The first round of talks between the Tajik Government and the opposition will take place in Moscow. The subsequent rounds are due to be held in Iran and Afghanistan in order to give due credit to the efforts of these countries, which have assisted national reconciliation in Tajikistan. In addition, their observers, like observers from Russia, Pakistan, and the United Nations, are due to attend the talks themselves. The leader of the Tajik opposition delegation will be Haji Akhbar Turajonzoda, former head of the Tajik Muslims. On behalf of the Russian leadership Adamishin guaranteed the delegation members' complete safety during their stay in Moscow. But opposition leaders are concerned for the safety of their families living in Tajikistan, especially bearing in mind that they themselves have been declared state criminals by the Dushanbe authorities. The interlocutors agreed that for the duration of the talks a moratorium must be imposed on hostilities both on the Tajik-Afghan border and inside Tajikistan. But the plans of the command of the CIS coalition peacekeeping forces in Tajikistan to hold military exercises in the near future on the territory of the unique "Tiger Gully" nature reserve and to carry out deterrent actions against the population of the Garm group of districts in the republic are being seen by the opposition as an attempt to wreck the talks. I contacted former spiritual leader Turajonzoda by telephone in Tehran and asked him a few questions. [Dubnov] We know about your statement that you do not aspire to political power in Tajikistan and that the new transitional coalition leadership must include professionals untainted by participation in the armed struggle of Tajiks among themselves. Can you see such people in the current Tajik leadership? [Turajonzoda] I have no doubt that there are now such decent people in the Tajik Government. This question was not discussed in the meetings with Mr. Adamishin. [Dubnov] Will you be able to guarantee control over opposition gunmen in order to observe the truce for the duration of the talks? [Turajonzoda] I can give an absolute guarantee. This is where we differ from the Dushanbe regime, which even now is incapable of coping with its own armed formations in Kurgan-Tyube Oblast. [Dubnov] How do you assess the role of Russian diplomats and military personnel in the Tajik-Tajik truce? [Turajonzoda] We are very grateful to the Russian Foreign Ministry for the meeting held in Tehran. We were ready for it even during the last eight months. Russia has finally recognized its own interests and its historical place in the region, and we fully recognize its geopolitical importance here. Friendly relations with democratic Russia, where human rights and ethnic minorities' rights are respected, are entirely in our interests. As regards the Russian military, we very much regret that some of them are not interested in a peaceful solution to the Tajik problem and are even trying to sow discord among opposition forces in Tajikistan. In doing so they are possibly pursuing their own aims. Mr. Adamishin also recognized in conversations with us that military personnel in Tajikistan often exceed their functions, and confirmed instances of their interference in the intra-Tajik conflict. [Dubnov] How soon can the Tajik-Tajik talks take place? [Turajonzoda] That must be determined by the UN secretary general's special representative; we are ready to begin them at any time.
