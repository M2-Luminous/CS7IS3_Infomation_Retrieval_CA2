He also received the Brazilian Ambassador to Portugal. The audience granted to Alioune Blondin Beye lasted about 40 minutes. Beye arrived in Luanda today from South Africa where he received assurances of the personal engagement of President Nelson Mandela in the peace process. [Begin recording] [Correspondent] I would like to know if the Angolan peace talks will be transferred from Lusaka to any South African city. [Beye] It is true that I was in Cape Town yesterday to meet with President Mandela. It was, therefore, normal for me to come to Luanda today to meet the president of the Republic. Our meeting obviously centered on the peace process. [Correspondent] We should not think that the peace talks will be transferred to South Africa, given the readiness expressed by President Mandela? [Beye] As you are aware, I have on several occasions visited heads of state of countries neighboring Angola. The visit to President Mandela, the president of a democratic South Africa, is therefore normal. He can certainly contribute toward the peace process. [Correspondent] What will happen after 30 June, that is, after the meeting of the UN Security Council? [Beye] At present it is difficult to give a reply, because, the UN Security Council is examining the situation in Angola and as an international official, I cannot speak about a decision that the UN Security Council has yet to take. I can say, however, that the international community is concerned with the Angolan problem and it will not remain indifferent. [Correspondent] Mr. Beye, the war is intensifying in Angola at a gigantic pace, while peace talks in Lusaka are moving at a chameleon's pace. Is it possible to speak of deadlines in the peace talks? [Beye] That is true, but there was a worse situation in August and September last year. Despite that, we began talks in Lusaka and we have made progress. Last week Dr. Savimbi told me that 90 percent of the work has been done. All the same, it is also true that in the past days or weeks, the military situation has deteriorated and this does not help the peace talks and the humanitarian action. [Correspondent] A last question, Mr. Beye. Only 10 percent of the work remains to establish peace in Angola. Can we then say that peace is a fait accompli, that the 10 percent will not make the war continue? [Beye] I am convinced that we can bring peace to Angola because the Angolan people want peace. The role of the press is to make the Angolan people believe in peace and in that way peace will be irreversible. I know that we are facing very difficult periods but I known that there will be light at the end of the tunnel. [end recording] Alioune Blondin Beye is also expected to meet with Angolan Foreign Minister Venancio de Moura. He leaves for Lusaka tomorrow.
