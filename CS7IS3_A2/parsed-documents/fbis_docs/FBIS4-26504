He pointed out: The establishment of special economic zones in China is an important step for promoting reform, opening up, and modernization. This move fully demonstrates Comrade Deng Xiaoping's and our party's enterprising spirit, farsightedness, revolutionary courage and resourcefulness, and political wisdom. I hope that people of the special economic zones, following the course set by Comrade Deng Xiaoping, based on the achievements and experiences they have gained, and through deepening reform in all fields, will revamp the economic structures, improve overall management, improve workers' training, improve the investment environment, improve economic efficiency, refine the democratic legal system, and promote spiritual civilization, to raise the overall economic and social development level to a new height. All in all, we should create new resources and raise our work to a new level. From 15 to 21 June, accompanied by Comrade Xie Fei, member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and secretary of the Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee, and Comrade Zhu Senlin, governor of Guangdong Province, Comrade Jiang Zemin inspected Guangzhou, Foshan, Zhongshan, Zhuhai, Shenzhen, and Meizhou. During the trip, Jiang Zemin, ignoring fatigue, inspected factories and rural areas to keep himself abreast of the current industrial and agricultural production situation and the building of grass-roots party organizations. He was very happy to see the progress in reform and development in all areas. He said: Under the leadership of the Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee and government, Guangdong's developmental trends have been very good, and developments in the special economic zones have also been very good. The progress is indeed encouraging. Wherever he went, Comrade Jiang Zemin cordially conversed with grass-roots cadres, technical workers, and the masses, discussing various issues with them and seeking their opinions. In Zhongshan City's Sanxiang Town and Meixian County's Fuda Town, he visited peasant households braving storms and muddy roads. He cordially engaged in small talk with peasants Zheng Xiangui, Zheng Dikun, and Liang Bo; visited their houses and farms; inquired about their incomes and lives; and hoped they would continue to work diligently to improve their livelihoods. General Secretary Jiang Zemin heard work reports by the Zhuhai City CPC Committee, the Shenzhen City CPC Committee, the Meizhou City CPC Committee, and the Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee. He fully affirmed the tremendous achievements and contributions Guangdong and the special economic zones have made over the last 15 years. He said: The establishment of the special economic zones was an important strategic decision made by the party Central Committee and the State Council according to Comrade Deng Xiaoping's proposal. With the exploratory and diligent work over the last 15 years, the special economic zones in Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and other localities have gained many valuable development experiences, making important contributions to the country's reform, opening up, and modernization drive. They have truly played an experimental role and served as the country's showcases and pacesetters. Practice proves that our decision to establish special economic zones is completely correct. The special economic zones' achievements and contributions are the result of the hard work and common efforts of the large numbers of constructors of the special economic zones; these achievements and contributions are also inseparable from the forceful support of other localities. Jiang Zemin said: Our reform, opening up, modernization efforts, and economic and social development across the country are a closely knit and unified whole. Cooperation should be stepped up between special economic zones and other localities, between the Zhujiang Delta and the Chang Jiang Delta and the Bohaiwan region, and between coastal areas and the central and western parts of the country. They should make use of their own resources, fulfill each other's needs, and help each other make progress, so they can develop in a better and more coordinated manner. They must not try to replace others, especially not to exclude each other. All localities, particularly special economic zones and the more economically developed coastal areas, should self-consciously make contributions to the development of a nationally unified socialist market economy. While discussing special economic zones' development experience, Jiang Zemin pointed out: The experience in building special economic zones all boils down to one point -- that is, we must unwaveringly insist on using Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line as our guidance, and should emancipate our minds and do things in light of reality. We should be bold and yet steady; we should integrate theory with practice; we should create on our own while making use of others' experience; we should strive to create and develop Chinese characteristics and a Chinese style for our special economic zones. While stressing that special economic zones should be further improved, Jiang Zemin said: The central authorities' resolve to develop special economic zones will not change; the central authorities' basic policy toward the special economic zones will not change; the special economic zones' status and role in the country's reform, opening up, and modernization drive will not change. We should interweave the development of special economic zones with the entire process of the socialist modernization drive. The view that special economic zones' status and role can be reduced or even gradually eliminated in the new situation in which a trend of all-front opening up to the outside world is being formed across the country is incorrect. Jiang Zemin believes that the development of special economic zones has entered a new stage in which we should strive to improve the overall quality and create additional advantages of special economic zones. Then, under the new circumstances, how can the additional advantages be created and new progress be made? He discussed five important points to this end. The first point is that special economic zones should continue to actively explore and gain more experience in accelerating the establishment of the socialist market economic structure across the country. Jiang Zemin said: In the special economic zones, we should accelerate the change of operational mechanisms of state-owned enterprises and establish a modern enterprise system. We should accelerate the cultivation and development of the market system, with emphasis on the development of the production-factors markets and intermediate organizations of various categories. We should accelerate the change of government functions and improve working efficiency. We should speed up the establishment of an income distribution system which takes the principle of "to each according to his work" as its mainstay, gives priority to efficiency while taking fairness into account; and we should improve the social security system. We should accelerate our participation in international economic cooperation and speed up the pace of necessary convergence with the international economy. While carrying out well these auxiliary reforms, we must formulate laws and regulations for governing the socialist market economy, and we must also handle well the relationship among reform, development, and stability and make the three coordinate with and promote one another. The second point is that the special economic zones should maintain a fast and healthy economic development through deepening the reform and opening wider to the outside world. In order for them to do so, Jiang Zemin emphasized the necessity to do work well in the following respects: First, great efforts should be made to readjust the economic structure and develop more high-tech industries; this is an urgent task for special economic zones at present. In principle, the special economic zones and open coastal cities should no longer develop labor-intensive industries with low-levels of technology, such as processing supplied materials, processing materials according to samples provided, assembling provided parts, and engaging in compensatory trade. Such industries should be gradually moved to the interior regions; such a move will help the special economic zones and coastal regions accelerate the upgrading of their industrial structure, and it is conducive to the economic development of the interior regions, to reducing the blind flow of labor forces out of the interior regions, and to gradually narrowing inter-regional development gaps. The special economic zones should continue making great efforts to develop an export- oriented economy, and the key to success in this regard is to raise levels of technology and improve the product quality. We should strive to produce and export products of advanced technology and high-added value. Second, great efforts should be made to improve management. We must improve management in order to develop the economy. The management system should be comprehensive, the management work should be strict, and management standards should be raised. We should raise management standards in all fields -- economic, legal, administrative, and social management fields alike. It is inconceivable to engage in the modernization drive in the absence of modern management. The special economic zones should take the lead in performing and enforcing modern management. Third, a further step should be taken to improve the investment environment of the special economic zones. It should include both the "hard" environment -- a good infrastructure -- and the "soft" environment -- good working efficiency, service, legislation, and systems. Fourth, we should attach importance to and step up overall planning for the special economic zones. Only when we have a scientifically oriented general plan can we reduce blindness and losses in construction. The third point is that the special economic zones should continue to introduce investment from abroad and establish lateral ties at home and make new contributions to promoting common development and common prosperity across the country. Jiang Zemin said: The special economic zones and the economically more developed coastal regions should persistently develop lateral ties with the interior regions, and they should make the most of their superior features, share out work, cooperate with one another, and take advantage of each other's strengths. This is extremely important for the development of a unified socialist market economy across the country, gradually narrowing the development gaps between the coastal regions and the interior regions, and achieving a common prosperity. I hope that the leading comrades in the special economic zones will constantly study how to strengthen economic and technological cooperation between the special economic zones and the interior regions and to support the development of poor interior regions; and this is something to the advantage of the economic development in the special economic zones and across the country, and it is well worth doing. The fourth point is that the special economic zones, particularly the Shenzhen and Zhuhai Special Economic Zones, should make more contributions to our country's resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao and to its maintenance of long-term prosperity there. Jiang Zemin said: The broad masses of the compatriots in Hong Kong and Macao are patriotic, actively supporting the reunification of the motherland and willing to contribute to the modernization of the motherland. The more the Shenzhen and Zhuhai special economic zones develop socialist market economy, socialist democracy, and socialist spiritual civilization, the more they will play an important role in helping maintain long-term prosperity in Hong Kong and Macao. The fifth point is that we should make great efforts to step up the building of socialist spiritual civilization in the special economic zones and improve the party's leadership over the work of the special economic zones. Jiang Zemin said: Comrade Deng Xiaoping particularly and unequivocally pointed out in his important talks made during his southern China inspection tour that a socialism with Chinese characteristics can be constructed only after both material and spiritual civilization are built well. We must have a profound understanding of this important idea of Comrade Deng Xiaoping, and conscientiously and persistently attach importance to both civilizations. We should see that the special economic zones and open coastal regions have achieved very rapid economic development and the situation of their material civilization has been gratifying in recent years. Relatively speaking, they still have many problems in the building of spiritual civilization, although they have made quite a few achievements in this regard. In particular, we must make great efforts to combat decadent behaviors and evils, such as disrupting public order, corrupting social values, and infringing upon the people's interests. We should take both stopgap measures and radical measures, and truly build both civilizations well. I hope that the special economic zones will not only march in the van in reform, opening up, and economic development, but also play a leading role in the building of spiritual civilization in China. Jiang Zemin also pointed out: We must know clearly that the additional advantages to be created for the special economic zones should include economic advantages, advantages in both material and spiritual civilization, ideological and political advantages, and the advantages of all-around social progress. For this reason, the special economic zones must make progress in building both civilizations. In appraising a leading cadre's job performance, we must assess not only his ability and achievements in building material civilization, but also his ability and achievements in building spiritual civilization. Under no circumstances should material civilization be developed at the expense of weakening or even sacrificing the building of spiritual civilization. Instead, the development of material civilization should help the development of spiritual civilization. We should satisfy the needs of the people's cultural life, while constantly providing a motive force and intellectual support for the development of material civilization. Jiang Zemin stressed: As China deepens reform and opening up, establishes a socialist market economic structure, and advances the modernization drive, special economic zones should also correspondingly develop their characteristics. Some original preferential policies and measures practiced in special economic zones will naturally undergo changes, and it is necessary to develop new characteristics for special economic zones through creating and fully displaying their new strengths. Special economic zones should be "special." Jiang Zemin encouraged special economic zones and the broad masses of cadres and people throughout Guangdong Province to lift their spirits and to continue their efforts to complete various tasks even better. General Secretary Jiang always has the production, lives, and well-being of the masses at heart. Because his inspection tour coincided with serious floods in some areas of Guangdong, he on many occasions inquired about the disaster situation, living arrangements for people in flood-affected areas, and the flood control and relief work and expressed his deep concern to people in those areas. The accident of the collapse of a textile factory building occurred during his inspection of Zhuhai, and he thus heard a briefing by the city party committee, ordered them to give treatment to the injured with all their strength, and he personally visited injured workers at the hospital. When he was informed that floods had also successively hit Guangxi, Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian, and Zhejiang, Comrade Jiang Zemin again gave important instructions. He asked principal leading cadres at all levels to swiftly go to the forefront of the disaster-stricken areas to organize and direct the people to carry out flood control and relief work. He demanded that flood-prone areas make preparations because preparedness averts peril. He also urged everybody to display the superiority of socialism and the fine tradition manifested that "whenever people in one part of the country are hard hit, their fellow countrymen in other parts of the country will come to their aid." He called for concerted efforts by the party, government, military, and the masses to strive for a victory in flood control and relief work. During his inspection of Guangzhou, Comrade Jiang Zemin also went to the Guangzhou Military Region and heard a briefing by Commander Li Xilin and Political Commissar Shi Yuxiao. He encouraged comrades in the military region to intensify their studying, to do their jobs well, and to comprehensively improve the troops' quality and fighting capacity. He asked the broad masses of officers and men to display the work style of fearing no danger and fatigue and of conducting continuous struggles in current flood-fighting and relief work so as to make the maximum contribution to ensuring the security of the lives and property of the people and to rapidly restoring production and construction in the flood-stricken areas. Those accompanying General Secretary Jiang Zemin in his inspection of Guangdong were Liao Hui, Zeng Peiyan, Hu Guangbao, Teng Wensheng, Yu Xiaosong, and other comrades in charge of relevant departments under the CPC Central Committee and the State Council.
