But the basic conclusion is that the Americans and others refuse to realize that the talks have reached a real impasse. They refuse to blame the side responsible for the impasse, that is, the Turkish side. Lamb's positions create the impression that the talks are advancing, that there has been agreement on many points, and that agreement is possible soon. If his positions do not indicate ignorance of today's reality, and they do not indicate such ignorance, then they represent an effort to dispel the impressions created not only by our positions, but also by the statements of the UN representatives. We voice our concern that we will return to the ups and downs of meaningless talks and that again the Turkish side will not bear the responsibilities of another impasse. This will make Rauf Denktas even bolder; he will filibuster every effort for progress in the Cyprus issue. We are faced with an impasse and the inability of the international community to blame the side that led to this situation. We understand that the government is awaiting the UN secretary general's report before taking any further steps. We just want to repeat that if we want to prevent particular situations and create developments instead of following them, we should act immediately. We should show our disappointment and disgust that Denktas--with the support of Ankara--fools everyone. We should also stress that we will not put up with this insulting mockery.
