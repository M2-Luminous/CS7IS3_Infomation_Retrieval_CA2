Ironically, businesses' alienation from banks stemmed from bank initiatives to issue capital stock, creating a boom in the issuance of secondary offerings. On the other hand, entirely different transactions from past Japanese-style futures trading systems is causing a collapse in the stock crossholding ownership system. At this juncture when we see a structural change in the Japanese economy, authorities must search for policies that are applicable to new financial systems. The economic situation enshrouding Japanese society is especially serious. It seems that the 1980's when Japan was referred to as an economic or financial superpower are now in the distant past. Even the automobile industry, which once considered itself the export elite of Japan, has begun to close plants and cut personnel; department stores and supermarkets continue to record sales declines from previous year figures, and restaurant rows with bright neon signs which normally prosper with festive yearend parties are filled with empty taxicabs waiting for the now rare rider. Japanese banks, which once monopolized the top rankings for banks worldwide, see no solution to their accumulations of nonperforming loans and mention is made of the risk of a crisis in the financial system. It is time for economic schools to perform on stage, but we must recognize the reality that there is no easy cure for the problem. Structural Changes The overall economy has changed completely from an inflationary to a deflationary one. Despite the fact that super low interest rates prevail, below even those in the latter half of the 1980's, the money supply fails to grow and stock prices cannot free themselves from the fear of a free fall because of the murkiness of the future economy. The approach of cashing in on unrealized paper profits to offset costs of amortizing nonperforming loans faces problems and the markets are enshrouded with a bottomless fear of future uncertainty in all business categories. The effects of the changing economy have begun to affect the general public in the form of layoffs, and if personal as well as corporate demand should cool, the problem of excess capital investments of the late 1980's will show up with greater intensity. When that happens, further production cuts will be made and, in the worst possible case, we can expect a spiraling shrinkage of material and monetary supplies. Already, in October 1993, the industrial production index had fallen to 88.0 and the shipping index to 89.5 from indices of 100 in 1990, the largest drop since the survey was started in 1978. Corporate revenue has declined drastically and, in the half year ending September 1993, recurring profits in the manufacturing sector declined 31.8 percent, recurring profits of the 11 automobile firms fell 90 percent, and revenue and profits declined industrywide to the degree that one out of five firms suffered losses, as reported by NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN on 1 December 1993. The notion that "prices always rise" and "the economy by its very nature expands" is in the process of undergoing instantaneous invalidation. Past episodes of this nature would have called for launching public works projects, but this time we cannot anticipate much in the way of relief from that source. Government finances are not adequate to provide for action in this sector and, although the Japanese Government compiled a huge supplemental budget of more than 30 trillion yen for the period 1992 to 1993, the desired effect was not obtained because of changes taking place in the economic system. Further, there is very little desire to borrow funds, despite the super low interest rates. This situation reflects the severity of the debts accumulated during the 1980's and has a restrictive effect on any remedy that can be envisioned in the way of financial policy. Essentially, the problem is that the economic system itself is changing. In other words, the system is undergoing a structural change as opposed to a cyclical change, and the situation requires an analysis in this respect. Accordingly, this should not be simply interpreted as a period in which we witness a "revival of Keynesian theory." Clearly, the "market worship" ideas of the "Chicago School" which asserted in the 1980's that Keynesian principles were relics of the past have lost their appeal, and the collapse of socialism was accompanied by the disappearance from center stage of Marxism which gave the impression of attracting the conscience of all people. One wonders about the potential effectiveness of any prescription written under a Keynesian scenario which consists of an amalgamation of market and programming principles just when both these principles are in the process of losing social credibility. The times are not so simple as to allow easy acceptance of a "revival of Keynesian theory." The reason is that a great structural change is taking place in the economy to the extent that Keynesian policy cannot create effective demand, and economic policy scenarios cannot be written without considering that fact. This article will not address the issue completely, but is designed to confirm the spread of the issue presented and to aid in identifying a solution for the issue. Change From Indirect Financing to Direct Financing At one time, the main source of capital for Japanese business was bank loans; it was not popular to seek funds via capital markets by issuing stocks and bonds. The latter method of capital procurement was limited to some of the firms listed on the stock exchanges, and high issuing costs associated with a unique underwriting system (limited to underwriting securities firms in the Euromarket) favored maintenance of a financial system centered on banks rather than capital markets. Underwriting institutions handling corporate bonds are limited to a segment of influential long-term credit banks, thus providing for the comparative prevalence of banks in the Japanese financial system. Such circumstances enhanced the societal confidence assigned to the banking industry. Between banks and securities firms, banks enjoy overwhelming confidence, while the custom of referring to securities firms in a somewhat deprecatory fashion as "brokerages" reflects the low social confidence placed in the stock market. Preference given to banks in this capital procurement structure has been extended to banks even in the management of funds by individuals in that they deposit funds in bank deposits or postal savings accounts despite low interest rates. Such a trend was influenced to a degree by the fact that other options were not necessarily diversified. Accordingly, a low-interest policy provided the mechanism whereby banks served as intermediaries in providing low-cost funds. Further, whenever there was a shortage of funds, postal savings were diverted to public works projects in a system referred to as the fiscal investment and loan program. In essence, banks and post offices served as intermediaries and played a central role under a structure which supplied low-interest capital to industry. In contrast to the foregoing situation, both the stock markets and bond markets were comparatively unpopular for investment of funds and were considered risky. As a former employee of a securities firm, I still have strong memories of an anecdote dating back to the 1970's when a branch manager of the securities firm returned from a trip to Europe to gleefully report that "In Europe securities firms are called banks." In those days, it was the "fervent desire" of securities firms in Japan to be elevated to the status of banks. This structure in which banks play a central role in issuing loans changed considerably during the 1980's. Those changes were inspired by external pressure. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) imposed the principle of maintaining a certain net worth and an awareness was established among currency authorities who supervise international financial markets that increasing net worth was indispensable in coping with instability in the financial system. In response, Japanese banks, which had extremely low levels of net worth, zealously pursued the issuance of capital instruments. Due to financial liberalization, Eurobond issues overseas were gradually liberalized, and a wide spectrum of firms issued bonds in the Eurobond markets. The reason why Japanese firms zealously engaged in the procurement of capital in the form of convertible and warrant bonds in the Euromarkets was the unusually low costs. And, both the percentage of Japanese business firms' capital procured in Eurobond markets and the percentage of Japanese corporate issues on the overall Eurobond market were huge, while many Japanese firms from the manufacturing and service sectors established financial subsidiaries in Europe and created a boom in capital investment and procurement. Essentially, Japanese domestic bank loans recorded a relative decline and securities markets played a central role in raising capital for the first time. If it were a case that the initiative of banks in raising capital by issuing stock inspired corporate alienation from banks, i.e., active raising of capital via the securities markets, we must label the development as being ironic. This is because we can say that the extensive involvement of banks themselves in the stock markets brought about a decline in the social function of banks. Unprecedented Alchemy The foregoing events have led to a substantial change in the financial structure of Japanese corporations and a conspicuous rise in their net worth. A review of changes over a 10-year period shows that net worth of Japanese corporations which stood at 20.93 percent in 1980 grew to 29.57 percent in 1985 and 36.4 percent in 1990. In contrast, U.S. corporate net worth over the same period dropped from 49.63 percent to 45.0 percent to 40.16 percent. The sharp rise in net worth of Japanese corporations and the contrasting sharp drop in U.S. corporate net worth are impressive. On the other hand, a look at the nature of debt shows a decline in current liabilities, i.e., a major decline in short-term borrowing. Short-term borrowing as a percentage of total assets (capital plus debt) during the above-mentioned 10-year period stood at 17.6 percent, 16.3 percent, and 9.9 percent. On the other hand, U.S. corporate short-term borrowing as a percentage of total assets during the same 10-year period stood at a very low 3.8 percent, 3.7 percent, and 4.3 percent and showed little change. Rather, U.S. corporate debt structures reflect an increase in the ratio of fixed debt in excess of one year known as long-term debt. Such long-term debt as a ratio of total assets during the same 10-year period stood at 23.6 percent, 28.1 percent, and 34.1 percent (the data cover the manufacturing sector and were extracted from the Bank of Japan "International Statistical Comparisons"). The data give us the opportunity to examine differences in financial structures of the 1980's whereby Japanese corporations tended to raise capital by issuing stock, while U.S. corporations tended to issue bonds for the same purpose. A similar drop in corporate bank loan ratios has taken place in both Japan and the United States, but the fact that bank loan ratios in Japan are still about twice as high as in the United States demonstrates that corporate dependence on banks is greater in Japan than in the United States. Stock markets expanded at an accelerated pace in the 1980's. Effects of the low-interest policies implemented under a coordinated international policy resulted in the flow of capital into stock markets. Capital procured with extremely low interest rates flowed into stock markets and the alchemy of a flow of funds from right to left functioned efficiently; even when Black Monday his the New York Stock Exchange in 1987, the Japanese markets were enshrouded with the bullish mood that the "Tokyo Stock Market" was insulated. Stocks continued to rise regardless of volume issued, giving birth to the "myth of stock prices." However, we must not forget that the "myth of stock prices" was the product of a desperate effort to engineer a stable stock ownership system. If stocks are held on a long-term basis through cross-shareholding and the stock in question is not traded in the markets, there would be no reason to sell the stocks. As long as underlying selling pressure (expansion of supply) did not manifest itself, equity financing functioned as an unprecedented form of alchemy. Collapse of the Cross-Shareholding System However, such circumstances guarantee reciprocal benefits if stocks continue to rise in value, but the story changes if they decline. I would like to verify the role of banks when that occurs. Banks not only issued loans to corporations, but also intervened in a wide range of corporate accounting settlements; in the international arena, banks offered foreign exchange services and foreign intelligence as well as serving on corporate management staffs as they dispatched officers to provide industrial corporations assistance in the form of human resources. However, because banks were most aggressive in the issuance of capital stock as a special characteristic of the 1980's, a sharp increase took place in the share of bank stocks issued. When stock prices peaked in December 1989, financial and insurance stocks held a 29.7-percent share of the total market value of all stock issued. However, transactions in financial and insurance stocks did not exceed 5.4 percent of total shares and 7.2 percent of total value traded. Bank stocks enjoyed the structural status of being issued but rarely traded. The reason for this was the attitude that nonfinancial corporations should refrain from selling stock of main banks on which the former were dependent for loans. However, the foregoing attitude should not be interpreted as a situation in which holders were unilaterally forced to retain their bank stocks. Corporate cross-shareholding was created among companies in the same corporate group with the idea that when one firm decides to issue new stock, it can depend on other corporations in the same group to purchase the newly issued stock, to maintain continuous business relationships, maintain stable stock prices through the creation of stable shareholders, and thus create stability in the management of corporations. However, systems of the foregoing nature are changing as stock prices fall. A look at data as of April 1992 when bank stocks were declining shows that financial and insurance stocks, which represented 25.7 percent of total stock value, had represented 7.2 percent of total shares traded and 11 percent of total value traded (data from the "Monthly Statistical Report of the Tokyo Stock Exchange"). Although the data indicate that financial stocks represent a large share of the total stock value and that trade in such stocks represents only a small share of the total volume traded, the share of both stocks traded and value traded have risen despite a drop in the current market value. This reflects a rise in the frequency with which bank stocks are being sold. Most likely, the fact that bank stocks played a significant role in the overall market drop at the end of 1993 can probably be interpreted as a further acceleration in the selling trend. The fact that bank stocks--which play a central role in Japanese-style corporate groupings--lead in sales when overall stock prices are declining reflects concern for the nonperforming bond problem as well as concern for bank operations, but also probably reflects a structural collapse of the cross-shareholding stock ownership system which is the very heart of Japanese-style systems to the degree that even bank stocks are subject to disposal. According to the 15 October 1993 edition of NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN, "Cross-sharehold of stock established by corporations during the bubble period with the objective of supporting stock prices is estimated to total 20-30 trillion yen and there is a widely held view that this segment of cross-shareholding is subject to early disposition." It can be assumed that because of hesitancy on the part of banks to issue loans and the difficulty to issue new stock, corporations are selling stock holdings to build up cash on hand and to raise new capital. Futures Trading as Different Factor in the Market What factors caused a manifestation of underlying expansion in supply, i.e., selling pressure in the markets, through excessive issuance of stock under equity financing? Basically, conceivable is the fact that the excessive issuance of stock in the form of huge, excessive financings in the latter half of the 1980's created huge selling pressure. However, as long as cross-shareholding relationships were maintained and stable stock ownership operations functioned smoothly, selling pressure did not manifest in the markets. Stock withheld from the markets despite continued new issuances caused stocks which should have fallen to continue rising and equity financing functioned in the form of clever "alchemy." However, at this point, I would like to draw attention to the fact that the arrival of different trading in the form of futures trading caused a change in the market structure. In the United States, long- and medium-term government bonds and currency are the primary objects of futures trading, but in Japan stock index futures became the major segment of the futures market. The main issue presented here is the difference between futures trading and Japanese systems. In a world of cross-shareholding, a rise in stock prices is beneficial to all corporations and a decline in stock prices has a negative impact. In general, mainstream textbooks in Japan explain (by using advance mathematical formulas) that futures trading can be effective in reducing risks. However, in the United States where futures trading represents a huge market and as an investment tool encompasses financial instruments such as currency and bonds and a diversity of commodities such as rice and petroleum, it may be an effective tool for avoiding risk, but in the case of Japan where it was first introduced in the latter half of the 1980's and the markets are immature, it is probably very important to understand how incompatible the basic mechanism of futures trading and Japanese systems are. Moreover, as rice futures begin to trade on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, as people anticipate a rise in future rice prices, and futures prices continue to rise, we cannot disregard the relationship with the price of rice in Japan. Further, in Japan forward trading is called futures trading and currency futures tend to be envisioned, but the history of futures is short. The foremost characteristic of futures trading involves the sale of the item purchased by the final settlement date and to earn the difference in price fluctuations, while that future which has been sold is repurchased by the final settlement date and to earn the difference in price fluctuations. In the case of forward markets, it involves a contract to trade a specific item at a specified future date and does not involve a settlement of price differentials. However, futures trading involves the execution of an opposing transaction by a specific date and a settlement involving price fluctuations. Accordingly, even if the price should fall, if the contract anticipated such an event, the trader realizes a profit, but if the price rises contrary to anticipation, the trader must settle and suffer a loss. In other words, the system provides for a profit whether prices rise or fall and the trader profits if he anticipates correctly and loses if he anticipates incorrectly. A mechanism benefiting all parties to a syndicate as long as stock prices rose served as the basic principle for Japanese-style cross-shareholding of stocks. However, it should be obvious that the nature of futures trading is completely incompatible with that principle. If one realizes that price rises do not necessarily represent a positive, we must admit that a major change must be made in Japanese-style systems which were premised on latent profits. However, this writer is not saying that futures trading was responsible for the drop in stock prices. Drops in stock prices were the logical outcome of the introduction of financial deregulation. Even if we were to attempt an energetic control over futures trading, in today's environment where internationalization of financial markets has progressed, trades will be relocated to foreign markets and it is doubtful that price stability can be attained, while any attempt at enforcing controls would most likely result in financial friction. Futures can be referred to as a source of profits based on the instability of spot prices. The reason why rice futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange are soaring is that magnified expectations are being placed on futures trading based on the theory that spot prices will continue to rise. That being the case, we cannot hold futures responsible for price fluctuations. New Financial Systems and Policy Huge Japanese international balance of payments surpluses flowed into overseas areas in the form of real estate and securities investments. As a result, Japan emerged as the world's leading creditor nation. However, even such investments have lost tremendous value because of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate changes. Additionally, overseas real estate investments have suffered price drops or vacancy rates have risen because of worsening market conditions and underlying debt instruments have converted into typical nonperforming debt. Now if we turn our eyes to the domestic scene, we note that we are unable to stimulate a recovery in lagging manufacturing activity even if we lower interest rates and increase public works projects and contrarily it seems that the situation may deteriorate into a state of employment instability. Further, money which lacks a productive investment target rotates between postal savings and short-term securities and there are no signs that money can be used to stimulate production and assist in the recovery of the economy. A variety of proposals such as an income tax cut, infrastructure investments in the area of consumer requirements, and additional cuts in the official discount rate are being made, but it is uncertain whether such measures will have a decisive effect. In the past, in times such as these when it appeared that all avenues of relief were blocked, capital investments in anticipation of export demand came into play but such an approach is no longer effective as long as trade friction with the United States is in the throes of intensifying. It is difficult to judge whether domestic market expansion measures will serve to reinvigorate the economy because there is the possibility that deregulation will destroy weak domestic industries, but perhaps stimulation for the economy can be obtained by directing efforts towards trade with Asia to include China in anticipation of significant growth in those areas. However, if economic policies of the past have been rendered ineffective because of significant changes in the Japanese economic structure as discussed in this article, we must search for policies which are responsive to the new structure. If we were to address the issue in terms of the discussion contained in this article, we may find it effective to maintain interest rates at a low level to ensure a smooth flow of funds via the banks, but if corporate funds procurement from banks decrease, such measures will prove inadequate. I believe it is a case where we must formulate policies which envision a transition of financial systems from reliance on banks to the capital markets as a whole including the stock, bond and futures markets.
