Summary EPA is proposing to list wastewater treatment sludge from the production of azo dyes, excluding FD&C colorants, as a hazardous waste. This wastestream meets the criteria set out at 40 CFR 261.11(a)(3) for listing a waste as hazardous and is capable of posing a substantial present or potential risk to human health or the environment. Based on ingestion of contaminated ground water, EPA calculated high-end individual cancer risk levels for five constituents which exceed 1E&hyph;4 for carcinogens and have HQs of 1 or greater for non-carcinogens for the plausible management practice, an on-site monofill. Four additional contaminants further support the listing by posing individual risks between 1E&hyph;4 and 1E&hyph;6. Risks between 1E&hyph;4 and 1E&hyph;6 also were identified for six contaminants from exposure to these constituents through other exposure pathways. Discussion The majority of wastewater treatment sludge from the production of azo dyes is biological treatment sludge. The information on volume and the percentage of this waste volume disposed of at Subtitle D municipal landfills, as reported in the 1992 RCRA Section 3007 Questionnaire, is not included at the present time due to business confidentiality concerns.
