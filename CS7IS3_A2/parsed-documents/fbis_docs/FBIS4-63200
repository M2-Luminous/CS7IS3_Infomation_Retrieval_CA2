It cannot fail to give rise to concern in Moscow," a senior member of Russia's Foreign Ministry in charge of Russian-Ukrainian relations told INTERFAX on Friday. According to him, "now the danger of displaying extremism by both Kiev and Simferopol, with all the ensuing consequences, is greater than ever before." "We do not back the Crimean radicals, of course. Nevertheless Ukraine, which is, speaking figuratively, in another weight division, should behave as it befits a big power," the diplomat said. So far the Crimean people have acted in the framework of democratic procedures, without violating Ukrainian legislation, he noted. "As regards Kiev, it is not quite clear how it interprets democracy and contemporary international law. To despatch troops is not a good way out of the situation," said INTERFAX's interviewee. According to him, "if events in the Crimea develop in the same vein, this might grow into a long-term conflict." "The experience of the former Yugoslavia shows that playing with fire ends in a big blaze," he said. Ukraine "can hardly find anything wrong in Russia's behavior," the diplomat pointed out. "It's characteristic that neither Russia's president and government nor parliament have made any official statements or taken sharp steps so far," he said. Nevertheless, Kiev "has not abandoned its attempts to find a foe from without," said INTERFAX's interviewee. On Wednesday the press service of Ukraine's president released a statement to the effect that "dangerous processes in the Crimea are stimulated by some Russian politicians, whose actions acquired the signs of open interference in Ukraine's internal affairs of late." "We do not even want to comment on such statements; Let them remain on Ukraine's conscience," the Russian diplomat said.
