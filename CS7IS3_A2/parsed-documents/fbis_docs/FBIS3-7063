Your majesties, your royal highnesses, your excellencies Prime Minister and Mrs. Hosokawa, distinguished guests, I am grateful for the warm hospitality that has been extended to my wife, myself and my delegation and also for this splendid dinner. Your majesty has just made some very kind and friendly comments about the Korean people. I am certain that your remarks will serve as an invaluable catalyst for developing our bilateral relationship. I am visiting your country in the belief that our two countries must endeavor to build truly neighborly ties of cooperation looking ahead into the future. As close neighbors, our two countries have interacted with each other in the cultural and other fields for many centuries. We must continue to be such close and good neighbors for millennia to come. At the turn of the century, it is true, Korean-Japanese relations were put to a severe test by the thunderstorms and turbulent currents of history. But we must not let our past fetter our progress into the future any longer. My conviction is that a new era of strong neighborly ties will surely arrive once we squarely face the past just as it was and have earnestly learned its lessons. Only if our two peoples continue to expand exchanges in all fields will a new good-neighborly relationship surely begin to develop. Our two countries should benefit from the shared advantages of a long history of interaction as well as geographical proximity. Your majesty, The fast-approaching century will almost certainly be an Asia-Pacific century. I believe that both our nations face a mandate of history to work together as partners to usher in this new era. This mandate must be fulfilled without fail. The firm resolve of both our peoples bolstered by their shared past experiences will greatly help power the march of mankind toward a new Asia, a new Pacific and a new world. Your majesty, Our two countries are jointly pursuing the universal ideals of freedom, democracy and market economics. Both our countries are striving for sweeping reforms and greater openness. With a shared sense of mission, both the Republic of Korea and Japan are now more determined and enthusiastic than ever about building a diverse bilateral relationship on the strength of a broad pubic consensus in both lands. We must establish a rock-solid bilateral relationship before the present century is out. By building an ROK-Japan partnership in answer to the call of the times, we should together lead the long march into the 21st century of peace and prosperity. Let us pool our wisdom and strength so that we will be able to proudly pass on to posterity the heirloom of a good neighborly relationship marked by a spirit of mutual help and interdependence. Distinguished guests, Please join me in toasting the good health and longevity of their majesties, the boundless prosperity of the Japanese people and the evolution of neighborly ties of cooperation between the Republic of Korea and Japan. Thank you.
