The item, published under the heading "Opinion Concerning the Attack," comprises four pie charts and four graphs that show the results of the survey, which questioned an unidentified number of Monterrey and Mexico City citizens on issues ranging from the possibility of rescheduling the presidential elections to who should replace Colosio on the PRI presidential ticket. Most citizens polled in Monterrey and Mexico City believe that the date for the scheduled 21 August elections should not be changed and that there likely is a covert mastermind behind the crime. Of the citizens polled in Mexico City, 54 percent responded by saying the date of the elections should not be changed, while 51 percent of Monterrey citizens opposed changing the date of the elections. Of those polled in Mexico City, some 15 percent believe opposition parties are behind Colosio's killing, followed by fellow PRI members (11 percent); Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas (9 percent); the government (9 percent); Party of the Democratic Revolution candidate Cuahutemoc Cardenas (3 percent); the Zapatist National Liberation Army (1 percent); drug traffickers (1 percent); and foreigners (1 percent). Also, 39 percent of those polled in both Mexico City and Monterrey said they believe the motive behind the killing was political. Meanwhile, 20 percent of those polled in Mexico City said the killing will bring about more violence and will destabilize the country. Regarding people's preferences to replace Colosio, 36 percent of those polled in Mexico City said they favor Manuel Camacho Solis, who was followed by Pedro Aspe Armella (4 percent), Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon (6 percent), Fernando Ortiz Arana (5 percent), Jaime Serra Puche (2 percent), Jorge Carpizo (6 percent), and Fernando Gutierrez Barrios (2 percent).
