Two days before the elections, Luigi Abete, Bruno Trentin, Sergio D'Antoni, and Pietro Larizza [respectively, General Confederation of Italian Industry, Confindustria, chairman; Italian General Confederation of Labor, CGIL, secretary; Italian Confederation of Trade Unions secretary; and Italian Federation of Trade Unions, UIL, secretary] chose the foreign press center to celebrate a very special event -- the collapse of the symbolic iron curtain that has always, despite any agreements, separated the public statements of Confindustria and the trade unions. Now their joint news conference and joint statement, read out by a trade unionist on behalf of both sides, suddenly made the conflicts and controversies of years of stormy relations seem part of the distant past. "We are here together to issue a message of calm and stability to the country," said the Confindustria chairman. "We are here as independent organizations that have sometimes been in conflict; nobody intends to relinquish his own role. But at this time of delicate transition from the First to the Second Republic, we feel a shared responsibility for guarding the 23 July 1993 agreement, which represented not a mere episode but a radical change of course in the entire system of industrial relations," the CGIL secretary explained. To [President] Scalfaro, who received them jointly yesterday morning, the industrialists and trade unions' representatives addressed the following request and promise: first, that the president act as guarantor of the continuity of the "heritage of rules, methods, and objectives" embodied in last July's protocol; second, an offer of a guarantee by both sides -- industry and labor -- to keep their conduct "consistent" with the agreement signed almost a year ago. An agreement, as they pointed out, that has hitherto ensured "strong social stability." From both the president and from [Prime Minister] Ciampi, whom they visited the previous day, the Confindustria and trade union representatives received "not formal reassurances, but committed replies," as Trentin explained, "from people who, like us, believe that we must protect one of the most important experiments that Republican democracy has managed to produce." Was this unusual move dictated by the fear of a leap into the unknown represented by the elections? This suspicion was also voiced by foreign reporters, who were as amazed as everyone else by the spectacle of so much concord and who are accustomed to the seeking after recondite causes typical of Italian politics. "Do not lower the tone of this initiative by asking the usual question about `what lies behind it,'" Abete began. "What I mean is that next Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday [29-31 March, following elections] will be normal, calm days," the Confindustria chairman said, as though to suggest that nobody believes that the barbarians are at the gates. "If we were gripped by fear, we would not be here together," Trentin said; "instead we would be waging a war of communiques. The fear, if any, is that since the future will not be easy -- because the next government will face some very tough decisions -- the fabric that we began to weave last summer will become unraveled." To state forcefully, as Luigi Abete did, that "agreements must be honored" and, as Trentin, D'Antoni, and Larizza did, that "the rules established by the July protocol cannot be changed without a consensus," does not mean using some kind of "blackmail" against the future government. "This is no kind of pressure on the next government," the UIL leader said, "but a confirmation of an option that remains valid, irrespective of the outcome of the elections." The message grew clearer when it became apparent that it was also addressed to the international markets: "We want to communicate that we are very confident of our capabilities and our strength," Confindustria Deputy Chairman Carlo Callieri summed up. "We want to tell the country and the international public that they can depend on Italy and that Italy can depend on itself." There was such an attitude of deference that nobody wanted to claim credit for being the first to propose the establishment of a common front. It is no sudden move, but the result of a long shared task, a policy of consultations ratified by the August 1992 agreement. The idea was born one evening a month and 10 days ago, "when the five of us met," Callieri revealed. And it was precisely in order to ensure that the joint move was not misinterpreted, Abete explained, that Confindustria and the trade unions agreed in rejecting the possibility of deferring their joint statement until after the election. The next government, whichever it may be, was asked not to jeopardize the policy of reform started by the Ciampi government, partly thanks to the July protocol. "The fall in inflation, the lowering of interest rates, and the interest shown by foreign markets," the joint document states, "have enabled enterprises to exploit the regained competitiveness of the exchange rates to make a considerable recovery in exports, in terms of volume, shares, and margins, with a significant change of direction in the balance of trade. Unfortunately, however, the actions to facilitate a recovery of employment have proved less effective." But Confindustria and the trade unions are demanding a number of most urgent measures from the present government: additional regulations covering public contracts, a report on unemployment, an inquiry into labor costs, and an assessment of the three-year research plan.
