Diplomatic measures supporting the government's initiative in North Korean affairs are becoming concrete. As soon as the telephone message proposing the preliminary contact was sent to North Korea on 20 June, the Foreign Ministry immediately gave formal notice of the fact to its allies, including the United States and Japan, permanent members of the UN Security Council, including China and Russia, and international organizations including the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. The government made it clear to the international community that it is moving toward dialogue while keeping the stick of sanctions in hand. The government is pursuing the North-South summit talks while rechecking the alliance between the ROK and the United States under the assessment that the dialogue phase might be the last chance to peacefully resolve the North Korean nuclear issue. This reflects the government's position that the United States and the international community's demands, including special inspections, are necessary elements for achieving the fundamental goal of the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. The government is reportedly evaluating the variables of the situation presented by the North-South summit talks and the third round of North Korea-U.S. talks while straightening up the confusion related to Former U.S. President Carter's visit to the North and rechecking the alliance to cope with the new situation. Based on various scenarios, the two governments are reportedly adjusting their positions regarding the verification of agenda in case the North-South summit talks are realized, the plan for achieving the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, and the principles of the North Korea-U.S. talks. The government also welcomed Japan's reaffirmation of the three-party alliance between the ROK, the United States, and Japan at a time when the North-South summit talks are being pursued, and reportedly asked for Japan's diplomatic support to realize the summit talks. The government is checking Japan's intention through diplomatic channels regarding Japanese Foreign Minister Kakizawa Koji's remarks at the House of Councillors' Foreign Affairs Committee on 20 June that the elimination of nuclear suspicions will not be a precondition to the resumption of negotiations on establishing diplomatic relations with North Korea. As negotiations on establishing diplomatic relations between North Korea and Japan could actually be resumed around the time of the North-South summit talks, the government is also finalizing its position regarding this possibility. As the general situation is inclined toward the possibile resumption of dialogue with North Korea, the Foreign Ministry has readjusted the principle of three-channel dialogue -- dialogue between the North and the South, North Korea and the United States, and North Korea and the IAEA -- and established a policy to utilize the three channels to complement each other. The government's position in the case of dialogue between North Korea and the IAEA, is that, with North Korea's withdrawal from the IAEA, it is better to induce practical dialogue rather than to agitate North Korea by demanding its return to the IAEA. According to a relevant government official's explanation, the government's readjustment of the basic frame of channels of communication is designed to efficiently respond to Russia's intention to exercise influence on the North Korean nuclear issue with its proposal of an eight-party conference, while taking advantage of the development in the North-South summit talks. With the resumption of the North Korea-U.S. talks, the government decided not to oppose the third round of high-level North Korea-U.S. talks if North Korea's sincerity is verified and to keep watching the result of working-level contacts between North Korea and the United States in New York. The government is positively appraising the remarks by U.S. President Clinton on 21 June that North Korea's proposal made through Former President Carter is a hopeful sign and that verifications will be made through contacts between North Korea and the United States. The government expects that the ROK and the United States may disagree on assuring the transparency of not only the present and future but also past nuclear activities of North Korea. The government reportedly conveyed a strong message regarding its position to the United States.
