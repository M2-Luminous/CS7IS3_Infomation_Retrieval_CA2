FBIS4-27591 "dreas106_d_94028" FBIS-EAS-94-106 Daily Report 2 Jun 1994 South Korea U.S. Firm Using Unauthorized Telephone Service U.S. Firm Using Unauthorized Telephone Service SK0206035294 Seoul THE KOREA TIMES in English 2 Jun 94 p 3 SK0206035294 Seoul THE KOREA TIMES English BFN [Text] Viatel and USA Link, American international call service retailers, are engaging in unauthorized international phone services in Korea, the Communications Ministry said yesterday. The ministry found the Viatel's service here was illegal in 1992 when the American firm introduced the service. The domestic law governing telecommunications service stipulates that the international call services shall be offered only by the public telecommunications service providers such as Korea Telecom and Dacom Corporation. However, the U.S. firms resorted to clandestine services to bypass the outright violation, employing automatic collect call and call back systems, ministry spokesman Yi Chong-son said. Such clandestine services are provided by Trans Pacific Service and Link Korea, the local agents of the U.S. companies. The call retailers have subscribers place a call to the switching system, based in the United States, to get a return call from the destinations in the U.S., using the call back system. When using the international toll free service method, subscribers dial a secret code and the destination number. They collect the fees by billing them on credit cards. While taking advantage of U.S. rates which are lower than the domestic charge by 30 to 40 percent, the signals are identified as originating in the U.S., making it impossible to slap a surcharge on the services. However, the service itself still illegal in that it uses domestic circuits without paying a fee, Yim Song-man, a director of international phone service of Korea Telecom, pointed out. The connections by call back system even interfere with the ordinary Telecom services by crowding the lines, he claimed. The subscribers are presumed to be business firms and U.S. servicemen who make frequent international calls, the official said. "On the other hand, there is no way to dissuade customers from using the services, as the subscribers can not be identified," he said. "Even when they are identified, it is hard to secure evidence of the illegal service." Though the market share of the firms remains at a meager level for now, they will further expand their service activities if left unchecked, he said. Meanwhile, Viatel and USA Link reportedly claimed that their business cannot be subject to domestic law, because the switching actually takes place in the United States. The ministry has delivered its complaints against the "illegal" business, but the response from the U.S. side was the Korea should lift the ban on the international call services by U.S. firms, instead, the ministry spokesman said. "Because of concerns over possible retaliation by trade sanctions, the ministry could not take any action against their business," he confided. So the ministry remains helpless in the situation with its hands tied, he added. Spain and Japan have also undergone problems with such infiltrations by U.S. firms into the phone service market, he said. To counter the low rates of the U.S. services, the ministry will study, with Korea Telecom and Dacom, lowering the domestic rates, he said.
