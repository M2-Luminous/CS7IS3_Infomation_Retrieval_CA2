(iii) Place a copy of this AD in the Pilot's Operating Handbook (POH) and FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual (AFM). (2) For Models H35, J35, K35, M35, N35, P35, S35, V35, V35A, and V35B: (i) Fabricate a placard (utilizing letters of at least .10-inch minimum height) with the words ``Never exceed speed, Vne, 197 MPH (171 knots) IAS; Maximum structural cruising speed, Vno, 177 MPH (154 knots) IAS; Maneuvering speed, VA, 132 MPH (115 knots) IAS.'' Install this placard on the airplane instrument panel next to the airspeed indicator within the pilot's clear view. (ii) Mark the outside surface of the airspeed indicator with lines of approximately 1/16-inch by 3/16-inch as follows: (A) Red line at 197 MPH (171 knots); (B) Yellow line at 177 MPH (154 knots); and (C) A white slippage mark between the airspeed indicator glass and case to visually verify glass has not rotated. (iii) Place a copy of this AD in the Pilot's Operating Handbook (POH) and FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual (AFM). (3) For all applicable model airplanes, fabricate a placard (utilizing letters of at least .10-inch minimum height) with the words ``Normal Category Operation Only'' and install this placard on the instrument panel within the pilot's clear view over the existing ``Utility Category'' placard. (e) For Models C35, D35, E35, F35, G35, H35, J35, K35, M35, N35, S35, V35, V35A, and V35B airplanes, accomplish the following: (1) Visually inspect the empennage, aft fuselage, and ruddervator control system for damage in accordance with the instructions to Beech Kit 35&hyph;4017&hyph;1 ``Kit Information Empennage & Aft Fuselage Inspection'', as specified in Beech SB No. 2188, dated May 1987. Prior to further flight, accomplish the following in accordance with these instructions: (i) Replace or repair any damaged parts; and (ii) Set the elevator controls, rudder and tab system controls, cable tensions, and rigging. (2) Remove all external stabilizer reinforcements installed during incorporation of either Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) SA845GL, STC SA846GL, STC SA1650CE, STC SA2286NM, or STC SA2287NM. Seal or fill any residual holes with appropriate size rivets. (i) The internal stub spar incorporated through SA1649CE and SA1650CE may be retained. (ii) The external angles incorporated through STC SA1649CE may also be retained by properly trimming the leading edge section to permit installing the stabilizer reinforcement referenced in paragraph (g)(3) of this AD. (3) Install stabilizer reinforcements in accordance with the instructions to either Beech Kit No. 35&hyph;4016&hyph;3, 35&hyph;4016&hyph;5, 35&hyph;4016&hyph;7, or 35&hyph;4016&hyph;9, as applicable and specified in Beech SB No. 2188, dated May 1987.

(f) Ensure correct accuracy of the airplane basic empty weight and balance information by accomplishing either (1) or (2) below. Prior to further flight, correct any discrepancies in accordance with the applicable maintenance manual. (1) Weight and Balance Information Accuracy Method No. 1: (i) Review existing weight and balance documentation to assure completeness and accuracy of the documentation from the most recent FAA-approved weighing or from factory delivery to date of compliance with this AD. (ii) Compare the actual configuration of the airplane to the configuration described in the weight and balance documentation; and
