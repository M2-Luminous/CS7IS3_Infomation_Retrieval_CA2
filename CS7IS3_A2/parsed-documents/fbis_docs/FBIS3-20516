The President said one major purpose of his Southeast Asian trip was to promote economic cooperation. To illustrate the need, he said, Taiwan's future economic development must rely on continuous investment abroad to create more sales opportunities and to secure the supply of essential raw materials. He described his visits to the three countries and his discussions with the leaders of the governments involved as fruitful, especially in the strengthening of economic cooperation. When asked what about the diplomatic implications of his trip, Li replied he did not expect to see any immediate gains in this respect. He said much more must be done and it takes time for the achievement of concrete results. In fact, Li's meetings with President Suharto of Indonesia, President Fidel Ramos of the Philippines and King Phumiphon Adunyadet of Thailand in themselves represented a major achievement of his pragmatic diplomacy. None of the three countries have formal ties with Taiwan. Asked about his chances of being invited to the 1994 summit meeting of APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) leaders, Li said he did not bring forward the matter in his meeting with Suharto, who will play host to the event this year. Li said he was not sure that he would be invited. But the President indicated he will not insist on participating, should that arouse protest from Beijing and consequently affect the convention of the summit. The Republic of China [ROC] after all wants to be a nation having the respect of all, he added. He was also asked to comment on the repeated protests Mainland China lodged with the three countries, warning their governments not to receive him. Li said those interventions were unreasonable and surely were not mature policies. The President noted that, despite Beijing's continued protests, the three nations still went ahead to discuss bilateral relations with the ROC and made clear to him that they want to be friends with this nation. Li did not believe that his Southeast Asian tour will have adverse effects on Taiwan's relations with the mainland. He said he did not hold any political attempts in embarking on his Southeast Asian tour, explaining that he had no idea of trying to use the trip to promote a two-China policy. Li continued that, since Taiwan and the mainland have remained divided because of political differences, this island must decide, as in the past, its own course of development. And he believes that in dealing with an intransigent Beijing, the best way, is to step up Taiwan's own strength, and use it [to] win the mainland's recognition. He is certainly right.
