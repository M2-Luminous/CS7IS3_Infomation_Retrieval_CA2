Diego Fernandez, spokesman for a delegation of Mexican businessmen visiting Havana, said 75 percent of the textile enterprise will be Mexican-owned. The 40 firms represented in the Mexican delegation will be able to sell perfumes, cosmetics, construction materials, canned juices, cookies, chocolates, fertilizers, insecticides, and chemical and pharmaceutical products in Cuba. Cuban firms will sell resins and marble for construction in the Mexican market. Mexico's annual sales to Cuba, especially products for the service sector, amount to approximately $124 million. Mexico imports about $7 million worth of nickel and tobacco from Cuba annually. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 0509 GMT 21 Apr 94) Radio Rebelde at 1155 GMT on 23 April reports that 915 Basic Cooperative Production Units (UBPC), with almost 90,000 members, have been formed nationwide in the agriculture-livestock sector. Salvador Valdez, secretary general of that sector's union, says that it is anticipated that there will eventually be 2,300 of these structures in that sector. In the same newscast, Rebelde announces that the work group of the Australia Sugar Mill in Jaguey Grande has been awarded the Labor Feat banner. The Australia is the first sugar-producing complex in Matanzas Province to fulfill its production plans for the current harvest. Radio Rebelde at 2300 GMT on 22 April reports that a factory run by the union of nickel enterprises in Moa Municipality, Holguin Province, makes "somewhat more than 1,000 kg of pigments per month for the construction materials industry." These pigments, obtained from nickel industry wastes, replace those Cuba has been importing for the production of tiles and toilet fixtures. Radio Rebelde at 1700 GMT on 25 April reports that the low-capacity generator factory in Cacocum Municipality, Holguin Province, has already produced 200 generators with PRC technology. The report adds that this factory, the only one of its kind in Cuba, is in the final stage of construction. The plant will produce 23 kinds of generators of capacities ranging from 0.55 to 15 kw. It aims to produce 30,000 units yearly. Once the local demand for these ?MT on 26 April reports that a metal recycling factory in Havana has experienced a decrease in its supply of scrap metal. Last year it recycled only 10 percent of the amount it recycled in 1990. In the first quarter of 1994, the nonferrous metals recycled have been less than 1 percent of the amount recycled in the same period in 1990. This recycling plant supplies approximately 50 other factories that use recycled metals. Radio Rebelde at 1406 GMT on 26 April reports that the Espana Republicana Sugar Mill in Perico Municipality, Matanzas Province, has thrown away 5,000 liters of the biological fertilizer Azospirillum, which had not been picked up and was quickly decomposing in the holding tanks. Radio Rebelde at 1700 GMT on 26 April reports that the months of May and June are crucial for the spring planting campaign. So far, 4,000 caballerias have been planted -- 76 percent of the goal for the January-April period. Over 18,000 caballerias are to planted in the first half of 1994; it is therefore important to stay on the planting schedule during the next two months. Radio Reloj at 1930 GMT on 26 April reports that combine-harvester operator Carlos Nunez of platoon number six which provides sugar cane for the Hector Rodriguez sugar agroindustrial complex in Sagua la Grande, Villa Clara Province, was the first to cut 2 million arrobas of cane. Carlos Nunez is one of the most outstanding producers in the country during the current harvest, cutting more than 16,000 arrobas daily. He reached 2 million arrobas in 110 working days. Nunez expects to cut 100,000 arrobas more before the end of the harvest in northern Villa Clara. Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision Networks at 0000 GMT on 27 April report that, despite efforts by farmers in Matanzas, the potato harvest of that province did not reach the expected levels due to the infestations that affected the crops and the high humidity of the soil. The current harvest has been the worse of the past years. With only 20 caballerias left to harvest, approximately 500,000 quintals of potatoes have been harvested, which means that the final results will be short of the goal of 760,000 quintals for the people's consumption. According to estimates, the average yield will be 4,000 quintals per caballeria, which is short of the goal and of what the province traditionally obtains. So far, 100,000 quintals have been sent to Santiago de Cuba and 170,000 quintals are in cold storage centers. Radio Reloj at 1930 GMT on 27 April reports that sugarcane planting will be intensified in Camaguey with the mobilization of thousands of workers toward that objective. From January to date, the province has planted 460 caballerias; the goal is to conclude the year with 1,189 caballerias of sugarcane. Recent rains and the dampness of the soil will accelerate seed germination. In the same newscast, Radio Reloj adds that the Segundo Diaz Prado UBPC in Caimito, Havana Province, will try to improve sugarcane production for the next harvest. Adolfo Lozada, president of the unit, has told this station that most cane plantations are just sprouting and for this reason workers must accelerate cleaning and planting activities because, for the time being, they have no fertilizer. He added that the main problem is the need to build more houses for workers.
