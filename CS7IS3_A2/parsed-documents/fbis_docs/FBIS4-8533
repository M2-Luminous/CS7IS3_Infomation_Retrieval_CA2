Here is a short report by Andrej Pirkovic: [Begin Pirkovic recording] When asked whether Slovene-Italian relations could be complicated with the possible appointment of the new Italian Prime Minister Designate Berlusconi, Minister Peterle replied that one should first wait for the official stance of the new government. He is convinced that it would not be in Italy's interests to strain the mutual relations. We shall see it as an act of goodwill, Peterle said, if relations will develop the way we want them to, which is something we have been striving for all the time. In his words, Slovenia will insist on the observation of the legal bases that have already been laid and here the Osimo agreements are a fact that cannot be negated. He assessed positively the work of the negotiating teams for the update of the Osimo agreements. The fact is that Slovenia and Italy need each other in this region and that this is the only way in which we can envisage the realization of the plans for Trieste and the border provinces. Regarding Slovenia's integration into the European Union, Foreign Minister Peterle stated resolutely that we would not tolerate any possible Italian blackmail. Asked about the protection of the Slovene minority in Italy, he replied that our state will continue to take care of the Slovene minority and demand the observation of the European standards by Italy.
