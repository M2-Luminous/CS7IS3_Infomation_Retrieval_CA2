Now Nakedi Mathews Phosa is to be sworn in as premier of the Eastern Transvaal region following the massive ANC victory in this region during the general elections. He is currently the chairperson of the ANC in the Eastern Transvaal. Mathews Phosa was born in Mbombela township at Nelspruit on September 1, 1952. His early years were spent on the farm in Potgietersrus with his grandfather. When he lost his land during the land removals young Phosa went to live with his parents in Nelspruit where his father was a teacher. His mother, who was politically active, had a strong influence on his life telling him about Nelson Mandela in prison on Robben Island among other things. He attended boarding school in Acornhoek. Having matriculated with a distinction in agricultural science, Phosa studied law at the University of the North. Steve Biko and Themba Sono were the heroes of his generation. At university Phosa started publishing poetry in English and Afrikaans. He graduated, completed his articles and started a legal firm of which he is still the senior partner. Besides serving as national organiser of the Black Lawyers' Association, Phosa was on the board of directors of a business and of a welfare organisation he had founded. When the then apartheid government wanted to incorporate KaNgwane into Swaziland, he was prominent in the campaigns against the move. He also led the rent boycotts in the Eastern Transvaal. During this time - in the early 1980's he joined MK and the ANC underground. During his stay in Mozambique he became part of a machinery directing political and military activity in the Eastern Transvaal. In 1990 he was among the first cadres sent home to begin negotiations with the government. As a lawyer he is currently involved in defending members of the movement and organising the ANC Legal Department. He is a member of the National Negotiations Commission and serves on the police board in terms of the Peace Accord. He is married to social worker Yvonne Nkwenkwezi and has three children.
