The Telecommunications Council, an advisory panel to the posts and telecommunications minister, has also recently come up with a report recommending construction -- in three stages -- of a optic fibre network, which by 2010, will become the mainframe of the information and communications infrastructure. Completion of an information and communications infrastructure will bring forth tremendous economic and social effects. First, it will become an incubator for the next general industry. There is no telling what kind of new industries will emerge when the existing industries of telephone, broadcasting, cable television (CATV), computer, movie, video, electric power, and city gas infuse with information and communications technologies. On the multimedia-related market alone, the council predicts the size of it to grow to 123 trillion yen, providing 2.43 million new jobs by 2010. Naturally, the industry will also become a base for technological reform. Second, the information and communications infrastructure can be used in medical, educational, and administrative services to improve living conditions and peoples' welfare. It can be expected to play the role of a social infrastructure that will support industrial development and improve living standards. Regulatory "Infrastructure" Despite this bright picture of the future, we become shocked when we see the walls of regulations blocking its arrival. The condition is so bad that networks of the regulations have become an infrastructure of their own. As long as they stand unabolished, there will be no way for the information and communications infrastructure to be built up. Nor will there be a multimedia market or new information society because they can only develop when there is an infrastructure. Let us cite some specific examples. First, if a company wants to start a telecommunications business by laying a communications system, or wants to withdraw from its business, it has to have a permit from the posts and telecommunications minister. But what if one might like to be entrepreneurial and start a new service at his own risk. The one who makes decisions on whether or not there is a demand for such a service is the government. The government nips the new businesses in the bud. It is indeed difficult to believe that bureaucrats have capabilities to predict what demand there will be for which service areas. The success of a service business depends on ideas. The process of supervisory government offices reviewing business plans, taking as much as they like in doing so, results in compromising creative ideas, and only discourages the entrepreneur's desire to create new businesses. The authorities' rationale is that this area of business belongs to one which commands high public interests, and thus, if companies are allowed to come and go as they please, it will not serve the people's interests. We are not saying we cannot understand that rationale, but we must note that this kind of justification has been too easily used to hide the fact that it has restrained competition. Suppose a permit was issued to a company for startup and the company was ready to go into business. There are other binding and fettering regulations waiting for it. "What are all these charts with drawings like spider webs?" When engineers from a U.S. CATV company arrive at a Japanese company to provide technological assistance, they all ask this question in amazement upon being shown project prospectus papers that cover the whole process leading up to the beginning of construction of a CATV network. In the United States, when a local government decides to approve installation of CATV networks in a certain area, businesses can start construction of networks right away without any government office's approval. In Tokyo, on the other hand, CATV companies that want to open interactive V service stations by the end of this year need to wait for half year to file an approval on its construction plan, and then wait about a year to receive an approval. Only then can it start the actual construction work. That company needs to explain specific details of its business plan to the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. It must then go through a process of obtaining a myriad of permits and approvals before actually being able to lay its circuits. It has to obtain approvals for all construction details -- use of roads and utility poles, crossing of railways, and construction of networks beneath roads. Drawings must be prepared on all individual work sites as well. Take roads for example. Because some roads belong to the central government, some to prefectural governments, and some to city governments, the company has to contact concerned offices and police stations of the central and appropriate local governments regarding the use of them. Even when the company comes up with a most efficient CATV circuit layout plan through the use of computers, the plan will become useless if even one government office says it cannot approve the crossing of roads at certain points. The company has to find different routes to make the necessary crossings and come up with a new layout plan. The company will have to receive approvals on tens and hundreds of utility poles -- at the huge cost of people's time and energy and the work of copy machines. It is only natural that companies insist approvals should be at least be given on the basis of certain blocks. Public utility utilization charges imposed on the use of roads and utility poles are bound to be higher than those imposed on uses of such facilities as electric power, city gas, piped water, and sewage systems, and are heavy burdens on the CATV image-transmitting service whose facilities have a relatively short life to begin with. Let us suppose a new communications or CATV business has somehow managed to install hardware. What is awaiting it now are more regulations, this time, dealing with the substance of the services it wants to provide. "Halt" to Service A typical case is medical service. Remotely conducted diagnosis by using an information network is technically possible, and much expectations are given to it at present. But according to the Law on Medical Practice, diagnosis made based on remotely provided information is not recognized as an act of diagnosis. As such, physicians cannot add diagnosis charges to their services; therefore, remotely conducted medical service will not make headway in this country. Even when diagnostic records are computerized on floppy disks for instance, under law, the medical cards need to be maintained anyway. Reservation of [train, bus, and airline] seats and the issuance of tickets can be considered as readily workable cases wherein benefits of the information network can be conveniently used to make people's lives easier. But even when people have computer terminals at home, they cannot have access to travel companies' systems. That makes it impossible for these people to make reservations or do anything at all. Even convenience stores, as they are not registered as travel agents, cannot provide reservations services. Furthermore, as far as the matter of issuing tickets is concerned, only offices with proper registration and with people in charge of ticketing are allowed to engage in such business services. Suppose reservations are made by phone or other means. The only way for the would-be travelers to get the tickets is for them to go to the ticket-issuing offices or to have them mailed. There is no way to get the tickets issued by a system like automatic vending machines. The government is set to complete the outline of external economic measures and intends to make deregulation a major part of it. Meanwhile, Keidanren [Japan Federation of Economic Organizations] and other private-sector organizations are calling for actions on this situation, citing existing regulations in the information area. If government offices are only concerned about which offices should take control of what interests, doing nothing about the substance of deregulation, not only will relations with the United States be jeopardized, but also the future of Japan itself. With eyes set on the future new information society, the regulations which no longer fit reality or which are too vague to define should be revised and changed at their foundations.
