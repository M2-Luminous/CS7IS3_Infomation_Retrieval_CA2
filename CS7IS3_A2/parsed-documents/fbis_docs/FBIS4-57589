The most hostile elements went as far as to launch a campaign of terror against a group of U.S.-based emigres who came to Havana in late April to participate in the meeting, which the attendees described as very useful. Cubans, who until now have comprised the so-called silent majority, prevented by the right from expressing their views in favor of a dialogue with the island's government, are beginning to defy extremists like the members of the Cuban American National Foundation [FNCA], one of the groups that has tried hardest to minimize the scope of the Havana meeting. Raymundo del Toro, president of the Cuban-American Committee for Peace, in a letter to THE NEW YORK TIMES, pointed out that his only son lives in Cuba and all members of his group have relatives on the island. That is why, Del Toro noted, we will no longer be the silent majority who remain quiet in the face of attacks by opportunistic politicians like Representative Robert Torricelli, who sponsored the amendment that stiffened the blockade on Cuba, and egomaniacs like Jorge Mas Canosa, head of the FNCA. In his letter to THE NEW YORK TIMES, Del Toro affirmed that the important thing about the aforementioned conference is the agreements reached, not whether the participants had a chat with Cuban President Fidel Castro. Del Toro is among the emigres who left the meeting satisfied, as its balance was significant in terms facilites for emigrants. In the opinion of Andres Gomez, coordinator of the Antonio Maceo Brigade, the changes in migration policy that eliminate the five-year waiting period for Cubans who left the country legally to return to the country will benefit thousands of Cubans eager to have more fluid relations with their family members and country of origin. Although this was not the only agreement reached in Havana, the extreme right among the emigres and in the Western media insist on saying that participants in the conference left empty-handed. In this letter, Del Toro regretted that the meeting in Havana has been downplayed. During a news conference in Miami, Gomez took a step farther in asking: Why do the gentlemen of the extreme right and the media refuse to hold a debate? Are not they always claiming they are democrats? Let them dare to practice what they claim to be.
