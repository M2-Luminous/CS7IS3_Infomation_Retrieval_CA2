The effects incurred from the bubble economy's collapse are great, and--still gasping amidst the Heisei recession--one can see no sign of recovery. Some even say the problems of the financial system are hurting business conditions; and the Real Estate Resolution Corporation [RERC], created as a "savior" for business recovery, started operations on 1 February 1993 with a full awareness of its heavy mission. Yet, limitations apparently exist for that corporation, too. Established Subject to "Restrictions" The collapse of the bubble economy brought on a drastic lowering of stock and real estate prices. That caused reductions in financial organizations' internal capital accumulations and increases in their bad assets, and drove the financial institutions into situations more severe than any seen since the start of the postwar high-growth period. Since financial institutions having a "duty" to aid businesses that have fallen into recession have themselves suffered managerial stagnation, a situation is even now continuing in which the bottoming out of the Heisei recession cannot be confirmed. Start Was Favorable, But... Let us look at a summary of the RERC, which started on 1 February to take requests effective for March. The president is former Mitsubishi Bank managing director Goto, while the Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank's previous chief of the operations promotion first division, Akira Miyagawa, was appointed executive director and former Bank of Japan inspection division chief Masa Ando was appointed fulltime auditor. The fulltime officers number three, but besides them there are seven non-fulltime directors and one auditor. The organization includes 23 persons in the lineup below the division chief level. The entire staff below the directors is made up of persons on loan from a variety of businesses such as banks and life insurance firms. The operations of the RERC begin with financial organs bringing in their bad liabilities. The financial institutions that can bring these in are all financial bodies that have equity in the RERC. Also the National Federation of Trust Banks, the National Federation of Credit Unions and those under the umbrella of the Central Cooperative Bank for Agriculture and Forestry. For banks not under its purview to bring in bad liabilities, that "will be considered premised on the buying up of such bad liabilities not running counter to the RERC's founding precepts nor to the interests of the RERC and all its stockholders." As for the liabilities that special housing loan institutions and non-banks hold, it will be possible to bring these in through the equity-holding financial institutions on the premise that "a reasonable reconstruction assistance program" exists. As for bringing them in directly, that is to be treated in the same manner as with financial institutions mentioned before that are not under the corporation's purview. Liabilities that are the object of buy-ups are bad liabilities secured by real estate, those setting up (basic) mortgages as security for the stated liabilities, and so forth. The current minimum buy-up unit is 10 million yen for each individual liability (original value of said liability at time of buy-up), with no upper limit being set. The types of such liabilities are not limited by the purposes of the funds; but housing loan liabilities for residences are excluded. In principle, limits are not set on the term, interest or payback conditions. Such liabilities as have conditions under which they cannot be dealt with by disputation (such as liabilities secured by real estate under dispute in court or liabilities subject to application for bankruptcy, arbitration or corporate restructuring) are excluded in principle. As for liabilities secured by real estate that is under declaration for auctioning or under attachment or provisional attachment, they will be included if the RERC can confirm that it will not be drawn into any dispute. Because trading of bad liabilities has not been done in Japan's financial markets heretofore, neither fixed evaluative methods nor markets exist for them. Due to that, once they have been sold between the RERC and the financial institution bringing in the bad liabilities at prices based on reasonable estimates, the selling price is fixed based on the amount ultimately recovered. At the time bad liability is sold, the financial institution calculates the sale loss for the difference in the sale amount from the cost of the liability and its estimated value. However, at the time the price is set, the institution will recalculate the profit or loss for the portion returned to the RERC that exceeds a "proper range" within any difference from the initial selling price. The most important finding on the buy-up price is the setup adopted for a dual check: an appraisal and evaluation of the mortgaged real estate by a real-estate inspector in order to assure objectivity and fairness (a normal price aiming at a sale with a real estate appraisal and evaluation), as well as appraisal and evaluation of the bought-up liability by a price-adjudicating committee (the rated value of the liability, with the evaluation of the mortgaged real estate as a base, adding in the element of the liability's estimated recoverable value based on the situation of the debtor and the guarantor, while excluding the costs involved in recovery). Selection of the real-estate appraisal firm and real-estate appraiser is handled impartially on the basis of the RERC's selection standards. Also, the price-adjudicating committee is made up of members with high discernment and specialized knowledge of law, accounting, tax administration and real-estate appraisal and evaluation. Incidentally, the members are Gen Takahashi (former permanent vice minister for finance and former chairman of the fair trade commission), Tsuneo Shirai (vice president of the tax accountants federation), Hiroshi Kawakita (former president of the Japan public accountants association), Ryoichi Inanohe (managing director, Japan real-estate appraisal association) and Shigeru Yamada (former vice president, Japan lawyers league). This committee is independent of the structure of the RERC's board of directors and so on. The prices for mortgaged real estate determined in this manner are published so as to stimulate and accelerate disposition. With the prerequisite of agreement by those involved, the RERC publishes such items as 1) the location (in principle, down to the town or village name); 2) the type (distinguishing between residence, commercial business, factory and so on); 3) legal cubic measurement ratio (%); 4) type (distinguishing between vacant lots, lots with buildings and so on); 5) Size (indicating scale of land by levels); 6) (indicating land price by 1,000 yen units per square meter, making the unit price the "appraised and evaluated price for mortgaged real estate" determined as proper by the price appraisal committee, which is the RERC's advisory body); and 7) the time of pricing (date when the appraisal and evaluation in 6 was done). From 1 February the RERC was taking the portion of applications for March implementation. On 25 February, it held the first price-appraisal committee meeting and on 15 April published the first mortgaged real estate prices. Because of the fiscal year ending [31 March] the first fiscal year results cover this March-implementation portion only. As financial institutions had held up their settlements, the number of cases of bought-up liabilities was 229 (categorized by amount per case: 26 at 500 million yen or less, 39 between 500 million and one billion yen, 85 between one and three billion yen, 34 between three and five billion yen and 45 above five billion yen)--a total of 681.7 billion yen, with a buy-up price of 452.1 billion yen, making it a favorable start-up. Fiscal 1993 Buy-Up Results and Recovery Results for Bought-up Liabilities Bought-Up Liabilities Recovery Value of Bought-Up Liabilities From Sale of Mortgaged Real Estate Cases Value Buy-Up Value Cases Value Price April 1993 1 0.1 0.08 0.41 2 0.36 May 1993 9 10.0 6.70 0.02 -- -- June 1993 12 24.3 17.60 0.39 2 0.12 July 1993 14 64.2 26.10 0.10 1 0.01 August 1993 60 130.8 66.70 1.32 4 1.25 September 414 954.7 485.70 1.33 5 1.23 1993 Totals 520 1,184.1 602.88 3.57 14 2.97 Unit: billion yen Issue Is Dealing With Special Housing Loan Institutions The results since the start of this fiscal year are as shown in the table. When we add the totals for the first half of this year to those of the bought-up liabilities for last fiscal year, we get about two trillion yen. This shows that deliveries by financial institutions are being made smoothly and that redemption of bad liabilities is progressing well. However, if we look at the results from April through July, a mere 36 cases--98.6 billion yen in money terms--have been bought up. Financial institutions bringing bad liabilities to the RERC are to judge the details of their own accounts and promote redemptions programmatically according to their earnings. In short, after checking out the balance figures to some extent, they bring the bad liabilities to the RERC. Thus, deliveries would become concentrated after the March settlements and September mid-term book closing. Due to that, some people criticize that this is shifting bad liabilities as an accounting measure; but we have the "major premise" of redeeming bad liabilities based on the principle of self responsibility, so that in some respects there may be nothing for us to do about this. The RERC's organization is as stated above; but under this system it reportedly takes some two months to get a decision on the buy-up price. We cannot deny that efficiency is low because the office focuses on it only for certain set periods. Also, while we say that the processing of 2 trillion yen has gone forward, there are those in the finance industry who say, "The fact that redemptions cannot proceed on the 7 trillion yen in bad assets that are held by the special housing loan institutions cannot erase the unease in the financial system." As stated before, under current conditions the special housing loan institutions and non-banks cannot sell liabilities directly to the RERC. Financial institutions with equity in the RERC will have to take them on in part and buy them. Under this method an undue burden falls on financial institutions that take them in. To resolve this problem, some people ask, "How about if the special housing institutions and non-banks buy equity in the RERC and then sell the liabilities directly?" Also, we have had the suggestion that the securities firms suffering from the bad liabilities of the keiretsu non-banks, too, "might as well invest in the RERC." Somehow this seems like useless advice. Many special housing loan institutions and non-banks are firms whose earnings are actually in the red. Considering the functions of the RERC, there is no value in those financial institutions not making enough profits to be bringing in bad liabilities. In the red even if that were free, they cannot take on the further burden of the sales losses. That would merely mean further deficits being be piled onto them. For example, firms like the Nihon Housing Finance Corporation have problems with both their parent banks and the farm banks; and there would seem to be no value in their bringing in bad liabilities so long as those are not resolved. Of course, there would be no problem if the special housing loan institutions had the strength to make profits, but under current conditions they are not in such a stage. One cannot deny that at the stage when the induction public funds became a blank sheet, expectations of the RERC fell. Most bad liabilities are held by non-banks in banking systems, including the special housing loan institutions and, as already stated, there is little sense in their being brought in under present conditions. In order to have strong financial institutions bring in bad liabilities and for the RERC to buy them up, the RERC brings much effectiveness to bear; but under current conditions it would be difficult for financial institutions with poor earnings to bring them in. In the eight months that have elapsed since we started business, 2 trillion yen in bad liabilities have collected in the RERC. On the other hand, it is hard to say that we are progressing with the disposal of mortgaged real estate, given the impact of stagnation in the real estate market. In the RERC's founding guidelines it is stated, "It will have a pump-priming effect in activating real estate dealings," but we cannot say it is fulfilling that function under present circumstances. Of course, the RERC will not trade in real estate contrary to its initial plans. There naturally are limitations; but it would be good now to be probing for ways to make it easier to dispose of the bad liabilities being brought in. The problem is that, while these are piling up, the RERC is making strenuous efforts under the restriction imposed on it. As there reportedly are over 10 trillion yen in bad liabilities, it seems that the time of crisis is yet to come.
