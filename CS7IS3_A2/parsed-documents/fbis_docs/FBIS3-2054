The State Council stressed the importance of Beijing as the capital of the People's Republic of China and the country's political and cultural center. The blueprint, published together with the approval by the municipal government last month, maps out the course of the building of the city into a cultural and economic center with first-class public utilities, infrastructure facilities and living environment. It also calls for important government buildings and cultural institutions to be located in downtown areas, such as along the north-south axis of the city, Chang'an Boulevard and the second ring road. Buildings relegated to this class include the economic and trade office of the State Council, the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Communications and Culture, the National Grand Theater and National Women's Center. According to the city's layout for 1991-2010, the future urban construction will place emphasis on the characteristics of the capital, and on the adjustment of the industrial structures and the use of land. Start-ups of new heavy industrial plants, especially big power- consumers and those that may cause serious water and air pollution, will no longer be allowed in urban districts. Meanwhile, the existing ones would not be expanded. The total population of permanent residents in the city will be brought under stricter control, to a limit of 12.5 million by the year 2010. Air, water, garbage and noise pollution will be reduced drastically in the coming 20 years, with the aim of making Beijing a pollution-free city by the year 2010. The document stipulates that all environmental quality indices will reach the government's standard in that period. The city will cut its use of coal greatly in the coming two decades by piping natural gas in from Shaanxi and Gansu Provinces and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region in northwest China. In addition, several hydroelectric power stations will be built to supply heat to most of the urban residents who still use coal for heating. The emission of exhaust gas will be put under control to further reduce air pollution. People in Beijing will also be drinking cleaner water, as major reservoirs and underground water sources will be better protected. The city also plans to build 16 new sewage-treatment plants in the next 20 years. Meanwhile, more trees will be planted, and ecological zones, shelterbelts and parks will be built in the urban areas. By 2010 the total green land will climb to 6,400 ha [hectares] from 3,00 ha at present. The forest coverage will rise to 40 percent. Officials say that Beijing has achieved major progress in environmental protection over the past few years. So far, some 25 percent of urban sewage is treated before it is discharged into rivers, and the forest coverage rate in the urban areas has reached 30.7 percent. The document also urges a quickening of the pace of the urban infrastructure modernization drive. The focus will be on the expansion of the city's transportation, including subways, light rail traffic and expressways. As a city with a long history and serving as the capital of several dynasties, the future construction will also be integrated with the brilliant culture of the nation. Beijing's cultural relics and scenic spots will be better protected, according to the blueprint.
