According to these reports, the president "should" assume direct control over the Armed Forces.... Does this information have any basis in fact? [Volkogonov] I was informed that the other day a foreign radio station had likewise already chimed in with the chorus of Russian publications. Journalists are phoning in, including foreigners. They are all asking the same question: Is it true that in the next few days the Defense Ministry will be fundamentally reorganized to become a civilian department, with the General Staff left to deal with the specifically military issues? I would like to state definitely that all this is no more than a rumor. No official decisions on this matter are known to me personally. What is more, I think that there won't be any. I think that in principle -- true, this is only my own personal view -- in three to four years, or five, or maybe by the turn of the century, the ministry probably will go civilian. As in all civilized societies it will be made up of civilians, of various specialists who will deal with political, technical, financial, economic, and international questions and hand over both operational and combat issues to a body like the Joint Chiefs of Staff. But I think that Russia will preserve its indigenous tradition, continuing to call this body the General Staff. Such a division will be of benefit. But it will only become possible when our society becomes very stable and governable. It is not right to resort to this kind of reorganization at present, indeed it is simply dangerous. This is something for the future. I would recommend that when all the necessary prerequisites are in place this should be done gradually, step by step, by filling the Defense Ministry with civilian specialists and handing over particular functions to them. Maybe we should introduce an additional post, that of civilian deputy minister with responsibility for, say, finances or technical, engineering or medical questions. Other such steps should be carried out, but only gradually. Our history shows us that extreme discontinuity always leads only to confusion, chaos, and to the people's losing faith. So I think that the time is not yet right for this major reorganization of the defense department about which people are writing and speaking. Society and the Army are not ready for it yet. I repeat, this is something for the future. One other thing you have to bear in mind is this. We are often blamed because the military reforms are proceeding in a feeble and slow manner, that they are not really visible, so people claim. You can make a quick sketch of any diagram with "boxes" representing components of a military system, but this is not enough for a reform. The crux of the matter is that the main motive force in reforming the Army is financial, economic, material. The person who has control over force -- and this is only possible when, unlike today, the country has a stable economy -- will be able to carry out a real reform. You see, it does not in any way come down to combining some organs and splitting up others and transferring cadres here or there, as even some military men think. What kind of a reform is that! You will only get a real reform when, and I repeat, society has a suitable material and financial impetus. [Rubtsov] As an advisor to Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin, you clearly know, do you not, what the president's evaluation of the Defense Ministry is? [Volkogonov] The Ministry is today in a position to discharge its obligations normally, and is actually doing so -- this is the president's evaluation in a nutshell. The Army played an important role in averting a civil war. Although the Army does, of course, have many problems which should be resolved. Here gratifying changes can be noted.... [Rubtsov] What do you have in mind? [Volkogonov] Society has become noticeably more governable since the well-known events in October. In the last few days I have spoken to important statesmen, in particular to Yegor Timurovich Gaydar, and they pick this out as a clear trend. The vertical structure of executive power has become noticeably strengthened, and the government's role has increased, as have those of the president and the executive structures in the provinces. In time all this will, I think, also be reflected in the Army in many areas starting with conscription and ending with material security. Such changes will in turn stimulate the development of the military reform. [Rubtsov] Dmitriy Antonovich, how from this viewpoint do you regard the problem of "the Army and politics." [Volkogonov] I already had the occasion to express my opinion on this question prior to the recent elections. Now that it is known that the election results in a number of regions, including several military garrisons, turned out to be -- not to beat about the bush -- discouraging, this topic for discussion seems particularly topical. I never could agree that the Army, as one of the state's most important instruments, can stand outside politics. Yes, it should stand outside party politics, but it cannot stand outside state politics. It should maintain the same course as the government and president/supreme commander in chief are steering, a course of security, an official course promoting military organizational development, reform, and so on. [Rubtsov] If this matter were completely cleared up, it would certainly be easier for the military themselves.... [Volkogonov] It would also, of course, be easier for the commanders and their assistants with responsibility for education work with personnel. Even so, the fear of breaking some rule, of overstepping the mark led to people being abandoned to their fates from a spiritual viewpoint. As a result quite a few servicemen cast their votes in the election on the basis of their mood at the time. It would seem that it is already clear: The idea that "the Army stands outside politics" was understood in a one-sided, legalistic manner; however, several leaders continue to cling onto it. In this connection, I would like to express my own ideas about the role of the comparatively new organs working with personnel.... [Rubtsov] Incidentally, the editorial office is receiving many questions on this.... [Volkogonov] Previously two organs, two institutions characterized our system: the security organs and commissars. In the days of Stalin both organs tarnished their own reputations. I know from my own experience that the commissars stuck to those ideological aims which drove us up a historical blind alley. In many respects they are guilty of causing the present situation in society. I do not absolve myself of personal responsibility in this matter. After August 1991 the absolutely correct decision was made that old-style ideological indoctrination was no longer thinkable in the Army. But at the same time the conclusion was reached at the Defense Ministry -- and this has been reflected in the president's and government's decisions -- that some organs are nevertheless necessary to specially take on the education of personnel. I am convinced that the fact that quite a few former political workers are employed in these organs should not cast doubt on them. It would, in my view, be all the more wrong to put these weak -- at the moment "feeble" -- organs dealing with personnel "under the knife" in the light of the results of an "unsuccessful" poll rating. We do not have an equivalent for the educational organs, we are unprepared to do without them, and we have neither the practice nor the experience of doing so. Some people say that the Russian Army did without such organs and no harm was done. But after all, how many decades did it take to make the system which we had in Russia when the 1917 October Revolution broke out, to get the necessary experience and practical work under our belts. And what is happening now? We will just destroy, eliminate what we have, and this will only lead to a future weakening of our spiritual potential. We will only achieve one thing -- we will radically cut down our degree of organizational influence on the educational processes in the Army. A few people are attempting to blame only the old political workers for what has happened. I must say that any attempt to sow disharmony among officers is not only unconstructive but also dangerous. There were all different kinds of commanders and political workers. It is not right to lump them all together. But it is necessary to sort out each individual case. If a man fails to do his work properly, fails to "make out," he should be discharged or found a position commensurate with his knowledge and experience, or he should be taught, educated. In my view the personnel organs should, proceeding from state policy, undertake the education of servicemen in the spirit of Russian history, Russian statehood, and the Russian Armed Forces. They should pay a great deal of attention to morale problems: military ethics and military valor. They simply must be at the heart of the work to inculcate the best qualities of the Russian soldier in our personnel. I consider that it is precisely these organs which should most of all engage in patriotic education. We have been called on to revive democratic patriotism, a patriotism which is not nationalistic or chauvinistic but democratic, taking into account not only our own interests but those of other peoples as well. These organs should, of course, explain state policy, the supreme commander in chief's policy, and government policy. With regard to both foreign and domestic affairs, for example what kinds of reforms are in progress here. I think that these organs, especially at the highest level, should take particular care of the subunits involved in the technology of propaganda. Without this we are deprived of a modern means of fighting for people's consciences. These organs will in one form or another be necessary to promote the new Russian Constitution. You see, it is the Constitution itself which should, in my view, be the basis of the moral and legal education of the Russian Army's personnel today. What about the cultural organs? We have so many officers' messes, clubs, libraries, and ensembles; if we let all this go there will be nobody involved professionally in this area, and everything will collapse. The claims you hear that only the commanders will be equal to all this are, in my view, superficial. It is just as important to help the Russian Federation Armed Forces Humanities Academy to determine more quickly its role in the creation of the necessary psychological climate in the Army and Navy, and in arming the relevant workers with the most up-to-date information and methods. Managing the spiritual life of people in uniform is a complex task. There must be no vacuum in the area of public consciousness. Gaps which appear will be filled immediately with anything at all -- all sorts of national-socialist prejudices and chauvinist, pseudo-patriotic views. I think it unnecessary to take a long time to explain what the consequences could be. The Army is a state institution, and all the transformations going on in it presuppose a wise, balanced approach and circumspection.
