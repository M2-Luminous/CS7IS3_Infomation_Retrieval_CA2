The first African National Congress (ANC)-National Party (NP) initiative, "which includes a move to extend the election registration deadline -- offers the FA an opportunity to reappraise its foolish and dangerous boycott tactic." The second initiative comes from Nelson Mandela, who has said: "`I will go down on my knees to beg those who want to drag our country into bloodshed...not to do so'." THE STAR believes Mandela's willingness to "adopt the position of supplicant begging for peace should not deceive his political opponents. It is not a sign of weakness, but a move by a strong man to prepare for tough action by showing that he has done his best to reach a compromise and avoid violence. Like the threat to restore the pre-colonial Zulu monarchy, Buthelezi's latest ploy -- of seeking a postponement of the April election in Natal and preserving the status quo there for the immediate future -- has no chance of success. By introducing yet another demand, he risks demonstrating beyond doubt that he will do anything to avid the verdict of the people at the polls. Unless he changes tack, his political epitaph will be that of a spoiler." BUSINESS DAY Need for Buthelezi `Conciliatory' Approach -- "It took a great deal of humility for Mandela, hardly a humble man, to say at an election rally on Sunday that he would be willing to `go down on my knees' before Buthelezi to plead with him to join the process," notes Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 1 March in a page-8 editorial. This permits Buthelezi "the opportunity to re-enter the political mainstream with dignity, perhaps even with the aura of a statesman." "What is required of Buthelezi at this stage, however, if he desires a reasonable deal, is that he adopt a more conciliatory attitude towards the process even if he remains dissatisfied with the offer on the table." However, the chances of Buthelezi adopting that approach "seem doubtful," given "the new obstacles he has identified. First he said Inkatha would be unprepared for an April election even if all its constitutional demands were met. He then noted that the king's demands for an autonomous realm were paramount. The portents are not good." SOWETAN `Good Riddance' to Homelands -- Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 1 March in a page-8 editorial believes the collapse of the political infrastructure in Venda and Bophuthatswana "was to be expected considering the manner in which these homelands were created. It is a well known fact that the National Party created these tin pots states dictated by the political fraud that they were giving black political status in their `own homes'. The so-called independent black states also deprived millions of people of their South African citizenship." It is well to bid the homelands "good riddance" since the lives of many have been "wrecked and millions of rand have been wasted on the homelands." CAPE TIMES `Colonels' Conspiracy' Threatens Country -- Gerald Shaw writes in his "Political Survey" column on page 6 of Cape Town CAPE TIMES in English 25 February: "A military coup is not on the cards; neither is a civil war, we may hope, but there are elements in the Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front] and the Inkatha Freedom Party whose efforts to upset the apple cart should be taken seriously." Shaw writes that according to the weekend newspaper RAPPORT, "the new conspiracy -- let us call it the Colonels' conspiracy -- is taking shape in extreme secrecy, with generals Viljoen and Groenewald and other Volksfront leaders apparently not in the picture." Now the "claim for the restoration of the Zulu kingdom's 1834 boundaries, however it originated, is ripe for exploitation by the dark forces on the Right, and so is the drive to rally traditionalist Zulus behind King Goodwill Zwelithini and declare a Natal/kwaZulu UDI [unilateral declaration of independence]. This conscious exploitation of Zulu national pride has added an explosive element to a readily combustible mixture." CITY PRESS Stop Promises of Afrikaner Homeland -- "While we support the efforts being made to bring Inkatha and the rightwingers on board the election train, we must question the wisdom of promising some Afrikaners a volkstaat [homeland]," declares a page-14 editorial in Johannesburg CITY PRESS in English on 27 February. "Whatever the motives of the ANC are in this regard, we believe they are playing dangerous games by making the rightwingers even remotely believe they can have their own homeland." "Afrikaners, like it or not, are now part of a heterogeneous but unitary South Africa."
