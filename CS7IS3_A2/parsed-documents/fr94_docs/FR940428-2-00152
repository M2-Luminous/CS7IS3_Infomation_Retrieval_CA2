FR940428-2-00152 FR940428-2-00072 Each facility must also submit a copy of the notice of intent to each State authority as appropriate (see individual state permits for appropriate authority and address). The facilities authorized to discharge under the final general permit will receive written notification from EPA, Region I, with State concurrence. Failure to submit to EPA, Region I, a notice of intent to be covered and/or failure to receive from EPA written notification of permit coverage means that the facility is not authorized to discharge under this general permit. c. Effluent Limitations 1. Statutory Requirements The Clean Water Act (the Act) prohibits the discharge of pollutants to waters of the United States without a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit unless such a discharge is otherwise authorized by the Act. The NPDES Permit is the mechanism used to implement technology and water quality based effluent limitations and other requirements including monitoring and reporting. The NPDES permit was developed in accordance with various statutory and regulatory authorities establised pursuant to the Act. The regulations governing the EPA NPDES Permit program are generally found at 40 CFR parts 122, 124, 125 and 136. EPA is required to consider technology and water quality requirements when developing permit limits. 40 CFR part 125 Subpart A sets the criteria and standards that EPA must use to determine which technology-based requirements, requirements under Section 301(b) of the Act and/or requirements established on a case-by-case basis under section 402(a)(1) of the Act, should be included in the permit. The Clean Water Act requires that all discharges, at a minimum, must meet effluent limitations based on the technological capability of dischargers to control pollutants in their discharge. Section 301(b)(1)(A) of the Act requires the application of Best Practicable Control Technology Currently Available (BPT) with the statutory deadline for compliance being July 1, 1977, unless otherwise authorized by the Act. Section 301(b)(2) of the Act requires the application of Best Conventional Control Technology (BCT) for conventional pollutants, and Best Available Technology Economically Achievable (BAT) for non-conventional and toxic pollutants. The compliance deadline for BCT and BAT is as expeditiously as practicable but in no case later than three years after the date such limitations are promulgated and in no case later than March 31, 1989. 2. Technology-Based Effluent Limitations EPA has not promulgated National Effluent Guidelines for non-contact cooling water discharges. For a category where Guidelines have been promulgated, such as steam electric generating stations (see 40 CFR part 423), the issuance of an individual permit for the discharges would be more appropriate (See 40 CFR 122.28(b)(3)(i)(C)). Therefore, as provided in section 402(a)(1) of the Act, EPA has determined to issue this general permit utilizing best professional judgement (BPJ) to meet the above stated criteria for BAT/BCT described in section 304(b) of the Act. The pH has been defined as a conventional pollutant. A review of the BCT regulations reveals the test cost is inappropriate because: (1) The pH is not adjusted as nothing but heat is added to the discharge and no chemical addition, unless approved by the State of Maine, or treatment is provided, and (2) pH, even though it is a conventional pollutant, is not measured in pounds as the other conventional pollutants. 3. Water Quality Based Effluent Limitations Under Section 301(b)(1)(C) of the Act discharges are subject to effluent limitations based on water quality standards and to the conditions of State certification under section 401 of the Act. Receiving stream requirements are established according to numerical and narrative standards adopted under state and/or federal law for each stream use classification. The CWA requires that EPA obtain State certification which states that all water quality standards will be satisfied. Regulations governing State certification are set forth in 40 CFR ยง124.53 and 124.55. Section 101(a)(3) of the Act specifically prohibits the discharge of toxic pollutants in toxic amounts. The States of Maine, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire have similar narrative criteria in their water quality regulations (See Maine Title 38, Article 4&hyph;A, section 420 and section 464.4.A.(4); Massachusetts 314 CMR 4.05(5)(e); and New Hampshire Part Env-Ws 432.02(c)(4)) that prohibits such discharges. The permit does not allow for the addition of materials or chemicals in amounts which would produce a toxic effect to any aquatic life. Nevertheless, toxic effects may still occur as a result of toxic source water or due to dissolution of the piping in the cooling water systems. Non-contact cooling water discharges do not contain or come in contact with raw materials, intermediate products, finished products, or process wastes. Therefore, it could be assumed that the discharges do not contain toxic or hazardous pollutants or oil and grease. However, based on the previous statement regarding potential source water toxicity, these discharges may violate water quality criteria established for toxic or hazardous pollutants in which case an individual permit would be required. Water quality standards applicable to non-contact cooling water discharges covered by this general permit include pH and temperature. EPA has reviewed the water quality standards for pH and temperature of each of the States and has incorporated the appropriate effluent limitations into each permit.
