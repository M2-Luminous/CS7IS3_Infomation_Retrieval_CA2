About two dozen of China's 55 ethnic minorities live in remote mountain villages in provincial borders between Guangxi, Guangdong, Hunan, Guizhou and Yunnan Provinces, like the Zhuang, Yao, Miao, Dong, Buyi, Shuijia, Maonan, Mulam and Yi. With China becoming market-oriented, these neighboring ethnic people have been convinced that they should work together to lift themselves from poverty instead of wrangling with each other over ownership of land, water conservancy and forests. Encouraged by governments at various levels, ethnic autonomous prefectures in these provinces have formed economic cooperation councils to coordinate economic development. As the neighboring ethnic prefectures belong to different provinces, local highways often did not connect in the past. Since 1985, however, 35 such roads have been built to connect the bordering areas and 45 scheduled passenger and cargo bus routes between different minority areas added. Meanwhile, some 180 markets have been established in 17 neighboring counties. The effort has brought prosperity for the ethnic villages as over 30,000 local ethnic people have turned to business in provincial borders in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region alone. In the face of rapid economic growth, their cooperation has now expanded from agricultural production, to industry, science and technology, commerce, transportation and material supply.
