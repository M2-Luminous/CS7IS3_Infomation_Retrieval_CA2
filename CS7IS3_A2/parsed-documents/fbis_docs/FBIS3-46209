This year the county and township levels should comprehensively promote the public service system; the province and various cities and prerectures should encourage organs to [words indistinct] in line with organizational reform. All cities and prefectures should regard the whole process of promoting the public service system as a process to strengthen the building of government organs and raising the quality of personnel and guarantee the smooth implementation of the public service system. Zhao Zhihao pointed out: The wage reform of organs and institutions has involved the immediate interests of more than 2 million workers and staff members of organs and institutions across the province. We must know the policies well, strictly observe organizational discipline and prevent the people to do things in their own way or to establish new organs. It is necessary to do a good job in conducting in-depth and meticulous ideological and political work. Regarding reform of the insurance system of organs and institutions, the State Council has clearly defined that the personnel departments should take charge of it. Personnel departments at all levels should rapidly issue overall plans for reform of the social security system of organs and institutions in our province and enable the social security work of organs and instituions across the province to become regular and legal.
