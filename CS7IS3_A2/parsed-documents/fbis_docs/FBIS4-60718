Posuvalyuk, who is director general of the Middle East and North African Department in the Russian Foreign Ministry, voiced his country's support for the continuation of peace negotiations. He said that efforts are now focusing on ways to eliminate the obstacles hindering the progress of the peace process. He spoke at the Foreign Ministry, where he met with Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz in the presence of ministry Secretary General Ambassador Zafir al-Hasan; Ambassador Yusuf Arsanyus, director of the foreign minister's office; and Russian Ambassador Gennadiy Ilichev. The Russian president's envoy arrived on the Lebanese-Syrian border point from Damascus before noon today. He will meet tomorrow with Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri before leaving for Amman and then going on to Israel. Responding to reporters' questions at the Foreign Ministry headquarters, Posuvalyuk said: [Begin recording] [Posuvalyuk] I would like to say that my trip to the region was launched on the instructions of President Boris Yeltsin and Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. Such visits usually include two areas: one dealing with bilateral ties and the other with the peace march. To answer your question, we had a candid discussion with his excellency the foreign minister. We discussed details pertaining to the Lebanese track in the peace process. This helped us understand the actual situation on the Lebanese-Israeli track. [Correspondent] Can your tour be viewed as supplementary to the U.S. secretary of state's tour of the region? In other words, do you coordinate with Washington when it comes to submitting certain ideas? [Posuvalyuk] Yes, we constantly coordinate our steps with the American sponsor. [Correspondent] What is your comment on the kidnapping of Mustafa al-Dirani, and does this hinder the peace process? [Posuvalyuk] I can say that we are concerned at what is happening at present. We are discussing this issue with the parties concerned. We believe in the need to eliminate all the causes of increased tension on the Lebanese-Israeli track. This must be based on UN resolutions, primarily Resolution 425. [Correspondent] Do you expect the resumption of talks soon or are there obstacles? [Posuvalyuk] We support the continuation of negotiations. We are discussing ways to eliminate these obstacles. [Correspondent] Have you found during your trip and contacts that it is Israel that is hindering the resumption of negotiations, or is it Arab states? [Posuvalyuk] I said that we are discussing ways to eliminate obstacles hindering progress in the peace process. [Correspondent] [Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq] Al-Shar' asked the cosponsors to condemn al-Dirani's kidnapping. What reaction did that request have in Moscow, and have you conveyed that request to Washington? [Posuvalyuk] I have conveyed that request to Moscow. [Correspondent] What was the reaction? [Posuvalyuk] I conveyed that request to Moscow. [Correspondent] What are the ideas you are proposing to give an impetus to the peace process? [Posuvalyuk] My theory is that if I start to talk about these details, I will erase the dividing line between the reporter and the diplomat. There are reporters and there are diplomats. [Correspondent] What are the general outlines of these ideas? [Posuvalyuk] The general line governing these ideas is that after the parties concerned exchange the required basic assertions, we can get into technical details. We believe that we have reached the stage at which we can discuss technical details, having discussed the general major principles. [Correspondent] At the end of your tour you will visit Israel. Have you promised Minister Buwayz to raise the issue of al-Dirani's kidnapping in Tel Aviv to discuss ways to release him? [Posuvalyuk] I will talk to Israeli officials about the obstacles that still hinder the peace process. [Correspondent] You represent President Yeltsin and Russia, who is a permanent member of the UN Security Council. You are also one of the cosponsors of the peace conference. What is your position on Lebanon's complaint against Israel and its demand for the immediate release of al-Dirani? [Posuvalyuk] As far as I know, the Lebanese request is still under consideration. [Correspondent] Is there not an official comment? [Posuvalyuk] As far as I know, there has been no official reaction. [end recording]
