The system, however, appears to offer little incentive for foreign companies seeking to invest in North Korea on the strength of its cheap labor, as the minimum wage set for foreign-invested firms is much higher than the country's general wage level. Late last year, North Korea's Administrative Council established a labor regulation laying down standard labor practices for foreign-invested firms, according to the Korea Trade Promotion Corp. (KOTRA). The regulation, consisting of 48 articles in eight chapters, provides a minimum wage level and procedures for employing, dismissing and punishing employees and for settling labor disputes at foreign-invested firms. In Article 26, the regulation stipulates that the minimum monthly wage paid by foreign-invested firms shall not be less than 220 won (about 100 U.S. dollars). This minimum wage level for foreign-invested firms compares with monthly pay of 30 to 50 dollars for ordinary North Korean workers and the 73-dollar minimum monthly wage for workers in the free trade zone. KOTRA officials say the higher minimum wage for foreign-invested firms will hinder the Stalinist country's efforts to attract foreign investment. The regulation also provides that joint-venture firms with foreign equity investment shall give priority either to workers of North Korean partner companies or to those recommended by the relevant employment office when they hire workers -- another stumbling block to active foreign investment -- according to the officials. Foreign firms operating in North Korea have previously set working conditions for their employees through negotiations with their North Korean partners or North Korean government authorities.
