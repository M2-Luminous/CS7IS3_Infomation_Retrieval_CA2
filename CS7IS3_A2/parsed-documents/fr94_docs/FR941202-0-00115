FR941202-0-00115 FR941202-0-00011 If EPA disapproves the State's complete corrective program, EPA will be required to apply one of the section 179(b) sanctions on the date 18 months after the effective date of the disapproval, unless prior to that date the State has submitted a revised program and EPA has determined that it corrected the deficiencies that prompted the disapproval. Moreover, if the Administrator finds a lack of good faith on the part of the State, both sanctions under section 179(b) shall apply after the expiration of the 18-month period until the Administrator determines that the State has come into compliance. In all cases, if, six months after EPA applies the first sanction, the State has not submitted a revised program that EPA has determined corrects the deficiencies, a second sanction is required. In addition, discretionary sanctions may be applied where warranted any time after the expiration of an interim approval period if the State has not timely submitted a complete corrective program or EPA has disapproved its submitted corrective program. Moreover, if EPA has not granted full approval to the State program by the expiration of this interim approval and that expiration occurs after November 15, 1995, EPA must promulgate, administer and enforce a Federal permits program for the State upon interim approval expiration. III. Administrative Requirements A. Docket Copies of the State's submittal and other information relied upon for the final interim approval, including public comments on the proposal received and reviewed by EPA, are contained in docket number OR-V&hyph;100 maintained at the EPA Regional Office. The docket is an organized and complete file of information submitted to, or otherwise considered by, EPA in the development of this final interim approval. The docket is available for public inspection at the location listed under the ADDRESSES section of this document. B. Executive Order 12866 The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this action from Executive Order 12866 review. C. Regulatory Flexibility Act EPA's actions under section 502 of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply address operating permits programs submitted to satisfy the requirements of 40 CFR part 70. Because this action does not impose any new requirements, it does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.
