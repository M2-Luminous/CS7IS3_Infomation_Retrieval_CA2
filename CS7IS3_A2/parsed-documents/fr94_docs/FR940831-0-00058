FR940831-0-00058 FR940831-0-00020 40 CFR Part 180 [PP 8F3658/R2076; FRL&hyph;4907&hyph;2] RIN 2070&hyph;AB78 Pesticide Tolerances for Triasulfuron AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This document extends the tolerances for residues of the herbicide triasulfuron [3-(6-methoxy-4-methyl-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)-1-(2-chloro ethoxy) phe nyl sul fonyl) urea] in or on barley and wheat grain at 0.02 part per million (ppm); barley and wheat straw at 2.0 ppm; barley and wheat forage at 5.0 ppm; meat, fat and meat byproducts (excluding kidney) of cattle, goats, hogs, horses, and sheep; kidney of cattle, goats, hogs, horses, and sheep at 0.2 ppm; and milk at 0.02 ppm. The Agency has not completed the regulatory assessment of its science findings; therefore, EPA is proposing to extend these tolerances for 1 year. EFFECTIVE DATE: This regulation becomes effective August 31, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written objections, identified by the document control number, [PP 8F3658/R2076], may be submitted to: Hearing Clerk (1900), Environmental Protection Agency, Rm. M3708, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. A copy of any objections and hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be identified by the document control number and submitted to: Public Response and Program Resources Branch, Field Operations Division (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460.

Fees accompanying objections shall be labeled ``Tolerance Petition Fees'' and forwarded to: EPA Headquarters Accounting Operations Branch, OPP (Tolerance Fees), P.O. Box 360277M, Pittsburgh, PA 15251. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: By mail: Robert J. Taylor, Product Manager (PM) 25, Registration Division (7505C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: Rm. 241, 1921 Jefferson Davis Hwy., Arlington, VA 22202, (703)-305-6800. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the Federal Register of July 13, 1994 (59 FR 35663), EPA issued a proposed rule that gave notice that the Ciba-Geigy Corp. had submitted all the required data to establish permanent tolerances for triasulfuron under 40 CFR 180.459. Because EPA has not completed the regulatory assessment of its scientific findings, EPA proposed to amend 40 CFR 180.459 to extend the expiration date for the tolerances until March 13, 1996. There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the proposed rule. The data submitted on the proposal and other relevant material have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed rule. Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes that the extended tolerances will protect the public health. Therefore, the extended tolerances are established as set forth below. Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the Federal Register, file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20). A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR 180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector (40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor, taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32). Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore not subject to OMB review. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the Federal Register of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).
