The application must be received by the local HUD Field Office no later than 4 p.m. (local time) on the deadline date listed in the application kit. In the interest of fairness to all competing applicants, any application that is received after the deadline date will be considered ineligible. Applicants should take this practice into account and make early submission of their materials to avoid any risk of loss of eligibility brought about by unanticipated delays or other delivery-related problems. HUD will date-stamp incoming applications to evidence (timely or late) receipt, and, upon request, will provide an acknowledgement of receipt. Facsimile and telegraphic applications are not authorized and will not be considered.
