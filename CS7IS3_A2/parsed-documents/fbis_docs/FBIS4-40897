This document empowers the Russian Interior Ministry, the Federal Counter-espionage Service and the provisional administration forces from the russian defence ministry, to take measures to prevent armed clashes between hostile sides, to ensure the safety of civilians and the strict observance of the emergency rules and regulations. According to Yevgeniy Abramov, the Russian presidential decree on the return of refugees and Russian Federation Government decisions to implementing the decree must be carried out. However, refugees should not be simply returned to their villages, but their security and normal living conditions should also be ensured. The minister expressed concern over the large quantity of arms possessed by the population, and over the activities of unlawful armed formations, which are trying to destabilize the situation and undermine the implementation of the Russian presidential decree.
