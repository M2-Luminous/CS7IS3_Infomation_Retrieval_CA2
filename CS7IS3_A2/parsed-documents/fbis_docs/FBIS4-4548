For 26 years to 1988, Myanmar had shut out the world and attempted to pursue a self-sufficient "Burmese Way to Socialism. But it realised eventually that ideological purity does not translate readily into the material progress a country and its people need, and Myanmar has in the last few years been crawling out of its hermit shell. But the world, particularly the West, has not rolled out a welcome-back mat. Instead, regular efforts are made at the United Nations to get the world body to condemn Myanmar and decree sanctions against it for its repressive political regime and human rights abuses. Singapore and its ASEAN neighbours believe, however, that "constructive engagement" rather than the cold shoulder will yield better results. The way to get Myanmar onto the path of democracy is to encourage it as it takes tentative steps into the free world. And the carrot is foreign investment, for this is what Myanmar's leaders know they need -- and need very badly -- to rebuild the country's crumbling infrastructure and economy. Myanmar is trying very hard to lure investors and visitors. Where previously foreigners would be lucky to get a 24-hour visa, Myanmar has now thrown open its doors. Visitors are coming in increasing numbers, but the passenger traffic at Yangon's [Rangoon] airport is nothing like that at airports in Vietnam and China, the other socialist states now embracing the capitalist way of life. One reason is the intense competition for foreign funds from not only these emerging economies of China and Vietnam, but also countries like Indonesia and India. These places offer more attractive investment incentives than Myanmar. And many a businessman exploring Myanmar's potential has been put off by the red-tape, the lack of infrastructure, and its most unrealistic foreign exchange rate. Many investors, especially from the West, are staying away because of the human rights issue. Some who did venture in are leaving. American oil giant Amoco recently closed its operations after sinking more than US$100 million [Singapore dollar] (S$151 million) looking for oil. Officially, the reason is failure to find oil. Unofficially, Amoco shareholders want out because of Myanmar's human rights record. Which brings us to a critical part of the development equation: Myanmar will have to show more progress on the political front if it hopes to attract the foreign investments it needs. In his talks with Myanmar's leaders, Mr Goh urged them to take steps to be more open and "return to normalcy", by which he meant Myanmar should become more like the countries of ASEAN with their democratic elections. He added that his impression is that while the leaders recognise this need, they will take the necessary steps at their own pace. Those steps have to be cautious because Myanmar's leaders have, for instance, to find ways to bridge the problematical ethnic divisions in the country. But take the steps Myanmar must, and sooner rather than later. The arguments put forth by ASEAN for constructive engagement will ring hollow if Myanmar is not seen to be responding appropriately to the growing foreign investor interest. It is up to Myanmar to show a sceptical world that constructive engagement works.
