The central administration and the localities have separated their management functions, and localities have expanded their competence in terms of finance, capital, investments and foreign trade. With the implementation of the policy enabling localities to be responsible for their finances, namely "dividing revenue and expenditure between the central administration and localities, and holding each responsible for balancing their budgets," the previous practice of "eating from the same kitchen" has been changed into "eating from separate kitchens." This has embodied the idea exactly. The expansion of localities' economic competence has aroused their enthusiasm for developing the economy, and has changed the situation in which local economic development and structural adjustment are completely controlled by the central mandatory plans and incremental investments [zeng liang tou zi 1073 6852 2121 6327]. This has changed the passive state of localities having to wait for, rely on and look to the central administration to promote local construction. All this has promoted local economic development in an unprecedented fashion, and has set off an upsurge of construction the like of which never occurred in the past. However, owing to the fact that when the central administration "delegates power and yields profits," when macroscopic constraint mechanisms, and a system to govern interest relationships has not been established, various localities' responsibilities do not conform with their power and interests. Under such circumstances, localities were prompted to distort price signals, and maximize their interests. They vied with one another to invest in high-price and huge-profit processing industries. They repeatedly imported items and carried out construction projects one after another. This happened everywhere. As a result, the proportion of the processing industry in the total output value of industrial production increased from 38.1 percent in 1982 to 43.9 percent in 1988. In recent years, although the central administration has strengthened its regulation and control to a certain extent, the changes in proportion have not yet proved ideal. Consequently, areas producing resources and are separated from processing zones, and various areas have developed the same kind of operational setups. The local industrial structure situation was tending toward the same pattern became increasingly serious. This triggered off local economic frictions and coincident market fluctuations. There occurred an "economy of feudal princes" [zhu hou jing ji 6175 0186 4842 3444], characterized by scrambling for natural resources and imposing trade blockades on one another. Thus the efficiency of natural resource disposition was greatly reduced. In addition, the central administration had increasingly weaker capability in concentrating its financial and material resources, but its burdens were very heavy. It was unable to invest in basic facilities projects, which needed huge amounts of investment and longer periods of time for completion. The development of basic industries and infrastructure projects -- including energy, raw and processed materials, communications and transportation, and so on -- lagged far behind the development of processing industry. This aggravated the imbalanced structure of supply and demand in the national economy. In particular, our railways, which undertake the main transport task, were heavily overloaded to maintain a normal transport situation. It is obvious that the deep root of these chaotic phenomena in the sustained development of the national economy, and the increasingly serious conflicts among energy, raw and processed materials, and processing industry, in particular, lies in improper handling of the relations between the central administration and localities. So what is to be done? Should we return to the previous traditional system, in which the central administration exercised rigid control over the localities? Or take a laissez-faire attitude toward the present situation? In his "On the Ten Major Relationships," Comrade Mao Zedong said: To build a powerful socialist country, it is imperative to have a strong and unified central leadership, and unified planning and discipline throughout the country. Disruption of this indispensable unity is impermissible. At the same time, it is essential to bring the initiative of local authorities into full play, and to let each locality enjoy what is particularity suited to its local conditions. Since the differences between various localities in China in terms of natural, social, and cultural conditions, and the level of economic development are so great, it is impossible to demand conformity in everything. There is obviously a dualistic structure in the coastal area, the interior, the southeast, the northwest, in urban and rural areas, and developed and backward regions. Furthermore, our commodity economy and domestic markets are not developed, and the proportions of natural and seminatural economies still are fairly high. This has decided that we need a unified planning and program to organize local economic operations effectively. In the meantime, we must not neglect regional differences that objectively exist, or the local interests caused by such differences. Therefore, in the process of deepening our reforms in the future, we must handle well the relationship between the central administration and the localities. On the one hand, we must continue to arouse the enthusiasm of localities for economic development and must maintain their economic vigor. On the other hand, while further transforming enterprise operational mechanisms and cultivating the market system in order to strengthen local economic capabilities, the central administration will increase the weight of macroeconomic regulation and control, with emphasis on finance, tax, monetary matters, investments, the planning system, and so on, so as to prevent anarchy in economic operations, or an economy of feudal princes.
