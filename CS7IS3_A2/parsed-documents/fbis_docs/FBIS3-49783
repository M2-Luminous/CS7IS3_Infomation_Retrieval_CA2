These were the words of Vitaliy Churkin, the Russian president's special envoy, after his talks with Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic. This is Tihomir Vinkovic reporting for Croatian radio news from Geneva. Churkin believes that tomorrow's meeting of all interested sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina must bring progress. However, it is too optimistic to expect that the agreement will be signed tomorrow, Churkin said. He believes that the talks should go along the line of the EU [European Union] proposal. Too much effort and time have been invested to introduce fundamental changes at this point, Churkin believes. Unfortunately, there are still forces that want war. Churkin said that President Tudjman's proposal, brought up in Bonn, was interesting, especially the part concerning access to the sea. The Russian Federation obviously supports the EU's stance, and, judging by the news from Moscow, so does America. The behavior of the Muslim side is in complete contravention of the European Twelve's stance. Their response to the peace initiative is negative. The opinion prevails that the Muslims would like the UN Security Council to take over the negotiations, which both the EU and America oppose. The problem is a European one, and consequently it should be dealt with in Europe, Croatian Minister Mate Granic said. An absolute cease-fire should come into effect in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and a political solution should be found in line with the EU's proposal. This is Croatia's stand, about which Vitaliy Churkin has been informed.
