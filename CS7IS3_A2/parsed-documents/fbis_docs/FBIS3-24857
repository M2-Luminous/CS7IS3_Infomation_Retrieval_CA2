Speaking to the daily, the top Air Force official referred to the last Friday's Turkish air assault on Iranian border areas and noted that the attack was not aimed at Iranian territory as the Islamic Republic forces were in full control of the borders. "It was by mistake that the Turkish missile landed in Iranian territory and 28 of our citizens were martyred or injured," Sattari said, "No Turkish fighter plane entered Iranian territory,... The Turkish pilots were not experienced or mature enough to avoid the tragedy." The general also denied reports that the Turkish planes violated Iran's airspace and said that the recent incident occured because Iran's residential areas were too close to the borders. Gen. Sattari also stated that the Air Force at the moment was totally freed from its previous intense dependence on the U.S. and that it was not only run by an all-Iranian personnel, but also provided educational services to some of the Islamic countries. As for the Persian Gulf security, the paper quoted the official as saying "we are not appalled by the presence of foreign warships in the region, in fact we are fully ready to counter any suspicious move and our warplanes are at all times guarding the country's airspace." Commenting on the post-war reconstruction of the Air Force, he said that the reconstruction had reached completion. The goal of self-sufficiency, he said, was now within the reach of the Air Force. The Air Force experience in achieving self-sufficiency could serve as a model for other governmental bodies, he said. Earlier in the day, Sattari visited the Air Force exhibition in which the latest achievements of different divisions within the Air Force were put on display.
