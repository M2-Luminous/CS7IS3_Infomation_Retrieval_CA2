Korean Students" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, April 20 (KCNA) -- Students in Seoul and Kwangju, South Korea, staged fierce demonstrations Tuesday in protest against the arrival of Patriot missiles at Pusan port and U.S. Defence Secretary William Perry's Seoul trip. The demonstrators in Seoul marched to the U.S. Embassy, breaking through the close encirclement of the police, and shouted anti-American slogans with a placard reading "We Hate The Patriot. We Hate Perry." Some 500 students affiliated with the Kwangju-South Cholla Province Federation of General Student Councils demonstrated in front of "the American Cultural Centre" in Kwangju. They threw more than 200 paint bottles at the building, branding Perry's Seoul trip and the deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea as criminal acts increasing the danger of war. The puppet clique mobilized a large force of riot police to harshly suppress the protesters. The students, however, continued the demonstration, chanting slogans urging the withdrawal of the U.S. imperialist aggression troops from South Korea.
