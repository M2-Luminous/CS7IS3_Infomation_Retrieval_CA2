The EU's proposal in the field of agriculture was also completely unacceptable to Finland: "Only 5 percent of agricultural production would be covered," Under Secretary of State Veli Sundback said. Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto said that the criteria for receiving agricultural support are so numerous and wide-ranging that Finland cannot accept the proposal, but will return with a counterbid at the weekend after careful study. In some areas, however, Haavisto was able to note forward movement. A special protocol protecting the Lapps' way of life was accepted by the EU. Foreigners will be granted the right to buy leisure homes in Finland. The issue of herring fishing in the Baltic Sea has also been resolved. This means that EU citizens will be able to fish herring for use as mink and fox food, with a promise of a review and an investigation of herring stocks after three years. However, the issue of regulations covering travelers remains to be resolved.
