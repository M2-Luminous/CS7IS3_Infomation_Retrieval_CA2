Here is an initial "who's who" of the Second Republic. Initially, Irene Pivetti was expected to become leader in the Chamber of Deputies and Carlo Scognamiglio in the Senate, but now--with the cabinet being formed, and given the alternation in every area that the principles of alternation require--the presence of new faces and unexpected personages promises, in a sense, to become the rule rather than the exception during this transition from the First Republic to the Second. Within a few weeks the pictures of a defeated (and often not excessively old) nomenklatura will disappear from the Palazzo walls and be replaced by the definitely younger faces of the victors--of a smiling Silvio Berlusconi, a sullen Umberto Bossi, and a stern Gianfranco Fini. This will attest to the fact that the advent of the new political class is accompanied by a revolution that even has an anthropological aspect and seems destined to lay siege--in concentric circles--to the entire hierarchy of power in the public administration, the banks, industry and finance, the press and television, the judiciary, and the police. A downright morbid curiosity has developed with respect to the selection of the new key figures in the government, beginning with the ministers who will be part of a still hypothetical Berlusconi cabinet. All the newspapers constructed and published--over a period of days--their own hypothetical organization charts. Were these lists either right or wrong? The leader of Forza Italia has dismissed them with the comment, "They are fantasies." In his opinion, these lists of cabinet ministers were wrong on two counts. First, they appeared to have been compiled using the Cencelli manual and a logic--based on a new version of the patronage system--that the Knight [Berlusconi] finds intolerable; moreover, they did not at all have either the appearance or the substance of an administration of the Milan [Berlusconi's soccer club] type, that is to say, a victorious administration composed of outstanding individuals, which is his supreme desire. "Organizing a good team will take time," Berlusconi cautioned, "all the time that is necessary." His words surprised no one who is aware of Berlusconi's convictions and of his modus operandi. Berlusconi is a tenacious advocate of the free-market economic theory known as "self-fulfilling prophecies" [preceding two words in English], that is to say, "prophecies that become true by dint of believing them." It is a principle that when translated into action means setting for oneself, from time to time, a great strategic objective--a goal that is increasingly ambitious--and then striving with all one's energies and those of one's team solely to attain it. From all appearances, this is also the way Berlusconi built his fortune: first with the model urban districts, then as a TV entrepreneur, then as a publisher, and finally as president of the Milan soccer club. If this is the logic employed, one can understand why Berlusconi wants only outstanding individuals for his cabinet, chosen freely as provided for by the Constitution. An example? His most ambitious goal is to convince Antonio Di Pietro--the magistrate most beloved by the Italians--to accept the post of interior minister. Although the initial indications in response were not encouraging, Berlusconi has not given up. Is Di Pietro too heavily involved in the final stages of the Cusani trial? No problem: the Knight immediately made it known that the government will not be formed overnight. His principal supporter in making this choice is Fini, who has always maintained good relations with the judge, who is the symbol of Operation Clean Hands. For this reason Giuseppe Tatarella, one of the leaders of the National Alliance [AN], took the field with an explicit invitation: "Di Pietro," he says, "is one of the founding fathers of the Second Republic, and we are now asking him to help build it. It is a choice that should be made from the perspective of history rather than that of the daily news columns." While waiting for a "yes" from Di Pietro, the Knight has already obtained one from from two high-ranking civil servants: Lamberto Dini, general manager of the Bank of Italy, and Andrea Monorchio, the government's chief accountant. The post of treasury minister awaits Dini, who is perhaps better known and esteemed abroad than in Italy (before joining the board of directors of the central bank--where his relations with Carlo Azeglio Ciampi have been difficult--he was for almost 20 years an IMF executive). This was confirmed on several occasions by Dini himself in recent discussions with his European colleagues in St. Petersburg during the meeting of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The only obstacle which could derive from the economic program that the government coalition plans to implement. "There must not be even the smallest recrudescence of an inflationary spiral," Dini said. "Otherwise, I will never accept." Dini's appointment, however, can be viewed as a certainty, to judge from certain programmatic suggestions that Dini himself has made to his interlocutors. First, complete disclosure of the actual accounts of the state, where the gap left by the Ciampi administration is reportedly much greater than the official figures. Second, the immediate resumption investment in major public works projects and simultaneous simplification of the attendant procedures. For example, a model for granting concessions that has been successful in the United States could be adopted in Italy: namely, allowing the firm that carries out a public works project to profit from its operation for a period of 30 years before it is transferred to the state. This model could be applied--in conjunction with a large-scale mobilization of private savings--to two major projects: a high-speed railroad system, with a spin-off of 50,000 new jobs, and a bridge over the Strait of Messina--an infrastructure that could virtually ensure to the Berlusconi administration its place in history. A novice in politics, Berlusconi in recent days has made no secret of the fact that he is also somewhat lacking in expertise in bureaucratic matters. And because the reorganization of the office of prime minister allocated great powers to what had previously been merely the government's "chief notarial office," this particular shortcoming of his must be remedied forthwith. Within the Knight's entourage the word is that the best solution would be the appointment of Andrea Monorchio as secretary-general to the office of prime minister, inasmuch as Monorchio is esteemed not only for his levelheadedness but above all for his exceptional knowledge of the actual accounts of the state. Berlusconi reportedly would like to appoint Gianni Letta, vice president of Fininvest Communications and his longtime political adviser, to serve with him in Palazzo Chigi [office of the prime minister] in a role of institutional importance and trust (i.e., undersecretary to the office of the prime minister). The appointment--which Letta has attempted gracefully to avoid and which has also reportedly elicited some resistance on the part of Fedele Confalonieri, who is reluctant to deprive himself of a key executive of the firm--has already been submitted to the legal experts for an analysis of all possible implications, inasmuch as Letta is in fact not a member of parliament, although this would appear not to be an obstacle. If it proves to be, Letta could be given a different post: for example, that of first private secretary to the prime minister. With Dini on board, the troika of economic ministers will probably be rounded out by the appointment of Giulio Tremonti as finance minister and Giancarlo Pagliarini as budget minister (the ministry was explicitly requested by the Northern League). Although Tremonti was elected on Mario Segni's Pact [Patto] ticket, he has never shared Segni's stubborn position that led the referendum leader [Segni] to side with the opposition to the Knight. Indeed, Tremonti's federalist theories on taxation--which came to light at an unexpected moment--make him a valuable hinge for linking together the allies of the Freedom Alliance with a view to reconciling the federalism that the League insists should apply even to tax matters, on the one hand, with the drastic reduction of the IRPEI [personal income tax] rate that Forza Italia and the AN are requesting. Nothing has been decided with respect to the other so-called series a cabinet ministries (such as foreign affairs, defense, justice, and posts), despite the numerous organization charts provided by the newspapers. A poll conducted by Gianni Pilo's Diakron (to which Berlusconi has always paid close attention) disclosed that Italians would like to see in the government--in addition to Di Pietro--prominent individuals such as Gianni Agnelli, Romano Prodi, and Umberto Veronesi. To take this poll into account would mean wiping out the hopes of many aspiring ministerial candidates, especially those who are closest to Berlusconi. Indeed, the League and the AN are unlikely to renounce their goal of restructuring their representation in the executive branch. Change will come not only to the government, however. Among the nerve centers of power that will be effected by change are the banking and financial system, which has always been of strategic importance. No one has any doubts as to who the victors are in this sector. The first is Enrico Cuccia, 84 years of age, the honorary president of Mediobanca [Financial Credit Bank], listed by many observers two or three years ago as among the losers, inasmuch as the separation of Mediobanca from Comit [Italian Commercial Bank] and Credit [Italian Credit Bank] threatened to shut off the financial spigots that had always enabled him to carry out his projects. But the "little man of steel" did not lose heart: he devised a strategy for the reconquest of Comit and Credit, and in spite of his most tenacious adversary--IRI [Institute for Industrial Reconstruction] President Romano Prodi--he succeeded in reconquering them, thanks to privatization. The result is almost incredible: Mediobanca is today the most authoritative and credible hinge linking the old and the new--between an old in which the only ones who counted were the great families under Cuccia's care, and a new in which--thanks to the privatization of the public banks--certain entrepreneurs who have become prominent stockholders of Credit and Comit are coming on stage, such as Diego Della Valle, Leonardo Del Vecchio, Steno Marcegaglia, Lionello Adler, and Vito Gnutti--the latter wearing two hats, the one of an entrepreneur-stockholder in Credit and the other of a League deputy who is being considered for a post in the cabinet. This list can be enlarged to include the leaders of the small and medium-sized manufacturers who took part in the recent convention of the Verona chapter of Confindustria [General Confederation of Italian Industry]: leading figures such as Massimo Zanetti and Paolo Rovagnati, or Giorgio Panto, who is working on Project Azzurro [Blue], an association that will be an alternative to the old Confindustria nomenklatura. Other events serve to confirm the fact that Mediobanca has again become the crossroads of the nation's financial activity. After years of incommunicability, Fininvest--of which Berlusconi is still the owner--has entrusted Cuccia's people with the Mondadori sale. And Maurizio Gasparri, the AN's chief economic adviser, has asked the government to give greater consideration to those banking operations that relate to the divestitures and specifically those of Mediobanca, which alleges that it has heretofore been placed at a disadvantage vis-a-vis the foreign merchant banks [preceding two words in English]. The list of victorious bankers includes the names--in addition to Cuccia's--of Mediobanca's allies, and in particular those of Luigi Fausti of Comit; Lucio Rondelli, back in the saddle at Credit; and Pellegrino Capaldo and Cesare Geronzi of the Bank of Rome. As for the losers--who had bet on an election victory of the center-left coalition--many of them are pointing the finger at Giovanni Bazoli, president of the Sao Paolo Bank of Brescia. "When Berlusconi entered politics," his enemies say resentfully, "Bazoli's initial reaction was to demand that the loans made to Fininvest be called." Some are predicting the triumphal return to Via Filodrammatici [Mediobanca headquarters] of Antonio Maccanico--undersecretary to the office of the prime minister during the Ciampi administration--who would replace Francesco Cingano as the bank's president, a post he previously held. Some say that among those making this prediction is Maurizio Romiti, a top manager [preceding word in English] at Mediobanca, who is regarded as one of the most unenthusiastic supporters of the theory that his father [Cesare Romiti]--the managing director at FIAT -- should be dragged in to fill the post. In Milan, a rumor is making the rounds of the more important suites to the effect that Cesare Romiti--after having for 15 years had a major impact on the operations of FIAT -- is about to hand over the controls at Corso Marconi [FIAT headquarters] to Paolo Cantarella--a generational change that for Romiti senior should not at all mean retirement, for rumor says that as an alternative to the Mediobanca job, he could become president of Montedison. A shock wave is also expected to hit the sector of the state-owned enterprises, foremost among which are the IRI [Institute for Industrial Reconstruction] and the ENI [National Hydrocarbons Corporation]. A particular Chinese metaphor is popular with the Freedom Alliance, to wit: It does not matter what color a cat is; the important thing is that it catch the mice. As if to say: Let no preconceived policy be applied to capable managers, provided they agree to implement the government program. IRI President Romano Prodi, however, has already decided to resign as soon as the new government takes office; then, if he is invited to remain, he will weigh the pros and cons. ENI Managing Director Franco Bernabe will in all probability do likewise. Meanwhile, there are those who venture to predict who the new strong men will be: Lorenzo Necci, the lord of high-speed transportation, a key element in the future government program; former IRI Vice President Pietro Armani, author of the AN's economic program, who has been mentioned for the top post at STET [Turin Telephone Finance Company]; Ernesto Pascale, candidate for the top post at Telecom Italia; Fabiano Fabiani, whose diligent performance in the construction of the new Finmeccanica [Mechanical Engineering Finance Corporation] was judged favorably by the League; IRI General Manager Enrico Micheli and Vincenzo Dettori, who distinguished themselves in connection with the privatization already carried out by the IRI; Renato Cassaro of Fintecna, an expert practicioner of downsizing; and Roberto Schisano, who became managing director of Alitalia following a successful career with Texas Instruments. And there are those who predict that one of the present ENI managers [preceding word in English]--Carlo Da Molo, formerly of Italgas [Italian Gas Company]--will be recycled. On the labor union front, hard times are predicted for the top leadership respectively of the CGIL [Italian General Confederation of Labor], CISL [Italian Confederation of Trade Unions], and UIL [Italian Federation of Trade Unions], all of whom before the election were committed opponents of the Freedom Alliance. On the launching pad, however, is the ISA [expansion not given], a new federation that groups together 10 independent unions--headed by CISNAL [Italian Confederation of National Trade Unions], CISAL [Italian Confederation of Independent Trade Unions], CIMO [Italian Confederation of Hospital Doctors], CONFSAL [Confederation of Autonomous Trade Unions], and DIRSTAL [National Association of Executives of the Civil Service])--with a total membership of 6 million and new leaders [preceding word in English]: Gaetano Cerioli, Mauro Nobilia, and Rosy Mauro. In spite of those who for years have been writing him off, the position of the chief of police, Vincenzo Parisi, is deemed to be "static." Working in his favor are reportedly not only his friendship with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro but also his thorough knowledge of the intelligence services, with whose top officials the progressive coalition had developed positive relations during the Ciampi administration but conflictual relations with Parisi himself. Last but not least [preceding four words in English], there is the political chapter that is perhaps the most sensitive of all: the press and TV. The new antitrust [preceding word in English] law--which has been invoked by several parties--will bring profound changes that no one is able to foresee. Many, however, are predicting the departure from the scene of Eugenio Scalfari--just turned 70--the most famous of the newspaper editors who lined up with the progressives and the center. Some even indicate 1 September as the date of his departure and Ezio Mauro--currently the editor in chief of STAMPA--as his most likely successor. Bossi's Key People 1. Roberto Maroni, 39.
