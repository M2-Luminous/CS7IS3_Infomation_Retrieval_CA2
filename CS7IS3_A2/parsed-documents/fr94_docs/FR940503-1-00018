FR940503-1-00018 FR940503-1-00005 SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION 17 CFR Part 240 [Release No. 34&hyph;33965; File No. S7&hyph;3&hyph;94] RIN 3235&hyph;AG03 Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements for Trading Systems Operated by Brokers and Dealers AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission. ACTION: Extension of comment period. SUMMARY: The Securities and Exchange Commission is extending the date by which comments must be received on proposed rule 17a&hyph;23 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') from April 19, 1994 to May 19, 1994. The proposed rule would establish recordkeeping and reporting requirements for broker-dealer sponsors of certain automated securities trading systems (``broker-dealer trading systems'' or ``BDTSs''). DATES: Comments should be received on or before May 19, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be submitted in triplicate and addressed to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street NW., Mail Stop 6&hyph;9, Washington D.C. 20549. Comment letters should refer to File No. S7&hyph;3&hyph;94. All comment letters received will be made available for public inspection and copying in the Commission's Public Reference Room, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Gordon K. Fuller, Special Counsel, Sheila C. Slevin, Branch Chief, or Kristen N. Geyer, Attorney Advisor, 202/942&hyph;0794 or 202/942&hyph;0792. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On February 9, 1994, the Commission published proposed rule 17a&hyph;23 under the Act. 1 The proposal would establish a uniform recordkeeping and reporting structure for broker-dealer sponsors of broker-dealer trading systems, requiring those broker-dealer sponsors to make available to the Commission and the appropriate self-regulatory organization (``SRO''), system-specific information about activity occurring in those systems. The Commission is extending the comment period on the proposal from April 19, 1994 to May 19, 1994 in order to receive the benefit of comments from the greatest possible number of interested persons. 1 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33605 (February 9, 1994), 59 FR 8368 (February 18, 1994). The proposal raises a number of complex issues with respect to the regulation of broker-dealer trading systems, including the consistency of the proposal with the policies underlying the Act and the appropriate scope of the requirements imposed under the proposal. The Commission has received only two comments on the proposal to date. Accordingly, the Commission is concerned that the current comment period may not permit interested persons sufficient time to address these issues in a thorough manner. 2 Moreover, the lack of a sufficient volume of comments to comprise an adequate record potentially undermines the quality of any determination the Commission ultimately may make with respect to the proposal. 3 Accordingly, in order to receive the benefit of comments from the greatest possible number of interested persons, the Commission is extending the comment period on the proposal from April 19, 1994 to May 19, 1994. 2 A number of potential commenters have called the staff to inquire whether the Commission will extend the comment period. 3 The Commission's experience with proposed rule 15c2&hyph;10 under the Act, which the Commission recently withdrew (Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33621 [February 14, 1994], 59 FR 8379), indicates that an extension of time may assist interested persons in formulating their views and help ensure that the Commission is provided with an adequate record. Proposed rule 15c2&hyph;10 would have established a comprehensive regulatory framework for certain automated securities trading systems that are not operated as facilities of national securities exchanges or associations. The Commission twice extended the comment period on proposed rule 15c2&hyph;10, for a total of 45 days (from June 19 to August 2, 1989). The Commission received 17 comments on its proposal. However, only five of those 17 comments were received during the initial comment period; the remaining 12 comments were submitted during the subsequent 45-day extended period. If the same pattern holds with respect to the current proposal, extension of the comment period could provide the Commission with a substantial number of additional comments upon which to base its determination. Dated: April 26, 1994. By the Commission. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;10540 Filed 5&hyph;2&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 8010&hyph;01&hyph;M
