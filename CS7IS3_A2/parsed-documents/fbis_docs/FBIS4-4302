FBIS4-4302 "dreas062_c_94005" FBIS-EAS-94-062 Daily Report 30 Mar 1994 North Korea SPA Statement Blasts South for Blocking Visits SPA Statement Blasts South for Blocking Visits SK3003152094 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1335 GMT 30 Mar 94 SK3003152094 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1335 GMT 30 Mar 94 Korean BFN [Text] In connection with the fact that the South Korean authorities' obstruction maneuvers have blocked [chadan] former presidents and premiers and high-ranking politicians of various countries of the world from visiting Pyongyang through Panmunjom, a spokesman for the Reunification Policy Committee of the DPRK Supreme People's Assembly [SPA], on 30 March, issued the following press statement [tamhwa]: Press statement by a spokesman for the Reunification Policy Committee of the DPRK SPA: At a time when numerous envoys of friendship from the five continents of the world are continuously visiting our country with the festive day of April [Kim Il-song birthday] on the horizon, former presidents and premiers and high-ranking politicians of various countries of the world who had attended the Second World Peace Conference expressed their hope to us a while ago that they would visit Pyongyang through Panmunjom. They were approximately 100 distinguished political activists from various continents of the world: They include approximately 30 former heads of state or government of various countries, including former Costa Rican Presidents Rodrigo Carazo and Mario Echandi, former Sudanese President Abdel Rahman Sowar el Dahab, former Sudanese Premier El Katim el Kalifa, former Zambian President Kenneth David Kaunda, former Guyanese President Desmond Hoyte, and former Canadian Governor General Edward Schreyer. They also include current and former high-ranking politicians from India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Thailand, and other Asian countries; Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan, and other Middle East countries; France, Spain, Norway, and other European countries; and Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Latin American countries. They also include high-ranking politicians from the United States. This large high-level foreign peace delegation expressed its intention to visit Pyongyang, know better the reality of our country, and extend their support to and solidarity with our people's efforts for peace in the country and its reunification. We made preparations to receive them as envoys of peace and friendship and had our side's area of Panmunjom opened. We did so because we treasure peace on the Korean peninsula and its peaceful reunification and welcome the intention of the former presidents and premiers and renowned high-ranking politicians from various countries and their activities for peace in the world. However, the foreign delegation's visit to Pyongyang through Panmunjom could not take place because of the South Korean authorities' obstruction. At the 28 March Panmunjom contact of joint duty officers [jigilgwan] of the Military Armistice Commission, the opposing side [taebang] said that the foreign delegation's plan to visit Pyongyang through Panmunjom had been canceled. At a news conference that was held in Seoul prior to this, the foreign delegation announced that they could not visit Pyongyang because the South side did not approve of the visit and expressed its dismay and regret for this. They also told us that they were very thankful for the DPRK for inviting them to visit Pyongyang through Panmunjom and extending kind hospitality to them and that there would surely come an opportunity for them to pay such visits. We cannot but think that it is regrettable that the large high-level foreign delegation for peace in the world could not visit Pyongyang. The South Korean authorities prevented the foreign delegation from visiting Pyongyang by blocking [pongswae] the South side's area of Panmunjom. This is an uncourteous act lacking international courtesy or morality [kukchejok yeuido todokto morunun muryehan haengwi]. The South Korean authorities prevented the approximately 100 former presidents and premiers and renowned high-ranking politicians from visiting Pyongyang. This cannot be construed otherwise than an act of restraining the intention of the foreign delegation and its activities for peace in the world. The just activities for independence, peace, and friendship by the dignitaries of the world must be respected as a matter of course. They blocked the world peace delegation, not the dissidents [pancheje insa] who are restricted [kyujedoen] under South Korea's National Security Law, from even passing through Panmunjom under an unjustifiable pretext. This shows the National Security Law is fully applied [kudaero chogyongdoego] to foreign envoys, as well. What cannot be overlooked with regard to the South Korean authorities' recent act is an act of wrongfully misusing [kuruttoege agyong] the visit to Pyongyang by the foreign delegation in North-South confrontation. As has already been known, the South Korean authorities unilaterally broke up [kyollyol] the contact of working-level delegates for the exchange of top-level special envoys of the North and South, froze all North-South dialogue, and are bringing the situation to the brink of war. The South Korean authorities had kicked up large-scale commotions with regard to southward aggression [namchimsodongul taedaejoguro irukyo], thus making people uneasy; made public a plan on a war of northward aggression called New Operation Plan 5027; and openly cried for achieving reunification after prevailing over communism. They more loudly babbled [ttodurotta] about this [achieving reunification after prevailing over communism] when foreign delegations' visits to Pyongyang resumed. As was shown, they created an extreme crisis in the situation [kuktanhan chongsejok wigi] in the face of the foreign envoys and asked them to cancel their plans to pass through Panmunjom and visit Pyongyang under the pretext of such a crisis. This is a disgusting, mean act [hyomogamul chaanaenun]. With regard to this, voices of denunciation are raised among media at home and abroad, including an English-language paper, THE ASIAN WALL STREET JOURNAL. Reporting that the South Korean authorities are at a loss because the issue of the large foreign peace delegation's visit to Pyongyang was raised [namchoson tanggukchaduli taekyumoui oeguk pyonghwa sajoltanui pyongyang pangmun munjega chegidoende taehayo maeu tanghokhae hagoittago hamyonso]. The papers wrote that South Korea's national unification minister hastily canceled its permission for the international delegations' visit to Pyongyang, changing its former stance. The papers exposed that the national unification minister's negative stance created an obstacle to the plan by the delegation--which is made up of former heads of state, politicians, and policymakers--to visit Pyongyang by crossing the Military Demarcation Line. It is a matter of course that the world's fair media will protest the South Korean authorities' rude acts of blocking the foreign peace delegation's visit to Pyongyang as disregarding basic international manners. The South Korean authorities blocked the foreign peace delegation's visit to Pyongyang for another reason: They were afraid that the quite different realities of the North and the South would be known to the world public. If the delegation had visited Pyongyang, it would have clearly seen that, under Korean-style socialism centered on the popular masses where the leader, the party, and the masses are single-heartedly united, all the people are leading an independent and creative happy life with no worries about food, clothing, and housing; are stepping up peaceful economic construction not preparations for a war; and are aspiring for a reunified Korea, contrary to what the South Korean rulers advertise. Contrary to this, South Korea's various kinds of rotten, ailing social evils that prevail under the present civilian rule, which stakes its fate on outside forces, will be strikingly revealed in contrast to the North. If one sees the true faces of South Korea, where a powder-reeking war fever is all the more instigated, and our republic, where peaceful construction is pushed ahead everywhere, he will clearly know who truly wants peace and reunification, and who pursues war and national division. This is what the South Korean authorities are afraid of. The third party will clearly see that South Korea is the one that is a secluded society, which the South Korean authorities babble about, and that the South Korean authorities are the ones who attempt to perpetuate the national division by erecting an immense concrete wall across the entire area of the Military Demarcation Line that extends approximately 240 km. Truth and lies are bound to be revealed. As one cannot hide sunshine with hands, the South Korean authorities can never cover our republic's external status, which is winning victory after victory, by blocking the international delegation's visit to the North. The South Korean authorities should no longer commit rude acts of damaging the nation's prestige, which is known as a country of courteous people in the East, running against the aspiration of the fellow countrymen and the world's peace-loving people. We will always keep the door open for the foreign delegation who, with a good intention, wish to visit Pyongyang to do good things for the peaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula. [Signed] Spokesman for the Reunification Policy Committee of the DPRK SPA [Dated] 30 March, Pyongyang
