The Vienna-based IAEA is waiting for Pyongyang to provide an official message signed by Atomic Energy Industry Minister Choe Hak-kun for any kind of breakthrough in the situation in view of past negotiations with the communist regime, Meyer said. There has not been any message from Pyongyang since unofficial contact between working-level officials from each side on Wednesday [5 January], he said. But IAEA expects North Korean response regarding nuclear inspections soon and will continue to be on the alert this weekend, he added.
