At 9:30 in the morning, 149 prisoners in a large classroom received presents of fruit and light refreshments from the prison. They were "well reformed inmates" who were sentenced to more than ten years in jail but had not been visited by any family members for a long time, or prisoners suffering from bad health, said a spokesman for the prison. Wu Zhongjun, 51, was sentenced to 15 years' jail for murdering his wife. His two sons had never been to the prison to visit him. He sobbed as he held the presents, and said: "I'm grateful for the care of the government, and I will reform myself here to reduce my prison term." At 10 a.m., another 55 "well reformed inmates" who have served more than half their terms were in new clothes and shoes which their families had brought them. They were waiting at the reception section for their families to take them home on parole for the three-day spring festival. These "home-leave" prisoners had been selected by the inmates themselves for good behavior or meritorious service, said the prison spokesman. Prison Deputy-Governor Li Jinghai exhorted them again and again at the farewell meeting not to make mistakes or commit any crimes and to return to the jail on time. He also warned them not to light fireworks or crackers, according to the ban brought in on December 1 last year by the Beijing municipal government. "More than 400 inmates of this kind have been granted such holidays since 1992," said Li. "No one escaped or committed any offences, and all have returned on time." At 11:30, the third batch of 84 well reformed prisoners received their family members and dined with them at the prison's guest-house. Spouses will be allowed to stay here for one day with the prisoners. Wu Duowei, 34, was sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment for blackmail. His three-year-old son Wu Qiong has not been estranged from him, because his wife and the little boy have visited him once a month for the past three years. Wu Qiong insisted that his father should feed him at the "family dinner." The father, in jail clothes, kisses him from time to time. Wu Duowei said the government's permission for his family to visit him helped to maintain his family and stabilized his spiritual moods during the time of reform. They are staying at the guest-house of the prison. The room has been decorated by the pretty wife with colorful balloons. A big red Chinese character "fu" or "fortune" poster hangs on the wall, which symbolizes good luck in the Chinese tradition, and is indispensable on happy occasions. Were it not for the high grey electrified wall outside the window, one would not guess one was in a prison. Other prisoners had been granted an additional monthly visit by family members, said the prison spokesman, adding that a party would be held for the inmates tonight. The Beijing No. 2 Prison, consisting of six prison blocks, was built in 1990 at a cost of 52 million yuan (around 9 million U.S. dollars then). The prison also has an assembly hall, several reading rooms, playgrounds and a guest-house for inmates' families.
