Deputies supported the proposal of people's deputy Serhiy Holovatyy, who proposed "to ensure a quorum of live deputies, and not button ones [ones who have substitutes to press the button in votes], and to send out telegrams to them so that there are not less than 300 deputies in the session hall tomorrow, 3 February." In his speech, Serhiy Holovatyy said that if the amendments to the law on elections are not approved, the elections to the Supreme Council of Ukraine on 27 March would not take place. But elections for the president are set for 26 June. "To whom will power belong over this period?" -- Serhiy Holovatyy asked. Ivan Plyushch, chairman of the Supreme Council, who was chairing the session, agreed with this proposal, instructing Vasyl Durdynets, first deputy chairman of the Supreme Council, to assemble a quorum.
