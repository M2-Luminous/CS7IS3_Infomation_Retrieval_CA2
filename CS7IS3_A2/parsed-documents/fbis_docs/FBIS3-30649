One bill will ratify the 1963 Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage and the 1988 Joint Protocol on Civil Law Liability and Compensation for Cross-Boundary Damage From Nuclear Accident, which established a link between the 1960 Paris Convention on Third Party Liability in the Field of Nuclear Energy and the Vienna Convention. The other bill will amend the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy Act. Bulgaria's accession to the Vienna Convention and the Joint Protocol will help assert this country's position in the international system of civil liability for nuclear damage, according to Mr. Yanko Yanev, chairman of the Committee for Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy, who sponsored the bills. So far Bulgaria has not been involved in this system which at some times has hampered normal trade relations with other countries, Mr. Yanev observed. Provision of technical and financial assistance to enhance the nuclear safety of the Kozloduy nuclear power plant, in his view, is also contingent on accession to the convention. The proposed amendments to the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy Act will limit the state monopoly to the extraction, processing, production and trade in nuclear material and operation of nuclear facilities. Other sources of ionizing radiation will be subject to licensing requirements. This means that upon payment of definite fees, both natural and juristic persons could use sources of ionizing radiation in hospitals, industrial and research laboratories and facilities. Liability for possible damage from nuclear accident will rest with the operators of the nuclear installations. Stiffer fines will be imposed for breaking nuclear and radiological safety rules. Besides this, the proposed changes will help penalize companies which do no meet nuclear safety requirements.
