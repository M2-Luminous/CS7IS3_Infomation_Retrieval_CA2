Thus, it is a major event in China's current activities to proceed from reality in fully studying and understanding the measures for improving large and medium-sized, state-owned enterprises. 1. Transform Mechanism To Clarify Property Rights The issue on clarifying enterprises' property rights or putting property rights in place is comprised of how to distribute the assets to individuals under the public economy so that both the public and individuals own public property. After several years of exploration, it can be said that the best way we have come up with is to promote the shareholding system at state-owned enterprises. There are two patterns we can adopt in promoting the shareholding system: One is to maintain the original property rights and draw in the shares of staff members and workers. This is a moderate and conservative therapy. The original state-owned assets, after being reappraised, serve as public shares, and then the shares of staff members and workers are drawn in. This not only helps separate ownership from management rights but also helps clarify the enterprises' property rights. The other is to divide public property into the liability shares of staff members and workers. This is a larger-scale reform measure. The original state-owned assets are manifest as collective property, but it is difficult to see their micro embodiment. If we divide state-owned property into individual shares to make everyone possess specific property and then pool the property and turn the enterprises into shareholding enterprises, the property as a whole belongs to the public although the shares belong to individuals. This is not only an effective method to maintain public ownership under the new market economy but also an effective way to maintain and increase the value of state-owned assets. It is the continuation, not disintegration, of public ownership; and it is progress, not retrogression, of history. In maintaining public ownership of state-owned assets, we may adopt two methods. One is to let the state or governments at all levels appoint representatives of property rights to execute the property rights of companies. The other is to appraise the current assets of state-owned enterprises and then lease them to individuals. 2. Establish a Modern Enterprise System and Turn Enterprises Into Companies In a strict sense, both enterprises and companies are qualified, independent, legal persons and economic entities capable of independent operation. Why is it then, that enterprises are urged to transform into companies? In general, there are two categories of enterprises. There are those with one main investor and there are others that are partnership enterprises, with unlimited liabilities for their operation so that when enterprises go bankrupt, the investment partners not only lose the enterprises but also all their personal deposits and property. Companies that emerged later are actually all stock companies, whose prominent characteristic is the diversification of major investors and share of risks and interests. In the process of development and evolution, stock companies have gradually become ones with limited liabilities. That is, investors bear the risks of companies only within the limits of the stocks they invest, excluding other property. The limited liability stock companies and limited liability companies that have emerged, all shoulder limited liabilities only. From this, we have come to the initial conclusion that turning enterprises into companies means changing one owner-enterprises into companies with many investors and limited liability. Large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises are enterprises invested solely by the state, and they are, as we often say, owned by the public. As the sole investor, the state holds unlimited liabilities for the enterprises. Heilongjiang's large and medium-sized enterprises have suffered losses year after year, their deficits have remained high, and two-thirds of them are in difficulty. However, most of them have not gone bankrupt. This is because the state holds unlimited liabilities for these enterprises. How then, should large and medium-sized enterprises be turned into companies? Of the two methods that can be applied, one is to transform large and medium-sized, state-owned enterprises in line with the shareholding system. This not only helps pluralize investors but also enables the state to hold limited liabilities correlating to the capital investment amount. The other is to turn large and medium-sized, state-owned enterprises into companies owned solely by the state. Transformation to the shareholding system is good, but extensive application is impossible for the time being. It is not that loss-making enterprises cannot be transformed in line with the shareholding system. It is that flexible methods should be adopted, such as auction, buying out, or quantifying the relatively profitable parts and turning them into shares to invest. The direct way out for loss-making enterprises is to turn them into companies first. That is, the existing state-owned enterprises are changed into limited liability companies solely invested by the state, and the state holds limited liability according to its current investment, no longer unlimited liability for continued losses. Property rights are delegated to enterprises thoroughly so that they operate independently and shoulder the responsibility should they go under. This may be the best way to enable enterprises to survive. 3. The Government Should Strengthen Service and, in Particular, Cultivate and Improve the Market System to Improve Large and Medium-Sized, State-Run Enterprises, . Speeding up the cultivation and improvement of the market system is a guarantee for transforming mechanisms and invigorating enterprises and also an important function of the government. In this regard, a good job should be done in three aspects. First, we should do a good job in building markets to establish the market networks more rapidly. Currently, Heilongjiang has yet to build stock markets, labor markets, futures markets, cultural markets, and enterprise markets, and it should transform its various types of markets into open ones with advanced facilities and complete functions, which can play a wide radiating role. Second, we should accelerate economic legislation and establishment of the market mechanism. Third, we should strengthen the coordination and control of some markets that monopolize the business of some essential elements of production. Some essential elements of production, such as funds, railways, and transportation, are seriously restricting Heilongjiang's enterprise production. Under conditions where these essential elements of production are under unified management by the central authorities, the government should make positive efforts in coordinate and control to ensure a reasonable distribution of the existing essential elements of production.
