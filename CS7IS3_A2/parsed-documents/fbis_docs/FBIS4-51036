"There will certainly be some governments facing significant domestic pressures seeking to amend the deal or even to overturn it altogether", he warned when addressing the 27th international meeting of the Pacific Basin Economic Council (PBEC) here today. "However, such governments will have to face down those pressures knowing that the rest of the world is waiting and watching," he told the plenary session on critical trade issues under the theme of "Aftermath of the Uruguay Round". At a press conference later he said about 20 to 30 of the 120 GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) contracting members have ratified the Uruguay Round of agreement adopted in Marrakesh this year, paving the way for the formation of the World Trade Organization on January 1 next year. There were no reports from major trading nations such as the United States, the European Union or Japan that they have ratified the pact. "it would be incomprehensible for the United States not to ratify the pact in time," he said. The Clinton administration has set August 15 as the deadline for congressional approvals. Sutherland said "it is the leadership role as signified by President Clinton that the ratification is made". On the resumption of China's GATT membership, Sutherland termed it as a priority for GATT Secretariat. "It is true to say that a World Trade Organization without China as part of it is less than a complete organization," he emphasized. He said the negotiations on the subject have reached a "decisive phase", as there is "a demanding schedule" for a protocol to be agreed by the summer time. Although there is a widespread recognition that significant (trade) liberalization steps have recently taken place in China, the contracting parties still "have legitimate and serious demands which have to be recognized and understood by China", he said, adding "it will require will and cooperation and constructive dialogue of everybody". "We'll give the utmost importance to it and will press forward the negotiations," he said.
