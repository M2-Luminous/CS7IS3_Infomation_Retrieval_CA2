But those who built the barricades in central Moscow, fired shots from Kalashnikovs, and broke into the "Ostankino" television center have not been consigned to the archives together with the prosecutor's files. And probably far from all of them have acknowledged their guilt, still less come to terms with defeat. Some "defenders of the Constitution" were released from prison, others emerged from underground where they had spent nearly six months hiding from the law enforcement organs. I wondered: Who are these people and what do they want now? The amnesty has so emboldened some of them that they agreed to meet with the correspondent of the "ideologically alien" IZVESTIYA. Colonel Aleksandr M. set as the main condition for our talk that his identity be kept anonymous. That, he gave me to understand over the telephone, was the directive "from above." Of himself he said only that he had graduated from the Lvov military-political school and taught at the Lenin military-political academy. He was coordinator of the "Officers Union" for the Moscow military district. He is easily recognized on a videotape made during last year's May Day demonstration by the opposition forces. In the White House he commanded a large subunit of "volunteers" who hid in a settlement near Moscow until recently. They had prepared for my arrival. In the apartment where I was taken by a sturdily built boy called Gleb, several "defenders of the White House" were waiting and there was a pile of video cassettes on the table. "The official press is lying when it says we were the first to shoot at `Ostankino,'" a colonel dressed in camouflage with the merit badges of the airborne troops began the talk. "Why did you go to take `Ostankino' at all?" I asked. "This was an action you knew to be futile: Even after purging the television center of `Vityaz' you would hardly have been able to broadcast." "You cannot imagine the euphoria which possessed thousands of people at the time. For me it was the happiest moment of my life," one of the underground members replied. The frames of the video report dispassionately recorded the prelude to the bloody tragedy. The deputies, emerging from the dark White House smelling of faeces (the lighting and sewerage system had been turned off for many days) called for history to be made. "Russia is with you!" they roared into the microphones. "Yeltsin's criminal regime is expiring. We shall see it into its grave!" And the crowd went to its slaughter. The road was opened, a green light from Krasnopresnenskaya embankment to Ostankino. The armored personnel carriers followed a parallel course, with blue eyes smiling from under the tank drivers' hard hats and fingers making the "V" sign: "Vivat!" Those taking part in the meeting demanded that "tele-vision" be brought to book and a truck rammed the door. People with assault rifles tried to repel the angry crowd from the building. A man in a camouflage jacket sat down not far from the entrance, with a grenade thrower ready. Man with the Grenade Thrower I recognized this man. He miraculously survived that carnage. A grenade blast threw him onto a concrete flower tub. It may be considered that he got off lightly: He had bruising and a grenade fragment wound to his hand. I met with him when he had been discharged from hospital. Radio engineer Nikolay Abramenkov remembers better than anyone the absurdity of the "Ostankino" forced march. And he even tried to persuade General Makashov of this but "obeying the oath" he had taken outside the White House he went to the television center as part of the "Sever" special group. Here they were already breaking the glass windows through which could be seen reflected the special militia members armed to the teeth and the fighters of the "Vityaz" special subunit. And when the general, having set off for talks with the "other side," asked for "cover," Abramenkov unthinkingly picked up the grenade thrower. And it was not important that the 30-year-old reserve officer did not know how to use the weapon -- "the main thing was to intimidate the special militia." He did not hear the radio conversations under way meanwhile among the "Vityaz" officers: "Do you see that grenade thrower? "Where, where?" "At the entrance. We must take him out." A single shot rang out and in a few minutes loops of tracer bullets were tearing through the crowd.... In 1987 Abramenkov graduated from the Moscow radioelectronics institute. He worked at a mailbox [secret defense industry enterprise] and "rose" to the post of senior engineer. At the same time he matured in the social field: First he was a communist youth league organization secretary and then headed a party committee. In 1990, when "the project was closed because of conversion," he was obliged to engage in the production of "radio consumer goods" at a firm in the capital. On 22 September, the day his son was born, he returned to Moscow from Smolensk. And learning of Yeltsin's edict no. 1400, he immediately went to the White House. He saw his son only a month later. "Why did I go there? To ensure they finally stopped selling the country. I saw plants standing idle in Smolensk while all around dealers were growing rich through speculation. It was time to put an end to the anarchy." "But protesting against `anarchy' is one thing, taking an assault rifle and grenade thrower in your hand is quite another. Did you realize you would have to shoot people?" "For the first two days I was on the barricades at the White House. Then I joined the `Sever' group. When virtually the entire guard left Rutskoy, we were asked to help him. We were issued weapons 30 September and the group was subordinate only to Rutskoy and General Makashov." A special airborne forces officer to whom I showed the photograph of Abramenkov with the grenade thrower was taken aback: "We do not even use grenades of this type. We have the latest model." "Where did you get the grenade thrower and ammunition?" "It was taken from outside the city hall building. There was also a spray gun lying around there, which was picked up before the city hall was seized by Barkashov's supporters, who probably thought it was a weapon. And a man aged about 40 dressed in a militia uniform brought two grenades and handed them over. It looks as though it was all specially set up to provoke us but it was only later I guessed that. Number After One, Two! The "Sever" group consisted of 12 men. Abramenkov would seem to be lying when he says that he joined it directly from the barricades. They took only tested people because, as became known from a reliable source, "Sever" was formed back in March 1993 and not without the participation of "Nashi" member journalist Nevzorov. The group carried out the most dangerous tasks and that is why the losses were so great: Two members were killed and several seriously wounded. Some members had fought in the trouble spots of the former Union. Those who came to the White House spontaneously and at the bidding of their hearts joined the "first Moscow volunteer regiment named for the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet." The regiment included a cossack battalion, two battalions of volunteer forces, and a subunit of the "Officers Union" -- in all about 1,000 men aged 18 to 60. The gunmen of the Russian National Unity under the command of Barkashov himself were in the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet armed forces under the fourth motorized rifle battalion. Like the first Moscow special cossack squadron and the above-mentioned "Sever" group, they were directly subordinate to the directives of "defense minister" by invitation Achalov. Yesaul [cossack captain] Vladimir Kurochkin, the owner of the apartment in which my meeting with the underground defenders of the White House took place, was deputy ataman of a cossack squadron. This subunit numbered slightly over 100 men, mainly from Siberia, the Urals, and South Russia. The passport of a USSR citizen was grounds for receiving an assault rifle. As was an application to the congress of people's deputies and Supreme Soviet asking to be considered a Russian patriot. Those who signed it swore an oath of loyalty to the "only legitimate" organs of power of the state and were considered servicemen. In the long hours of deathly quiet the armed opposition marched along the asphalt paths and stood watch. It can be seen on the video recording how the opposition wallowed in the floods of misinformation coming from the White House balcony. The "defenders of the Constitution" did not know that the "reliable report" on the spontaneous transfer of yet another division to their side had been prepared by a few deputies "to strengthen their fighting morale." The special militia members looking out of the armored personnel carriers were taunting them: "What's the matter with you, boys, we are with you." Barkashov's supporters were already whispering of storming the Kremlin. The airborne forces were meekly eating sandwiches made by women who were Communist Youth League members in the thirties. Engineers in camouflage were sticking ballpoint pens into the muzzles of the militia's assault rifles. Hurrah, our boys are coming, they shouted, seeing the approach of yet another convoy of armored vehicles which after a few hours would tear the crowd to shreds with large-caliber machineguns. There was a set expression of perplexity on the faces of the dead: "How stupid, we were only a step from victory...." The survivors were cut down by salvos from the "stinking special militia who have betrayed Russia." The rebels left the barricade not as a crowd but in detachments of insurgents who had sworn loyalty to a power which no longer existed. Actually, I was told by Yesaul Kurochkin, they had not come to the White House to defend Khasbulatov or Rutskoy personally but rather to oppose "Yeltsin's criminal regime." "Third Force" "What was it you so disliked about `Yeltsin's regime?'" I asked my interlocutors. "At least there are no wars in Russia, there is food in the stores, and no one is yet dying of hunger. And look what is being down on the outskirts of the former Union...." "For a long time now the country has been controlled not by Yeltsin's clique," Colonel M. a former political worker, sought to enlighten me, "but by a third force. It is no accident that during his trip to Russia Nixon met with members of the opposition. The third force is now seeking someone on whom to gamble after the fall of the existing regime." "Do you consider this `fall' to be inevitable?" "Having issued his edict on the dissolution of parliament, Yeltsin put himself outside the law. And time is now working in our favor." "But what about the political amnesty and the memorandum on accord?" "The amnesty was issued for those accomplices of the criminal regime who are up to their elbows in blood. They were thus given the chance to go voluntarily. Otherwise civil war was inevitable. In my view the idea of concluding the memorandum on accord between the executioners and the victims is stillborn. The opposition will conclude it only after Yeltsin's voluntary resignation. All these Yeltsins, Kaufmans, and Rozenfelds who have found a cosy spot at the top taking cover under Russian surnames must go and the sooner the better for them." The colonel's intentions are serious and as far as I know he is by no means alone in his thoughts and intentions. Somewhere deep underground a staff of armed forces named for the abolished Supreme Soviet is operating. Aleksandr M.'s deputies are almost constantly on the move "establishing contacts with fellow thinkers in the provinces." Opposition's Weapon The losses of manpower during the October events were not as great as the opposition members are inclined to think. Colonel M., who had seven battalions under his command 3 October, for instance, could recall less than 10 men killed from his subunits. But the opposition is losing its fighters in peace time. Last winter Russian National Unity activists Denisov and Kostin were arrested, as was "Sever" group commander Fridlender. From Russian Federation Ministry of Internal Affairs operational reports: 1. Aleksandr Kostin. Born 1961 in Voronezh Oblast. Was resident in Anninskiy Rayon, in Arkhangelskaya village, has previous convictions, is regarded a particularly dangerous recidivist. Arrested in Voronezh for mugging a taxi driver in Voronezh. 2. Aleksandr Denisov, from Buryat Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. Sentenced in Rostov-na-Donu in 1992 for the illegal possession of a weapon to corrective labor, from which he escaped. Has worked in militia organs in Estonia. Arrested in Tallinn in early 1994. 3. Sergey Fridlender, born 1967, from Lithuania. Was resident in Kobrin City, in Brest Oblast. Went to St. Petersburg in 1988. Since May 1992 has worked in the fifth detachment of the Russian Federation Finance Ministry paramilitary guard. Arrested 29 December 1993 in Kobrin on suspicion of the murder of two people. According to available information the murders were committed with an assault rifle taken from the White House arsenal. In all the Supreme Soviet was assigned about 2,000 guns. To this day over 400 of them, mainly Kalashnikov assault rifles, have not been found. After Barkashov's supporters had seized the city hall building, 146 official-issue pistols and assault rifles were taken away. Only slightly more than 10 were returned. I am reliably informed that on the evening of 3 October the more farsighted "White House defenders" used every available means to take away dozens of guns from the "last bastion of democracy." It is not hard to guess that these weapons of the opposition will be fired many times yet. But my meeting with the underground members continued. On the video recording four boys are carrying the body of a young woman to somewhere to one side of the White House. She is stripped naked and her mane of dark hair is trailing on the ground. Meanwhile Colonel M. told me: "We broke out of the White House on the night of 4 October. Broke out is the word, because we could not surrender alive. There were about 200 of us and we left through the central exist onto Krasnopresnensakaya embankment and were about to move to the right, toward the international trade center, when suddenly we came under sniper fire. Then we moved rapidly toward the city hall. We broke through three cordons calmly, without a single shot. The special militia pretended not to notice us. We ran across some waste land, crossed a construction site, and then divided into groups of 10-15 and went in various directions. We walked through the city, dirty and unkempt -- it was immediately obvious where we had come from but no one tried to stop us. That stinking special militia seized those who had no weapons, not those that were needed. All those who had to got away.
