The recalcitrant Khmer Rouge leaders still continue to occupy illegally this region and continue to cause considerable damage to national assets even after our country had entered the stage of national reconciliation, unity, and peace; after our most venerated monarch, His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk Varman, had ascended the throne to provide the coolest shade for all of us, his Cambodian subjects; and after the Royal Government of Cambodia [RGC] had come to power to lead and govern the nation in full legitimacy. Thus, with the noble intention of preserving peace and maintaining security for the people and preserving national unity and national reconciliation, the Khmer Royal Armed Forces [KRAF] made monumental efforts and braved all kinds of difficulties in entering and completely capturing the Pailin region on 19 March 1994. With a high sense of responsibility toward the destiny of all Cambodians, the RGC would like to make another appeal to the officers, the rank and file, and the compatriots living under the temporary control of the Khmer Rouge. The brothers are asked to waste no time in finding all means to return to the national community and join the great family of Cambodians. The RGC always has the fate and destiny of all of you at heart as already emphasized in previous appeals, especially in the statement made by the RGC on 25 March 1994. 1. As a matter of fact, the officers, noncommissioned officers, and men still serving in the ranks of the Khmer Rouge are urged to hurry up and present themselves before the KRAF and the competent authorities in the region. You will be accorded all due attention and your rights, privileges, grades, and duties will be assured in the same way as has been done by the RGC toward the thousands of former Khmer Rouge officers, noncommissioned officers, and men who have already awakened to the call and joined the national community and the RGC. 2. As for the civilians who have been forcibly taken along by Khmer Rouge leaders, they should hurry up and liberate themselves from the claws of the Khmer Rouge by immediately contacting the KRAF and the competent authorities protecting the region. You will be welcomed and given all necessary assistance by the RGC and you will receive land and houses in accordance with the law. 3. As far as the compatriots who take temporary refuge in Thailand are concerned, the RGC will continue to contact and negotiate with the representatives of the Thai Government in order to bring them back to our sacred Angkorian land with the assistance of various international organizations. Concerning the repatriation of these refugees, the RGC's good-will and sincere stance is that the repatriation should proceed through a negotiation between our RGC and the government of the country concerned on the basis of humanitarian principles, voluntariness, noncoercion, and respect for the right of the concerned brothers to make a choice. Any brothers who wish to remain in Pailin or to go to any other fully safe regions will be allowed to do so with the assistance of the RGC. The RGC is confident that the country concerned will do its best to help and support this righteous cause by respecting Cambodia's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity and refrain from interfering in each other's internal affairs as stipulated in the 23 October 1991 Paris agreement. [Signed] Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranaridddh, first prime minister Samdech Hun Sen, second prime minister [Dated] 6 April 1994, Phnom Penh
