FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Britthany Beadle, Marketing Order Administration Branch, Fruit and Vegetable Division, AMS, USDA, P.O. Box 96456, Room 2525&hyph;S, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456; telephone: (202) 720&hyph;5127; or William Pimental, Southeast Marketing Field Office, Fruit & Vegetable Division, AMS, USDA, P.O. Box 2276, Winter Haven, Florida 33883&hyph;2276; telephone: (813) 299&hyph;4770. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Marketing Order No. 905, as amended, [7 CFR Part 905] regulating the handling of oranges, grapefruit, tangerines, and tangelos grown in Florida, hereinafter referred to as the order. The order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674], hereinafter referred to as the Act. The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the marketing order provisions now in effect, oranges, grapefruit, tangerines, and tangelos grown in Florida are subject to assessments. It is intended that the assessment rate as issued herein will be applicable to all assessable citrus fruit during the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year, beginning August 1, 1994, through July 31, 1995. This rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 8c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.
