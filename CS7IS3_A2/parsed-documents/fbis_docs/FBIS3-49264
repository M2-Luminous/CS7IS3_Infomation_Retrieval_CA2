The prime minister did not confirm this news. Minister of National Defense Piotr Kolodziejczyk has declared that he will tender his resignation if the coalition introduces political deputy ministers into his ministry. [Begin recording] [Correspondent Maciej Sojka] A month ago, in the course of a meeting of the SLD Supreme Council, Aleksander Kwasniewski stated that he agreed with Waldemar Pawlak that each of the coalition parties would introduce one deputy minister into the ministries of foreign affairs, internal affairs, and national defense. Unofficially, it is known that the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has agreed to this, on condition that these will be people already working in his ministry. The minister of internal affairs also said, during a meeting with journalists of the GLOS SZCZECINSKI daily, that he is not surprised by such a proposal. On the other hand, the president protested strongly. Just a few days ago, SLD politicians stated that to avoid provoking a conflict with the Belweder Palace, Waldemar Pawlak will withdraw the nomination of the deputy ministers. In the view of Aleksander Kwasniewski, in the course of the meeting today Waldemar Pawlak stuck to the earlier decisions. [Correspondent] Prime Minister Pawlak agreed? [Kwasniewski] He did not have to agree, he agreed a long time ago, and we will be implementing this. [Correspondent] So he again maintained this today? [Kwasniewski] That is so. [end recording] [Sojka] The head of the Ministry of National Defense has announced that he will not agree to the introduction of deputy ministers from the SLD and PSL, since, as he put it, the army does not need political commissars. [Defense Minister Kolodziejczyk] I will be considering our moves, together with a possible tendering of my resignation. [Correspondent] Mr. Prime Minister, will you agree to the nomination of deputy ministers in the presidential ministries? Mr. Kwasniewski said that you agree. Is this true? [video shows Pawlak walking down corridor without answering] [Sojka] Ewa Wachowicz, press secretary for the prime minister, affirmed that the issue of filling deputy ministerial posts in the presidential ministries is a marginal topic for the prime minister.
