[Begin Komirenko recording] Leonid Kuchma, a recent prime minister, now president of the Ukrainian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, has been remarkably active lately. Numerous press interviews by the former prime minister have appeared in Ukraine and neighboring countries, in which, using more slogans than facts, he embarks on a search for scapegoats for the present difficult economic situation in Ukraine. In his latest press appearances, he puts the blame on the so-called "Party of Power," the present government. Strangely enough, in none of his appearances does Leonid Kuchma associate himself with this party, although only six months ago he was one of the top state officials who determined the country's political and economic course, and therefore, commanded considerable powers to overcome the crisis. Taking the office of prime minister in Autumn 1992, Leonid Kuchma declared his readiness to take upon himself responsibility for the state of affairs in the economy. In order to cure it, his government was granted the widest of powers. Incidentally, despite the complexity of the situation, the objective opportunities for a comprehensive reform in the Ukrainian economy then were tangibly better than now. But did Leonid Kuchma take advantage of them? The answer is evident from the results of economic management in 1993, when it was Kuchma who headed the government: A complete imbalance of macroeconomic parameters that is having an extremely negative effect on the present state of the economy, a 100-fold retail price rise twice exceeding the rate of wage increase. The wage share in a product's cost price has shrunk almost two-fold. If one should also take into account the devaluation of the population's savings, one can safely say that last year every resident of Ukraine became much poorer than he was before Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma took office. One should be reminded that at his initiative the indexation of the population's incomes, as well as the publication of price indexes for consumer goods, were terminated. The former prime minister is currently passing himself for a mouthpiece of producers' interests. But how did they fare under his leadership? During the time Leonid Kuchma was government head, taxes grew significantly and huge excise taxes were introduced. All this befell the producer as a heavy burden and undermined entrepreneurship. Creditor's indebtedness among enterprises has grown 62 times over the past year, as a result of which the most severe crisis of payments got under way, whose consequences are reflected today in full measure in a decline of production, overdue wages payments, and other disorders. The growth in the budget profits was ensured not by the economy's incomes, but by monetary emission. In his time, holding the high post, Leonid Kuchma accused the National Bank of the karbovanets collapse, however, with the 17-fold growth in emission last year, the exchange rate of the Ukrainian currency per dollar fell 36 times. As a whole, with the three-fold devaluation of the dollar in Ukraine taken into account, the purchasing capacity of the karbovanets decreased 100 times. This is not the fault of the National Bank but the result of the absolutely unbalanced foreign economic and currency policy by the Kuchma government, which caused the outflow of money and capitals from Ukraine. Legal relations in the state were significantly affected by the hasty decree-making activity by Leonid Kuchma. The abrogation or amendment of many enactments and their separate provisions brought more confusion into legislation than order. It is in the times that Leonid Kuchma headed the government, that they began to impose a thesis on Ukraine's feebleness upon society and disbelief in our state's ability to get out of the crisis situation. Obviously, Leonid Kuchma's personal inability to fulfill his numerous promises to restore order in Ukraine and raise people's living standards was far from playing the least important role in this. To a great extent the miscalculations made by the Kuchma team conditioned the worsening of the economic situation in the Crimea Republic, resulting in the formation of anti-Ukrainian sentiments there. Firstly, a ban on the export of agricultural produce, grown on subsidiary plots of land, to Russia and other countries, which were traditional markets to sell that produce, affected Crimea more than other regions of the country. A cunning blow against one of Crimea's leading industries -- wine-making -- was the introduction of high excise duties for its products, at the same time, with the abolition of excise duties for imported, often low-quality, beverages. As a result of this arbitrary rule, the viability of world-famous Crimean wines was artificially undermined, which led to a decline in their production. Finally, the third blow against the Crimean economy was the decisions preventing the development of lease relations that had gained wide popularity, particularly in Crimea. One's attention is caught by Leonid Kuchma's attempt to gamble on such a topical issue as Ukraine's nuclear disarmament. In one of his latest interviews, he is threatening, with a multitude of economic and environmental consequences involved, to implement the trilateral statement by the presidents of Ukraine, Russia, and the United States. But it is Leonid Kuchma's signature that was put under the Massandra Protocol of 3 September 1993 on the withdrawal of all nuclear warheads from Ukraine in the course of 24 months! So, when did he really defend state interests? Last autumn in Crimea, or during his interviews this spring? Leonid Kuchma puts most of the blame on those members of government whom he personally invited to join his cabinet. Although, it is they who now have to put out the fire of the crisis which they could not do last year, working under the former prime minister's leadership. Perhaps, one should not pay attention to all this. All sorts of things can be heard and read at a time of a great public and political campaign, like the recent and upcoming elections to the top state institutions. However, the arguments and slogans used by Leonid Kuchma more often than not mislead entrepreneurs and citizens in Ukraine and those states whose papers publish his interviews. Take, for example, the accusation against the present state leadership of choosing the road of self-isolation. The reality proves different. In actual fact, Ukraine is now following the road of consolidating its state independence, at the same time, establishing mutually beneficial economic and political cooperation with the countries of both the West and East. Suffice it to say that 35 various economic agreements have been concluded with Russia alone, 28 agreements with Belarus, 25 agreements with Kazakhstan, 23 agreements with Kyrgyzstan, 16 agreements with Uzbekistan, and 13 agreements with Turkmenistan. At the latest meeting of the heads of state and government of the CIS countries alone, which took place in Ashgabat in December 1993, Ukraine's representatives signed about 20 bilateral documents, the majority of which dealt with economy. Ukraine, as a cofounder of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation [PACZES], is working out draft agreements on a significant expansion of mutually advantageous contacts with the PACZES countries: Turkey, Romania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Albania, Georgia, and Russia. Greece, Bulgaria, Slovakia, and Poland expressed their wish to join PACZES. Recently Ukraine, by the way, the first among the CIS countries, initialled the agreement on partnership and cooperation with the European Union which lifts restrictions on our trade relations with the EEC countries. Such a balanced policy will promote the stabilization of Ukraine's economy. And if it were not for the consequences of numerous incompetent decisions made by the Leonid Kuchma government in the first half of 1993, which the present-day government has to overcome and the fruit of which all the citizens of Ukraine have to reap, the economic situation could have been stabilized much sooner. The Cabinet of Ministers is working on the implementation of a program aimed at overcoming the crisis phenomena in economy and improving people's living conditions in 1994. It is exactly this that the government of Ukraine regards to be its duty.
