This is the resolution adopted by the 15 employers' associations who gathered yesterday at the Villa Creole Hotel. Our colleague Jean Luckenson attended this session. Let us listen to his report. [Begin recording, in Creole] All commercial and industrial enterprises and services will discontinue operations as of Friday, 28 January at noon, until Wednesday, 9 February inclusive, to force all concerned parties to submit themselves to the superior interests of the nation and to obtain the lifting of the embargo against Haiti. This is the resolution that emerged from the meeting held by 15 of the 16 employers' associations on Tuesday, 25 January, at the Villa Creole Hotel on the economic crisis the country has been experiencing for over 28 months, and which has become increasingly more alarming as a result of the fuel problem, and which has already caused much ink to flow. [passage omitted] The decision resulting from this meeting does not concern the health sector. All of the employers agree to create a crisis committee, which will have the mission of ensuring follow-up of the resolutions that resulted from the 25 January meeting. A report will be sent to the employers' associations, which will meet again to adopt whatever additional measures might be necessary. By the way, the employers' sector recommended that insofar as possible, its members take the interests of the workers into account. We should tell you that this meeting began at 0930 and ended at 1800, and was held at the initiative of the Haitian Chamber of Commerce [and Industry], which had several times requested the lifting of the embargo against Haiti.
