New commitments of US320 million dollars, about US70 million dollars in escess of earlier expectations, were received from representatives of donors meeting here in a special sub-group gathering on Guyana under the Caribbean Group for Co-operation in Economic Development (CGCED). The World Bank in a statement coming out of the consultation said Guyana's prospects for sustained development are "promising" but reiterated a theme of the meeting -- the need for deeper reform, a clear developmnt agenda, and consistent signals to the private sector. "Good result," conference chairman Yoshiaki Abe of the World Bank summarised for reporters Friday at the end of the two-day meeting. An effusive Guyana Finance Minister Asgar Ally said the objectives of the meeting had been achieved. World Bank officials declined to provide detailed breakdowns of the commitments received but among them was US20 million dollars from the Caribbean Development Bank, in addition to US35 million committed last year, well-placed sources told CANA. The United States and Britain also signed agreements here Friday extending further assistance to Guyana. The U.S. package, a PL480 commodity agreement, covers three years and provides US6 million dollars for 1994, while the British assistance under the Overseas Development Administration is for five million pounds sterling over three years to the public sector reform programme. The commitments from the various donors are intended to fill the gap remaining in Guyana's projected US500 million dollars financing requirements in the 1994-96 period after accounting for international trade, transfers, and already committed inflows. During the meeting here, attended by 100 representatives of 27 countries and international organisations and addressed for former U.S. President Jimmy Carter at the invitation of the Guyana Government, the government presented its economic policies and programmes for consideration. "I think that basically what we have set out to achieve we have achieved.... One of the objectives of this conference was to close the financing gap in 1994 and that gap has been closed. We have also had commitments beyond 1994," Ally told reporters. The meeting, the first such to be hosted by the country making the pitch to the financing community, was billed as an important milepost along the country's economic recovery programme, started in 1988. "The meeting recognised the significant progress achieved since the country embarked on its economic recovery programme in 1988. The donors, however also acknowledged the huge constraints Guyana faces in view of the high external debt, the dilapidated economic and social infrastructure and pervasive poverty," the Bank said. "Guyana's prospects for further sustained growth and poverty alleviation are promising. "To achieve them will require a deepening of the reform programme, the maintenance of a sound macroeconomic framework, the elaboration of a clear development agenda, and consistent signals to the private sector," the Bank added. Ally said the Guyana presentations during the meeting laid the basis for "the donors to better understand the problems of Guyana." "I come out of that meeting very reassured that we have friends overseas, both among the (international financial institutions) and among the donor countries. Guyana is really lucky to be in a position where it has so many firends that are prepared to help us at a time when the availability of aid and soft loans is drying up. "I think that for Guyana to be able to come out with this kind of success is indeed remarkable to the country and to the people and to the government. "The conference has been a success and the foundations are now being laid for sustaining growth and to sustain democracy."
