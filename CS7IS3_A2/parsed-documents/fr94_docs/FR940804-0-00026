FR940804-0-00026 FR940804-0-00012 5. The area must have a fully approved maintenance plan pursuant to section 175A of the CAA. III. Review of State Submittal On May 19, 1993, Region IV determined that the information received from the MSCHD constituted a complete redesignation request under the general completeness criteria of 40 CFR 51, appendix V, sections 2.1 and 2.2. However, for purposes of determining what requirements are applicable for redesignation purposes, EPA believes it is necessary to identify when the MSCHD first submitted a redesignation request that meets the completeness criteria. EPA noted in a previous policy memorandum that parallel processing requests for submittals under the CAA, including redesignation submittals, would not be determined complete. See the memorandum entitled ``State Implementation Plan (SIP) Actions Submitted in Response to Clean Air Act (Act) Deadlines'' from John Calcagni to Air Programs Division Directors, Regions I-X, dated October 28, 1992 (Memorandum). The rationale for this conclusion was that the parallel processing exception to the completeness criteria (40 CFR 51, appendix V, section 2.3) was not intended to extend statutory due dates for mandatory submittals. (See Memorandum at 3&hyph;4). However, since requests for redesignation are not mandatory submittals under the CAA, EPA believed it appropriate to change its policy with respect to redesignation submittals to conform to the existing completeness criteria. (See 58 FR 38108 (July 15, 1993)). Therefore, EPA believes, the parallel processing exception to the completeness criteria may be applied to redesignation request submittals, at least until such time as the EPA decides to revise that exception. MSCHD submitted a redesignation request on November 12, 1992. In the November 12 submittal, MSCHD submitted the maintenance plan, thereby including the final element to make the November 12, 1992, request for parallel processing complete under the parallel processing exception to the completeness criteria. When the maintenance plan became state effective on March 9, 1994, the State of Tennessee no longer needed parallel processing for the redesignation request and maintenance plan. The Tennessee redesignation request for the Memphis and Shelby County area meets the five requirements of section 107(d)(3)(E) for redesignation to attainment. The following is a brief description of how the State of Tennessee has fulfilled each of these requirements. Because the maintenance plan is a critical element of the redesignation request, EPA will discuss its evaluation of the maintenance plan under its analysis of the redesignation request. 1. The Area Must Have Attained the O 3 NAAQS The State of Tennessee's request is based on an analysis of quality assured ambient air quality monitoring data which is relevant to the maintenance plan and to the redesignation request. Ambient air quality monitoring data for calendar year 1989 through calendar year 1992 show an expected exceedance rate of less than or equal to 1.0 per year of the O 3 NAAQS in the Memphis and Shelby County area. (See 40 CFR 50.9 and appendix H.) One of the two ozone monitoring sites had no exceedances over this period of time while the other monitor had one exceedance. That exceedance occurred in 1989. The design value, or the ``fourth highest high,'' of the two monitors for the calendar year period of 1990 through 1992 was 0.117 ppm, down from 0.140 ppm in the period of calendar year 1988 through calendar year 1990, and 0.121 ppm for the calendar year period of 1989 through 1991. The ozone monitoring year for 1993 ended on October 31, 1993. One monitor recorded an exceedance of the 0.120 ppm NAAQS during the 1993 season. The State of Tennessee has committed to continue monitoring in this area in accordance with 40 CFR 58. Because the Memphis and Shelby County area has complete quality-assured data showing no violations of the standard over the most recent consecutive three calendar year period, the Memphis and Shelby County area has met the first statutory criterion of attainment of the O 3 NAAQS. 2. The Area Has Met All Applicable Requirements Under Section 110 and Part D of the Act On February 6, 1980, and on September 2, 1981, EPA fully approved Tennessee's SIP as meeting the requirements of section 110(a)(2) and part D of the 1977 CAA (45 FR 26038 and 45 FR 59578). The amended CAA, however, revised section 110(a)(2) and, under part D, revised section 172 and added new requirements for all nonattainment areas. Therefore, for purposes of redesignation, to meet the requirement that the SIP contain all applicable requirements under the CAA, EPA reviewed the Tennessee SIP to ensure that it contained all measures due under the amended CAA prior to or at the time the State of Tennessee submitted its redesignation request. A. Section 110 Requirements Although section 110 was amended, the Memphis and Shelby County area SIP meets the requirements of amended section 110(a)(2). A number of the requirements did not change in substance and, therefore, EPA believes that the pre-amendment SIP met these requirements. As to those requirements that were amended, see 57 FR 27936 and 57 FR 27939 (June 23, 1992), many are duplicative of other requirements of the CAA. EPA has analyzed the SIP and determined that it is consistent with the requirements of amended section 110(a)(2). B. Part D Requirements
