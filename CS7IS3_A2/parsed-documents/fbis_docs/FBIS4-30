FBIS TRENDS-13APR94-JAPAN-U.S. Japanese Consumers Get Little Savings from Imported Rice Japanese Consumers Get Little Savings from Imported Rice SUMMARY Recent Japanese media reporting has suggested that the Japanese Government and agricultural wholesalers have passed to Japanese consumers relatively little, if any, of the savings from the foreign rice Tokyo has been importing to make up for the current domestic rice shortage. If this pattern continues, Japanese consumers will gain little advantage from Tokyo's decision to partially open its rice market as part of the Uruguay Round of International Trade talks. END SUMMARY Despite the Japanese government's importation of an estimated 2.29 million tons of foreign rice, rice prices in Japan have reportedly continued to rise sharply from their already high levels. According to a 25 March Kyodo report, a Japanese government report released at the end of March revealed that consumer prices of rice in Tokyo rose 7.4 percent in March over those in February--reportedly the sharpest monthly increase in 17 years. The government report also indicated that the consumer price of rice in March rose 19.7 percent over prices a year earlier. According to a 12 April Kyodo report, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries' (MAFF) 1993 White Paper on Agriculture indicated that even before these increases, rice prices in Japan in 1993 were approximately 8 times higher than those in the United States. While panic buying of domestic rice in response to rumors of an impending rice shortage accounted for some of this increase, the higher prices may also stem from a failure by the MAFF to pass significant savings from imports on to wholesalers and consumers. According to a 13 April Kyodo report, the Ministry has made a profit of 211.7 billion yen (slightly over $2 billion) on the 2.29 million tons of rice it has imported so far. Kyodo quoted unnamed Ministry sources as saying that this worked out to an average profit of about 92,000 yen (approximately $900) per ton on sales of rice to wholesalers, who presumably marked their prices up still further before selling it to consumers. Another factor contributing to the high prices may be bidrigging on government sales of imported rice. According to the 1 April Asahi Shimbun, the Director General of MAFF's Food Agency sends written instructions every 6 months to the 28 trading companies involved in grain purchases telling them, before bidding takes place, the share each company will receive in upcoming grain auctions. Asahi Shimbun reported that, according to sources close to the trading companies, the companies then rig their bidding prices, deciding which company will bid the lowest price on the basis of the percentages determined by the Food Agency. Although Asahi Shimbun said nothing about the effect of this practice on rice prices, judging from the profits MAFF has reportedly been making on the sale of imported rice, the bidrigging probably limits competition and helps to keep the prices that wholesalers pay to the Ministry relatively high.
