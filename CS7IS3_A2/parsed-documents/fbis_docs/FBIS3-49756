Some Muslim units have been cut off following an unstoppable advance by Serb infantry and tank forces, and they are currently surrounded. These units keep asking for help from Tuzla which has not arrived because of severed communications. A large number of Muslim soldiers are leaving the battlefield in panic fleeing toward Olovo. The Muslim population from Krusevo and other villages near Olovo is already fleeing toward Tuzla. The Muslim defeat can neither be helped by three rows of bunkers deeply dug in and covered by planks and earth by which Olovo and neighboring villages are surrounded. In the bloody four-day conflicts near Olovo, four members of the Combined Brigade of the Herzegovina Corps have been killed, while a few fighters have been wounded, three of them seriously. In the fighting today, up to the time when this dispatch was sent, the Serb side had not suffered any losses.
