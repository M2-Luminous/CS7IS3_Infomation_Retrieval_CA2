This appeal signaled the beginning of the process of French decolonization in Africa. The ceremonies were to have been held in Brazzaville, but in the light of the current tension in the Congolese capital, they are being held in Avenue Kleber in Paris. Congo is represented on this occasion by its prime minister, Joachim Yhombi-Opango. Earlier today, he spoke to Assane Diop, who began by asking him what the Brazzaville appeal meant to him. [Begin recording] [Yhombi-Opango] There is indeed a situation of insecurity in Brazzaville, or rather in one part of Brazzaville. Three areas out of seven are living in a climate of insecurity due to the fact that, at one point, some of our political colleagues decided to look for a political solution by arming their militia's. Congo, however, is not made up of 80,000 inhabitants, but of 2 million. The rest of the country goes on living and working as normal. Having said this, we are concerned by the situation in Brazzaville. We have done everything for dialogue to prevail. The point about dialogue is that it does not bring immediate solutions: one has to be patient; one has to enter into constructive dialogue, and wait for the results. [Diop] Prime Minister, there have been several attempts at dialogue: Gabon has offered its mediation, which led to the Libreville accords in August. And yet every time, the violence has flared up again. Estimates give more than 200 killed since November in Brazzaville alone. For a population of 80,000, that is a lot. [Yhombi-Opango] Let us examine the problem rationally. The mediation, even that offered by Gabon, was essentially a mediation on problems arising from the elections. In other words, ensuring that a second round of voting could go ahead, which did indeed happen. Today, those people who are holding weapons consider that the arbitration college--which was set up by the Libreville accords, should announce the results of the elections. You have heard some opposition leaders declaring that, once the results have been announced, the situation will return to normal in Brazzaville. The fundamental problem, therefore, is the problem of power. People are fighting because--as President Pascal Lissouba has said--their stomachs are speaking. [Diop] Is this to say that President Lissouba, who was in power before the elections, has not accepted his defeat? [Yhombi-Opango] The simple reason I can give you is this: If he is armed, it is not because his life is in danger. I can tell you as prime minister that nobody is threatening either President Sassou-Nguesso or President Bernard Kolelas, who is a member of the National Assembly. [Diop] Would you agree to hold talks with President Denis Sassou-Nguesso. Political conflicts in Africa are often very personal. People say that there is a grudge between you and President Sassou and vice-versa. Would you agree to hold open, rational talks with President Denis Sassou-Nguesso in order to put an end to the violence? [Yhombi-Opango] Hold talks yes, but talk about what? [Diop] About peace. [Yhombi-Opango] But everyone wants peace. I am prime minister today, because President Pascal Lissouba thought it would be useful to appoint me to that position as one of the leaders of the presidential group who contributed to the victory of the Presidential group in the elections. I am not prime minister because I took up arms at some time. What we are looking for in the search for peace is respect for the institutions that we have set up freely. Now, if we are to talk in the context of a normal return to peace, because there are differences between one or the other, then we can talk, but as responsible politicians. [Diop] If problems were to persist, if dialogue did not lead to anything, don't you fear an Algerian-style situation; in other words, that there might be a third force, like the [Algerian] Higher State Council that was put into place after the cancellation of the 1992 elections? Would you not perhaps find yourselves back at square one, with the democratic process interrupted? [Yhombi-Opango] We have not reached this point. I think that in our country there is a state and a government that have a duty to protect the security of the people. I would say that we are giving dialogue and mediation every possible chance, so that everyone understands the necessity of taking part. There will come a time, however, when, as the authorities in charge of the government, we will have to take every responsibility for returning peace to the country. This is the price to pay in the building of our country. It is not a sign of weakness to have accepted--and the president of the Republic keeps insisting on this point--it is not a sign of weakness to seek dialogue. On the contrary. If we see that the efforts that we are making today do not have the expected results, then the government will take its responsibilities. [end recording] That was the Congolese prime minister, Joachim Yhombi-Opango. He was interviewed by Assane Diop. The representatives in France of the Congolese opposition have issued a strong protest against the presence of Mr. Opango in Paris. In a communique issued today, the Congolese opposition stresses that the fact that the commemoration of the Brazzaville Appeal is taking place in Paris [rather than Brazzaville] should alert international public opinion to the current situation in Congo.
