FR940720-1-00039 FR940720-1-00011 40 CFR Part 180 [OPP&hyph;3000346; FRL&hyph;4868&hyph;7] RIN 2070&hyph;AC18 Tetrachlorvinphos, Terbutryn, and Etridiazole; Removals AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: This document proposes to remove tolerances for residues of tetrachlorvinphos (2-chloro-1-(2,4,5-trichlorophenyl) vinyl dimethyl phosphate), terbutryn (2-tert-butylamino-4-ethylamino-6-methylthio- s -triazine), and etridiazole (5-ethoxy-3-(trichloromethyl)-1,2,4-thiadiazole) in or on certain raw agricultural commodities (RAC's). EPA is initiating this action because there are no current registrations associated with these food uses. The applicable registrations for these pesticide uses have been cancelled for nonpayment of maintenance fees and/or by company request. DATES: Written comments, identified by the document control number [OPP-300346], must be received on or before September 19, 1994. ADDRESSES: By mail, submit comments to: Public Response Section, Field Operations Division (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: By mail: Sherada D. Hobgood, Registration Division (7505W), Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: 6th Floor, 2800 Crystal Drive, Arlington, VA 22202, (703)-308-8352. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This document proposes the revocation of certain tolerances established under section 408 of the Federal, Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) (21 U.S.C. 346a) for residues of the insecticide tetrachlorvinphos, the herbicide terbutryn, and the fungicide etridiazole in or on certain RAC's. Since a tolerance is generally not necessary for a pesticide chemical which is not registered for a particular food use, EPA is initiating this action because all registered food uses associated with these tolerances have been cancelled. I. Discussion of Chemicals A. Tetrachlorvinphos EPA proposes to revoke the tolerances established for residues of the insecticide 2-chloro-1-(2,4,5-trichlorophenyl) vinyl dimethyl phosphate (tetrachlorvinphos) as listed in 40 CFR 180.252 in or on th following RAC's: (1) 110 parts per million in or on and corn fodder and forage (including field corn, sweet corn, and popcorn); (2) 10 parts per million in or on apples, cherries, corn grain, fresh corn including sweet corn (kernels plus cob with husk removed), cranberries, and pears; (3) 5 parts per million in or on tomatoes; (4) 0.1 part per million in or on peaches. Registered uses of the parent compound on these commodities were cancelled August 20, 1987. Action levels to replace revoked tolerances are not necessary based on: (1) the small number of detectable residues that were found during a period of time the tetrachlorvinphos was registered for use; (2) the low levels in the samples that were indicated in the findings; (3) the long period of time that had elapsed since tetrachlorvinphos was last registered for use in the U.S. (over 6 years); and (4) the fact that FDA did not detect any tetrachlorvinphos residues in its monitoring programs in recent years. B. Terbutryn EPA proposes to revoke the tolerances established for negligible residues (N) of the herbicide terbutryn (2-tert-butylamino-4-ethylamino-6-methylthio- s -triazine) as listed in 40 CFR 180.265 in or on the following RAC's: ␣ 1Commodity 1Parts per million Barley, fodder 0.1 (N) Barley, grain 0.1 (N) Barley, green 0.1 (N) Barley, straw 0.1 (N) Sorghum, grain 0.1 (N) Wheat, fodder 0.1 (N) Wheat, grain 0.1 (N) Wheat, green 0.1 (N) Wheat, straw 0.1 (N) Action levels to replace revoked tolerances are not required because: (1) Uses of terbutryn on these crops were all cancelled on or prior to October 10, 1989; (2) the tolerances for terbutryn on these commodities all reflect non-detectable residues in or on the treated commodities indicating that residues are minuscule even in the treated crop; and (3) FDA did not detect any terbutryn residues in its monitoring programs in recent years. Therefore, detectable residues are not likely to be found in subsequent crops as a result of past uses of terbutryn. C. Etridiazole EPA proposes to amend 40 CFR 180.370 to revoke the tolerance established for residues of the fungicide 5-ethoxy-3-(trichloromethyl)-1,2,4-thiadiazole (etridiazole) and its monoacid metabolite 3-carboxy-5-ethoxy-1,2,4-thiadiazole as listed in 40 CFR 180.370 in or on the following RAC: ␣ 1Commodity 1Parts per million Tomatoes 0.15 An action level to replace the revoked tolerance is not required because: (1) Use of etridiazole on the crop was cancelled in the mid-1980's; (2) the tolerance for etridiazole on the commodity reflects very low residues in or on the treated commodity, indicating that residues are low even in the treated crop; and (3) residues have degraded and dissipated from prior use. Therefore, detectable residues are not likely to be found in subsequent crops as a result of past uses of etridiazole. II. Solicitation of Comments Any person who has registered or submitted an application for registration of a pesticide chemical under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, as amended, that contains tetrachlorvinphos, terbutryn, and etridiazole may request, within 60 days after the publication of the document in the Federal Register , that this rulemaking proposal be referred to an Advisory Committee in accordance with section 408(e) of the FFDCA. Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposed regulation. Further, EPA is soliciting comments from anyone adversely affected by revocation of these tolerances. EPA requests that anyone adversely affected by these revocations submit information pertaining to why and provide specific information: (1) Are there any existing stocks of the chemicals?; (2) What amount of existing stocks remains?; (3) When will the stocks be depleted?; (4) How long would the commodities treated with these chemicals be in the channels of trade?; (5) Are any of these three pesticide chemicals used in foreign countries?; (6) Would residues of any of these three pesticide chemicals be present in or on commodities grown in foreign countries and imported into the United States? Comments must bear a notation indicating the document control number [OPP-300346]. All written comments filed in the Public Response to this document will be available for public inspection in the Public Response Section, at the Virginia address given above, from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays. The Agency has conducted an anaylsis in order to satisfy requirements as specified by Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act. This analysis is available for public inspection in Rm. 1128 at the Virginia address given above. III. Other Regulatory Requirements A. Executive Order 12866 Executive Order 12866 requires the Agency initially to determine whether a proposed regulatory action being proposed or issued is a ``significant'' rule and therefore subject to the requirements of the Executive Order (i.e., Regulatory Impact Analysis, review by the Office of Management and Budget [OMB]). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant'' as those actions likely to lead to a rule: (1) Having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also known as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore not subject to OMB review. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act This proposed rule has been reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-354; 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), and it has been determined that it will not have an economic impact on small businesses, small organizations, or small governmental jurisdictions. This regulatory action is intended to prevent the sale of food commodities containing pesticide residues where the subject pesticide has been used in an unregistered or illegal manner. Since all domestic registrations associated with these food uses of tetrachlorvinphos, terbutryn, and etridiazole have been cancelled, it is expected that no economic impact would occur at any level of business enterprise if these tolerances were revoked. Accordingly, I certify that this action does not require a separate regulatory flexibility analysis under the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
