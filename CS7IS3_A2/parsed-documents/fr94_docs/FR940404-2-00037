FR940404-2-00037 FR940404-2-00028 [Docket No. CP94&hyph;300&hyph;000] Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co. and Florida Gas Transmission Co.; Abandonment March 29, 1994. Take notice that on March 22, 1994, Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company (Tennessee), P.O. Box 2511, Houston, Texas 77252 and Florida Gas Transmission Company (FGT), P.O. Box 1188, Houston, Texas 77251, filed a joint application in Docket No. CP94&hyph;300&hyph;000 pursuant to section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act for permission and approval to abandon the exchange of natural gas, all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Tennessee and FGT propose to abandon the exchange of natural gas pursuant to a December 10, 1962 Gas Exchange Agreement included in Tennessee's FERC Gas Tariff as Rate Schedule X&hyph;17 and in FGT's FERC Gas Tariff as Rate Schedule E&hyph;2. Tennessee and FGT state that these rate schedules provide for the exchange of natural gas between the parties at the point where FGT's 24-inch main line crosses Tennessee's 30-inch Delta-Portland Line in Stone County, Mississippi. Tennessee and FGT state that since both parties have open access transportation certificates and have restructured their services under Order No. 636, there is no longer a need for the exchange service as certificated by the Commission. Tennessee states that it notified FGT of its intent to terminate the exchange agreement on April 30, 1993. FGT states that it agreed to this termination on January 18, 1994. Tennessee and FGT do not propose to abandon any facilities as a result of the authorization requested. Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before April 19, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211) and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to the jurisdiction conferred upon the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter finds that permission and approval for the proposed abandonment are required by the public convenience and necessity. If a motion for leave to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given. Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for Tennessee and FGT to appear or to be represented at the hearing. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
