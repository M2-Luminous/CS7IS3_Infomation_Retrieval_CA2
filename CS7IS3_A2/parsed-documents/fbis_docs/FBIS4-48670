The tour was organized by urban task force to show the diplomats the seriousness of the matter. The diplomats, who were led by the country director of the USAID, Mr. Keith Sharper, were accompanied by the minister of state for internal affairs, Mr. Tom Butime, and the chairman of the pan- African congress, Colonel Kahinda Otafiire. During the tour, the chairman of the urban task force, Mr. (Mike Mukula), revealed that, according to an aerial survey conducted last week, an estimated 40,000 floating bodies are on Uganda's part of Lake Victoria. He said this is a big threat to the people who live along the shores, as they directly use lake water. At Kasensero landing site, by yesterday, an average of 80 bodies were being reclaimed per hour. Mr. (Mukula) said already 600 hundred bodies had been observed approaching Mpigi, and if the situation is not contained, the beaches in Gaba and Entebbe may soon be affected. After the tour of the landing site, the diplomats attended a burial mass for the reclaimed bodies at Kitoma Village, seven km from the landing site. The mass, conducted by Archbishop Emmanuel Wamalwa of Kampala, attracted hundreds of wananchi [citizens] in the area, and Rwandese refugees in Uganda. The archbishop prayed for the return of sanity in Rwanda, and urged Ugandan Christians to pray for the war-torn country. The resident director of USAID, Mr. Sharper, termed events in Rwanda as a step backwards in the development of human race. He said such a problem knows no boundaries, and thanked Uganda for tackling the problem of floating bodies without hesitation. Speaking on behalf of African diplomats, Ambassador (Leonidas Habyarimana) of Burundi urged African countries to cultivate mature politics, in order to avoid acts similar to the Rwandan crisis. He regretted that, while Africa has a big potential wealth, bad politics is tearing the continent. He called for an immediate end to the situation. The British high commissioner, Mr. Edward Clay, termed the situation in Rwanda as a shame to modern society. He said it was sad that events that characterized Rwanda 30 years ago are happening again at a time when peace is crucial. The NRC [National Resistance Council] member for (Kakoto), Rakai District, Mr. (Manuel Pinto), challenged Kenya and Tanzania to join Uganda in the efforts of cleaning Lake Victoria. He urged Ugandans to unite and love one another, as hatred is the source of problems similar to what is happening in Rwanda. [passage omitted]
