Riot agents entered the "Saul Flores" Coed Urban School where members of the municipal electoral board were holding the boxes. Reports have indicated militants of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, Unity Movement, and Democratic Convergence have tried to keep the boxes from the PNC members, who succeeded in their objective without any major incidents. Representatives of the above parties did not allow TSE delegates to remove the ballot boxes on 20 March, claiming "fraud" was committed in the elections and that they should have been held in Jucuapa. The disgruntled party representatives warned if the TSE does not cancel the Jucuapa elections, the political parties that participated in the elections in that region "will adopt a municipal government elected by consensus." TSE Magistrate Dr. Jaime Romero Ventura has told EL DIARIO DE HOY "today (yesterday) at 0800 in the morning, all the voting material from Jucuapa reached the TSE." Romero added "because the vote counting could not take place in Jucuapa, they are doing it here in the hotel (Presidente)... but all (the information from) from Usulutan Department is indeed at TSE installations."
