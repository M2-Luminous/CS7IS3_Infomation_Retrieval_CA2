The first part of the program is an interview with Aleksandr Chalyy, chairman of the Legal Department within the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, and Konstantin Trishchenko, chief of the Department for Control Over Weapons and Disarmament within the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry by correspondent Syarhey Omelchuk. The second part of the program is a live phone-in question-and-answer program. The subject of the cast addresses the activities of Ukraine in the sphere of denuclearization and results of the tripartite Ukrainian-Russian-U. S. negotiations in Moscow. At 1313 GMT, touching upon opinions of various political groupings regarding the Moscow agreement, Aleksandr Chalyy says that "this tripartite declaration is the logical continuation of Ukraine's political activities on the international arena," and it fully corresponds to clause No. 9 of the Declaration of the National Sovereignty of Ukraine. In addition, he recalls that 90 percent of the population backed the text of this Declaration and "the Supreme Council has ratified the START treaty with reservations." Responding to the reporter's question on whether nuclear weapons are a deterring factor in relations with Ukraine's neighbors, the chairman of the Legal Department states that this theory was born in the USSR, and it demands the existence of reliable nuclear weapons and an aggressive military policy. "Ukraine has no operational control over its nuclear weapons and this policy cannot be used by us. In addition, we cannot produce nuclear weapons," he adds. At 1317, when asked to comment on security guarantees, Aleksandr Chalyy enumerates the principles -- territorial integrity, inviolability of borders, sovereignty, and independence of Ukraine -- saying that this document will be published tomorrow. Further, the talk shifted to prospects of the political development of Crimea. However, Mr. Chalyy refuses to answer this question and says that time will show what happens, however, the nuclear disarmament process does not in any case affect the political processes in the Crimea. "There are many regions even in Russia that want to become independent, however, Russian diplomacy is very careful in meeting their demands." At 1328 GMT, queried on the compensation mechanism, Konstantin Trishchenko recalls the Massandra agreement and Geneva negotiations on the issue and reminds that "Ukraine will receive free fuel for its nuclear power plants and new jobs will be created in the atomic power engineering field." In the second part of the program, at 1337 GMT, the listeners again ask about security guarantees for Ukraine and compensation for the Republic. Konstantin Trishchenko recommends that they read tomorrow's newspapers and repeats that the United States is a stable guarantor of Ukraine's security. Next, some listeners ask about the possibility of ratifying this agreement in the Supreme Council. Konstantin Trishchenko responds that the tripartite international treaty will be ratified "by all means." The final questions concern the general situation in the world regarding the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. The end of the program is unmonitorable.
