This shortage is caused by prolonged drought that devastated thousands of hectares of rice. During the rainy season the province put a total area of 65,000 hectares under rice cultivation or 65 percent of the plan. Nearly 30,000 hectares have been harvested with an average yield of over a tonne per hectare compared to a tonne and a half in the previous year. This year's rice production would be around 65,000 tonnes which could feed the province's population of 465,000 for only four months, says the same source.
