The attack resulted in 20 Red Wa soldiers being killed and 32 wounded, while the Khun Sa force suffered 20 killed and seven wounded. The Khun Sa force, however, successfully defended its base after thirty minutes of fighting and seized several weapons from the attackers. The clash was the first such incident after the signing of the peace accord in May by independent ethnic minority forces which oppose the Burmese Government. The Khun Sa force, however, does not have such an accord with the Burmese Government. The other ethnic minority groups hope that the Red Wa will keep its pledge to them. On the same evening, a ceremony was held in Tachilek to welcome new recruits who will join seven battalions of the 55th Division under Major General Swu Tun, commander of the Eastern Military Command, which came from Rangoon and Toungoo. The new augmented force is likely to participate in renewed fighting in the area.
