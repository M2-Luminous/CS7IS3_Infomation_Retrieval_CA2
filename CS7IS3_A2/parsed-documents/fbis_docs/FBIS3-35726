According to RESPUBLIKA (THE REPUBLIC), Shushkevich has become disagreeable to everybody in the parliament. "The parliament majority was not satisfied with his strongly negative attitude to the treaty on collective security, his uncertain stance on prospects of uniting Russian and Belarusian monetary systems, as well as on what sort of state system should be created in Belarus, and his keep-away from economic problems. "On the other hand, Shushkevich was objectionable to the parliament opposition who has shifted to radical nationalist or apparently pro-western views", the newspaper says. In RESPUBLIKA's opinion, another reason for ousting the unconvenient leader was that it was necessary to find and publicly demonstrate the major "culprit" of the delay in drafting a new constitution to masque the parliament's own failures. Otherwise, the parliament would face a threat of early elections, no faction in the parliament was interested in. However, according to the newspaper, Shushkevich's removal can hardly solve the parliament's problems, it will rather generate new ones. A "buffer" policy of the former speaker, though not facilitating the work on the draft constitution, sometimes made it possible to find a compromise between different factions and groups in the parliament. We cannot say with certainty that this will be possible insofar, as the parliament is now broken into two uncompromising camps, the newspaper concludes. "Shushkevich appeared a weak politician, who failed to realize until the very end that he does not fit the post", Anatoliy Maysenya, president of the centre for strategic studies "East-West" said in an interview with the SEM DNEY (the SEVEN DAYS), one of the most popular weekly papers in the republic. "His (Shushkevich's) permanent complaints about the lack of powers, about a relativity of the very post of the speaker only prove this", he added. "Genuine politicians never ask for power, they struggle for it and take it, and this is the essence of policy-making". "He has become a sort of stationary scenery picturing democratic hopes on the Belarusian political scene, over which both those marching to the right and those going to the left have become stumbling with an increasing frequency. Nothing has changed with his ousting". "Stanislav Shushkevich failed to protect himself and his values", Maysenya resumes. However, the Belarusian press does not give much attention to Shushkevich, being more concerned over the future. "People are tired", chief editor of SOVETSKAYA BELORUSSIYA (the SOVIET BELARUS) Igor Osinskiy writes addressing both the speaker and the deputies. "Our politicians are living in the vacuum, they do not hear and understand not only each other but the people on whose behalf they are acting and to whose opinion they like to refer. "If they could hear people, the former speaker would be ashamed to state that the Belarusians whole-heartedly welcomed the Mishkuli agreement. If they could hear people, the parliament opposition would know that the Belarusians are against the imposed Belarusification and break of relations with Russia." "You have exhausted the patience of the people, gentlemen. Go home", Osinsky says.
