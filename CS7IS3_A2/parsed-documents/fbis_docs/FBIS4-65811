This is stated in a study of the IW German Economic Research Institute, which was written on behalf of, and subsidized by, the European Commission. The IW argues that, since, in the framework of the convergence process during the next few years, monetary policy has been fixed at a strictly antiinflationary course and financial policy has been oriented at structural consolidation, wage policy errors can in the future no longer be covered up by an expansive governmental demand management. In addition, it will no longer be possible to devalue the currency to correct an exaggerated wage policy. In view of the recession, which has led to a drastic increase in unemployment throughout the European Union [EU], employers and trade unions are particularly called upon in the nineties to promote economic growth within the EU by pursuing a wage policy that must be aimed at combating rising costs and improving international competitiveness. They are also called upon to make an active wage policy contribution to solve employment problems. Competitive Disadvantage Through Higher Wage Unit Costs The IW study criticizes the fact that, in the recent past, the development of wages in many areas has been faster than the productivity rate, so that wage unit costs have increased steeply. With the changes in the international exchange rate mechanism, the EU's competitiveness toward the United States and Japan since 1985 has clearly deteriorated as far as wage costs are concerned. As a result, EU industrial products in 1992 involved wage costs that were almost 14 percent higher than comparable U.S. and Japanese products. According to the IW study, regarding EMU requirements, the undesirable wage policy developments in recent years cannot be corrected in one year or over several years by means of lower wage agreements. What is rather necessary is a lasting and sustained change of attitude among employers and trade unions. Employees should not primarily define their wage demands on a distribution policy basis, according to the formula of "productivity increase plus fully expected price increase plus redistribution component." Employers and trade unions should basically start operating a productivity-oriented wage policy. Such a policy confines the wage increase to the rate of increase of labor productivity and is thus aimed at a certain stability of wage unit costs. Then no cost-induced price increase will take place. To that extent, this form of wage policy is also stability-oriented and thus in line with the EMU. However, because the economy of the EU is currently in a situation of structural underemployment, the IW is going a step farther with its demands. According to the IW, an employment-oriented wage policy in this situation requires wage increases to be lower for a certain period of time than the productivity increase. This will improve the companies' profits. Since, in that case, capital profitability will increase, the scope for investment will also increase. Without such a clear stimulation of investment activities and the stimulation of growth, no improvement in the labor market can be expected, it says in the IW study. As a possible way to reach the goal of a wage policy that is less marked by distribution struggles, the IW recommends that employees should not only take part in the national income in the form of wages, but should also participate in the second type of the national income -- gross earnings from entrepreneurial activities and property. Trade unions and employees would then not have to fear that they could be left behind in distribution policy terms if they pursue a moderate wage policy. For companies, such a change of system would also pay. Labor and capital productivity would increase, as would the profitability of the capital invested. Profit-Oriented Wage Component According to the IW, a standardization of the wage creation systems in the individual EU member states cannot be expected, nor would it be appropriate. Nor does the IW see any economically convincing reasons for a wage policy centralization within the EU in the sense of supranational collective negotiations. On the contrary -- EU-wide pay settlements could not take the very different conditions and developments in the individual member states adequately into account and would thus rule out an increased orientation at productivity. The example of the Federal Republic shows that the introduction of the currency union does not entail any central, generally valid collective negotiations. Separate negotiations have been conducted for the old and new federal laender to make it possible to take their different capacities into account in pay settlements. To solve the European employment problems, the required moderate wage policy must be accompanied by structural reforms of the labor market, stresses the IW. In many countries, the current individual and collective legal regulations tend to reduce the employment policy effectiveness of collective bargaining policies.
