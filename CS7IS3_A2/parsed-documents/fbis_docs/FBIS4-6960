Kono, president of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), accused the coalition's core party Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] in particular of failing to take due process under parliamentary democracy. "Never lead Japan's politics on a wrong path," he said. [sentence as received] Kono did not go into specifics, although he was apparently referring to controversies involving issues such as taxes. In early February, Hosokawa announced plans to implement a 6 trillion yen tax cut and also to replace the 3 percent consumption tax with a 7 percent "national welfare tax." The new tax proposal, which was soon scrapped, was widely criticized as being hastily put out and being done abruptly in a closed-door meeting. Kono spoke at an LDP-sponsored fund-raising event in Okayama, some 730 kilometers west of Tokyo, on the eve of the Diet's election Monday of Shinseito head Tsutomu Hata as Japan's new prime minister. Hata is foreign minister in the cabinet of outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa.
