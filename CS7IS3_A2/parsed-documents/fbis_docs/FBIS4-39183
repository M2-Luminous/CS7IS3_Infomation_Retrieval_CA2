The topic of discussion was the 1994 state budget. Most discussions centered on the apparently insufficient proposals by departmental ministries with regard to cutting budget expenditures. If these proposals are taken as a basis, not only will the expenditures not be cut; rather, the earlier envisaged deficit will increase threefold. The participants of the sitting expressed fair doubts that the income part of the budget, which had been confirmed earlier, was feasible. Many enterprises and even branches of industry are currently loss-generating, while credit turnover is extremely low. A decision was made to petition for review by the Supreme Kenges the possibility of a gradual stage-by-stage increase of prices for bread and bakery products that currently are subsidized. The need for measures to protect the poorest segments of the population was also raised.
