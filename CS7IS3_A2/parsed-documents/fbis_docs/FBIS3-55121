Today, according to expert estimates, the physiologial survival basket costs 383,996 karbovanets, which is double the november figure. A more or less normal minimum consumer basket, comprising twenty products, now costs 900,738 karbovanets, while the average wages are much lower than that. NORMA-PRESS economists stress that all the measures taken by the government to raise minimal wages, pensions, scholarships, and allowances to poor families leave these sections of the population without any hope for even purely physiological survival.
