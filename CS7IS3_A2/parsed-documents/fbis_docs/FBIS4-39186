In comparison with the previous months of the current year, electricity production fell to 846 million kWh. Nevertheless, it is more than for the same period last year. Owing to fuel shortages the electricity plants are running into hardships, with most production accounted for by the Naryn cascade, which comprises five hydroelectric power stations working at full capacity. Two power generating units function at the Shemyldysayskaya plant, which is still under construction. The Republic plans to generate about 11.5 billion kWh this year.
