Klaus, however, did not specify what he meant by the term "ours" -- those of the Czech government, his ruling Civic Democratic Party (ODS), the Czech Republic in general or his own. He said that "emphases laid in Britain are closer to our emphases than in some other European countries." In a meeting with Czech journalists, however, he did not elaborate. In London, Klaus did not sign any agreements. He said he did not expect any impulse for Czech-British trade to result from his current visit. "It is not the business of premiers," he said, but added that talks he held in Britain dealt with the Czech Republic, which was "highly" esteemed there. Asked by CTK about a possible message for discussion on the Czech Republic's future local administrative arrangement which might ensue from the fact that Britain is a strictly unitary state, Klaus stressed the "necessity of the existence of a powerful state against the rest of the world." "The Czech lands were always strong enough when they had a powerful king and not when the estates argued and divided the country into many parts. The unitary character of Britain thus belongs to the same logic of my considerations," Klaus said. On his visit to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), he said that "the unreal character of how it was built at the cost of investments in countries that would need it was quite interesting for me." Klaus delivered a speech to a luncheon organized in central London by the Adam Smith Institute.
