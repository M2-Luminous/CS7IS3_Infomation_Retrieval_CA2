FBIS4-58965 "drnes090_j_94020" FBIS-NES-94-090 Daily Report 10 May 1994 ARABIAN PENINSULA Yemen Al-'Attas Rejects Dismissal Al-'Attas Rejects Dismissal EA1005094094 Aden Yemeni Republic Radio Network in Arabic 0330 GMT 10 May 94 EA1005094094 Aden Yemeni Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [Text] A responsible source at the office of Council of Ministers Chairman Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas has made a statement to the Yemeni news agency, SABA'. He said in the statement that there have been successive improvised and biased decisions from 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, the latest of which is a decision announced through the Sanaa news media to suspend Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas and to charge another person to carry out his duties. Earlier 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih issued a number of decisions suspending Defense Minister Haytham Qasim Tahir, Salih Abu-Bakr Bin-Husaynun, minister of oil and mineral resources, and Aden Governor Salih Munassar al-Syayli. The source said this type of decision reflects the state of bewilderment experienced by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih after his ill-fated decision to drown Yemen in a bloody war. He pointed out that these decisions not only contradict the Constitution which he trampled under foot when he declared the war, but also reflect the psychology of defeat which has controlled his mind following the setbacks suffered by the forces of his gang in more than one military position. He is now trying to patch up his shaky position before those he promised to occupy Aden within a few hours. The source confirmed that these decisions have been rejected in their entirety because they violate the Constitution and go against it. He clarified that confidence in the prime minister can only be withdrawn by the house of deputies. The ministers cannot be dismissed except publicly and with the prime minister's consent. When this occurs or when the prime minister resigns himself, the entire Council of Ministers must be considered as having resigned. The source wondered: What can we expect from the man who ignited the war, the strife, and the civil war? What can we expect from the man who directs his guns against the citizens and children and stabs at the very heart of unity? What can we expect other than these stupid decisions through which he is implementing his secessionist goals. The source ridiculed such decisions and said they have no impact whatsoever after the war decision adopted by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. He pointed out that these decisions are additions to the declaration of war by means of which he announced the liquidation of unity and the liquidation of everything that would remind him of it. The source concluded by saying that all the decisions issued by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih are constitutionally invalid and are (?capricious) and unrecognized. He said that the theatrical farce being implemented by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his gang after the war decision cannot fool anybody, particularly as he cancelled the legitimacy of unity and adopted a secessionist decision by declaring war on 27 April. It is a decision he will not be permitted to achieve because unity is the will of the people, and they will defend it to the last breath of life.
