FR941205-0-00112 FR941205-0-00026 Discussion of the Three Species Melicope adscendens was first collected by Charles Noyes Forbes at Auwahi on the southwestern slopes of Haleakala in 1920. Harold St. John and Edward P. Hume (St. John 1944) later named and described the species as Pelea adscendens, choosing the specific epithet to describe the habit of the plant. Thomas G. Hartley and Benjamin C. Stone (1989, Stone et al. 1990, Wagner et al. 1990) synonymized the genus Pelea with Melicope, resulting in M. adscendens, the current name for this species. Melicope adscendens is a sprawling shrub with long, slender branches covered with gray hairs when young and becoming hairless when older. New growth is covered with many fine, yellowish to golden brown hairs. The opposite, widely spaced, leathery to papery, elliptic leaves measure 1.5 to 6.5 cm (0.6 to 2.6 in) long and 1 to 4 cm (0.4 to 1.6 in) wide and have petioles 0.6 to 1.6 cm (0.2 to 0.6 in) long. Both upper and lower surfaces of mature leaves are hairless. Each flower cluster is on a main stalk 13 to 17 mm (0.5 to 0.7 in) long and comprises one to three flowers on individual stalks usually 4 to 8 mm (0.2 to 0.3 in) long. Only female flowers have been observed, and each consists of four sepals about 3.5 mm (0.1 in) long, four petals about 5 mm (0.2 in) long, an eight-lobed nectary disk, eight reduced and nonfunctional stamens, and a hairless four-celled ovary. The 14 to 15 mm (0.6 in) wide fruit is made up of 4 distinct follicles (dry fruits splitting along one side) 7 to 7.5 mm (0.3 in) long. Sepals and petals remain attached to the mature fruit. The endocarp (inner fruit wall) and the wrinkled exocarp (outer fruit wall) are both hairless. Melicope adscendens is distinguished from other species of the genus by its habit, the distinct follicles of its fruit, and the persistent (remaining attached) sepals and petals (Stone 1969, Stone et al. 1990). Melicope adscendens has been found only on the island of Maui on the southwestern slope of Haleakala. Two plants, separated by an unspecified distance, were found by Forbes in 1920. Today, one of these plants is still known to exist near Puu Ouli on privately owned land; the other plant has not been relocated. This species typically grows in Olopua Lowland Mesic Forest with hala pepe as a co-dominant at elevations between 914 and 1,200 m (3,000 and 3,900 ft). Associated taxa include Chamaesyce celastroides var. lorifolia ('akoko), Dodonaea viscosa (a'ali'i), Pouteria sandwicensis ('ala'a), and Styphelia tameiameiae (pukiawe). The plant grows next to a water pipeline on land used as a cattle ( Bos taurus ) ranch. Major threats are habitat damage and trampling by cattle, competition with the alien plant species Lantana camara (lantana) and Pennisetum clandestinum (Kikuyu grass), and reduced reproductive vigor and/or extinction from stochastic events due to the existence of only one known population with one individual. Potential threats include habitat degradation and damage to plants by feral axis deer ( Axis axis ), goats ( Capra hircus ), feral pigs ( Sus scrofa ), black twig borer ( Xylosandrus compactus ), fire, and ranch activities (such as water pipeline maintenance) (HHP 1992a; Art Medeiros, Haleakala National Park, Robert Hobdy, Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources, and Steve Perlman, Hawaii Plant Conservation Center, pers. comms., 1992). Melicope balloui was first collected by Horace Mann, Jr., and William Tufts Brigham in 1864 or 1865. When Wilhelm Hillebrand (1888) named this plant Pelea mannii, he cited this specimen as well as a specimen which is now thought to be P. peduncularis. If Mann and Brigham's specimen is chosen as the type of P. mannii, the correct name for the taxon will be M. mannii, and M. balloui will become a synonym (Stone et al. 1990). When naming P. balloui, Rock (1913) based his name on a specimen he had collected in 1910. Rock chose the specific epithet to honor Howard M. Ballou, who corrected the proof sheets of his landmark book on Hawaiian indigenous trees (Rock 1913). The specimen St. John cited as the type when he named and described P. ukuleleensis actually comprised material of both P. balloui and P. clusiaefolia, both previously validly published names (Stone 1963). Following the transfer of the genus Pelea to Melicope (Hartley and Stone 1989, Wagner et al. 1990), authors of the current treatment of the Hawaiian members of the genus (Stone et al. 1990) now consider P. balloui and P. ukuleleensis to be synonyms of M. balloui.
