Our correspondent Hayim Hecht reports that in a meeting with the Labor Knesset caucus, Peres said that Mubarak's regime handles fundamentalist violence with political wisdom and appropriate force. Peres stressed that signs of economic development are clearly visible in Egypt. The foreign minister sharply attacked the Syrian attitude toward the peace process. He said that we have a right to demand that it raise the level of negotiators to that of heads of state or senior ministers. The Syrians must adjust to international standards. We will not get far if we continue the Syrian way of negotiating. The talks with them are still bogged down, Peres said.
