It also highlights the need to strengthen the federal system of government, change the status of Buenos Aires City, and broaden the framework of citizens' rights and guarantees. The text was approved during the UCR National Convention that was in session until early this morning at the Asturian Center in Vicente Lopez. The text makes it clear that "in full exercise of the plenary's authority," it drafted the UCR platform "pursuant to the provisions of the party's national by-laws." The platform's most salient points concerning the system of checks and balances include the establishment of the post of cabinet chief, shortening the president's and vice president's terms of office to four years, the direct election of the president and vice president through a first round and a runoff, and regulating the president's power to issue decrees in cases of emergency or need. It further endorses the direct election of three senators for each constituency as of 1995, streamlining the process of enacting laws, and Congress' power to decide on federal intervention and strengthening its role as a check on the executive branch. With a view to buttressing the country's legal security and the judiciary's independence, the UCR tract demands that a Council for Magistrates be established for the appointment of federal judges and Supreme Court justices -- whose nomination will have to be confirmed by the Senate by a two-third majority of those present at the session -- and trial by jury as a procedure to remove low-level judges from office. Moreover, it calls for strengthening the federal system of government and municipal autonomy through the redefinition of financial relations between the federal and provincial governments, which will include setting up a revenue-sharing plan and giving provinces the power to administer their own resources without any interference from the federal government. It also states that the federal plan should entail the possibility of signing international agreements that do not tamper with the federal government's authority, stipulating a deadline for a federal intervention, and acknowledging the principle of municipal authority. The UCR platform also underscores the importance of changing the status of Buenos Aires City by acknowledging its autonomy and its special rights concerning legislation and jurisdiction. It proposes setting up a constituent assembly for Buenos Aires City in order to organize its institutions. With regard to citizens' rights and guarantees, the platform provides for the incorporation of semi-direct democracy mechanisms like the right to petition and nonbinding referendums or plebiscites. It further provides for the express upholding of habeas corpus; constitutional guarantees for the protection of civil rights; the defense of user and consumer rights against constraining practices, monopolistic attempts, or undue privileges; and constitutional acknowledgement of political parties. Finally, the tract stresses the need to have a qualified majority to modify the system of elections and political parties, as well as the laying down of rules that guarantee the defense of democracy.
