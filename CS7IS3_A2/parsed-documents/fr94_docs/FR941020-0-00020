FR941020-0-00020 FR941020-0-00005 Indicated Companies and Hadson contend that posting of tariff waivers should be continued. They argue that tariff waivers can provide competitive benefits to affiliates as significant as discounts and that viewing such waivers at the pipelines' offices is unduly burdensome. Hadson contends that requiring shippers to travel to pipeline offices to view waivers is an anachronism in an age when computer technology can provide such data instantaneously. Hadson contends that complaints should continue to be posted because they may help shippers detect patterns of abuse. The Commission will not reinstate the requirements to post tariff waivers and complaints on EBBs. Complaints are individual concerns between the pipeline and their customers and complaints that are resolved amicably would not generally provide indications of abuse. Complaints which are not resolved can be referred to the Commission, and the Commission will be able to discern any patterns of abuse. With respect to tariff waivers, the potential benefits from EBB postings may be outweighed by the programming and other computer and administrative costs of placing such waivers on pipeline EBBs. The Commission, however, agrees that shippers should have reasonable access to such waiver information without having to travel to pipeline offices to copy the waivers. The Commission, therefore, will amend Standard K to require pipelines to provide a copy of the log of tariff waivers to anyone requesting it within 24 hours of the request. The pipelines can then choose the most expedient method of complying, whether that may be posting the tariff waivers on their EBBs or providing them using facsimile machines. IX. Coordination of the Affiliate Requirements With Part 284 Requirements Pipelines have requested that the Commission coordinate its affiliate regulations with some of its Part 284 regulations to eliminate duplicative requirements and make these requirements consistent. ANR/CIG contends that the Commission should eliminate the requirement to include in the initial reports required by §284.106(a)(3) the points between which natural gas is to be transported and the state of the source of gas, because the Commission, in Order No. 566, removed similar maintenance requirements relating to source and destination of gas. Columbia/Columbia Gulf and Tenneco contend that the requirements for pipelines to file discount information under §284.7(d)(5)(iv) is unnecessary since pipelines must maintain even more extensive discount information under §250.16(d). Tenneco further argues that the semi-annual storage reports required by §§284.106(g) and 284.126(g) require information also required by the affiliate regulations and only one requirement should be retained. The Commission will not make piecemeal changes in its Part 284 requirements in this proceeding. For example, the Part 284 discount reporting requirements are not identical with the requirements of §250.16(d): the Part 284 reports are publicly available while the more extensive §250.16 information is not. Similarly, in the EBB proceedings in Docket No. RM93&hyph;4&hyph;000, the Commission has been considering industry proposals to replace the initial reports with an electronic Index of Purchasers. 30 The Commission already is examining its regulations in light of the changes caused by Order No. 636 and revisions to these requirements will be made at the appropriate time when all the regulations can be considered as a whole. 30 Order No. 563&hyph;A, III FERC Stats. & Regs. Preambles, at 31,047&hyph;49. X. Applicability of the Regulations The Commission is revising the definition of marketing in §161.2(c) as a result of the Commission's recent order 31 eliminating all of its producer regulations at Part 270 due to the passage of the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act (Decontrol Act). 32 Section 161.2(c) currently defines marketing, in relevant part, as ``a first sale of natural gas as that term is defined in §270.203 of this chapter, or a sale of natural gas in interstate commerce for resale*␣*␣*.'' Since §270.203 has been removed, the Commission is revising the definition so as to maintain the same coverage as the previous definition. 31 Removal of Outdated Regulations Pertaining To The Sales of Natural Gas Production, 59 FR 40240 (Aug. 8, 1994), III FERC Stats. & Regs. Preambles ¶30,909 (July 28, 1994). 32 Pub. L. No. 101&hyph;60; 103 Stat. 157. Section 270.203(c) used the Commission's authority under the Natural Gas Policy Act (NGPA) to define any sale by an affiliate of an interstate pipeline as that affiliate's first sale of natural gas. 33 Under the NGPA, first sales include sales to interstate and intrastate pipelines, sales to local distribution companies, sales to any person for use by that person, as well as any sale preceding the enumerated sales. 34 If first sale status for marketing affiliates were removed (without the revision made here) a substantive change in coverage would occur, because the definition would not apply to certain direct sales by pipeline marketing affiliates that were previously covered by the definition of marketing. Accordingly, the definition of marketing will be revised to ensure that no substantive change occurs. The revised regulation will read as follows: 33 Under the NGPA, sales by pipeline marketing affiliates generally would not be first sales. The Commission used its authority to define pipeline affiliates as making first sales to prevent possible circumvention by pipeline affiliates of the maximum lawful price provisions of the NGPA. 15 U.S.C. 3301(21)(A)(v). 34 15 U.S.C. 3301(21)(A)(i)&hyph;(iv). Thus, the prior definition of marketing in §161.2 applied both to sales for resale and direct sales made by pipeline marketing affiliates. Marketing or brokering as used in this part and §250.16 of this chapter means a sale of natural gas to any person or entity by a seller that is not an interstate pipeline, except when: (1) the seller is selling gas solely from its own production; (2) the seller is selling gas solely from its own gathering or processing facilities; or (3) the seller is an intrastate natural gas pipeline or a local distribution company making an on-system sale. This definition effects no change in substantive coverage under the regulations. The regulations continue to apply only to pipeline affiliates that are engaging in gas sales activities that would compete with independent marketers. The definition does not apply to producers, gatherers, and processors, acting in their traditional roles of selling gas from their own production, gathering, or processing facilities, or to intrastate pipelines and local distribution companies acting in their traditional roles of making on-system sales of gas. 35 These entities will be included as marketers only to the extent that their activities go beyond their traditional roles and they make sales for which an independent marketer could compete. Because the revision has no substantive effect on the rights of any party, the Commission determines that good cause exists under the APA for finding that notice and public comment on these revisions is unnecessary and contrary to the public interest. 36 35 Order No. 497&hyph;A, 54 FR 52781 (Dec. 22, 1989), FERC Stats. & Regs. [Regulations Preambles 1986&hyph;1990] ¶30,868, at 31,592 (1989). 36 5 U.S.C. 553(b). See National Helium Corporation v. Federal Energy Administration, 569 F.2d 1137, 1145&hyph;46 (Emer. Ct. App. 1978). Columbia/Columbia Gulf, INGAA, and Enron point out that the applicability sections of §161.1 and §250.16 and Standards E and H refer to affiliates rather than marketing affiliates. They assert that the regulations have only applied to marketing affiliates in the past and request the Commission to revise these regulations to make this clear. The Commission will revise the regulations to make clear that they apply only to marketing affiliates.
