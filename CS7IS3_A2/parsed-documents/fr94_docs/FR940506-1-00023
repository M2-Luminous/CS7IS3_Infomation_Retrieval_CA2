FR940506-1-00023 FR940506-1-00010 There are approximately 4,000 U.S. manufacturers and importers of recreational vessels. They manufacture or import an estimated 2,000,000 recreational vessels annually. Eighty percent are built by major manufacturers. For those manufacturers the Coast Guard estimates five minutes per vessel to determine the HIN and affix it to the vessel: .80×2,000,000=1,600,000 vessels 5×1,600,000=8,000,000 minutes=133,333 hours. Twenty percent of the vessels are built by small and often non-sophisticated manufacturers. For those manufacturers the Coast Guard estimates 15 minutes per vessel to determine the HIN and affix it to the vessel: .20×2,000,000=400,000 vessels 15×400,000=6,000,000 minutes=100,000 hours. An estimated 17,000 individuals build their own vessels annually. Individuals building their own vessels are assigned an entire Hull Identification Number by the State in which they reside. The Coast Guard estimates that it takes an individual approximately 15 minutes to affix the HIN to a vessel: 17,000×15=255,000 minutes=4,250 hours 133,333+100,000+4,250=237,583 hours a total annual burden. This total annual burden estimate would vary from year to year depending upon the state of the national economy which impacts upon annual production figures. There is also no practical way to estimate the burden per respondent for the proposed COO requirement. The respondents are vessel manufacturers and importers and State vessel registration and numbering authorities and members of the public who build their own vessels. Most manufacturers with a computer will not suffer from significant burdens, because the computer can be programmed to generate completed COOs. For those manufacturers the Coast Guard estimates 3 minutes per vessel to complete a COO: .80×2,000,000=1,600,000 vessels 3×1,600,000=4,800,000 minutes=80,000 hours. Twenty percent of the vessels are built by small and often non-sophisticated manufacturers. For those manufacturers the Coast Guard estimates 5 minutes per vessel to type the required information (security standards would require that the COO be machine prepared): .20×2,000,000=400,000 vessels 5×400,000=2,000,000 minutes=33,333 hours. Approximately 17,000 individuals build their own vessels annually. The States assign Hull Identification Numbers to individuals building their own vessels. For individuals the Coast Guard estimates 30 minutes per vessel to obtain a COO from the State. 30×17,000=510,000=8,500 hours. States and territories participating in VIS and assigning Hull Identification Numbers would have computers to generate the COO and HIN on the basis of information supplied by an individual. The Coast Guard estimates 5 minutes for States or territories to enter information about a vessel into a computer and generate a COO: 5×17,000=85,000=1,416 hours 80,000+33,000+8,500+1,416=122,916 hours total annual burden. This annual burden estimate could be substantially higher or lower from year to year depending upon the state of the national economy, which impacts upon annual production figures. Federalism The Coast Guard has analyzed this proposal in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has determined that this proposal does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. These regulations will benefit State boating authorities enforcing State titling and registration regulations. Title 46 U.S.C. 4302 authorizes the Coast Guard to establish HIN regulations. Unless the Secretary provides an exemption, a State may not establish, continue in effect, or enforce a law or regulation that is not identical to a regulation prescribed under 46 U.S.C. 4302. Therefore, the Coast Guard intends to preempt State and local laws and regulations which are not identical to the Coast Guard's HIN or COO requirements. Title 46 U.S.C. chapter 125 requires the Coast Guard to establish VIS requirements. The States' participation in VIS is entirely voluntary; however, once a State elects to participate, it must comply with the requirements of VIS in order to ensure the integrity and uniformity of the system. Therefore, only those States meeting all of the VIS requirements will be allowed to participate in the VIS system, and the Coast Guard would preempt State and local laws prescribing requirements for VIS which are not identical to those the Coast Guard prescribes. Environment The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this proposal and concluded that under section 2.b.2(1) of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this proposal is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. This proposal governs labeling and the issuance of COOs for vessels, and has no environmental consequences. A Categorical Exclusion Determination is available in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under ADDRESSES. List of Subjects in 33 CFR Part 181 Labeling, Marine safety, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Incorporation by reference. For the reasons set out in the preamble, the Coast Guard proposes to amend 33 CFR part 181 as follows: PART 181_MANUFACTURER REQUIREMENTS 1. The authority citation for part 181 is revised to read as follows: Authority: 46 U.S.C. 4302, 12501, 12502; 49 CFR 1.46. 2. In §181.3, paragraph (f) is revised to read as follows:
