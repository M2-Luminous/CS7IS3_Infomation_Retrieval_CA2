FBIS3-29652 "dreas035_d_94007" FBIS-EAS-94-035 Document Type:Daily Report 22 Feb 1994 South Korea Papers Examine Debate Over Patriot Deployment SK2202110794 SK2202110794 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] Seoul vernacular newspapers on 22 February carry editorials on the possible deployment of Patriot missiles to the ROK. The moderate CHOSON ILBO on page 3 carries an 800-word editorial entitled, "Dispute Over the Patriot Missile." The editorial notes that it is understandable that "the deployment of the Patriot missile will be helpful in maintaining security on the Korean peninsula, but if the government is to purchase it for a high price, it will have to examine its feasibility and effectiveness." The editorial goes on to say that it seems that "the Defense Ministry does not have a clear policy on this matter." The editorial says that "if the Patriot missile is a weapon that can effectively take countermeasures against North Korea's airplanes and Scud missiles, it will be of help in deterring war on the Korean peninsula." However, it notes that the plan to deploy the Patriot missile is not purely to build up defense capability and goes on to explain that the Patriot missile is now "out-of-date," and stresses the need to make "prudent" examinations before making a decision on introducing the Patriot missile. The editorial then elaborates on the ROK arms system which is dependent on the United States and notes that the ROK must revise its system in introducing arms. The editorial concludes by stressing the need to guarantee transparency in the process of introducing arms, and that there must be a device to effectively execute the defense budget in its military capability. The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN on page 3 carries an 800-word editorial entitled, "The Deployment of the Patriot Missile to the U.S. Forces Stationed in the ROK." The editorial starts by saying that "dispute over the deployment of Patriot missiles to the ROK is divided." The editorial says that there is disagreement regarding this matter between the ROK and the United States but notes that it is not a big problem. It goes on to explain that the examination of deploying the Patriot missile is a just matter because "North Korea has already reserved large amounts of chemical and biological weapons and has succeeded in the test of its medium range missile which has a range of 1,000 km." It notes that the deployment of the Patriot missile is the best way to deal with North Korea's missile development. The editorial continues to say that there is no reason to oppose the deployment of the Patriot missile to the ROK, and stresses that "the deployment of the Patriot missile to the U.S. forces in the ROK and introducing it to the ROK Army are different issues." The editorial concludes by saying that "since there is no effective alternative," it hopes that "regardless of North Korea's nuclear development, the up-to-date Patriot missile can be deployed to U.S. forces stationed in the ROK as soon as possible."
