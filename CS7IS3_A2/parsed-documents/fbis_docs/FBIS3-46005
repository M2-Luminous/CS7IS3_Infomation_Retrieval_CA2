The discovery has prompted authorities to warn Chinese consumers again to be on the lookout for fake and shoddy goods. Fabricated motors, mechanical equipment and high-tech products have joined the list of fake name brand liquors, cigarettes, medicine, fertilizers and pesticides. According to Li Chuanqing, newly appointed Director General of the State Technology Supervision Administration (STSA), one of the most serious new cases involves fake Dong Feng trucks. According to Li, more than 4,000 such fake trucks have been found on the roads. This has resulted in an estimated loss of 40 million yuan ($4.59 million) to the State and also to the maker, the Dongfeng Motor Corporation, which is based in Hubei Province. Analysts believe some 16,000 more fake trucks are in service, he added. Meanwhile, some enterprises in Zhejiang's Pingyang County and Fujian's Fuding County have sold assembled mechanical equipment to landlocked regions at more than 60 million yuan ($6.89 million). When the machine tools arrived in these 26 provinces and municipalities under the name of "joint ventures," they failed to operate and turned out to be waste parts. The central government is now investigating these matters and is prepared to levy tougher penalties on producers. Counterfeit products in the high tech sector include computer software, anti-virus disks and laser symbol detectors. Li vowed to further carry on the drive against counterfeit goods, which was started six years ago. Last year, the country handled 91,017 cases involving fake and shoddy goods, sentenced 470 people and executed four. One of the latest cases reported by the Beijing-based Worker's Daily [GONGREN RIBAO] said that a firm in Shenzhen was ordered to pay a fine of 8.2 million yuan ($940,000) and had its earnings of 2.8 million yuan ($320,000) confiscated for selling counterfeit Maotai, a Chinese brand liquor.
