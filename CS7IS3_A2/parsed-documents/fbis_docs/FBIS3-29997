The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, argued there could be no figure (for such a target) that Japan could attain and satisfy the United States at the same time. His remarks were in response to a comment made in the business community to propose to the U.S. as an "objective criteria" a target of setting a ratio of Japan's current-account surplus to its gross domestic product (GDP). "Even if there should be target figures which can satisfy the U.S. Administration, (setting such targets) would only serve as a stopgap measure. In a couple of years, (U.S.-Japan relations) would get worse," he said.
