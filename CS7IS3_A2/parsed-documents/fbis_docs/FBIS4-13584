FBIS4-13584 "drnes077_m_94009" FBIS-NES-94-077 Daily Report 20 Apr 1994 JORDAN IAF Deputy Cited on Detainees' Release, Hamas `Bridle' IAF Deputy Cited on Detainees' Release, Hamas `Bridle' JN2004141294 Amman AL-BILAD in Arabic 20 Apr 94 p 4 JN2004141294 Amman AL-BILAD Arabic BFN [Excerpts] Over the past few days security agencies have released a considerable number of detainees in response to pressure from Islamic Action Front [IAF] desputies. The IAF deputies met Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali more than a week ago and presented him with a memorandum that spelled out the IAF's view on the recent wave of arrests, and including a list of the detainees. The exact number of those that were released is not known. Deputy Hamzah Mansur told AL-BILAD that two al-Ahliyah [National] University students were released, as well as 'Abd-al-Majid Diyah, an IAF leader in Amman's fifth electoral district. An al-Rysayfah youth and a University of Jordan student were also released. Asked by AL-BILAD whether the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, in Jordan, or other Islamic groups, were officially asked by the government to keep a low profile in light of the recent U.S. and Israeli escalation, Hamzah Mansur said he had not met any Hamas representatives in Jordan over the past few days and had no idea about any government demand in this connection. [passage omitted] Regarding the recent U.S.-Israeli threats, Mansur said U.S. decision making is linked with the decisions of the Israeli Foreign Ministry. The Zionist administration in Palestine is confused and does not know how to act. Imagine its reaction if the 'Afula and Hadera operations been launched via the Jordan River. Mansur added: If the government wants to say that Hamas has no organization on Jordanian territory, this is acceptable. However, if our government wants to bridle those who speak about our people's suffering and the operations in Palestine, then it is wrong, because each Jordanian citizen talks about the operations inside Palestine and the suffering of its people. Mansur added: With all due respect to the government, the current situation might warrant the government's reconsideration of its program and formation. Until this happens, I demand that the government think primarily of how to be a truthful image of this people, which has a great measure of pride and self-esteem. [passage omitted]
