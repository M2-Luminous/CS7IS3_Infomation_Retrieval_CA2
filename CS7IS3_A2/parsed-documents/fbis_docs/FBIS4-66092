A communique released here by the Socialist group in the European Parliament said that the threat was contained in a letter that Labor leader Pauline Green had sent to British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd. In the letter, Green claimed that the Labor deputies would refuse to vote for the investiture of a new Commission as called for by the Maastricht Treaty, if Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi were to name a neofascist to the European Commission. The threatened move is backed by Labor's allies in the largest political group in the European Parliament, she said, and if carried out would plunge the EU immediately into "an unprecedented crisis." The document went on to say that the Commission would be politically paralyzed if it did not obtain the approval of the only institution within the European Union which was directly elected. Green concluded by announcing that Labor deputies and their Socialist allies in the European Parliament would refuse to cooperate with any fascist minister and would veto any attempt to name a neofascist as a Commission member.
