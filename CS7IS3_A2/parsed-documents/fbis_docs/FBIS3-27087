The Chinese side put forward a whole set of opinions on the overall financing plan on the airport construction at Chek Lap Kok as early as last August. But the British side failed to respond for a half-year period, Guo said after attending a local Spring Festival gathering. Therefore, Guo stated, China should not be responsible for the delay of the construction of the new Hong Kong airport. He regarded two British blames as "contradictive". One saying China doesn't raise any proposal on the airport financing plan, while other saying the new proposal recently advanced by the British side satisfied all the demands raised by the Chinese side. If the Chinese side never advanced any opinions, how could it be possible to say the British side has satisfied all the Chinese demands? Guo asked. He said the Chinese side had studied some problems with the British plan, the fourth one proposed by Britain. However, he added, "the airport issue covers a wide range of subjects, we are studying further into some problems and will exchange opinions with the British side." The Sino-British negotiation on the airport issue will have to be opened. But it depends necessary preparations before hand, he said. [sentence as received]
