He has told TIESA's reporter Jolanta Zilinskaite about his first official duties. [Zilinskaite] It is said that a new broom sweeps clean. With what duties did you begin work in your new position? [Stankevicius] I am continuing the work begun by others. I have participated in the creation and restructuring of the social security system for several years. Although being pushed around as a chess piece, an individual enjoyed a minimum of security in socialist times. As we are trying to move toward a modern market economy, we must understand that all principles of social security are changing in essence. A human being must begin to provide for himself or herself, while the key task of the state is to help those who really cannot survive without its assistance. Our country is still very poor. Thus, we cannot pay such benefits to unemployed people all year round as in other states, which would be sufficient to live on. The Seimas [parliament] and the government must draft definite laws, while a person should receive assistance at his or her place of residence. So, we want to assist local self-governments in organizing such work. We think that local social security services should expand such activities more actively. We have definite proposals how to help them. The state has assigned some means for this, while the EC, which is ready to help us, has promised to supply the aforementioned services with computers through the PHARE [Poland and Hungary Action for Restructuring the Economy]. This is one of such broader initiatives, while my everyday work is routine. Although much criticized, the social insurance system "Sodra," is doing its work, as well as the labor exchange. Services for retraining of adults encounter more difficulties. They should help jobless people react quickly to the current situation -- to either improve their skills, learn new jobs, or engage in private business. It is very important that the State Labor Inspection get down to serious work, because many job injuries, accidents, and occupational diseases still occur in Lithuania, and a "black" labor market is emerging, where the people are unprotected. I agree with the criticism that social security is not sufficiently balanced. There are many pressing problems that are even hard to list. For example, we compensate part of the expenses for urban pensioners, while rural pensioners who buy expensive fuel do not have such compensation. [passage omitted] [Zilinskaite]Does state assistance reach primarily those who require it most of all? What is to be done to prevent those who can earn a living on their own from collecting benefits? [Stankevicius] The larger part of assistance really reaches such people. However, there are different cases. I think that one or another trader from Gariunai [large market-place in the suburbs of Vilnius] receives unemployment benefits from the Labor Exchange. What must be done to prevent this? First of all, the state must have such a mechanism that would assess the real income of each citizen. The law on the declaration of income is, probably, the best outcome. However, this is not so simple. Therefore, we do not intend to idle about. We are drafting proposals to toughen existing laws. [Zilinskaite] People's life is hard, while the state budget coffers are empty. There are no means for supporting all those who cannot earn a living. While the Seimas is debating the budget for next year, I would like to ask you whether there are any possibilities for assigning more money from the budget for the poor? [Stankevicius] Even if all of next year's budget was earmarked for social security, this sum would not be too large. Seriously speaking, the social sector receives about 43 percent of the budget money. This includes both health care and education, because all three of these issues mean social security. We must help the needy. However, the most important issue today is to create conditions for profitable jobs. Currently, about 7 percent of Lithuanian residents receive the lowest reward, that is, 48 litai a month. We are often reprimanded for this. Even the average pension is only 103 litai. Certainly, we could increase the minimum wage to 90-100 litai. However, if they become mandatory, no one would be able to pay less, and the number of jobless people would climb several times. That is why we are discussing which is better -- to leave people without work straight away or allow them to earn something, because we have no means to support the unemployed. Neither of these options are good! [Zilinskaite] It looks like the number of jobs will drop considerably next year. How are you going to create new jobs? [Stankevicius] The official current figure of jobless people in Lithuania is 30,800. However, that is only the tip of the iceberg -- many people work part-time, some of them are on leave without pay, while others simply do not apply to the employment office and earn a living anyway they can. I think that the restructuring of industry will bring many enterprises to bankruptcy in the near future. We are preparing for mass unemployment. I pray that our predictions do not come true. I suppose, however, that we may have about 200,000 jobless people by the end of the coming year. The experience of most countries shows that the constant unemployment rate is about 10 percent. The same is likely to inevitably occur here, at least until the economy gets back on its feet. Private structures must create new jobs. The possibilities of the state are very much restricted. Therefore, it is necessary to grant credits and tax privileges to businessmen, and create the most favorable conditions for foreign investments. Employment is the outcome of the state's economic policy. [passage omitted]
