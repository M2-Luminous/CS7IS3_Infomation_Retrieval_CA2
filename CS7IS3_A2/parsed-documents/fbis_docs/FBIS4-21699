FBIS4-21699 "jptnd009___94086" JPRS-TND-94-009 JPRS PROLIFERATION ISSUES 14 April 1994 INTERNATIONAL ROK Dailies on Discussion With PRC on DPRK Nuclear Issue ROK Dailies on Discussion With PRC on DPRK Nuclear Issue SK3003125294 SK3003125294 BFN [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of editorials carried by ROK vernacular newspapers on 30 March commenting on the ROK-China discussion on the North Korean nuclear issue. The conservative CHOSON ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled "Does Our Position on the North Korean Nuclear Issue Change Again?" The editorial refers to Chinese President Jiang Zemin's opposition to the resumption of the Team Spirit exercise and the deployment of Patriot missiles during his talks with ROK President Kim Yong-sam and writes: "This again shows that China consistently supports North Korea's position regarding the nuclear issue." The editorial asks the ROK Government to elaborate on what Jiang actually told President Kim Yong-sam during the talks and how the ROK responded to Jiang's remarks. The editorial describes China's passive attitude toward international efforts to ensure North Korea's nuclear transparency and writes: "China turns a blind eye to the North Korean nuclear issue, which constitutes the most grave challenge to a post-cold war world, but intervenes, unfairly, into the ROK's defensive Team Spirit exercise and the deployment of Patriot missiles. We cannot understand this." The editorial writes the ROK's diplomacy has "lost its balance" by blindly believing that the resumption of the Team Spirit exercise may lead North Korea to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty or that the adoption of a resolution at the UN Security Council may incite North Korea. The moderate TONG-A ILBO carries on page 3 a 800-word editorial entitled "Truth and Falsehood of Chinese-Style Solutions." Citing the fact that President Kim Yong-sam stressed the nuclear issue during his visit to Japan, while stressing economic cooperation during his visit to China, the editorial writes: "Even though the leaders of Japan and China may have felt comfortable because of such an attitude, President Kim Yong-sam failed to make the valuable opportunities to meet with the leaders of the two countries more valuable." Describing the U.S.-DPRK talks, a package deal, and the use of persuasion regarding the North Korean nuclear issue as "Chinese-style solutions," the editorial writes that China's opposition to some points in a statement of the UN Security Council chairman is "disappointing" and describes China's opposition to the resumption of the Team Spirit exercise and the deployment of Patriot missiles during the summit talks as an "almost uncourteous act." The editorial concludes: "We are under the impression that our government relies on the Chinese-style solutions too heavily. It is necessary to examine whether China is using the North Korean nuclear issue as its diplomatic card." The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled "Why Does the Policy on the North Korean Nuclear Issue Change Again?" The editorial first describes the ROK's acceptance of China's preference for dialogue and its logic that "no one must incite North Korea" and writes that this means that the ROK was "persuaded" by China, instead of persuading China to accept the ROK's view. The editorial writes: "The ROK Government may have its own reason to change its nuclear policies. However, we cannot but express our worry that the chaos at home and abroad caused by this policy change may weaken the ROK's trustworthiness and cause a confusion in the security structure." Citing ROK Ambassador to China Hwang Pyong-tae's remarks on the ROK's decision to discuss the nuclear issue with China, in addition to the United States, and to take joint action, the editorial writes this is "shocking" and may cause a "mess" in the ROK's diplomatic axis centering on the United States and Japan. After writing that all powerful countries in the ROK's neighborhood are competing to intervene in Korean peninsula affairs, the editorial concludes: "We already learned a century ago what invited competition among the powerful countries in our neighborhood and what resulted from that competition. Our country must not tremble in dealing with such important diplomatic issues as the North Korean nuclear issue."
