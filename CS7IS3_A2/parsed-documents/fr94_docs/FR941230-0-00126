This action is being taken to clarify certain aspects of the program, provide additional guidance to applicants so that the material submitted facilitates the evaluation of proposals, and add newly applicable Federal statutes and regulations. CSREES is publishing these regulations in their entirety to enhance their use by the public and to ensure expeditious submission and processing of grant proposals. In addition, this rule amends 7 CFR chapter XXXIV to reflect the abolishment of the Cooperative State Research Service (CSRS) and the establishment of the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service in the recent Department of Agriculture reorganization.
