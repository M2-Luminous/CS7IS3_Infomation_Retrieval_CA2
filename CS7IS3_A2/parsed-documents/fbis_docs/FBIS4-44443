Nationality propaganda work must be guided by the principles underlying the party's propaganda work and carried out in conjunction with the reality in minority-inhabited areas and the conditions of minorities. Nationality propaganda work shares some common features with the party's other propaganda work but also has its own special content and characteristics. In nationality propaganda work, therefore, we must neither deviate from the party's propaganda work as a whole nor overlook the special content and characteristics of this particular kind of propaganda work. Only by integrating the two closely can we put nationality propaganda work on a sound footing. We must steadfastly publicize the Marxist view on minority nationalities and the party's nationalities policy and religious policy, paying special attention to the "Regional National Autonomy Law." Autonomy in regions inhabited by minorities is the product of the marriage between basic Marxist tenets and the reality in China and a great achievement of the CPC. Practice proves that autonomy in minority-inhabited areas is consistent with the circumstances in China, has withstood any test, and has been embraced by the people of all nationalities in China. At a time when nationalism is on the rise in some places in the world, causing endless wars and turmoil, minority regions in China are politically and socially stable and enjoy steady economic growth. This fully demonstrates the superiority of China's socialist system. We must put the publicizing of the "Regional National Autonomy Law" at the top of the agenda and make it work all the time. Grasp the opportunity and take pains to guide minority nationalities and minority-inhabited regions to correctly understand and handle the disparities left behind by history. Disparities in economic development are an objective fact, the result of a host of historical and geographical factors. Since the 3d Plenum of the 11th CPC Central Committee, the minority-inhabited regions have been developing rapidly economically, but not fast enough to prevent the gap between them and developed areas from widening. Should we limit ourselves to economic development disparities in all our talk about disparities, or should we look at the gaps in ideology and thinking as well? In my opinion, we should begin by identifying the ideological gaps. Once we discover where the minorities have fallen behind ideologically, we will have located the crux of the problem and the driving force of development. Successful ideological education is an important part of uniting everybody to further economic construction. Minority-inhabited regions and minority nationalities must be constantly guided to deepen their understanding of the principle put forward by the CPC: "Liberate thinking, seek truth from facts, unite to forge ahead, open up new territory, and strive for success"; to summon the courage to think, act, experiment, and break new ground to the extent objective conditions allow; and to further economic growth endlessly and gradually narrow the gaps, ultimately achieving the objective of common prosperity. The CPC Central Committee and State Council have always taken the economic gaps between minority-inhabited regions and the rest of the nation seriously. To accelerate economic development in minority-inhabited regions, a string of preferential policies and measures have been taken, which have proved remarkably successful. Propaganda work has been highlighting this aspect, but the effort has been relatively superficial, not in-depth or solid enough. Therefore we need to publicize the party's various preferential policies and measures thoroughly and tell the masses about the party's moves in this area so that everybody, every household knows about them. That way cohesiveness is enhanced and people become united in striving for economic development and social progress. Not only is this enormously significant domestically, but internationally too it will speak volumes. Routine nationality propaganda work must touch upon issues of greatest concern to the masses and succeed in dispelling doubt and providing correct guidance. Right now we find ourselves in the new situation of building a socialist market economy. In the wake of the development of a market economy, the masses are most concerned about how the various interests would be adjusted. We must do a good job in nationality propaganda work, targeting ideological understanding of relevance to the masses. Since reform began and the open policy went under way, the national economy has been growing in a sustained and steady manner and living standards have widely gone up. This is mainly why people of all nationalities support reform and the open policy. The purpose of reform and the open policy is to enable a majority of people to secure more tangible benefits. If the living standard of the people in other regions of the nation goes up while minority regions and minority nationalities benefit little, still lagging in economic development, then reform and the open policy will have been a failure. If this issue is not resolved properly, there will be contradictions and unrest, with undesirable consequences. Comrades involved in nationality work are bound by duty and obligation to face up to this sensitive issue, doing a good job in a focused way and with a confidence borne of the knowledge that justice is on their side and minimizing any factors that may potentially cause contradictions and unrest. "Equality, unity, and mutual aid" is the basic principle in socialist nationality relations. Nationality propaganda must always take this theme seriously. The inter-nationality relationship in old China was one of political oppression and economic exploitation. There was simply no equality worth mentioning in internationality relations. Under the CPC's leadership, people of all nationalities have abolished the unequal relationship of the past and established a brand-new nationality relationship. To solidify this relationship, we must publicize national unity and national progress even more so that even minorities feel and experience the warmth of the extended family of nationalities. Although the economic and social gaps bequeathed to us by history still remain, they can be bridged through hard work. To close the gaps, we must, first of all, understand correctly and analyze closely their basic causes. We must then make the most of the resource and locational advantages of minority-inhabited regions. Third, we must instil the idea of self-reliance and the notion of hard struggle. Fourth, we must build up confidence. It takes meticulous, detailed, thoroughgoing, and painstaking propaganda and ideological work that is also specific, lively, and fully convincing to achieve all of the above. Publicize the concept of the "two inseparables" widely and in depth. The "two inseparables" is a product of history. The Chinese nation is a unified collection of multiple nationalities. Although there have been splits as well as unions over the years, unity has always been the dominant trend. This proves that the 56 nationalities are interdependent and that they spur each other on in the interest of common development, not only politically, but also economically and culturally. The pattern of nationality distribution is characterized by intermingling among the various peoples. The army of cadres is also multinational. In terms of religion, several nationalities may subscribe to one religion, or one nationality may practice several religions. When it comes to daily habits and customs, the nationalities have common features as well as differences. When they diverge, they display their respective uniqueness. Their similarities are the result of the various nationalities learning from, emulating, and influencing one another. The above description shows that the "two inseparables" have deep roots. Widely and thoroughly publicizing the concept of the "two inseparables" and the notion of the various nationalities "breathing the same breath and sharing the same fate, their hearts beating as one" has enormous significance for handling internationality relations properly. Publicize the customs of minorities in light of the developments in real life. National customs are closely interwoven with national characteristics and national psychology. Together they help a nationality survive and thrive. However, they can be a negative factor under particular circumstances, perhaps even to the extent of impeding the nationality's development. Here nationality propaganda workers have a big job on their hands, and a difficult one too. If mishandled, it would lead to thorny problems. Concentrate on guidance. Put equal emphasis on continuation, refinement, and innovation. Vigorously but cautiously do a good propaganda job to transform social customs. Handle correctly the relations between the nationalities policy and the religious policy in terms of propaganda. Nationality issues are "flash points" in the world today while religious issues are "sticky points." "Flash points" and "sticky points" are often intertwined, vastly complicating nationality propaganda work. We must have a good understanding of the links and differences between the two. Strictly differentiate between their respective policy limits. Conduct propaganda energetically but cautiously. In conducting nationality propaganda work, one must not only consider the domestic situation, but also study the political, economic, and cultural conditions in neighboring countries in earnest. On the one hand, over 30 out of the 55 minority nationalities in China have as their neighbors people of the same nationality living in another country. On the other hand, as part of reform and the open policy and modernization, every nationality needs to know the world better and let the world understand itself better. This presents nationality propaganda work with a real and serious issue. People living in border areas have multiple and wide-ranging ties with the neighboring countries. The contacts and interactions across the border have a broad impact. The only way to do a good job in ideological and political work and instill in border residents a sense of national pride is to study the political, economic, and cultural conditions in neighboring countries regularly and make propaganda work more proactive. As for national separatists at home and abroad, we must try to understand their motives, familiarize ourselves with their methods, and expose them at an opportune moment when we know exactly whom to go after. Educate the masses to keep up their vigilance and see through the separatists' plots so that they will not be taken in or duped. Instead, they should take a clear-cut stand and fight back. And then there is the tiny handful of people who try to fish among troubled water. They should be treated on a case-by-case basis. Step up the propaganda offensive to win over public opinion. Take advantage of contradictions to divide and demoralize, winning over the majority while isolating and cracking down on a handful of people. Properly used, negative teaching materials would be even more effective and successful in turning negative factors into positive ones and educating and uniting the vast majority of the people. Intensify external nationality propaganda. Some Western nations, particularly hostile forces in the world, years ago adopted the "peaceful evolution" strategy toward China and are still practicing it. Unwilling to see China develop in leaps and bounds, they try in every way possible to infiltrate and carry out separatist and subversive activities. Taking advantage of the surge in nationalism around the world more recently, they have been working in collusion with some of the Chinese national separatists who have fled overseas to stir up trouble using the nationality and religious issues. We must maintain sharp vigilance against them and combat them in a reasoned manner, backed up by evidence, with the party's nationalities and religious policies. Propaganda work on this front must be done just right in intensity, extent, and timing. The last thing we should do is to give others a handle against us. The primary targets of nationality propaganda work are cadres, intellectuals, and young people. Cadres in this context refer not only to cadres in minority-inhabited regions, but also to cadres elsewhere, particularly leading cadres at all levels. "Once the political line is set, cadres become the decisive factor." When a cadre understands the circumstances of a nationality and has a good grasp of the nationalities policy, he will be free from short-sightedness and more conscientious in his execution of the policy. Furthermore, he will be able to practice in earnest what he advocates, thereby influencing and leading the masses. These days old cadres are giving way to new ones. Some of the newly promoted cadres are not familiar with the nationalities policy and nationality theory. They lack a general knowledge of the nationalities and have little understanding of the principles of and tasks in nationality work. So the need is even more compelling for them to study harder. Han cadres in minority-inhabited regions must immerse themselves among the local masses to comprehend their conditions and master local customs and languages. Communicating in a minority language is more effective in bridging the gulf and promoting goodwill and friendship. Cadres in non-minority regions also should be well versed in the party's nationalities policy. Avoid and eliminate the kind of damage that may be done to the feelings of minority nationalities by an ignorance of local customs. Use models to help push nationality propaganda work forward widely and in depth. "The power of models is boundless." "Light one lamp to illuminate a large area." Be adept at discovering models, nurturing them and publicizing them. Use models to further nationality work and enhance the impact of such work. The first national unity and progress commendation meeting was convened by the State Council in 1988. The second commendation meeting will be held this year. All provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly administered by the central government will also be holding similar gatherings. Treat the process of selecting advanced national unity and progress collectives and individuals as part of the great cause of furthering national unity and progress. It is a good method and should be regularized and institutionalized. Even more important, we must discover models in a timely way in our daily work, review the experiences, and popularize their exemplary conduct promptly. The idea is to introduce a constant parade of models without interruption. This is an important tool that would help us do a good job in nationality propaganda work. Mobilize the initiative and enthusiasm of publishing, literary, and artistic units for participating in nationality propaganda work. "There is no minor issue in nationality and religion." Furthermore, a number of problems have arisen in the past few years concerning the way the media portrayed the nationality issue in their reports and the way literary and artistic units dealt with it in literary works, on TV, and in movies. Still haunted by these events, the above-mentioned units tend to shy away from reports and creations involving a minority nationality, hurting the effort to make nationality propaganda more widespread and multimedia. In the course of time, nobody will dare touch this subject and it will become a taboo, which would only hinder the development and progress of the entire Chinese nation. We must fire the courage of propaganda workers and literary and artistic workers to participate in nationality propaganda work through an active use of such media as the newspaper, literature, and art. At the same time, they must be given assistance in selecting topics carefully and handling sensitive matters properly. When the issue in question is uncertain, do not decide for yourself. Instead, explore it from a variety of angles and at all levels and consult with others. In short, the army of people in the media, in literature, and in art have something going for them--they have wide-ranging connections and wield much influence. Make the most of those characteristics. Handle the problems that arise in nationality propaganda work carefully. Nationality propaganda work involves major policy issues. It embraces a broad area and touches upon many fields. Meanwhile, comrades engaged in nationality propaganda work are constrained by a variety of factors, including the limitations of their own professional knowledge. Hence the mistakes and misjudgments in nationality propaganda work and the consequent problems. Problems must be analyzed by looking at the specific facts in a particular case. When errors occur in the course of nationality propaganda work because of the misapplication of the nationalities policy, when problems arise in the publicizing of national customs due to ignorance, education is the answer. Workers who deliberately hurt national feelings and sow discord among the nationalities must be held accountable. Those who act bureaucratically and irresponsibly, thereby making errors in their work, must be dealt with sternly. Be adept at dissolving the contradictions in internationality relations. Cadres engaged in nationality propaganda work should also pay attention to those contradictions. Once contradictions and problems occur in internationality relations, nationality propaganda work must serve as a catalyst, working out differences, providing correct guidance, breaking down barriers, removing contradictions, promoting understanding, and enhancing trust. Accordingly, we must take pains to accomplish the following. First, abide by the party's nationalities policy. Second, understand and respect the government departments' resolve to mediate disputes as well as their methods of dispute mediation. Third, analyze the specific causes of such contradictions. Fourth, carry out propaganda in a timely, precise, and thoroughly reasoned manner, resting on firm grounds. Distinguish between the internal and the external. Nationality propaganda work must focus on mobilizing the initiative of the masses. When all is said and done, propaganda and ideological work entails mobilizing hundreds of millions of people to fight for the interests of the country and nation as well as their own interests. Nationality propaganda work is no exception. Accordingly, this requires us to tell the masses about the party's principles and policies, explaining the need for and feasibility of such principles and policies by relating them to the interests of the masses. We must explain that only by operating in accordance with the party's principles and policies will society be stable, the nation progress, the economy develop, and the masses be able to improve their living standards. Once they see the light, the masses will work hard on behalf of the principles and policies on their own initiative. Dualism must be adhered to in nationality propaganda work as well. On the one hand, we strive for stability. On the other hand, we pursue development. Stability provides a sound objective environment for reform and development. It serves the interests of reform and development. Reform, in turn, promotes stability. When the economy and society thrive and when the masses see progress and profit tangibly, their sense of responsibility as master in control of their own destiny enhanced, stability will be the winner. The two are complementary and both are indispensable. Nationality propaganda work must stress methods. Firmly adhere to guidance and enlightenment. Avoid drilling hard and fast rules into people's heads. Draw upon materials in real life and refine them into a theory. In explaining the party's nationalities policy, we must make the minorities feel that it was formulated with them in mind, that it is highly relevant to them and feasible and that it would benefit them if implemented in earnest. Once the party's policy is implemented, progress will be solid and development will come about rapidly. Otherwise, development will be delayed and living standards would not go up, causing unnecessary losses. Only by publicizing the party's policy--a profound thing--in simple terms can we achieve practical results. Nationality propaganda work must adhere to the materialist dialectical method. Stick to the doctrine that everything has two aspects and steer clear of metaphysics; this is one method that works in all we do. Be careful to do a good job in nationality propaganda and ideological work from all angles. The general principle is to tell the truth, report the facts, and talk about the problems as well as the achievements. When we talk about achievements, be restrained. When we talk about problems, don't go overboard. In publicizing models, we should emphasize the facts and not exaggerate so as to project a sense of objectivity, truthfulness, and trustworthiness. This will make propaganda work more effective and influential. Nationality propaganda work must stress diversity and guard against imposing a single policy across the board. China is a unified multi-national country. To publicize the party's theory, line, principles, and policies among 56 nationalities, particularly the 55 minorities, we must take into consideration each nationality's special characteristics, the differences in their respective natural, economic, cultural, and historical circumstances, the differences in their psychology and their tolerance threshold, and the differences in the frequency and extent of their contacts with other nationalities in China as well as the outside world. We must also be aware of their occupational differences and go about our propaganda work in a focused way. We must put the construction of facilities for nationality propaganda in its proper place in the overall strategic plan. For historical reasons, most minority-inhabited areas are located in mountains, on highland, and along the border. They are not easily accessible by means of transportation and are cut off from information. Newspapers and magazines have a hard time getting there or do so only after a long time lag, when news is no longer news. Radio and television penetration rates are much lower in minority-inhabited areas than in the rest of the nation. Moreover, most minority nationalities still use their own languages as the tool of communication, so even if they have access to radio, television, newspapers, and magazines, there remains the insurmountable language barrier. In contrast, minority-language radio and television broadcasting originating in neighboring countries can be picked up in many minority-inhabited areas along the border. If this state of affairs continues, its negative effects can be imagined. We must face up to reality and make the construction of nationality propaganda facilities a top priority. Be willing to invest in it in order to put an end to the current conditions and meet the needs of the new situation. Go out of the way to solve the practical problems in nationality propaganda work. Currently news and propaganda units in minority-inhabited areas are plagued by widespread problems having to do with manpower and material and financial resources. Backward tools and fund shortages severely constrain the launching and development of nationality propaganda activities. The news-gathering activities and literary and artistic propaganda organized in recent years have been a big boost to nationalities work. However, the remoteness and inaccessibility of minority-inhabited areas presents reporters and literary and artistic workers with numerous difficulties and prevents them from doing their job on a regular or permanent basis. As far as these problems are concerned, we have to depend on nationalities commissions at all levels as well as artistic and literary organizations to summon up their spirit of self-reliance and arduous struggle to overcome problems and, circumstances permitting, do a good job in nationalities propaganda work. Meanwhile, governments at all levels must understand the difficult position nationality news and propaganda departments are in and help them work out their practical problems. Work hard for the leadership and support of propaganda departments. Nationality propaganda work is an important part of propaganda work. It is essential that propaganda departments at all levels step up their leadership and support. The nationalities commission should initiate regular contacts with the propaganda department to keep it informed of the situation. It should submit to the latter's leadership voluntarily and work hard to win its support. For their part propaganda departments at all levels should consider nationality propaganda work part of their responsibilities and take it seriously, making plans comprehensively and carrying them out in stages step by step. Implementation is one area that calls for an aggressive effort. Rely on the strengths of news units. News and propaganda units have a nation-wide presence. The army of news workers constitutes a vital new force on the ideological front; they are politically sensitive, have a high professional caliber, and are familiar with the party's propaganda work. Making a success of nationality propaganda work is inseparable from this army. Put it to the fullest use. First, respect the news workers, Second, provide leads for their news-gathering and propaganda. Third, make it easier for them to gather news. Go out of the way to solve the problems and difficulties they encounter in news-gathering. Utilize to the fullest the army of news and propaganda workers in the nationalities commission system. The nationalities commission system has developed a formidable propaganda contingent with years of experience in nationalities work, including some who are members of minority nationalities. Take advantage of their strength--their knowledge of minority-inhabited areas and minority nationalities--and mobilize their initiative and enthusiasm for serving the minorities and minority-inhabited areas to conduct nationality propaganda extensively and in depth. No doubt the news and propaganda (including publishing) units of our system were created rather late, lack the necessary wherewithal, and are not well connected. They also operate under more institutional constraints than other news and propaganda units. Moreover, most units are not financially self-sufficient and belong in the category of subsidized institutional units. For these reasons, therefore, we must make the deepening of internal reform a priority, straighten out relations, strengthen unity, improve the conditions in which they operate, and map out a new path of development. Accelerate the build-up of the army of propaganda cadres in nationalities commission organs. That army of cadres is small in size but has much work to do, including a lot of coordination tasks. We must pay sufficient attention to this army, instead of considering it expendable or its size unimportant. We must rely on it to strengthen guidance over nationality propaganda work and the implementation of the plan, using it as a bridge to reconcile the external with the internal. In this sense, this army is vital, so vital that it must be strengthened, not weakened. It must be amplified depending on the real circumstances in the unit in question. Take pains to nurture news and propaganda cadres in order to facilitate the completion of nationality propaganda tasks in the new era.
