FR940810-0-00129 FR940810-0-00021 Much debate on these issues occurred in this rulemaking. Some, most prominently, BCTD, (Ex. 143 at 220 et seq, see also Tr. 483; Tr. 1142, Tr. 3547) stated that OSHA should develop model curricula and certify training courses for asbestos workers. Reasons for this were given as: OSHA's earlier training requirements are inadequate; that ``Ahera has proved successful, but needs improvement,'' and that AHERA should be improved by more ``hands-on'' training and testing and longer training (see Ex. 143 at 232). The Agency notes that participants agreeing and disagreeing with the need for OSHA certification of trainers and courses agreed with BCTD's reasons. For example, R. Chadwick the President of Local Union 22 of the International Association of Heat and Frost Insulators and Asbestos Workers, in a letter to OSHA stated that since OSHA stipulated no specific minimum period of training, ``Most abatement contractors show a 2-hour film and classify the workers being trained'' (Ex. 1&hyph;175). OSHA agreed with the above comment that its 1986 training requirements fairly can be considered ``bare-bones.'' Although BCTD argued that the AHERA model needed improvement, BCTD acknowledged its success in improving worksite conditions (see Ex. 143 at 240, citing Ex. 7&hyph;52). EPA itself has improved its training program. As noted above, it recently issued improved model curricula, increasing the training requirements. In particular, the new MAP contains specific ``hands-on'' training requirements in each major course, including those of workers and supervisors (59 FR 5236&hyph;60, February 3, 1994). EPA also increased the number of training hours and now requires 4-day training of workers, and 5-day training of supervisors. Other disciplines of the AHERA program also have increased training requirements. OSHA has reviewed recommendations carefully and has concluded that requiring OSHA to certify training courses and trainers would consume a disproportionate share of OSHA's resources. Further, establishing another system for certifying asbestos trainers and workers when another agency has a similar program in place would be duplicative of effort as well. OSHA's concerns regarding duplication of effort is also addressed in this preamble in the section on the notification of OSHA vis-a-vis that of EPA under NESHAP. In addition, other entities have already developed more stringent curricula than those under AHERA. The HEI Report noted that under AHERA each state develops ``training and certification programs for inspectors, management planner, asbestos abatement workers and supervisors that were at least as stringent as the AHERA model'' (Ex. 1&hyph;344, p. 5&hyph;51). It further found that a ``number of states have developed other requirements that exceeded the AHERA requirement'' and that ``*␣*␣* in some states AHERA certification are required for any asbestos-related work''_not just for schools. Paragraphs (k)(8)(i)-(v) cover curricula and length of course requirement. They allow flexibility in the new training provisions. Courses equivalent to those of AHERA (ASHARA) may be substituted, but must be equivalent in curriculum, training method, and length to that of the EPA plan. Thus, employers who in-house training program meets these requirements does not need send all workers off-site for the required training. Several commentaries objected to requiring that all training take place in EPA or state approved training centers, most also praised job-specific training as superior (e.g., Ex. 7&hyph;21, 7&hyph;39, 7&hyph;50, 7&hyph;99, 7&hyph;100, 7&hyph;102, 7&hyph;103, 7&hyph;108, 7&hyph;150). Training Requirements for Employees Performing Class III and IV Work: In these standards OSHA does not define the term ``custodian'' nor do the requirements differ based on the job title. OSHA agrees that in some facilities there is a clear distinction between custodial workers who as a participant noted, ``may only *␣*␣* strip or buff floor tile or replace light bulbs in fixtures located below ACM'' and maintenance workers ``who *␣*␣* work on building materials or systems that contain asbestos''. (ICSC, Ex. 162&hyph;58 at 10). Relying on job title, however, to assign duties is inexact and potentially non-protective. Rather in these standards, the nature of the operations performed by that worker determine the level of training required, regardless of job title; janitor, custodian, or maintenance worker. Those who perform only Class IV work must receive at least 2 hours of awareness training, and those who do Class III work must be given 16 hours of training equivalent in content and length to the 16 hour operations and maintenance course developed by EPA (see 40 CFR 763.92(a)(2). Workers performing these activities may be employees of the building owners or other employers such as outside housekeeping contractors, or trade contractors such as plumbing, electrical, or air conditioning contractors. They must be trained to use appropriate measures to avoid exposure to airborne asbestos. OSHA in the November 3, 1992 notice, stated that it was considering a training requirement modelled after that of the awareness training required by EPA in its AHERA rule. OSHA further noted that in its training requirements under AHERA, EPA distinguishes between the duties and training of custodial workers and the additional duties and training needs of maintenance and service workers (40 CFR Parts 763). OSHA, too, believes that building/facility workers, who frequently disturb asbestos containing material need more extensive training.
