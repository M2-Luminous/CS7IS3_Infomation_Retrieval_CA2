FR941230-2-00051 FR941230-2-00042 [Finance Docket No. 32603] St. Louis Southwestern Railway Company_Merger Exemption_Dallas Terminal Railway and Union Depot Company St. Louis Southwestern Railway Company (Cotton Belt) filed a notice of exemption to merge Dallas Terminal Railway and Union Depot Company (DTR) into Cotton Belt. DTR has no employees and owns no equipment. DTR owns 7.14 miles of trackage in Dallas, TX, which is utilized as switching trackage. The trackage is operated and maintained by Cotton Belt. DTR will be dissolved when its corporate charter expires on December 8, 1994, and all of its assets and liabilities will be assumed as of that date by its sole shareholder, Cotton Belt. The proposed transaction was scheduled to be consummated on December 8, 1994. Because the parties are members of the same corporate family, and the merger will not result in adverse changes in service levels, significant operational changes, or a change in the competitive balance with carriers outside the corporate family, the transaction qualifies for the class exemption at 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(3). The purpose of this transaction is the simplification of the corporate structure of Cotton Belt and the elimination of costs associated with separate accounting, tax, and regulatory reporting functions. As a condition to the use of this exemption, any employees adversely affected by the transaction will be protected by the conditions set forth in New York Dock Ry._Control_Brooklyn Eastern Dist., 360 I.C.C. 60 (1979). Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke will not stay the transaction. Pleadings must be filed with the Commission and served on: Gary A. Laakso, Southern Pacific Building, Room 846, One Market Plaza, San Francisco, CA 94105. Decided: December 14, 1994. By the Commission, David M. Konschnik, Director, Office of Proceedings. Vernon A. Williams. Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;31999 Filed 12&hyph;29&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7035&hyph;01&hyph;P
