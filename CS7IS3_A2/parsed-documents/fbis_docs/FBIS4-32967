The U.S. Commerce Department based its decision on the argument that Mexican export companies did not provide adequate information on Mexico's cement sales to the U.S. market. Commerce Secretary Jaime Serra Puche said that if the final decision by the U.S. Government in August turns out to be adverse to the interests of Mexican cement companies, Mexico will present the case to the NAFTA commission. Serra Puche explained that a formal request will be presented to establish an arbitration panel to consider the correct application of the U.S. antidumping law in accordance with what is established in Chapter 19 of NAFTA. Meanwhile, Trade Negotiations Under Secretary Herminio Blanco will meet with the representatives of the affected companies to evaluate the possibility of a public hearing that will allow them to explain their arguments against the U.S. Commerce Department's decision. The Mexican businessmen have 30 days to submit comments on Friday's preliminary decision, which established differential margins [margenes diferenciales] of 60.33 percent for Mexican Cement and 59.91 percent for the rest of the companies.
