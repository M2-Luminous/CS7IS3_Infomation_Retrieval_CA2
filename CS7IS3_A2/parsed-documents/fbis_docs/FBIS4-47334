Experiments were conducted at subsonic speeds. Artificial turbulence was induced. Secondary eddy structures were formed which are similar to Taylor eddies between coaxial rotating cylinders. These structures lead to a laminar-turbulent transition. Creation of turbulence in the eddy may occur without altering the profile of the average speed, that is, without eddy decay.
