That Is Why Results Are Impressive. This Was How Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton Assessed Their Talks in Moscow"] [Text] All's well that ends well. In accordance with this Russian popular saying, the participants in the Russian-U.S. summit completed their dialogue with a whole range of joint documents. As Boris Yeltsin said at the press conference, the aim was to "get a result." The list of agreements and statements signed indicates that relations between Moscow and Washington have now indeed entered the phase of mature strategic global partnership in all spheres. The fundamental element in this partnership is enshrined in particular in the Moscow Declaration signed by the presidents, which, as Boris Yeltsin said, "reflects and enshrines the historical improvement in Russian-U.S. relations in Eurasia and the world as a whole." The two countries' cooperation in strengthening strategic stability and security is also given new substance. "A milestone that it proved possible to overcome in Moscow was the adoption of a decision leading to the elimination of nuclear weapons in Ukraine," Boris Yeltsin said. He described this decision by the Russian, U.S., and Ukrainian presidents as an "historic document from which everyone stands to gain, particularly the Ukrainian people." The accord on eliminating nuclear weapons in Ukraine saves money, removes disagreements, sets other countries a good example, and bolsters the Russian-U.S. statement on the nonproliferation of mass-destruction weapons. The lofty assessment of the "Partnership for Peace" initiative adopted at the NATO Council in Brussels recently was also evidence of the harmony between Russia and the United States. Bill Clinton briefed his Russian partners at the talks on the content of this initiative. The Russian president pointed out that this initiative contains the "beginnings of Russian-U.S. joint activity." It precludes the argument of unequal security and the possibility of new demarcation lines forming "from Vancouver to Vladivostok." The Russian side sees this idea as "one, but not, of course, the only scenario for the development of a new Europe." Yeltsin expressed willingness to "fill this channel for cooperation with concrete substance." The U.S. President also agreed to that approach. "I came to Europe in the hope of starting to build new security based on a common commitment to democracy, a free economy, and mutual respect for security and territorial borders," he said at a press conference. "I dream of Europe being politically and economically integrated from the security viewpoint." Bill Clinton confirmed that the United States wants "to be an equal partner in relations with Russia." Backing Boris Yeltsin's reformist course, particularly in the social sphere, and noting that Russia is a great country, the U.S. President said that "the whole world and Europe want Russia to be successful in its reforms." The concerted approach was also backed up by specific actions. The heads of the two states made pointed statements in support of human rights and on nuclear weapons nonproliferation, while the leaders of the foreign policy departments ratified with their signatures several agreements improving cooperation between the two countries in the sphere of public health, environmental protection, and air transport, as well as a memorandum on export controls.
