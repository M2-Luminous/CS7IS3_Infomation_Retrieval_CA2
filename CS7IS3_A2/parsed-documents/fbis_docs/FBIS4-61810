During this round the two sides did not discuss the general agreement at all. At the post-talks press conference in Tallinn, Russian negotiator Vasiliy Svirin stated that no further troops will be brought to Estonia, but refused to comment on press reports that today in Moscow Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev threatened to do just that. Although the general agreement has been ready for initialing since March, the Russian side refuses to reinsert the clause referring to the already agreed-upon final withdrawal date, 31 August 1994. Despite an international obligation to withdraw "unconditionally," Russia continues to demand Estonian compliance with substantial conditions. Specifically, Russia has refused to initial the agreement until Estonia agrees 1) to pay $23 million to the Government of Russia and 2) to initial an agreement on pensioned military officers. Although troop withdrawal cannot be linked to any other issues, including social guarantees for demobilized Russian military personnel, Estonia has continued negotiating in good faith. Unfortunately, the Russian side has gone beyond demanding Estonian residency for former Red Army troops. They state that Estonia must give these individuals special treatment and privileges over those enjoyed by Estonian citizens. Although years served in the Soviet Armed Forces do not count as working years for privatization purposes even for Estonian citizens, the Russian side says that years spent in the Red Army must be counted for their military pensioners. This demand is particularly egregious as the Red Army was the basic instrument for repression of civil liberties and human rights in Eastern Europe. In a further setback, the Russian side declared that the defuelling of the nuclear reactors at Paldiski Training Center cannot be started before a detailed agreement is signed legalizing the presence of some 200 military personnel there plus their families until the end of the century. Some progress was made in the humanitarian and border issues group. The next round will be in Moscow, but the Russian side failed to name a date, proposing that the working groups meet in between rounds.
