In 1969 National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA) was established. Introducing U.S. technology, Japan developed the N-I rocket, followed by the N-II and H-I rockets. At present, an H-II rocket is under development designed solely with Japanese technology. The H-II rocket will deliver four times more power than its predecessor and will have a capability of launching a 2-ton class geostationary satellite. When complete, the new rocket will move Japan to a world-class country in the field of space development. The following are the outline and future outlook of the H-II rocket. Outline of H-II Rocket 1) Purpose of Development The work on developing the H-II rocket (Fig. 1) started in 1986 with the purpose of providing this country with her own world-level transport system and of promoting Japan's space activities. Based on Japanese technology acquired through rocket development and operation so far, the H-II rocket is designed to meet broad demands for the launching of 2-ton class geostationary satellites and other devices at an internationally acceptable launching cost. Fig. 1. Comparison of H-II Rocket With World's Major Rockets 2) Structure and Specifications The H-II rocket is a two-stage rocket with a high-power rocket engine that uses liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen as propulsion fuel and with an auxiliary engine in the form of a large-sized solid rocket booster. The basic model of the H-II rocket is designed for launching a single geostationary triple-axis satellite. However, by changing its structure, the rocket is also capable of launching low- and medium-altitude satellites and multiple satellites. The H-II rocket is a transport system that will have the capacity, in the future, to meet a broad range of demands including the launching of moon and planet surveyors. The H-II rocket is of a simple two-stage formation but has a vastly increased launching capability compared with Japan's past rockets by improving the propulsion and other systems. The first-stage engine is LE-7 (Fig. 2), a two-stage combustion cycle type liquid oxygen/liquid hydrogen rocket engine now under development based on the technology of H-I rocket's second-stage engine, LE-5. Fig. 2. LE-7 Engine's System Chart The development of a system using the two-stage combustion cycle method is difficult due to the high temperature and pressure of combustion gas which are higher than those of the gas generator method employed in the LE-5 engine. The new method has been adopted practically only in U.S. space shuttles and the former Soviet Union's Energia rocket. The H-II rocket's second-stage engine is LE-5A, a liquid oxygen/liquid hydrogen rocket engine of expander breed cycle type. The LE-5 adopted the gas generator method, but, for LE-5A, the method was changed into a structurally simple expander breed cycle system to gain improved functions and higher reliability. Using LE-5A engine's re-ignition function, the H-II rocket is capable, in its second stage, of launching a satellite into a transfer orbit toward a geostationary orbit. The solid rocket booster, SRB, is unlike the solid auxiliary rocket, SOB, adopted through the H-I rocket, a large-sized solid motor now being newly developed using solid propulsion fuel of composite type. The SRB has a movable nozzle for position control. The H-II rocket will be fitted with large-sized satellite fairings of four and five meters in diameters, double the scale of those of the H-I rocket, to meet the future demand for large-sized satellites. The guidance control of the H-II launcher will be of the inertia guidance control type, similar to the one employed in the H-II launcher, but the H-II attitude control method will change from the H-I platform method to the strap down method. Development of H-II Rocket The H-II rocket is being developed solely with Japanese technology and the work of development has faced one technological difficulty after another. It was particularly difficult to develop the LE-7, the main first-stage engine. The following are the outlines of the LE-7 engine. 1) Current World Situation Rocket engines use oil fuel, liquid hydrogen fuel, solid fuel, etc.; among these, liquid hydrogen provides the highest performance. However, the use of liquid hydrogen fuel involves serious technological difficulties and only the United States, the former Soviet Union, Japan and the European Space Agency have successfully operated or developed engines with thrusts of more than 100 tons. 2) Technological Problems Liquid hydrogen has an extremely low temperature of minus 253 degrees centigrade and liquid oxygen minus 183 degrees. If air remains in the movable parts of the engine, lubricant oil freezes, and the engine fails to operate fully. The combustion temperature of the gas rises to 3,200 to 3,300 degrees centigrade, melting or burning ordinary metals. Rocket engines show high performance as combustion pressure is increased. To take advantage of this merit, the high-pressure combustion method is employed, requiring the development of high- pressure combustion technology and high-pressure turbo pumps of large power to send propellant into the combustion chambers under high pressure. Thus, the development of a large-sized liquid oxygen or hydrogen engine contains technological difficulties in handling simultaneously the three factors of extremely low temperature, extremely high temperature and extremely high pressure. Figure 3) Purposes of LE-7 Development One of the purposes of developing the LE-7 engine is to provide high-performance launch vehicles with large-sized liquid oxygen/hydrogen engines to utilize space environment and send explorers to nearby planets in the near future. Another purpose is to establish liquid hydrogen technology as the fuel considered the best for the future scramjet, an air inducting ultra-sonic speed combustion engine, which is to power a single-stage rocket. Such a rocket is currently thought of as the best space transport system in the next generation. 4) Current Situation of LE-7 Development The work to develop the LE-7 engine started simultaneously with the development of the H-II rocket and is under way, overcoming various technological difficulties. In November 1992, the engine design was determined. Combustion tests, combining the LE-7 engine with the first-stage rocket body, were held from February through July 1993. As a result, the development of the LE-7 engine is nearing completion and the H-II rocket took a giant stride toward the maiden flight in February 1, 1994. Future of H-II Rocket 1) H-II Rocket Launching Plans The H-II rocket's test flight No. 1, TF No. 1, is scheduled to be launched in February 1, 1994 and launching plans have already been decided through the sixth test flight (The launching schedule in Table 1 is as per the space development plans decided on 15 March 1993). Table 1. Satellite Launching Schedule by H-II The TF No. 1 (scheduled for launch in 1 February 1994) is planned to carry payloads for confirmation of functions (VEP) and an Orbital Re-entry Experiment (OREX). The TF No. 2 (scheduled for launch in August-September, 1994) is to launch the Engineering Test Satellite VI (ETS-VI), and the TF No. 3 (scheduled for launch in January-February, 1995) will launch the Geostationary Meteorological Satellite 5 (GMS-5) and the Space Flyer Unit (SFU). The flight No. 4 (scheduled for launch in January-February, 1996) is to launch the Advanced Earth Observing Satellite (ADEOS); the flight No. 5 (January-February 1997), the Communications and Broadcasting Engineering Test Satellite (COMETS); the flight No. 6 (August-September 1997), the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and the Engineering Test Satellite VII (ETS-VII). 2) Future Plans Studies are being made on H-II-derived rockets to meet future launching demands on the basis of the H-II development technology, such as a plan to strengthen the capability of launching payloads into low orbits. Japan needs to develop its own space transport system to supply and recollect commodities for the utilization of the space environment. The research and development of the unmanned winged shuttle HOPE (H-II Orbit Plane) has been conducted with the target of first flight by the early 2000s. There is a plan to use an H-II-derived rocket to launch HOPE. Postscript The H-II rocket is thus Japan's mainstay launch vehicle in the future and has broad potentials to meet various needs. When this rocket is completed, Japan will be able to further contribute to international cooperation in the field of space development and make giant strides toward the construction of space infrastructure.
