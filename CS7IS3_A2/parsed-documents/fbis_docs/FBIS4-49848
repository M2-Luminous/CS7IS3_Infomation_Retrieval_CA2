The State Education Commission insists that all students must take the unified national examination for college entrance, otherwise, no graduation certificates will be given. To prevent unauthorized colleges from expanding enrollment, the government will issue for the first time forgery-proof graduation certificates. And the total enrollment nationwide will be reduced by about 30,000 over last year. "These are the toughest control measures for many years," said Xu Dunhuang, who is in charge of the plan. The commission has reported that the enrollment reached 924,000 last year, up 22.5 percent over 1992. That made a total of 2.53 million students on campuses, up 16.1 percent over 1992. However, the growth of student number exceeded the economic growth of 13.4 percent last year, putting the education sector in the doldrums. Dormitories have become more crowded. Over 100 universities and colleges were not able to meet the official requirements for residence conditions last year. Teaching and research equipment is insufficient or outdated, owing to funding problems. About 160 colleges of science or engineering cannot meet the official standards. More difficulties were found in liberal arts schools. Compared to the fast growth of higher education, basic education has been slow. Last year about 73 percent of eligible students went to junior middle schools, up only 1.2 percent over 1992. "The situation reveals that the current state investment level cannot support the growth of education," said Xu. However, Xu said, the government has decided to allow the number of students on campuses to grow by 6.5 percent each year, to reach 3.5 million before the year 2000. This will enable 35 percent of Chinese youngsters of college age to receive higher education by then.
