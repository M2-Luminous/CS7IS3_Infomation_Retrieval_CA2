The number of respondents who answered that they would "support" Japan's decision to cooperate with the United Nations in imposing sanctions against North Korea if it continues to reject nuclear inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and if the United Nations decides to take some kind of sanction, totaled 60 percent. How to deal with the issue of North Korea's suspected nuclear arms development has become the most important task confronting Japan. It is also a focal point of policy discussions among the ruling coalition parties. However, the poll indicated that the people are highly interested in this issue, and many of them are of the view that the international community, with the United Nations as the central figure, should take a decisive stand against North Korea. As for the issue of North Korea's suspected nuclear arms development, the total of respondents who answered they were "very much interested" or "somewhat interested" reached 70 percent, exceeding by far the 27 percent who answered they were "not so much" or "completely not" interested. As for apprehension about suspected nuclear arms development, as many as 71 percent of those surveyed answered they "feel it," and only 23 percent said they "do not feel it." As regards the question of whether Japan should cooperate with the United Nations in imposing sanctions against North Korea, 60 percent said they would "support" and 24 percent said they would "not support" the government's decision to cooperate. It seems the people are highly interested in and feel apprehensive about the issue due to the fact that, in addition to Japanese disapproval of and precautions against nuclear weapons, North Korea has developed missiles which can strike most parts of Japan. Asked why they supported Japan's cooperation in imposing UN sanctions, 42 percent--the highest rate--said that North Korea's nuclear development is a "threat to Japan's security." This was followed by 31 percent who said North Korean nuclear arms development "runs counter to international trends, including reductions of nuclear weapons" and by 14 percent who said "North Korean is ignoring UN agreements."
