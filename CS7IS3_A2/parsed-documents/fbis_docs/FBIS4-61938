FBIS4-61938 "drsov091_f_94007" FBIS-SOV-94-091 Daily Report 10 May 1994 National Affairs Further on New Crimean Parliament Speaker Further on New Crimean Parliament Speaker LD1005191694 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1627 GMT 10 May 94 LD1005191694 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [Text] As a longer range priority, Crimea must be an independent legal entity and form a closer union with Russia, leader of the local Republican Party Sergey [Serhiy] Tsekov told parliament on Tuesday. He believes the idea of such a union must be legislated upon. On Tuesday, the parliament's largest Russia faction holding 55 out of the 98 seats overwhelmingly approved Tsekov's candidacy for the speaker's post. Tsekov himself prefers a safer option providing for appropriate agreements to be signed with Ukraine and Russia and whatever laws needed to be adopted. His rival Vladimir Klychnikov has called for a balance of forces in parliament and the society. On the diplomatic front, priority must be given to Russia given that the emerging situation is good for Crimea's movement towards Moscow, he said. Klychnikov thinks Crimea must take advantage of the current situation when unification trends pervail both in the Russian and Ukrainian parliaments. The deputies are expected to elect a new speaker later today.
