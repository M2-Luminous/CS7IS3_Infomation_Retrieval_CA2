You know, Mr. Mandela has said no volkstaat [homeland] for the Afrikaners.... [Van der Walt, interrupting] While he is living, yes. [Hartzenberg] Yes, while he is living. The PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] said they are demanding the whole South Africa as it was in 1652, before Jan van Riebeeck came here. The PAC did not object then when we began to occupy South Africa; and we have claims -- legitimate claims -- because ever since that time the Afrikaner has been here, and we are a nation -- one which is being threatened at the moment. That is the international criteria that is necessary. [Van der Walt] Dr. Hartzenberg, in other words the report on that working committee, which was requested to investigate this matter a few weeks ago, and it has been evaluated and considered.... [Hartzenberg] It has now been evaluated and decisions have been taken and those decisions will be announced next week. [Van der Walt] Even the issue of boundaries will also be announced within a week? [Hartzenberg] The issue of boundaries and how we arrived at it -- that will also be announced. We maintain that it actually depends on the people. You know, if you have a certain region, we know that as South Africa is today there are certain regions which belong to other nations and we are not, in any way, laying any claims on any of those. There are certain areas which have been occupied by other population groups which are a reality, which cannot be included in our volkstaat. Then you also have some of our people who do not want to be included in such a volkstaat, and we do not want to force them to be in our volkstaat. In other words, these are all criteria which have been taken into consideration. Then we went further and approved the actions in towns and cities that have to be planned, the towns must work out comprehensive programs aimed at declaring, or rather proclaiming -- irrespective of whether the Transitional Executive Council likes proclamations or not -- those towns volkstaat towns. [Van der Walt ] Is this the peg that you said.... [Hartzenberg] This is the peg I spoke about, but if you start talking about claims and you start talking from the point of view of regions, then it is up to the people to knock in that peg because it will be their will to embrace that town in a volkstaat. Those are programs that have been approved and that have to be set into motion around 29th March, and that we hope -- if it happens throughout -- will be something spectacular and will reaffirm our claim on freedom and our claim on land, as we saw happening yesterday as regards the Zulu nation. We also further reaffirmed that the Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front, AVF] will not participate in the elections and that the differences in this regard - in right-wing ranks -- will not detract our attention and our actions from our actual objectives and our enemies, namely the ANC [African National Congress] and the SACP [South African Communist Party] as well as the government. That we are not to grab each other by the throat, but rather that we strive toward our objective purposefully, enthusiastically, with idealism and dedication so that we can see our volkstaat materialize -- that is what we have been striving for. And we don't have a trace of doubt that our nation will not be free in its own fatherland, under its own flag, and with its own anthem "Die stem van Suid-Afrika" [The Voice of South Africa]. [Van der Walt] And the election? [Hartzenberg] Well, that question, as a result of all the things which have happened lately, it has been extremely difficult, of course, to bring that to fruition before the election. The differences in our ranks, the fact that one of our ally partners has been forced through violence to surrender, and all that sort of thing has had such a quick effect, but what we want to at least do is to make the volkstaat a type of a reality, that it is inevitable, that it has to come; and everyone will know that it has to be there. And this is our aim. I must tell you that when that volkstaat will materialize -- it is in fact a question no one can answer -- and how it will come about, no one knows. But come it will -- there is no doubt about that because that is a legitimate right of every nation, and our nation also has that right. Everything depends on us. [Van der Walt] It is something, Dr. Ferdi, that binds us together, despite the split in our ranks. [Hartzenberg] That is a fact. That is the cementing factor, and we can launch actions in which all can participate to promote and strive for this objective. And one of these days the election will be over and then there will be no need to argue about such things. But if I read the signs correctly, then it seems to me as if that election will perhaps not take place, because I.... [Van der Walt, interrupting] I have always said that. [Hartzenberg] I have heard some of these revolutionaries say that they have brought one government of an independent state to its knees, they are in the process of destabilizing another, and they also have their eyes focused on kwaZulu, and they say it is not their sole aim to take over independent and self-governing states, but to take over the Pretoria government. And Mr. Mandela has made rumblings which amount to the fact that they will achieve this through violence; and that there will possibly be no election. And I think we Afrikaners have to realize that if they are going around interfering with the governments of independent and self-governing states, they are also on their way to us -- that they will want to force us Afrikaners to surrender. And that is why it is essential that we must not grab each other by the throat during these times of crises, because should this happen, then we must stand together and we must assert ourselves. [Hartzenberg] If it had been during other times, with no communist takeover threatening within five weeks, then we could have afforded to sort each other out. But right now we have to keep the wolf away from the door [laughter from both] and we have to see to it that we do not end up in an embarrassing situation. [Van der Walt] Dr. Hartzenberg, the agreement which Dr. Pieter Mulder spoke about between...[pauses] that they are going to take part in the election as a front, but yet remain part of the CP. Your comment on that? [Hartzenberg] No, no, I made no such agreement with them. We discussed the matter, and look, I did everything in my power and under those circumstances no person has a desire to lose colleagues along the way. And we discussed the matter and looked at all possible ways, to see if there was a solution somewhere. But unfortunately that is the position. In politics it is a reality, namely that one can only belong to one party, because if you belong to two parties, where is your loyalty then? Really, one must accept it as a reality, and our constitution also determines that. And it's not only because the constitution states it, but it's because it is a reality. And the other thing is, if someone belongs to one party and you are a candidate to another party, then it's just not tenable. All political parties forbid their members to belong to other parties and to become candidates of other parties. I discussed this with the gentlemen concerned. We did find ways and means, but I told them emphatically that if they become candidates of another party, then they could very well cancel themselves out of the party. The constitution says that if you render yourself available as candidate to another party, then your membership automatically expires. [Van der Walt] Could you, as leader of the Conservative Party -- just in conclusion, Dr. Hartzenberg -- say something relating to what is in the news this morning and today, this issue about the police? We were approached by listeners this morning. They want to know our views about the matter -- this thing about there being an international investigation into the actions of a sort of third force in the police, something the ANC has been talking about for a long time? [Hartzenberg] Well, Johannes, I think it is significant that such a report has been brought to light now. We have not as yet seen the report officially, we have only been reading newspaper and other reports. But it still seems as though it is not a report based on firm grounds. It is still hearsay evidence. And it is part of the suspicion-creating, the revolutionary onslaught. These revolutionists work that way, as happened in Russia. The resistance against a communist takeover must be broken down, and in this case the top general is put in the accused's box without any legitimate reasons, without a comprehensive investigation. They are put on obligatory leave for no real reason; and I think this issue of a third force is a story being exploited by the ANC to focus suspicion on the police, and the security forces. [Van der Walt] And also to detract attention from the conflict with the Inkatha Freedom Party. [Hartzenberg] Yes, but also to weaken the forces which have to maintain law and order so that they can violently...[pauses] because this is the impression I get, that they don't intend taking over the country through an election but through other ways. And that fits in with Mr. Mandela's utterance the other day, when he said that such an onslaught was being directed at the police. And that is why I want to sympathize wholeheartedly with those guys who are really being treated unfairly.
