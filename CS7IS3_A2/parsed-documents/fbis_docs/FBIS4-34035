The victim was identified as July Jean, 24, who was hit in the temple by a bullet. In initial explanations to reporters, Army spokespersons have said July Jean and several other Haitians tried to attack an Army soldier who shot his rifle while trying to defend himself, seriously wounding the man. The young man was taken to Mella Hospital in Dajabon, where he died. The victim lived in the township of Juan Jimenez, near Dajabon. Hundreds of Haitians come to the border everyday in an attempt to dodge patrols and enter the Dominican Republic in search of food, fuel, and medicine. July Jean is the second Haitian to die within the last 10 days. The first was an unidentified young man of just under 20 years of age, also shot by a Dominican Army soldier. The recently intensified embargo against the military regime ruling in Port-au-Prince includes fencing off the land and sea borders around Haiti. The line dividing Haiti and the Dominican Republic, the two Caribbean nations that share the island of La Hispaniola, is 300 km long. Santo Domingo reluctantly agreed to deploy Army troops to control the region. The request came as a result of pressure from Washington, following numerous reports of contraband, especially fuel, crossing the border. The flow hampered the effects of the blockade to dislodge the Port-au-Prince regime and reinstate deposed President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
