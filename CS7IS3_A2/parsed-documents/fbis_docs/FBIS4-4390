She was addressing the inaugural session at the seventh meeting of Bangladesh-Japan Committee for commercial and economic cooperation. Begum Zia said due to fast progress in technology and high labor cost some industries have ceased to be commercially viable in Japan. Bangladesh offers to host these relocations to the mutual benefit of both our countries. The prime minister said excellent bilateral political relations between the two countries (?naturally) translated into increasingly active and mutually beneficial economic cooperation, trade and tourism. She said the promising opportunities in Bangladesh for Japanese investors and entrepreneurs need to be materialized for the benefit of the two countries. Begum Zia drew the attention of the Joint Committee to the increased cooperation between the two countries in the fields of trade, investment and tourism. Highlighting the present social-political conditions in Bangladesh, the prime minister said it has been able to establish social-political stability through democratically elected government. She said the present government is fully committed to further strengthening and broadening the democratic basis of the society. Listing the success in the economic policies of the country, Begum Zia said international financial organizations, like World Bank and the IMF, have appreciated the economic policies of Bangladesh. She said increased food production, faster growth of export-oriented industries and the recent interest of foreign investors in Bangladesh testify to the soundness of nation's macroeconomic management. Begum Zia said in Bangladesh privatization is being encouraged through new policies and institutions. Bangladesh's economy is now thriving in the midst of market forces. The prime minister said liberalization of our trade has moved at a rate much faster than that of country's immediate neighbors. She said new opportunities have been created for foreign trade and investment. The prime minister said Bangladesh encourages the strong role for the private sector and strengthening its banking system and stock markets. The country's laws fully protect foreign investment. Begum Zia said the Joint Committee can play a further significant role in disseminating in Japan the relevant information on attractive investment opportunities in Bangladesh. She hoped the committee will continue to play a dynamic and innovating role in generating increasing interest among Japanese traders, investors and tourists of Bangladesh.
