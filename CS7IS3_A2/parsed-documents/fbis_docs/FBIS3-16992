He added that the territorial question "was not discussed in detail" in the talks. But the premier voiced the hope that this question will be resolved sooner or later: "We will, all the same, arrive at the conclusion of a peace treaty between our countries," and the resolution of the territorial problem is one of the preconditions for concluding it. Viktor Chernomyrdin told journalists that questions of developing cooperation in the economic sphere were mainly discussed with the Japanese foreign minister. "It is pleasant," the premier said, "that the Japanese side is increasing its efforts to support our reforms." Replying to a question about the possibility of transforming the "seven" leading industrially developed countries into the "eight" with the participation of Russia, Tsutomu Hata said that, since the G-7 will hold its summit in Naples this summer, Italy might play the chief role in resolving this question. In general, Russia's joining the G-7 must be examined within the framework of precisely this group of countries. The minister added that, mindful of Russia's growing influence in contemporary international politics, as particularly manifested in the resolution of the Bosnian crisis, Japan ought to have closer contacts with Russia. Then Tsutomu Hata held talks with Andrey Kozyrev, head of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and met with State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin. According to Japanese diplomatic sources, the most important issue during the visit was to advance a two-way dialogue in accordance with the principles enshrined in the "Tokyo declaration," which was adopted last October during Russian President Boris Yeltsin's visit to Japan. In conversation with an ITAR-TASS correspondent a Japanese Foreign Ministry staffer did not rule out the possibility that the dialogue between Moscow and Tokyo might be continued at the highest level this year.
