Answering a question by AKHIR KHABAR on the link between the weapons and the Muslim Brotherhood, Dr. al-Farhan said: You can ask the Muslim Brotherhood about this. But, he added: This is silly, making connections between what is taking place and the Islamic movement. Those who fight to protect the nation's unity do not seek to divide it from within. He said: We have not ruled out the involvement of the Mosad [Israeli intelligence service] or the anti-Islamic forces, which are trying to shake our national unity and undermine the bridges of confidence on which basis we have been serving the homeland and nation for decades. He also said: We spoke to officials and explained our open position toward these issues. Everyone knows the movement's Islamic, nationalist, and pan-Arab positions. Recent press reports on the al-Karak weapons cache cited a link between the Islamic Centers Society, one of the most important Muslim Brotherhood establishments, and the weapons that were discovered.
