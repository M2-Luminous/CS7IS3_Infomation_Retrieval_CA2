FR941219-1-00061 FR941219-1-00018 The FAR Council is interested in an exchange of ideas and opinions with respect to the regulatory implementation of the Act. For that reason, the FAR Council is conducting a series of public meetings. However, the FAR Council has not scheduled a public meeting on this rule (FAR case 94&hyph;752) because of the clarity and non-controversial nature of the rule. If the public believes such a meeting is needed with respect to this rule, a letter requesting a public meeting and outlining the nature of the requested meeting shall be submitted to and received by the FAR Secretariat (see ADDRESSES caption, above) on or before January 18, 1995. The FAR Council will consider such requests in determining whether a public meeting on this rule should be scheduled. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act This proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq ., because the percentage of actions awarded to small business that will be affected by this rule is estimated to be less than 1% of the total of such actions. Most actions awarded to small business are firm-fixed price actions awarded on a competitive basis. The cost principles and requirements to submit indirect cost rate proposals generally apply only when certified cost or pricing data are required. The vast preponderance of actions awarded to small business do not require submittal of either cost or pricing data nor an indirect cost rate proposal. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments from small entities concerning the affected FAR subparts will be considered in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately and should cite 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq. (FAR case 94&hyph;752), in correspondence. C. Paperwork Reduction Act The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the proposed changes to the FAR do not impose additional recordkeeping or information collection requirements, or collections of information from offerors, contractors, or members of the public which require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq.
