Mr. Chairman, it has been several months since our last conversation and I think there have been many problems that have given rise to this conversation, considering also the fact that you are continuing contacts at the highest level in Europe regarding the Kosova issue. I would like to greet our television viewers wherever they may be, in Albania, Kosova, Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and in all other countries where they are temporarily working and living. I would like to inform you, dear viewers, that in our conversation with Chairman Rugova, you will have the possibility to call us directly on numbers 426-08 and 425-01. Mr. Chairman, I greet you and thank you for taking part in our satellite program. [Rugova] Allow me to thank you for this invitation to talk again. As you noted, there have been many problems and there still are. However, we should maintain our work consistently, consider the situation first in Kosova and then in Albanian areas and, of course, establish contacts with the world, our friends, and foster contacts and sympathy. This is our every-day job and we should do it. [Muharremi] Mr. Chairman, I believe we can start our conversation today with your recent visit, your last diplomatic tour to several European countries. As we reported on our satellite program, you recently paid an official visit to Denmark, then stopped over in Norway, and then went again to Germany. Your last stop was in France. Of course, Mr. President, it is observed that your contacts reach top official spheres. For example, in Denmark you met Prime Minister Rasmussen and Foreign Minister Petersen. Are these meetings a sign of the seriousness of the Kosova issue and the increasing interest of European diplomacy? [Rugova] I can say that it was really a cycle of visits or a small tour in several European countries starting, as you stressed, from Denmark. What was most important was the visit to the North Atlantic Assembly, to which we were invited. The talks we held there and our presentations were very successful and important. I can say that the entire visit in general was very successful and very productive. At the same time, I do agree with you, because this illustrates the seriousness of the issue and raises the Kosova issue to the level of the official and state diplomatic circles of the European countries. I can say that we received not only understanding, but also support from these countries. These countries are very important not only in the European Union, but also in the Atlantic Pact. After these official contacts, I can say that, fortunately, we have made many friends who, during these years, have visited and helped Kosova -- friends who have been to Albania and have helped Albania. I want to say that we have maintained contact with them, as a popular saying goes: It is easy to make friends, but it is difficult to keep them. We should keep these friends and establish regular contacts in the future. [Muharremi] Mr. President, could you describe some of the main issues you raised during your last European tour? [Rugova] We discussed the situation in Kosova, which is always dangerous and tense. It is a situation of repression, violence, and discrimination, or apartheid, as is said in Europe nowadays. Secondly, we discussed the question of our political plans -- the plan for Kosova, for the political solution of the Kosova question. As you know, our political plan is for an independent and neutral Kosova, open to Serbia and Albania. As a preventive measure, we have requested a larger international presence and protection for Kosova, as well as a protectorate or civil administration as a transitional or temporary stage for Kosova, in which life would be normalized and institutions would function. We could then talk about the status and future of Kosova. I hope that one day the Serbs will change their viewpoints. [Muharremi] Mr. Chairman, in an interview for Deutsche Welle during your stay in Germany, you stressed that you favor the option of the independence of Kosova. You also stressed that an international civil protectorate would be a transitional stage. How were these alternatives you presented received by your main interlocutors? [Rugova] I can say that there is understanding for the plan and the viewpoint on the independence of Kosova, because this is a result of the referendum we held in 1991, just like the other peoples in the former Yugoslavia, Croats, Slovenes, Macedonians, Bosniaks, and so forth. The other question, i.e. of an administration or civil protectorate, is being carefully considered. Of course, contacts and work are needed for this, as well as pressure on the Serbian side to accept such a thing. I can also say that there are different views on the solution of the situation in Kosova. However, these two topics are very serious and should be carefully examined. [Muharremi] Mr. President, you mentioned at the beginning of the conversation that you visited Germany. On this occasion, you had contacts with State Minister Helmut Schaefer, Bundestag Foreign Policy Chairman Mr. Stercken, as well as other high-level representatives of the German Government. To what extent is the question of Kosova known and supported in Germany? [Rugova] I can say that Germany is one of the first countries to have shown interest in the Kosova situation and it has done so for many years. Traditionally, it knows the Kosova issue quite well and has so far supported it. We hope that Germany will be more active, particularly now that it will be taking over the European Union [EU] Presidency from 1 July. Then after six months, France will assume it. During this stage, the German side promises to be more committed to resolving the Kosova issue. [Muharremi] Mr. President, I think that another question that would be of interest is this: In all these meetings and political and diplomatic contacts you have had, how much is the role and weight of the Albanian democratic state, and the figure of President Berisha, felt in resolving the Kosova issue and the national question? [Rugova] I can say that after 50 years, it is our good fortune to have started to have contacts and to cooperate. I can say that the role of the democratic power in Albania, President Berisha, and the government is very great. Today, this role is important as Albania is entering international institutions and organizations and represents and puts forward our demands as well. Albania's support is invaluable and should continue in this direction. [Muharremi] Do you think that we have reached this stage, i.e. a pan-Albanian global policy? [Rugova] I think so. We have taken the first steps and now, we are consolidating this policy. It is good that we have managed to start a common policy, an Albanian global policy regarding all topics and problems. [Muharremi] Mr. President, it is clear that European policy in general, from the lowest levels up to the highest circles, manifests an evident concern and predisposition to resolve the Kosova issue. Of course, in this framework Belgrade's and Athens' positions seem to be out of tune. I would like to stress here the Greek Government's position regarding your participation in the North Atlantic Assembly proceedings. The Greek Government considered it an act that runs counter to the Atlantic Pact goals and impairs stability in the Balkans. Please, Mr. President, what did you say in the meeting in Oslo? [Rugova] Unfortunately, there was some reaction from Greece, and perhaps Serbia. I would also like to say that a German lady chairing the Committee of Civil Affairs said that even the Greek delegation had agreed on my presence there. Regarding the remarks and accusations that are circulating, they have no basis and justification, as I presented the situation in Kosova, our political plans, and the question of a political solution for Kosova. These met with great understanding both in the Civil and Political Affairs Committees. The success is important. Of course, there will always be rumors and charges. [Muharremi] What about the position of the Serbian Government, considering the kind of official reaction it maintained toward the German Government? Of course, the German Government gave its answer -- Rugova is the highest representative elected by free elections in a region inhabited mainly by the Albanians of Kosova. How do you assess the German Government's reaction in this case? [Rugova] I consider it remarkably positive. I am used to these reactions by the Serbian Government, with various attacks and threats. That is why this is a sign of the nervousness of that regime, which wants to isolate the Albanians more. That is why the German Government accepts the legitimacy of the Albanian representatives elected by free votes in the elections of two years ago. [Muharremi] Mr. President, do you think that these stances maintained by the Greek and Serbian Governments in the context of the events occurring in the region and the Balkans, and particularly in the south, toward which Greece is presenting a pretentious policy, are casual combinations or a fruit of old relations in the Belgrade-Athens axis? [Rugova] Unfortunately, some of our neighbors have always worked in this way. We can consider this as either cooperation or coincidence. However, we request from the Greek Government that it be more tolerant, examine questions calmly, and cultivate good neighborliness with Albania and Albanians in general, as we are one factor in the Balkans. Regarding the Serbian side, it is known that today it rules Kosova by force. We are making efforts to find a political solution to the Kosova issue. [Muharremi] Mr. President, the ministerial meeting of nonaligned countries was recently held in Cairo. You sent a letter, a kind of message, to the leaders at the meeting. Of course, foreign policy analysts noted the fact that Serbia had not been invited to this nonaligned meeting, while it is well known that for decades the former Yugoslavia was, as it were, a country that relied on the nonaligned countries. Do you think that this is a strong position, a reaction of the nonaligned toward the current Serbian policy of violence and repression? [Rugova] As you know, the nonaligned movement flourished in the sixties and seventies. By the eighties it had begun to weaken. The former Yugoslavia was a major country in the movement and one of its founders. Of course, nowadays when new states have emerged and are emerging from the former Yugoslavia, they cannot accept Serbia, which is employing violence and declaring war on other people and former regions. That is why it was a good move that the Kosova issue was included as one of the topics even in this conference. It was a good gesture for the Kosova issue and that of Albanians in general. [Muharremi] Mr. President, a new element of the Kosova situation is, of course, the demand now being put forward by both political and state figures and the media for a dialogue between Serbia and the legitimate leadership of the Albanian people of Kosova. Do you think that Serbia is ready for a constructive dialogue with Kosovar personalities? [Rugova] To tell the truth, there is a great effort being made by the international community, many European countries, and the United States to find possibilities for any dialogue in various negotiations. From the start, we have been for dialogue and for holding talks. So far the Serbian side has not shown any sign that it is ready to talk. We request that these talks be held under some supervision or in the presence of a third party. That is why there is the readiness at the international level to start something. As you know, two years ago we held talks in the framework of the Geneva Conference on several specific issues, but they yielded no results. Nevertheless, it is necessary to hold talks. [Muharremi] Mr. President, there are rumors that Serbia has started a dialogue with separate individuals. Is this true, and do these individuals enjoy the mandate of the Albanian people of Kosova? [Rugova] As you know, there have been contacts with several parties of the Serbian opposition by some of our small parties. Then, there have been contacts between Albanian and Serbian intellectual groups. Meanwhile, it is known that individuals can contact each other, no one can prevent them from doing so. However, it is also known who has the mandate -- the elected organs of Kosova. The various contacts that may have been established are matters that are up to the individuals themselves. [Muharremi] Mr. President, I have another question for you. Some time ago you spoke about -- and it is precisely the topic we are discussing right now -- the need for dialogue with Serbia. This is, of course, much spoken about and President Berisha stressed it during his last visit to Romania, about the need for a dialogue with the legitimate leaders of the Albanian people of Kosova in the presence of a third party. Please, who is or could this third party be? [Rugova] To tell the truth, for the moment, the definition of the third party is still.... As a side, we can say it should be oneof the international or European institutions. As you observe, the European Union, the United States, and Russia have committed themselves to the questions in former Yugoslavia. I think that in this connection a third party will be found for us to supervise the talks under the auspices of the United Nations. [Muharremi] Mr. President, another issue that I think is of interest and worth addressing in this conversation is the fact that much is spoken today, both in the international and Albanian media, about peaceful resistance having always been your political credo. This is and has always been highly valued in the world. Here I would like to remind you that U.S. Vice President Al Gore, who has praised your peaceful policy, German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel in his last interview with the ZERI newspaper, and Mr. Peter Albright, the U.S. ambassador in Zagreb, considered you the Albanian Mahatma Gandhi or Martin Luther King. Are you convinced that this is the way to avoid conflict and bloodshed in Kosova? [Rugova] By all means. This is the way to avoid it. So far we have managed, fortunately with the understanding of the entire people, to escape a conflict, because as you know we have no protection in Kosova. Since 1991, we have been left with no protection in Kosova. Then, considerations about our movement and the resistance of the Kosovar people are in fact qualifications that allow the international and the Albanian question to be regarded as a stabilizing and peaceful factor in the Balkans and Europe. We have managed this through this movement, which is both a need and our choice. It is a need because we did not and do not want to move toward a catastrophe and a tragedy. It is our choice because, in this way, we have affirmed ourselves as a nation, as good-tempered people with high human qualities and with a resistance that will unfailingly yield its own results. [Muharremi] Mr. President, during your visit to the countries we mentioned, you stopped over in France, where you had contacts with several French political figures. You met Michel Rocard, chairman of the French Socialist Party, and Alain Lamassoure, French minister for European Affairs. Can you please tell us what were the problems you discussed with them and what was their position on the Kosova issue? [Rugova] Regarding these contacts, we have maintained several contacts with other French parties, and now with the Socialist Party at the highest level. As you know, the French Socialist Party has supported our issue many times. We discussed with Mr. Lamassoure the situation in Kosova and possibilities for a dialogue to resolve the Kosova issue. I can say that these are, more or less, regular contacts that we have established with France, the French Government, and French institutions. [Muharremi] Mr. President, in this case, of course, it would be permissible to mention here in this live conversation your latest book, presented on the occasion of your visit to France, titled: The Kosovo Issue -- Ibrahim Rugova -- The Kosovo Issue [as heard]. Mr. President, of course, the book embodies a part of your political opinions, a part of your attitudes, and your political and diplomatic activity so far. Can you please tell us how was the presentation of this book, which has political importance for the Kosova issue, assessed by the French intellectuals and the entire public? [Rugova] To tell the truth, it was a special pleasure to present this book in the framework of my visit there. The book was prepared on the initiative of the Paris-based Committee for Kosova by Mrs. (Marie Francoise Allain and Xavier Galmichte), who compiled this book and worked a lot on it. They insisted that we should work together because, as you know, given the difficulty of movement, it is very difficult to enter and leave Kosova. They really managed to write a very good book, a book with interviews and long conversations, which present the question of Kosova and other historical and judicial problems in Kosova, i.e. what happened with the Albanians in a retrospective way. The book has an introduction by our well-known writer Ismail Kadare. It is important that in Paris, where we are not very well represented with literature, a well-known publisher like Fayard is publishing such a book at this time. It is a readable book, more a story with a historical, scientific, and political content than a discourse. I think that for the general public, considering the assessments given in Paris, the book would be very acceptable and popular for the Kosova issue and the Albanian cause in general, as I do not have time now to write books. [Muharremi] Of course. Meanwhile, while we have been talking, we have received many phone calls from our brothers of the diaspora. First, a group of citizens from Switzerland wants to greet you personally on your productive work in the interest of the Albanian people and Kosova. [Rugova] Thank you and we greet them together from your studio. [Muharremi] Eva Konini, a citizen from Tirana, asks: What prospects lie in store for Kosova? [Rugova] Everyone is aware of the situation there and you know that it is grave. However, I think that Kosova has very good prospects, as it possesses economic potential, rich natural resources, as well as, like all Albanian areas, a human potential, a new, active, and cultured population, 90 percent of which is educated. We also have an economy, though it is presently not functioning -- Kosova's economy was destroyed by the Serbian regime -- and this is a good basis for future development. [Muharremi] Mr. President.... [Rugova] And of course, an open and not a closed Kosova. I always say this. [Muharremi] Mr. President, here is another question: What is your opinion on the chances of parallel power in Kosova? [Rugova] Ours is a legal power and the only power, but we are presently occupied. There is an installed Serb power, which is rudimentary. Our power there functions, as you know, in the school system, a system of solidarity to survive and organize our life, and this has surprised the world. That is why people are supporting us in this organized and very rational resistance. [Muharremi] Another question, Mr. President, comes from Switzerland this time. Will the government be completed? [Rugova] I have warned for a completion of the government and it will be done, but carefully and it will take time. As you know, a part of the government we had and we still have is in Kosova and a part abroad, for reasons that are known, as the government was not able to act several years ago. The government has performed and is performing many important tasks and, of course, through the strong cooperation we have with each other, with all Kosovar institutions, the government, and outside organizations. [Muharremi] Another question comes from a viewer from Switzerland, who poses this question. Of course, he has in mind problems that have to do with Kosovar youths who are refugees in Switzerland and the efforts to prolong the stay of the youths there. This viewer asks: How do you foresee the solution to the question of the youths after their return from Sweden? [Rugova] This depends whether he is talking about the people living there or not. Sweden has made efforts to return all our citizens there, but it has run into obstacles on the part of Serbia. We have asked that these youths be granted temporary residence. Many European countries have agreed to grant this status to these youths. In this situation, we can provide the youths with some vacancies, find some positions in our present system, such as in the university, the small private economy that the Albanians have. And of course, under these grave circumstances, we will leave no one to die of hunger. [Muharremi] Another question.... [Rugova] Of course, if we think of tomorrow, that's another question. [Muharremi] Mr. President, another question for you is this: What is your comment on the visit of an Albanian Socialist Party leader to Greece? [Rugova] It is true that parties and groups have the right to establish contacts. However, it should of course be known, direct information is needed, or a report by the state where the political parties or various associations are acting, because we often talk about the national question, but the national question is very concrete. We have a consensus, an Albanian global policy. That is why it would be better if all parties and groups were to remain loyal to this consensus, not to put it in stronger words, to be loyal to an official policy. However, contacts with good intentions, without inferiority, are important and should be developed. [Muharremi] Mr. President, another question comes from Tirana: What are your relations as president with the intellectual Rexhep Qosja? [Rugova] They are very good. As you know, Rexhep Qosja is one of our renowned intellectuals. He has not entered any political organizations or parties. He is the leader of the Forum of Albanian Intellectuals. He has contributed with his writings and presentations and there are no misunderstandings or disagreement. He performs his job, and of course; I, as president, carry out my job, too. [Muharremi] Mr. President, another question seems to be related to Belgrade preparations to appoint a new ambassador in Tirana. It looks as if it is going to be Zivorad Igic. The question is: What is president Rugova's opinion about the appointment of this Belgrade ambassador in Tirana? [Rugova] I heard recently that he will be appointed here as ambassador. As you know, for years he has been the chief of the Socialist Party for Kosova, as there is not one of Kosova, but for Kosova. Unfortunately, he has largely contributed to the repressive situation prevailing in Kosova now. I think that this option should be reconsidered, whether Belgrade has decided to send him or not. Of course, Kosova has its own representation in Tirana and other countries. However, such people do not deserve to represent anyone. [Muharremi] Our pan-Albanian public has continuously shown interest in the contribution and role of Kosovar intellectuals in the present processes in Kosova. Precisely that is the content of another question addressed to you. [Rugova] To tell the truth, Kosovar intellectuals have shown great commitment and, with the foundation of our parallel institutions and political parties, many of them have become members of political parties, elected deputies of the Kosova Assembly, members of various associations and the university. Their role is very great, of course including here the youngest intellectuals, as they keep the university and various institutions going. Under this grave and difficult situation, they, nevertheless, contribute a lot. [Muharremi] Mr. President, the next question comes from Germany. Islam Kamberi puts this question to you: When is the Kosova parliament expected to convene? [Rugova] We have so far postponed the meeting of the parliament, so as not to provoke any conflict. We can hold this meeting, I am not giving any time here, but we should be careful. It is important that parliamentarians are in Kosova, elections have been held, and several parliamentary groups are working. Some commissions of the parliament have started to work on the basis of the present situation. As you know, under such conditions, a parliament finds it difficult to conduct normal activity. Anyway, we will see our way to performing this job. However, a part of the parliament is working and functioning. [Muharremi] A question from Zurich, Mr. President. Now, this question has to do with the present situation of the political parties and the Albanians in Macedonia. How do you see this situation developing? [Rugova] You know what happened with the Party for Democratic Prosperity [PDP] there. I think that there is now a kind of lull and we should make efforts so that all parties can consolidate, be they large or small. However, a means of cooperation, a council, or something should be found for the PDP, as they should definitely be more individual. In the case of the present census, all the Albanian forces there should be organized. Elections in Macedonia will be held in the future, too. That is why we should make common efforts to consolidate the political organization of the Albanians there. [Muharremi] Mr. President, recently as well as before, Serbia has concocted several trumped-up political trials in various main cities in Kosova. With these trials, Serbia attempts to accuse the Albanians of Kosova that they are being prepared for terrorism, to bear arms, up to the point of charging them with being trained in special camps in Albania, and so forth. Are these activities of the present Serbian policy an aggravation and an escalation of the violence and terror against the Albanians in Kosova, as well as an attempt to attribute to the personalities and the political leadership of the Albanians in Kosova the role of a destructive force, and not of a force that aspires for dialogue and agrees to discuss at the table of bilateral negotiations? [Rugova] To tell the truth, this is an old song being sung to us. Thus, always with charges against Albanians, they have created that myth on the armed Albanians, and so forth. For a year now, as you know, there has been widespread imprisonment of various groups and the majority have been convicted from one to 15 years of jail. These are simply trumped-up political trials to discredit our present policy, weaken the political position of the Kosova leadership, and of course, increase the degree of violence and repression. This is their main aim. As you know, no weapons or anything else have been found on those people who were imprisoned. They have taken people from their homes. Anyway, these are all fabrications so as to intensify the violence and repression and politically discredit the Albanian policy and leadership in general. [Muharremi] Mr. President, we mentioned before.... [Rugova] When Germany wanted to repatriate refugees, the Serbs said that they were trained there and they continued training. These are fabrications aimed at discrediting the Albanian policy. [Muharremi] Mr. President, I would like to pick out a part of the interview that German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel gave to the ZERI newspaper. Mr. Kinkel stresses that the Serbs cannot refuse to the Albanians of Kosova what they request themselves for the Serbian communities in Bosnia, Herzegovina, and Croatia. How do you assess this statement from the chief of the German diplomacy? [Rugova] This is an interesting opinion. However, as you know the Serbs and their regime have always acted with double standards. In Bosnia and Croatia they have requested their ethnic rights, as they have people there. Then they brought this about through violence and force. Meanwhile, the Serb regime refuses the Albanians the right to self-determination, the right of independence. Regarding Kosova, they always call upon a certain historic right, which no longer holds water in the modern, contemporary world. Of course, much would depend on the solutions in Bosnia. [Muharremi] Mr. President, the next question comes from Germany from Nazif Bilalli. He addresses this question to you: Do you assess as positive the last visit of the delegation of the Republic of Montenegro in Tirana? [Rugova] These are normal contacts that Albania maintains and will maintain with neighboring countries. As you know, last year the president of Montenegro paid a visit, then the foreign minister, and now the prime minister. These are positive steps of contacts, recognition, and cooperation. Thus, nothing bad comes out of these contacts. It is known that Albania has its own positions and policy and should cooperate with the others. [Muharremi] Mr. President, in continuation of our conversation, regarding your visit to Denmark, the Danish newspaper DETFRI ACTUELLE cites you stating that "President Rugova declared: We have asked that the question of Kosova be treated in the framework of the global examination of problems in former Yugoslavia." What is the stance of the European diplomatic circles regarding this fair demand of yours? [Rugova] Besides what I said and we discussed at the beginning, we have always requested that the question of Kosova be put forward in the global solution to former Yugoslavia, so that Kosova would be a direct representative in any possible conference that will be held. Then comes the question of sanctions, and I can say that there is understanding and promises that Kosova will anyway be included as a partner in possible talks on the global solutions for former Yugoslavia. I can affirm that there exist such a disposition not only in the countries we visited, but in other countries as well. [Muharremi] Mr. President, in a conversation such as this, it is routine to ask you about the activity carried out by the government of Kosova. Of course, it is known that the Kosova government is regularly active in educational and health matters, in economic organization, as well as in slowly creating state structures. How do you assess this activity bearing in mind that it has to work under all these extremely difficult conditions? [Rugova] They pertain to our entire organization and the government, that is, the part that is abroad and that at home, and to political parties, as we are in a situation in which our organs are functioning in Kosova under difficult conditions. For example, I can mention here the Democratic Alliance, which has a very good organization, various associations, other parties, institutions or local governments that we have, which are being strengthened every day. We can also point out the creation of several economic institutions, such as the Chamber of Commerce set up some time ago, then the organization of the economic and everyday life in Kosova. [Muharremi] Mr. President, there is a question from Sweden from Haxhi Osmanaj. In this framework, he would like to ask you for a certain assessment of the mass media. He says: How does president Rugova assess the work of the RILINDJA newspaper? [Rugova] RILINDJA is for the moment published in Tirana and Switzerland. There is a RILINDJA in Kosova, as well as BUJKU. We assess this very positively and RILINDJA has contributed a lot in informing the public at home and abroad. It is a serious newspaper and has contributed a lot. Its publication in Switzerland was an important step in keeping RILINDJA alive and preventing it from being extinguished. At the same time, it informed our public and people abroad that stability in information and in the information culture is being created in the West. [Muharremi] Mr. President, Kadri Berisha from Switzerland asks you: What contacts does president Rugova have with Mr. Adem Demaci? [Rugova] We have good contacts. As you know, Mr. Demaci is chairman of the Human Rights Council in Kosova, a very important association that is performing a great job. Then, the authority of Mr. Demaci helps us all, particularly his work during the recent years in Kosova. I can say he is not only a symbol of resistance, but he works and is in the framework of our resistance. [Muharremi] Let us come to a question I addressed to you before through a viewer regarding the movements of young Kosovars from Kosova. This viewer from Germany asks: Is this movement, this departure of the youth from Kosova, proper? [Rugova] It is not that we are trying to find arguments, but we should understand this on the basis of the entire situation in the former Yugoslavia. You know what happened with the refugees from the war front in Bosnia and Croatia. Then from the front of violence present in Kosova, which started first in 1981, and particularly in 1989-90, young people have left, particularly for refusing to join the Serbian military service, deserters starting from Slovenia up to Bosnia. Regarding this exodus, the situation is such that we have requested their temporary asylum and have been trying to help them as much as we can. Meanwhile, I can say that recently there has been less movement, because many European countries have established their system of visas and various actions. However, on the basis of the present situation, this is important as people are alive and they will move and come back. [Muharremi] Mr. President, another question comes from Ejup Gashi in Norway. He asks you: How does president Rugova assess the Norwegian foreign policy on the option of a peaceful solution in Kosova? [Rugova] Very positively. We have had contacts with Norway before. Like all other Scandinavian countries, this has always been the case in Kosova. We have had contacts with various delegations, associations, and the government. Even this time, we reached a very good understanding on the question of Kosova and its solution. We also consider the assistance that Norway is granting us through various aid and with the temporary shelter of our refugees, who were settled in many places there and have began to be integrated, in the positive sense, until possibilities are created in Kosovo. [Muharremi] Mr. President, another question for you: A television viewer from Korce asks: Do you see the fight of the Albanian people in Kosova as a peaceful passive resistance or as a peaceful active stand? [Rugova] To be frank, this is not as completely passive as is thought, because the people there are sacrificing their work and their lives. As you know, all this violence and repression goes as far as murder. That is why this is an active resistance and a resistance praised by the world. If other demonstrations may be called active resistance, we have also tried them several times, as you know. However, there is great danger as the large troop presence there presents a potential threat, because things may take another direction, which we would not want. [Muharremi] Mr. President, a student from Tirana wants to know your opinion: Is it possible that the question of Kosova can be won through diplomatic contacts alone? [Rugova] This cannot be done through diplomatic contacts, because as you know, there has been... Of course, we are a state and we have a policy. There are criticisms, opinions, and different viewpoints. The diplomatic contacts are necessary and important. We are on the road to success through the organization we have established in Kosova, through the resistance of the people, because the people are not asleep there, as sometimes may be thought in a simplistic way. However, we, and Albania too, should strengthen contacts and friendships. As I said before, the contacts that Albania, President Berisha, and the government have established today, as well as those of Kosova, are very important; as the saying of our people goes: A house cannot be kept without friends. Then there are international factors that have often supported us. That is why we should be ready and cooperate with them. [Muharremi] Mr. President, a viewer from Shkoder comes back to the idea of dialogue. He asks: Do the conditions and possibilities exist for the development and start of an unconditioned dialogue between the two sides at the present moment? [Rugova] To tell the truth, we have not set many conditions, because you know that such a dialogue would be unequal given the violence and total insecurity in Kosova. However, we should talk and, I repeat again, there have been no official indications of talks so far, but, anyway, we should talk. [Muharremi] Mr. President, a viewer from Switzerland has posed this question: Which international factors, so to say, are supporting and assisting the solution to the Kosova issue? [Rugova] Now, how to consider what these international factors are? There are special places and factors -- such as the international community, the European Union, the United States -- that have reached understanding and address and assist the question of Kosova. This is the international factor and, of course, depends... as well as certain countries that we have mentioned during our talk that assist the question of Kosova. [Muharremi] Mr. President, Hysni Sopaj from Split asks: Does president Rugova foresee paying a working visit to Croatia and Slovenia to discuss the position of Albanians in these two countries? [Rugova] I went to Slovenia some time ago. Now we will see with Croatia, as we have better relations, more or less. As you know, Albania has made contact with these two countries and has established good relations. This helps, but we will do our utmost in Kosova to organize a visit to Croatia soon. The predisposition exists, but you know the difficulty of these contacts, which were interrupted a year ago. [Muharremi] A viewer from Switzerland wants to know your opinion: How does president Rugova comment on the threats of Arkan [Zeljko Raznjatovic, leader of the Serb Unity Party, SSJ; head of the Serbian Volunteer Guards, SDG] and Seselj [Vojislav Seselj, president of the Serbian Renewal Movement, SPO] regarding the eviction of Albanians from their ancient territories in Kosova? [Rugova] These are continuous threats. We have become used to them. However, their ill-omened dream of evicting Albanians, suspending political parties, and exterminating Albanian leaders will not come true. In short, their dreams and demands will not be realized. As you know, this is a bad myth that has been inherited over several years or decades. [Muharremi] Mr. President, another television viewer, this time from Tirana, wants to know whether all the political factors in Kosova are in accord with president Rugova's stances or not? [Rugova] All the political factors are of the same opinion. As you know, we have five parties in the parliament of Kosova, as well as the Coordinating Council of the Albanian Political Parties. We have reached consensus on the independence of Kosova on the basis of a referendum, the people's will, and of course, the demands put forward in our political project on the situation and organization in Kosova. Of course, the president consults these parties and is obliged, even by the Constitution, to listen to the parties, groups, parliament, and so forth. [Muharremi] Mr. President, Nazmi Ramadani from Berlin has posed this question: Will our Berlin Wall be removed without war, as was the original wall in Berlin? [Rugova] I hope yes and, not to answer so shortly, I can say we are working on it, the Albanian people in general are working. [Muharremi] Ferit Ejupi from Switzerland asks: Why does a part of the government of the republic of Kosova act in Kosova while the other part acts outside Kosova? [Rugova] In short, it is because of the current conditions. In 1991, when we founded this provisional coalition government, it was necessary for some government members to go abroad as they may have been arrested and their activity suspended. As you know, before this government, we had another government that emerged from the other parliament. We have also accepted the legitimacy of that government, while this is a coalition government. There is nothing bad here if opinions are expressed, whether it should be in Kosova, or wherever. However, we should be prudent regarding this. After the 1992 elections, the situation changed. The president is in Kosova, as well as a part of the government. It is important that they function where, and how, we can see it. [Muharremi] Mr. President, we have another question from Germany, which, I think, is seemingly related with the statement of Douglas Hogg in Prishtina. The viewer has posed this question: What is president Rugova's opinion on Bosnia's division and the problem of Kosova, as part of the former Yugoslav Federation? [Rugova] Now, regarding the question of Bosnia, this has been accepted as a state, but the situation in the field has urged immediate efforts, such as the ethnic division, and so forth. This situation will depend a lot on the efforts to create a Muslim-Croat federation, headed by a confederation or something else. The Serbian side is abstaining from this. Regarding the question of Kosova, it is known that we are committed to its independence and neutrality. We have also said that all the Albanian political parties in Kosova have reached consensus, and if there are changes to the internal borders of the former Yugoslavia, they will naturally be valid for the Albanians, too. [Muharremi] Mr. President, another question comes from Switzerland: Do you think that the discriminating policy against the Albanians in Macedonia will change? [Rugova] To tell the truth, the Albanians there have contributed a lot to the stability of that republic by being members of the parliament, participating in the government, and having a political organization. The Macedonian Government and the other institutions should be more active in fulfilling the demands of the Albanians, incorporating their institutions, schools, and faculties, and following a more active policy. I hope that this policy will be more active in the future and, of course, the Albanians will be better organized on the political, administrative, and judicial levels in Macedonia, because there is the potential, but we should be ready to find agreement and understanding. [Muharremi] Mr. President, it seems from the telephone calls that there are many questions from the television viewers. Anyway, because of the limited time, of course, I would like to ask you two more questions before closing our live conversation on our satellite program. Several months ago, the television started satellite broadcasting. Considering the contacts you have had and your assessments of the pan-Albanian general opinion, is the value of this satellite program appreciated properly -- not only in the sense of moral support, but also regarding the material and financial support to continue this program and particularly to expand it, so that this program reaches new dimensions of pan-national importance? [Rugova] To tell the truth, several months ago, when we talked together, it was the start of this program, which is something very important and a great achievement. Of course, we should now make all possible efforts, with a better organization of the diaspora and with our people, be it with the government, the Democratic Alliance -- which is very well organized abroad -- with clubs, and with various associations, so that the launch of this television is assisted, because without such a studio today, our people, our nation would be more divided. We should do our utmost to keep it. I am not making any appeal to our citizens abroad, but we should work to realize this and keep this studio. And God willing, tomorrow we will have more. Anyway, we should be organized and carry out these obligations and duties, because we need it, above all, as it is in Albanian. [Muharremi] Mr. President, the last question, in closing this conversation. As is known, we are on the eve of celebrating the 70th anniversary of the June democratic revolution. Do you see parallels today with this important event in our national history? [Rugova] I stayed here for these days in order to be present at this great, important celebration of our renowned figure, Fan Noli, who, throughout his life, worked in politics and fought for the realization of the national rights of Albanians. I can say that a parallel can be drawn regarding the democratic ideas and the democratic progress. Albanians today are different from the Albanians of the Twenties, fortunately, and it is easier to accomplish the mechanism of democracy and the national interests. Once again I want to show my great respect and great thanks to our great Noli, as they say. At the same time, this is a good opportunity for Albania to celebrate this important moment. [Muharremi] Mr. President.... [Rugova] And we should continue this. [Muharremi] In closing, I want to thank you for this very friendly conversation, hoping that through this talk we provided the pan-national broad public with ample information on the main problems that worry us today. I would also like to send thanks to all the television viewers who watched our broadcast and greetings from the staff of the Radio Television and the Satellite Program, hoping that you will come to our studio again. Thank you once again. [Rugova] Thank you. Warm greetings to all. You are welcome to come to Prishtina soon.
