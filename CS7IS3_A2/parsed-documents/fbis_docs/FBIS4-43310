It is very likely that it will not be possible to prevent the PDS from entering the Bundestag again, Gysi told DPA on Monday [13 June]. After the very good performance in the municipal elections in the east and the European elections, Gysi stated that the PDS will at least get three direct mandates, "but it might also be five to 10." The 5-percent hurdle can also be overcome. In Gysi's opinion, the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] still has not been able to gain a foothold in the new laender. It does not have any relation to reality and to history in the east.
