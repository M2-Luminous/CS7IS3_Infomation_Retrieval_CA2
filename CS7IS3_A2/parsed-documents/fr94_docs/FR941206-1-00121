FR941206-1-00121 FR941206-1-00009 (gg) Subpart 201&hyph;39.46 is amended to delete provisions that are more adequately addressed in FAR Subpart 46. This subpart addresses quality assurance and provides guidance limiting contractor liability in contracts for FIP resources. Unless circumstances warrant otherwise, contracting officers are instructed to insert a limitation of liability clause found at §201&hyph;39.5206. FAR Subpart 46 also provides guidance on limitation of contractor liability. The FAR's guidance is more comprehensive and flexible than is the FIRMR's. The FAR provides multiple contractual clauses from which a contracting officer must choose. One clause applies to contracts for the delivery of non-high value end items, a second to the delivery of high-value end items, and a third to the provision of services. Contracting officers are instructed to combine relevant parts of each clause for contracts involving more than one of these categories. Accordingly, the FIRMR provision and clause found at §201&hyph;39.5202&hyph;6 are removed so that the corresponding FAR provision will apply. (2) GSA has determined that this rule is not a significant rule for the purposes of Executive Order 12866 of October 4, 1993, because it is not likely to result in any of the impacts noted in Executive Order 12866, affect the rights of specified individuals, or raise issues arising from the policies of the Administration. GSA has based all administrative decisions underlying this rule on adequate information concerning the need for and consequences of this rule; has determined that the potential benefits to society from this rule outweigh the potential costs; has maximized the net benefits; and has chosen the alternative approach involving the least net cost to society.

The authority citation for part 201&hyph;1 continues to read as follows: Authority: 40 U.S.C. 486(c) and 751(f). §201&hyph;1.003 [Amended] 2. Section 201&hyph;1.003 is amended by removing the word ``system'' from paragraph (a) and removing paragraph (d). PART 201&hyph;2_DESIGNATED SENIOR OFFICIALS 3. The authority citation for part 201&hyph;2 continues to read as follows: Authority: 40 U.S.C. 486(c) and 751(f). 4. Section 201&hyph;2.001 is revised to read as follows: §201&hyph;2.001 General. (a) The PRA requires that the head of each executive agency designate a senior official who shall report directly to the agency head. The designated official is responsible for carrying out the IRM function assigned to the agency by the PRA. (b) The PRA also assigns to the designated official the responsibility for the conduct of and accountability for acquisitions of FIP resources made under a DPA from GSA. Therefore, when GSA delegates its procurements authority to executive agencies, it grants those delegations to the designated officials when GSA determines that such officials are sufficiently independent of program responsibility and have sufficient experience, resources, and ability to fairly and effectively carry out procurements under GSA's authority as provided by 40 U.S.C. 759(b)(3). §201&hyph;2.002 [Amended] 5.
