He will step up the fight against drug consumption in the United States and will give more economic support to eradication and substitution of drug cultivation in drug-producing countries. Miriam Ortiz has the report on what that program means for Colombia. [Begin recording] [Ortiz] President Bill Clinton's new counternarcotics program has four fundamental objectives. The first is to reduce demand. This is the most important goal of the new strategy. Budgets for prevention, treatment, and education programs will be increased. The second objective is to reduce drug-related violence. The U.S. Government will appoint 100 policemen [as heard] to prevent crime in the streets and will ask Congress to pass more controls and requirements on gun ownership. The third objective is to reject the legalization and decriminalization of illegal drugs. The fourth is to request international cooperation. According to the drug czar [Lee Brown], the U.S. Government will continue to be a strong ally of countries that have demonstrated a political willingness to fight drug trafficking. [Brown, in English with superimposed translation into Spanish] It's very important that we do not open our borders to the Escobars of the world to bring drugs in at will. That is why we will continue our program to ban drugs. [Ortiz] The U.S. Government believes that Colombia has one of the most successful counternarcotics programs, so its budget will not be reduced. [Gabriel Silva, Colombian ambassador to Washington] In addition to support for efforts to reduce consumption, the new program includes institutional support, which will strengthen justice and democratic institutions.
