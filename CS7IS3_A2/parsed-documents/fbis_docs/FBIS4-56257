The shipment totals 500 tons and marks the return of mining activity to Iquique Province. Copper now accounts for 10 percent of the cargo passing through the port of Iquique, which handles mostly fishing industry products and goods entering the Free Zone. Copper's share is expected to increase when the three mines in the area (Cerro Colorado, Quebrada Blanca, and Dona Ines de Collahuasi) are in operation. The Cerro Colorado company, which is part of the Canadian mining corporation Rio Algom, views the shipment as the start of a new phase and anticipates exporting about 40,000 tons annually. The company's open-cast mine is located 120 km east of Iquique and represents an investment of $290 million.

The government has set two priorities in its export strategy: identifying emerging markets for Chilean products, and taking specific actions to increase competitiveness. These actions could include quality certification, environmental standards, increased investment in infrastructure, and expansion of worker training. He noted that the Latin American market has been expanding and diversifying while sales to the EU and Japan have declined over the past year. Thus, the government will emphasize trade liberalization in the region. Garcia stressed the need for flexible machanisms to react quickly to changes in international economic relations. He stated that the Economy Ministry has come to the conclusion that existing export incentives are inadequate under the current circumstances and must be reviewed with special attention to export diversification in both products and markets. (Santiago LA NACION in Spanish 30 March p 16) Government Economic Policies Speaking at the opening ceremony for the academic year at the Andres Bello University, Economy Minister Alvaro Garcia presented an outline of the government's economic policies. He reiterated the government's intention to change the Law on State Enterprises to modernize the public sector and ensure greater efficiency. He said that a sustained increase in productivity is required in order to reach the goal of 6 percent economic growth this year, and noted that controlling inflation means "avoiding any populist temptation concerning public spending, salaries, subsidies, and taxes; and moderating private spending on consumption and wage demands in excess of productivity." The government will continue to increase programs to improve income distribution, and proposes to create a national job training system, a workers training fund, and a national employment information and guidance system. The government is also concerned about expanding the process of collective negotiation, creating unemployment insurance, and promoting competition in all areas possible. These steps would involve a significant revision and strengthening of regulatory agencies and the Antitrust Law.

Fernan Ibanez and Felipe Larrain presented the study to the Chilean-Canadian Chamber of Commerce. One of their main conclusions is that Chile is well-prepared to enter NAFTA, given the country's macroecomic stability and open and transparent commercial law and business practices. Chile has also had a lengthy and active tradition of participation in international agreements such as the GATT. Chile would need a minimal number of legal and procedural changes to comply with NAFTA, because most tariff rates and government procurement practices meet NAFTA standards. The study concludes that Chile would benefit from guaranteed access to a large market; an impartial conflict resolution mechanism; uniform regulations for trade among four countries, especially regarding nontariff matters; and assured access to goods and services.
