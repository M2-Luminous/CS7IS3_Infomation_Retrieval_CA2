What do journalists of KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA, SELSKAYA ZHIZN, OGONEK, KRESTYANKA, PRAVDA, ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA -- around 20 publications in all -- want? In short -- justice. The publishing house had been expanding for many years, including on the money of newspapers and magazines. Through collective efforts a unique publishing complex was created. But following the well-known August events the publishing house received state-owned status, while the newspapers got the status of juridical entities and...no shares in the property. As a result, every editorial collective was forced to conclude a lease contract separately with the publishing house on -- let us be blunt -- disadvantageous terms. State Duma deputies deemed the demands of the journalists' collectives to be well-founded, and proposed that the government adopt the necessary measures.
