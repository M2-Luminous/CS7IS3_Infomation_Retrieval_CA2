The abrogation of Yuriy Meshkov's (eds: Meshkov is president of the Crimea) decree of 10 March is the first step in this direction," said Ivan Timchenko, head of the Ukrainian president's legal service, explaining Leonid Kravchuk's decisons over national television on Thursday. He dwelt at length on the background of these events. The Crimean Republic adopted its Constitution on 6 May 1992 where Article 9 read: Relations between Ukraine and the Crimean Republic are based on treaties and agreements. Article 17 granted Crimean citizens the right to have dual citizenship to be determined by treaties between the Crimea and other states. However, the above was in contradiction with the Ukrainian Constitution. Therefore, the Ukrainian parliament proposed that the Crimea bring these and other articles in line with the Ukrainian Constitution. Such a decision was taken by the Crimean parliament on September 25, 1992. Article 9 now reads that relations between Ukraine and its subjects are based on legislative acts and agreements. "The question of dual citizenship was the competence only of the Ukrainian parliament," Timchenko stressed. The lawyer noted that the decree by the Crimean Republic president says about a public poll on whether there is any need for restoring these articles of the Constitution, although such questions are the competence of the Crimean parliament. The preamble of Meshkov's decree runs that the poll will be held to study the will of Crimean citizens and to take decisions important for the Republic. Timchenko claims that "in actual fact, a decision was taken to hold a consultative referendum" under the pretext of a public opinion poll. "This was the reason for Kravchuk to repeal items 1 and 2 of the above decree's Article 2," the lawyer stressed. The Crimean central Electoral Commission held its meeting in Simferopol on Wednesday and discussed Meshkov's address. The Crimean president accused the commission of "unwillingness to organise this poll and of usurping the role of a constitutional court." The commission responded with a protest.
