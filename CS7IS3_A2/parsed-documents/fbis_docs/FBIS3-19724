At the Nordic Council session in Stockholm last week, he was introduced to the expression "late milking." "All this must of course be seen from the standpoint of Finland's specific situation. In my view, a Swedish judgment on this matter is neither easy nor warranted." Bildt is quite clearly convinced about Finland's negotiatiated agreement with the EU [European Union]. It is what he believed from the very beginning, although he did not want to question his Finnish counterpart [Prime Minister] Esko Aho's gloomy reaction to the information about his achievements in Brussels a couple of weeks ago. "There are always things that have to be interpreted from within an agreement," Bildt added diplomatically. Sweden has similar problems and needs complementary measures at the national level. This does not actually affect the agreement with the EU. The problem of complementary national financing of regional support also arises in Sweden. Bildt pointed out that, unlike Finland, Sweden has been adapting to EU price levels ever since the mid- 1960's, based on a belief that sooner or later it would be knocking on the EU's door. "It has always been my firm belief that this would happen sooner or later, although my time-frame estimates have varied from the short term to a pessimistic distant future." But this Nordic advocate of Europe has always been sure about Swedish EU membership: "I think I became convinced about the present schedule in 1987-88. That is when the events became predictable." Bildt was referring to the 1985 European Single Act decision. The white paper resolutions were to be implemented by the end of 1992, and that paved the way for an extension. The prime minister and leader of the Swedish Conservative Party states that all his efforts from 1987-88 onward were focused on getting Sweden's application submitted by 1991-92, negotiations in 1993, ratification in 1994, and membership in 1995. In other words, Carl Bildt has worked hard for Swedish accession to the EU over the last seven years. Opening of the Nordic Council Meeting "I am convinced about membership in 1995," he said, without showing any doubt as to the outcome of the planned consultative referendum. The date of the referendum has not been agreed upon yet, but negotiations are now under way between the government and the opposition. Bildt would prefer to see it take place in June, while the opposition and one of the government coalition parties, the Liberal Party, have indicated that the referendum cannot be held before November, in other words a couple of months after the elections. "As far as I can judge, there is a parliament majority for a referendum in June, with or without the Liberal Party." Must Not Become an Issue of Conflict Bildt does not see any point in turning the referendum question into a political conflict. "Trying to split a nation is a bad way of trying to unite Europe." The parties in Sweden are now evaluating the pros and cons of the alternatives. Bildt does not want to predict how long the discussions will last, but he does not believe it is absolutely essential for the referendum to be out of the way before the 18 September elections. "The important thing for us is to get a good result," he said, adding that a referendum in June does not mean a great personal political victory for him. After the successful outcome of the negotiations, there is only one good result in the Swedish prime minister's eyes: a yes to the EU from the majority of the people. Bildt does not think that a change of power in the middle of the campaign would influence the outcome of the referendum. "It may be significant if the Social Democrats lose the elections, which I think they will, in which case their party will be in fairly bad shape this fall. If the referendum is not held before November, there is a danger or a chance that the conservatives will no longer be in power on the planned date of the country's accession to the EU. Various opinion polls indicate that a change of power can be expected in Sweden this coming September. The Social Democrats have a strong position and in the eyes of many it takes a good deal of self-confidence and optimism today for a Conservative leader in Sweden to believe in victory, no matter how little significance he sees in the opinion polls: This is relatively limited," he said, and added that he is confident about "the evolution of political and economic events." Bildt believes in a yes to the EU at the referendum regardless of who is in power after the fall elections. This yes will be the outcome of a debate which informs and involves the people: "The problem with the Social Democrats is that they did not believe we could reach such a good agreement so quickly." According to Bildt, this has led to the Social Democrats campaigning predominantly for a no vote. Today, a clear majority of Social Democrats -- some 75 percent -- are against EU membership. "The longer they postpone the start of a proper yes campaign, the more problematic the no situation will become within the party. Problems are seldom solved by waiting." The Social Democrats Have No Opinion And the social democrats have waited. Last fall they decided to adjourn the party congress because they could not achieve unanimity on the EU issue. "It is remarkable that they have not made any decision in principle. They are the only political party without a principle on this issue." While the discussion about the date of the Swedish referendum is going on, Bildt does not really believe in simultaneous plebiscites in Finland, Sweden, and Norway, but he is sure that Norway will succeed: "I think they are very near a solution." And he is just as sure of a yes vote in the referendum to follow: "Opinion polls record the opinions of yesterday, or rather, they reflect an approximate, often fairly unreliable picture of yesterday's situation. The only thing one can be absolutely sure about is that things look different tomrrow," he added to his somewhat enigmatic view on opinion polls. Bildt was referring to opinion polls in Norway from 1972 when the no ethos predominated to a considerably greater degree than today. The Swedish Prime Minister takes the view that Norway cannot manage without the EU, not even with its oil and fish, because that is not what it is all about: "What is at stake is political influence in shaping the Europe of the future, and not sitting and leading a dull life on an island. Of course, one can pursue a Robinson Crusoe-like policy, cracking a coconut now and then. But that will hardly satisfy any nation in the long run." Isolation Is No Solution Bildt does not believe that the EU poses any direct threats other than in the guise of bad decisions. But of course, such decisions could also be made by parliaments in Sweden and Finland. "It is very hard for me to see that there is anything intrinsically wrong in cooperation. You either cooperate or remain isolated," he argued. "I cannot find a single valid argument why we in the Nordic countries should be isolated from European cooperation. Not a single one!" He is not laboring under any illusions, however; this cooperation is likely to be laborious, time-consuming, and complicated, but he thinks it is worth it: "One must, of course, give up some of one's independence in exchange for something else. This happens with people who get married. I suppose, or rather know, that they give up some of their independence while being aware of gaining other benefits from the arrangement," he added firmly. Carl Bildt believes that the Nordic countries will work closely together as members of the EU. Among other things, they will be actively supporting membership for the Baltic states and other countries like Hungary and Poland, which were seen last week knocking discreetly on the EU's door.... The Swedish Prime Minister is convinced that membership in the EU is also a guarantee of security, but he does not think Finland needs the EU specifically for that reason: "Soviet policy always included an expansionist element. This trait is not present in Russian policy today." Neither does Bildt see any threat of this kind in Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. Bildt does not set much store by his threats to put the Russian Army on a war footing: "I find it hard to believe that anyone can win many votes by promising a super-Afghanistan as an electoral pledge." Bildt does not doubt Russia's ability to take a tough stand to safeguard its national interests, even if there is a risk that this may lead to conflicts -- although not military ones -- with the West: "But I think that a prevalently ideological attitude belongs to the past." Bildt believes that security and stability will increase in Europe with its northernmost countries as members of the EU: "I see this as one of the strongest arguments for membership. It offers a security bonus." NATO membership, on the other hand, is not necessary and the candidate countries will, in time, define their relationship to the WEU [Western European Union]. What matters to Carl Bildt today is to pilot Sweden into the EU. He is now on the home stretch of his race to make an old dream come true.
