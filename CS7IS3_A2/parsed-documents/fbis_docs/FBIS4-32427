This adjustment should come about during the fourth quarter of this year. At yesterday's news conference, this was announced by Minister Jindrich Vodicka. Measures being readied for families with children will have to do with adjustment of the additional payments for children (the ministry anticipates an increase of between 40 and 50 korunas [Kc] a month), adjustments in the state equalization contribution for foster children (it will rise approximately by Kc200 for a family operating within the one-and-one-half and double multiple of the minimum living costs in terms of their income). The adjustment figures on increasing support payments for the birth of a child (by Kc500) and on increasing the parental contribution. The ministry is also proposing increasing burial payments by approximately Kc2,000; adjusting the contribution for wives and children of soldiers (by approximately Kc100); the contribution toward the expenses for quarters for a soldier (by approximately 10 percent); and payments supporting alimentation and other basic requirements of citizens who depend on catering services (by approximately Kc100). The above amounts are still to be discussed by the government. But the minister was not expecting any fundamental changes in the amounts he proposes. He is also proposing the valorization of pensions, which should also come about in the fourth quarter but will most likely occur a month later. The valorization is to be made up of two portions according to the proposal. The state equalization contribution is to be valorized first, which means that all pensioners would receive an additional payment of Kc220. Next, pensions are to be increased by 5 percent. On average, pensions should rise by Kc360, which, according to Minister Vodicka, represents a 12-percent rise in pensions.
