Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak said the move will be to the advantage of both Vietnam and Thailand. It will be a catalyst in the development of Vietnam, as more investors will go in, but it will be for Vietnam to amend its existing laws and regulations to tempt investors, he said. The transfer of funds will become more convenient, and the Mekhong Sub-region Project will benefit as Vietnam will be encouraged to take part, he said. Suphachai assured Thai investors that Vietnam will not become a competitor because Thailand is several steps ahead of Vietnam in manufacturing. Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai Wirawan commented that he does not expect Vietnam to represent a serious threat to Thai rice exports to the US as a result of the move. The US imports Thai glutinous rice because there are many Asians living there, and normally the US does not import rice from any country because of its rice surplus. Amnuai said Thailand's strong economic growth will prevent a significant shift of foreign investment away from Thailand to Vietnam. "Nobody will abandon Thailand for Vietnam," he said. "What we should worry about is how to manage and control our strong growth." Government spokesman Aphisit Wetchachiwa said that Thailand as one of the main gateways to Indochina stands to benefit from increased trade and regional investment. "The lifting of the embargo will stimulate trade and investment in the region," Abpisit told UPI. "It is positive development for Thailand." But the lifting of the embargo will eliminate the necessity to trans-ship products through Thailand to Vietnam. "Definitely it will affect certain kinds of Thai businesses," Aphisit said. "Some will benefit from this and some will lose. We have to accept the (Vietnamese) competition." [passage omitted] Kroekkrai Chiraphaet, Director-General of the Business Economics Department, said the move will mean keener competition for Thailand. "Vietnam may take three to five years to catch up with us, especially in products such as textiles, shoes, electronics, computer components and electrical appliances, he said. But it does not take long to establish factories and Vietnam has a comparative labour advantage, he said. Thailand's labour costs are moving up, therefore it should seek a comparative advantage in manufacturing quality. Thailand must catch up with Japan, Taiwan, Korea and Hong Kong and step away from competitors. The influx of investors to Vietnam implies that they want to gain a greater share of the local market, Kroekkrai said. Due to its proximity to Vietnam, Thailand enjoys a decisive advantage in certain businesses such as construction materials and certain Thai consumer products. These have gained market recognition from being smuggled into Vietnam over the past two decades. [passage omitted]
