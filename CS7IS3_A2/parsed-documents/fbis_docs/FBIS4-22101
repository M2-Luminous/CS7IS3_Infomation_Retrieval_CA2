Houri after his failed assassination bid against Hojatoleslam Mohammad Abaei-Khorasani just after the latter had finished his Friday prayer sermons, tried to shoot himself to escape the fury of the worshippers.

A third bullet fired by the attacker missed the prayer leader and injured a theology student. The Information Ministry official asked to comment on the motives of the attack, said the MKO because of its nature will not abandon its terrorism. Moreover, he said, it has reached a deadlock in Iraq. Musavi-Nejad recalled that at the outbreak of the Iraqi war (1980-88), the MKO shouted slogans against Saddam Husayn but soon, however, it became attached to Saddam Husayn.

He said the MKO selected young persons in the country with promises and encouraged them to carry out terrorist operations. Musavi said those that cooperate with MKO will be considered as being against the security of the country and will be prosecuted. Regarding the reason why the MKO is looking for people inside the country for terrorist operations he said there were many reasons. "One of those reasons is, the MKO wants to propagate that it has cells inside the country, whereas it is not so. The second reason is, the people deceived by the MKO are without previous records and if they did anything the MKO can deny their terrorist acts," he said. The third reason is that the group has been under pressure since its flight from the country and considers this a way for its presence. The fourth reason, added Musavi-Nejad, such people are considered to be forces at no cost, and the MKO without incurring any expenditure exploits them. He said the grouplet is not even willing to pay for the costs of exit from Iran of its people and they steal the jewelery of their mothers or borrow from friends to go abroad. These measures of the MKO, he said, are exactly the expectation of Iraq which has always planned subversive operations in the Islamic Republic.
