But the emphasis has shifted yet a little further away from last year's proposal for a consumer-driven increase toward an investment-driven one. This is evident in part from the fact that the party does not repeat its demand to restore the basic deduction to 32 percent of the basic amount from the present 25. (On that point the account in yesterday's SVENSKA DAGBLADET regarding what could be expected was not correct.) Through a number of incentives -- all of them temporary -- both as regards employment and investments, the Social Democrats expect in their alternative that they will get the economy to grow much more rapidly than if the Riksdag sticks to the government's proposal. The government anticipated 2.4 percent economic growth for 1994, both in the national budget and the now current spring budget. With Social Democratic policies the growth will be 3.3 percent, compared to 3.4 in the shadow budget. For next year the government believes in 3-percent growth, while the Social Democrats maintain that they can achieve as much as a 4.5 upturn with their policies. Among other established prognosis-makers Nordbanken has come up with growth figures that exceed the government's. The Industry Association and LO [Federation of Trade Unions] are at 1.3 and 1.2 percent, respectively, for this year and below 2 percent for 1995. One novelty in the Social Democratic party bill is the proposal for a new "social contract" between wage earners, employers, and the state. Both Goran Persson, the party's financial spokesman, and party secretary Mona Sahlin, at yesterday's news conference stressed the course of mutual understanding which they now say they want to pursue -- despite devastating criticism of the government alternative. The new social contract would constitute an important part of this. However, the Social Democrats' intended minister of finance wanted to dispel the fears/hopes that the state intends to introduce an income policy by saying: "It is not a matter of anything written, and I see neither Haga nor Harpsund in front of me." Praises Backstrom After the dissenting opinion on the appointment of Urban Backstrom as new head of the Bank of Sweden, and the criticism which the Social Democrats heaped on him after his open hearing in the Finance Committee, Persson surprised everyone with a confidence-creating statement about the new head of the Bank of Sweden: "I think that Urban Backstrom is doing a good job," Persson said, but he did not go so far as to promise that the head of the Bank of Sweden would remain after a potential change of power this fall. The fact that Goran Persson is making positive statements about the contributions by the former under secretary of state (Conservative) at least indicates that he realizes the danger of fanning rumors that a change would be part of a new government's plans. It would in all likelihood drive the interest rates up. Goran Persson does not hide his opinion that the Bank of Sweden has previously missed several opportunities to push the interest rate down, but he had no criticism of the policy being pursued in today's situation. It is evident from the party bill, however, that monetary policy should be formed on the basis of more indicators than the development of inflation. What the party is aiming for is that the monetary policy outside the inflation goal should also be designed for an ambitious growth target for the entire economy. The Social Democrats' new/old arsenal of stimulus measures includes a program aimed at youth unemployment, in which the goal is for every unemployed person under 25 to be offered a job or other active measures within the period of 100 days. On the investment side, an entire battery of measures is included, with direct deductions as number one. Up to 70 percent of the investments for machinery by business and industry may be deducted during the first year. It is proposed that the measure should take effect on 1 July this year and last for one year. The investments are expected to increase by 6 billion in 1995 as a result of just that measure. Business and industry organizations are skeptical, and some critics are of the opinion that the measure prepares for a tax planning which the Social Democrats in other connections oppose. Incentive Subsidy The expansion of the AXE [communications network] system is moved up in the Social Democratic proposal, which also wants to accelerate maintenance investments in the highway network. The party further proposes 20-percent incentive subsidies for more ROT [repair, renovation, expansion] activity in apartments and a 10-percent temporary investment subsidy for new housing construction begun before the turn of the year. For next year the Social Democrats propose savings -- agriculture, defense, etc. -- of 65 billion kronor and income supplements in the form of tax increases amounting to 3.8 billion. They oppose child care allowance and oppose the proposal for a new unemployment insurance. "Unfinanced tax cuts and new social reforms must get off the agenda," it says in the bill. That opinion is not just aimed at the government side. Goran Persson has not foreseen any new social reforms even in the party's own version. If he becomes finance minister, he will have a tough enough time anyway, one could imagine.
