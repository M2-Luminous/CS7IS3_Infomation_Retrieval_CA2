FBIS4-45507 "jptdd028__l94007" JPRS-TDD-94-028-L JPRS Narcotics 10 June 1994 LATIN AMERICA BOLIVIA MIR, MNR Deny Accord To `Tone Down' Report On `Narcolinks' MIR, MNR Deny Accord To `Tone Down' Report On `Narcolinks' PY2006133594 La Paz HOY in Spanish 10 Jun 94 p 12 PY2006133594 La Paz HOY Spanish BFN [Excerpt] The rumors spread during the past few days referring to alleged negotiations between the MNR [Nationalist Revolutionary Movement] and the MIR [Movement of the Revolutionary Left] were denied by the two parties' representatives, although with different arguments. Communications Minister Ernesto Machicado, MIR Senator Gonzalo Valda, and MIR Deputy Hugo Carvajal said the version of the alleged agreement between the two parties, supposedly to "tone down" the report on "narcolinks" in exchange for support to sentence the Supreme Court justices, were mere rumors. Carvajal believes the rumors spread by some MNR groups seek to discredit Constitutional Committee Chairman Edil Sandoval to force him and other deputies to act "aggressively" against the MIR. Carvajal added: "An effort is being made for the purpose of demonstrating the existence of alleged negotiations, probably due to disagreements among some MNR groups that seek to discredit and disqualify the performance of Edil Sandoval, probably to prevent him from continuing to behave as objectively as he has done so far." Carvajal said he believed that these rumors influence the rest of the committee members to act against the MIR to avoid speculation regarding the alleged negotiations. The MIR deputy regretted the spreading of rumors on the performance of MIR senators in the impeachment process who, he asserted, "have conscientiously acknowledged the deputies' decision." According to Carvajal, the MIR senators will vote according to their consciences "and nobody will be able to influence them." [passage omitted]
