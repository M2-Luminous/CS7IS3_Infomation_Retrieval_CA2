SUMMARY: This action adds to the Procurement List commodities and services to be furnished by nonprofit agencies employing persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities. EFFECTIVE DATE: June 13, 1994. ADDRESS: Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled, Crystal Square 3, Suite 403, 1735 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, Virginia 22202&hyph;3461. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Beverly Milkman, (703) 603&hyph;7740. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On March 4 and 18, 1994, the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled published notices (59 FR 10378 and 12895) of proposed additions to the Procurement List. After consideration of the material presented to it concerning capability of qualified nonprofit agencies to provide the commodities and services, fair market price, and impact of the additions on the current or most recent contractors, the Committee has determined that the commodities and services listed below are suitable for procurement by the Federal Government under 41 U.S.C. 46&hyph;48c and 41 CFR 51&hyph;2.4. I certify that the following action will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The major factors considered for this certification were: 1. The action will not result in any additional reporting, recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small entities other than the small organizations that will furnish the commodities and services to the Government. 2. The action does not appear to have a severe economic impact on current contractors for the commodities and services. 3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish the commodities and services to the Government. 4. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41 U.S.C. 46&hyph;48c) in connection with the commodities and services proposed for addition to the Procurement List. Accordingly, the following commodities and services are hereby added to the Procurement List: Commodities Case, Carrying 1005&hyph;00&hyph;791&hyph;5420 Bag, Sand, Cotton 8105&hyph;00&hyph;965&hyph;2509 Drawers, Flyers' 8415&hyph;00&hyph;467&hyph;4075 8415&hyph;00&hyph;467&hyph;4076 8415&hyph;00&hyph;467&hyph;4078 8415&hyph;00&hyph;467&hyph;4100 8415&hyph;01&hyph;043&hyph;4036 Lubricating Oil, General Purpose 9150&hyph;00&hyph;458&hyph;0075 Services Janitorial/Custodial, R.
