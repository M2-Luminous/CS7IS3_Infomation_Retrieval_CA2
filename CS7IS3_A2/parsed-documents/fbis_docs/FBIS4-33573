During a meeting with the Association of Panamanian Industrialists, one of the country's leading organizations, Perez Balladares maintained that opening and modernizing the economy must occur without "jolt" or "shock" measures, which could have "unpredictable" social ramifications. "We are not planning to use disguised subsidies or indefinite protective tariffs to motivate the private sector; much less will we advocate excessive interference in its business activities," he said. He pledged to review those laws that discourage foreign investment, including the Labor Code, and those that regulate protection of the industrial sector, "because no legal instrument is engraved in stone, not even the Constitution." Perez Balladares said the opening of the market will not be "synonymous with a lack of protection and will not constitute a letter of marque for unfair competition." The opening of the market should not be confused "with ambiguous rules of the game or a tolerance of smuggling." Perez Balladares added businessmen will have to assume a large part of responsibility for the future of the country's economy, but they will also reap the most benefits due to the broad markets they will find. He added that in light of the prevailing globalization and rapid economic changes, the industrial sector will have to make adjustments in order "to be up with the times and able to compete in the international market." Perez Balladares said the private sector will be responsible for generating jobs while the government will have to provide the country with adequate infrastructures that will enable the normal development of industries. Perez Balladares said if the costs that depend on government legislation are not more arduous than those of other countries, "there is no reason for the country not to be able to compete in the international market in a relatively short time." As for Panama joining GATT, Perez Balladares said that his administration "will not allow any unnecessary delay or whimsical haste" and that negotiations will continue to integrate the interests of all productive sectors. He conceded that, although the final decisions will not satisfy everyone, "those who disagree will be in the minority." Regardless, all sectors will be consulted so as to minimize any adverse effects resulting "from this significant and unpostponable move Panama must make." Perez Balladares believes the "primitive and parochial" idea of paternalizing government works must be abandoned, and he urged private sector involvement in the construction of highways and the improvement, widening, and management of ports. The economic crisis the country is facing, he explained, goes hand in hand with the education crisis. There is no point in creating jobs if there are no qualified workers; conversely, it would be discouraging to have skilled workers if no jobs are available. In this regard, Perez Balladares urged private sector involvement in the process of educational reform and the training of labor, which will benefit industries in the future. According to Perez Balladares, the political integration advocated by Simon Bolivar "is a utopia," but economic integration in small or large blocs "is indispensable for development." Redefining Panamanian delegations abroad to promote the country's potential and publicize its advantages in close cooperation with local businessmen is among his government's priorities in attracting new foreign investment. He said security is vital for attracting foreign investment; consequently, "as a priority" he will professionalize the police force, "but without the jolt of having military control in public matters."
