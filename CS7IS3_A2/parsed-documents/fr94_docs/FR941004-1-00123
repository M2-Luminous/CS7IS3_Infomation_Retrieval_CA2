FR941004-1-00123 FR941004-1-00019 This proposed amendment to part 11 would provide a new and more efficient procedure for adopting non-controversial or consensual rules. Little or no cost would be associated with the FAA's use of this procedure in appropriate instances. Use of this alternative procedure is expected to reduce the costs of rulemaking to the FAA by eliminating duplicate publication of rule text when no adverse comment was received. In cases where the rule would result in cost savings to the aviation industry, use of this alternative would allow the industry to receive the cost savings sooner than would be the case if current rulemaking procedures were used. Accordingly, the FAA has determined that because no costs can be foreseen, the expected economic impact of the amendment is minimal, and that a full regulatory evaluation is not warranted. International Trade Impact The proposed rule is only a change in the FAA's procedures for rulemaking, and will have no impact on trade. Regulatory Flexibility Determination The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) of 1980 ensures that small entities are not unnecessarily or disproportionately burdened by Government regulations. The RFA requires agencies to review rules that may have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The costs associated with this proposed rule are minimal, and are well below any threshold established by FAA Order 2100.14A. Accordingly, this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on any small entity. Federalism Implications The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a federalism assessment. Conclusion For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act; and (4) that because any economic impact would be minimal, a full regulatory evaluation is not warranted.
