In this stage of the maneuvers, initially a divers' exploration team attacked the jetties of an imaginary enemy and while destroying support vessels tied up at the docks, passed through defensive positions and mine fields. The operating forces, in a lightning attack on military installations on the island, including radar, listening, and [word indistinct] posts, destroyed a substantial portion of the enemy's radar capacity. In the final stage of the Victory-3 maneuvers the heavy artillery of the Guards and [military] equipment company, with their heavy, precise, and extensive fire on enemy positions, installations, and the beach jetty, prevented the vessels of the imaginary enemy from aproaching these areas. At the same time as these operations, the joint IGRC-Army mine-layers blocked all entrances and sensitive areas with various marine mines of extremely high sensitivity. Meanwhile, the fighter-bombers of the army of the Islamic Republic of Iran, using the best tactical actions, identified attacking vessels and, coordinating with missile sites, took action to ensure their destruction. While bombarding the positions of the imaginary enemy, the Kousar brigade warship and the Qader support vessel, supported by the heavy fire of the army's gunships, began their thunderous attacks. The marine brigade and the commando brigade of the navy of the Guards Corps, together with the army's armored units and supported by the tanks and armored vehicles of the Guards Corps' land forces, executed a lightning attack on the island and captured the first defenses of the imaginary enemy. Meanwhile, in order to speed up operations and to capture the island, companies of the IRGC commando brigade, landed from helicopters beyond enemy lines and carried out their tactical military operations.
