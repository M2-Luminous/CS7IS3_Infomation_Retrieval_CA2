The report, submitted to government tax panels and the ruling coalition parties, estimates Japan will face a budgetary revenue shortage of 8.9 trillion yen to 12.7 trillion yen in fiscal 2000. Ministry officials told reporters that net increases in tax revenues are a necessary part of tax reform because fiscal and administrative reforms appear insufficient to cover the shortage. Kan Kato, chairman of the Tax Commission, said the panel acknowledged the tough medium- to long-term financial conditions. However, the panel is to make its own estimates, and revenue "neutral" is still one alternative for tax reform, Kato told a news conference after the panel's meeting. The advisory forum to the prime minister is scheduled to prepare various alternatives with concrete figures for its regional hearings in early June. After the hearings, the panel is to begin drafting its report for the coalition parties and the government to decide on promised full- fledged tax reform, including permanent tax cuts, by the end of June. Kato said the ministry report poses various estimates that require the panel's further review, including in social welfare spending, bond issuances, tax revenues and economic growth. He noted the body will come up with more "realistic" alternatives by including in its estimates effects from extending tax cuts. The report estimated 24 trillion yen for welfare spending in fiscal 2000, up from 14.6 trillion yen in the fiscal 1994 budget plan, based on figures from a welfare vision prepared by an advisory panel to the Health and Welfare Ministry. On bond issuance, the ministry projected 18 trillion yen, up slightly from 14.4 trillion yen, in line with its policy to limit the debt-to-expenditure ratio to 5 percent. Kato said further discussions are necessary on appropriate levels of bond issuance. He also ruled out the elasticity rate of 1.1 and the nominal economic growth rate of 5 percent used by the ministry to estimate tax revenues. Under the report, tax revenues are expected to increase to 79.3 trillion yen in fiscal 2000 from an estimated 53.7 trillion yen in fiscal 1994. Kato said more "natural" increases in such revenues can be expected with lower prices in line with deregulations and administrative overhauls to stimulate consumption. But panel members acknowledged the increases would not be enough to finance tax cuts and heavier welfare spending, Kato said. On the economic growth rate, many panel members held off on any optimistic outlook, he said.
