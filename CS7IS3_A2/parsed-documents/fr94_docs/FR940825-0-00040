SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In a notice published in the Federal Register of March 29, 1994 (59 FR 14626), FDA announced that a food additive petition (FAP 4B4413) had been filed by General Electric Co., 1 Lexan Lane, Mt.

FDA has evaluated data in the petition and other relevant material. The agency concludes that the proposed use of the additive is safe and that §177.1580(b) should be amended as set forth below. In accordance with §171.1(h) (21 CFR 171.1(h)), the petition and the documents that FDA considered and relied upon in reaching its decision to approve the petition are available for inspection at the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition by appointment with the information contact person listed above. As provided in 21 CFR 171.1(h), the agency will delete from the documents any materials that are not available for public disclosure before making the documents available for inspection.
