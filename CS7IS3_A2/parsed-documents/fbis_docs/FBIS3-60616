Unless Pyongyang takes positive measures, including the acceptance of IAEA inspections of its nuclear facilities, the North Korean nuclear issue will cease to be a subject of negotiations but a target of action by the international community. During Friday's session, the United States and France expressed grave concern over the possibility of the use of nuclear materials by North Korea for the development of weapons. They said their countries will have to take strong follow-up measures, including reference of the issue back to the United Nations Security Council. Nelson Sieverling, U.S. [IAEA] governor, said that if North Korea does not accept IAEA inspection at an early date, there would not be a third round of high-level U.S.-North Korean talks. The United States will have no choice but to refer the issue to the U.N. Security Council, he said. Sieverling made the remark after expressing grave concern over a report by IAEA Director-general Hans Blix that the IAEA could not give a "meaningful assurance" to the governors that North Korea was using nuclear materials only for peaceful purposes. The United States would not only continue its negotiations with North Korea but also have to refer the question to the U.N. Security Council if IAEA inspections are not taking place in North Korea and continuity of nuclear safeguards is maintained, he said. But the situation has not yet reached the point where it could not be turned around, Sieverling said, urging North Korea to accept the IAEA's routine inspections as soon as possible. The French Governor urged the IAEA to convene another Board of Governors meeting before its regularly scheduled one next year to work out countermeasures if there is no progress in the issue. It is necessary, he said, for the international community to take strong action including sanctions against North Korea by referring the question to the U.N. Security Council. The governor from Switzerland criticized the North Korean argument of "special circumstances" and urged Pyongyang to immediately and completely implement its nuclear safeguards agreement. Governors of other countries also shared their opinion that time was running out on North Korea for the resolution of its nuclear issue and all criticized Pyongyang in firm and unprecedented tones. Against these remarks, North Korea's ambassador to Vienna, Yun Ho-chin, repeated his country's old rhetoric that the issue had been raised by "some officials of the IAEA Secretariat" and that it was controlled behind-the-scenes by the United States. Therefore, he said, responsibility in the North Korean nuclear issue rests entirely on the IAEA and the United States. The nuclear question would be automatically solved once the United States and North Korea worked out the so-called package deal aimed at improving bilateral relations, he said. Continuity in nuclear safeguards in North Korea or any damage in the IAEA's surveillance mechanism also rested with the IAEA because the IAEA had refused to conduct inspections, Yun said. Ronald Walker, chairman of the Board of Governors, in summary, stated the board's complete support for handling of the question by the IAEA Secretariat and the director-general. While urging North Korea to accept IAEA inspections, Walker expressed concern over proliferation in North Korea's non-compliance of nuclear safeguards. North Korea's refusal to accept IAEA inspections has to be regarded as a challenge to the entire nuclear non-proliferation regime, he added. Walker asked Blix to report the Board of Governors' position to the United Nations.
