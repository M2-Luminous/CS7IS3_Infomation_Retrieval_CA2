We must all, together, create such a system of a democratic society and social order which in itself is favorably disposed toward man. Lithuania will then be a secure, flourishing, democratic country where concord and honesty will be dominant. [passage omitted] The nature of the political system of our democratic state became much stronger in 1993. It was very important that all the most important institutions provided for by the republic's Constitution, which did not exist in 1992, came into being. They are the president of the Republic of Lithuania and, for the first time in the history of the Lithuanian state, the Constitutional Court. [passage omitted] Visiting various towns and districts in Lithuania, I noticed that there has been no positive progress in local government. The reform of local government is overdue; corresponding draft laws have been drawn up. It is most important that reform does not take place for the sake of reform, but serves the solution of everyday problems of every person, not destroying what has been proved to be useful in practice. We now have our independent state, but we have failed to reorganize our state apparatus in such a way that it qualitatively differs from the previous one. This is bad. The implementation of the general state policy depends on the work of state officials and on their competence. Of course, the formation of a civilized state apparatus is a long-term process. Therefore it is important to adopt at present a law which establishes the rights and duties of state officials, their responsibilities and social guarantees. This would be followed by more radical decisions. I am a realist; therefore I do not deny that not all the residents of Lithuania have a favorable attitude to the present government and its policy. But, I think, nobody will dispute the fact that the political atmosphere in our country became calmer last year after we stopped looking for internal enemies and fighting against them. [passage omitted] On 1 January 1993 the republic's nationality was 19.4 percent non-Lithuanian. Eighteen of Lithuania's national minorities and ethnic groups have more than 100 public organizations. The Lithuanian legislation and practical policy regulating national relations is being positively assessed both in the country and on the international scale. A careful, consistent and at the same time a principled policy enabled the Republic of Lithuania to avoid the troubles and difficulties experienced by some other countries. This is capital which must not be thoughtlessly squandered. [passage omitted] I wish to note on this occasion that the adoption of a law on preventive detention, which has been the object of many disputes, has become an objective and unavoidable reaction to the organized crimes and enabled the law enforcement bodies to take the initiative. But the combat against organized crime with political and legal means can be successful only up to a certain extent. Economic and social causes of crime must be eliminated. [passage omitted] The national defense system is being reorganized according to the Western model. I must say that the rapprochement with the NATO structures is taking place, above all, by reorganizing the structure of our Ministry of National Defense according to Western standards. In solving these problems, we expect serious assistance from Western military experts. Nonstatutory relations and other negative phenomena in our army are among the most pressing problems. There cannot be concessions or compromises in this sphere. Nonstatutory relations in our army must be uprooted by mercilessly punishing the culprits. This, for me, as the supreme commander of the armed forces, is a strict and clear demand to the leadership of the Ministry of National Defense, the army commander and to all military commanders. [passage omitted] The decline of production slowed in the second half of 1993, and the signs of stability and even growth could be noticed in some branches of the economy. Some enterprises adapt themselves to new conditions of the manufacture and sale of products, and find themselves partners. Inflation was a very heavy burden last year. Joint efforts by the government and the Bank of Lithuania stopped it in the middle of the year. This was an essential condition for the introduction of the litas. After the introduction of the litas the rate of inflation declined even more, and constituted in the second half of the year [figure indistinct] percent. Since the prices of raw materials and energy resources have reached the world level I think there will be no great increase in prices this year. [passage omitted] The government program provides for concluding the stage of primary privatization in the first half of this year. But almost half of all investment checks remain unused. It is becoming obvious that it is not expedient to convert them into state bonds. In order to use all checks in the first stage it is essential to inform the residents as soon as possible about what will be privatized and to define the final date of the validity of the investment checks. [passage omitted] The government must effectively guide the process of privatization. I consider the work of the Central Privatization Commission to be unsatisfactory. Foreign investments in Lithuania's economy are not increasing as we expected. At present no foreign investors compete among themselves in striving to dominate Lithuania's market, but, on the contrary, the states are competing among themselves for foreign investments, including the Baltic states. In order to win this competition, it is esential to pay more attention to advertising, propagate our investment projects, supply information and all other services to foreign investors, and simplify the order of the use of foreign credits. [passage omitted] Many problems have accumulated in agriculture. In carrying out the agricultural reform the seed of the current confusion was sown, which almost halted the reform. As a result of a limited understanding of the problem of social justice the principles of rational farming were ignored. [passage omitted] Yet contrary to what our opponents and sometimes even misinformed foreign experts maintained, the agricultural reform was not impeded. [passage omitted] According to the latest figures, every third farmer has been given all the documents proving his rights to land and property. About 30 percent of land suitable for farming is currently used by the Lithuanian farmers. In 1993, privatization of the property owned by the agricultural enterprises was virtually completed. The remaining property of agricultural enterprises due to be privatized comprises only one percent of the value of that which is to be privatized. However, the general situation in agriculture and the financial state of agricultural subjects so far is not satisfactory. The slump in production which started three years ago continued last year. The volume of production in comparison with 1992 has decreased by eight percent. Farmers and agricultural enterprises encounter great financial difficulties, the reasons for which are: A decrease in the solvent demand by the population resulting in contraction of the internal market; limited export possibilities; and an ever-increasing flow of imported food products. The possibilities of the state to support the farmers in one way or another are also limited. However, most probably the main reason for the current situation are the debts to the agricultural suppliers by the food processing enterprises. [passage omitted] Although not long ago the farmers demanded freedom for economic activity, now they are attacking the government, demanding rather strict state control. Without going into fine detail I would like to say this: In a nutshell, the support must correspond to the financial possibilities of the state budget, it must help to coordinate the interests of producers and consumers, it must lower social tensions in rural areas and not increase them in the cities. It must not contradict the essential concepts of the agreement concluded with the World Bank and the IMF. [passage omitted] The Partnership for Peace program signed in Brussels on 27 January is a real step in ensuring the security of the state. It is becoming obvious that membership in the European Community and NATO is only a means of striving for further aims. I think that there is no need to discuss Lithuania's (?position). From the point of view of culture and of the geopolitical situation, it is a Central European country. But there is no need to artificially thrust ourselves into some single region and thus limit our opportunities. We are both in Central Europe and in the region of the Baltic Sea. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs should define Lithuania's strategy both toward the states of the Baltic Sea and of Central Europe, the Visegrad group, and other states. Many changes have taken place in the relations between the Baltic states. Cooperation between Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia, which has often been declaratory and which almost ceased in the autumn of 1991, acquired new features last year. Several meetings of the presidents, parliaments and heads of governments took place. The tripartite free trade agreement was signed and ratified, the memorandum on consular relations and the joint visa area of the Baltic states was signed. A Baltic Council is to be formed from the existing interparliamentary Baltic Assembly and the future Baltic [words indistinct]. A formula of three-plus-five is being consolidated in Lithuanian foreign policy. This is the prospect of cooperation between the three Baltic states and five Nordic states. But there are problems here, too. In relations with the Nordic states we are as yet unable to make use of the proposed aid. We not always display initiative. Our foreign policy contains the striving to establish and develop bilateral relations with Western states. I would like to mention relations with Germany as an example. They are intensive and can serve as an example of good relations with a powerful Western state, if only we can make better use of the opportunities of economic cooperation. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, making use of this example, could develop in a more inventive way our state relations with Great Britain, France, Italy, and the United States. It would be advantageous to Lithuania to establish closer relations with the Balkan states and those in the Near East, and also with such countries as Austria, Switzerland, Turkey, Israel and Canada. The relations between Lithuania and Poland have so far not been regulated by a joint political treaty. We must more boldly take the necessary step and sign such a treaty. The delay is very detrimental to Lithuania's interests. We must make better use of all opportunities in working in international organizations. This is a good opportunity to develop bilateral relations, especially bearing in mind our limited material and technical resources and shortage of experienced specialists. Relations with Russia and the CIS countries are important to us. Relations with Russia rather improved in 1993. This is testified by my meeting with the Russian president, Boris Yeltsin, and a packet of bilateral agreements signed during the visit of the Russian prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin, in Vilnius. This provides good grounds for the development of Lithuanian-Russian economic cooperation. So far I do not see any need to revise our policy toward Russia, although, in time, corrections might be necessary. If an imperial stand becomes stronger in the foreign policy of that country, Lithuania's policy will change toward Russia, too. The most important thing for us is to remain realists. Lithuania's relations with other countries will continue to be based on bilateral agreements, and various issues, both with Russia and with other CIS countries will be solved by Lithuania by way of negotiations. The visits to Kazakhstan and China demonstrated what huge and untapped possibilities exist in the Asian region. This is an immense market, the source of inexhaustible raw materials, the fastest developing economy, new technologies, financial and credit resources. I would like to mention that Lithuanian Government structures have not always smoothly coordinated their foreign policy. By my decree, the Council for the Coordination of Foreign Policy was formed. We should expect basic changes, although this council has no constitutional power to make decisions, but the authorizations of the heads and representatives of the state institutions make it possible to strive by way of coordination for the optimal decisions for our country. It is very important to form a positive image of Lithuania in the world. Disputes, dialogues and sharp criticism on the domestic issues of Lithuania should not become an object of international investigation or even derision, unless attempts are being made to discredit the state of Lithuania and frighten away our potential partners.
