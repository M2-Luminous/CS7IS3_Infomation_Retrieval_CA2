The meeting between guerrilla leaders and representatives of the peace mission, which consists of representatives of the International Support and Verification Commission of the OAS (CIAV-OAS) and the Catholic Church, took place in El Rosario, a village in Nueva Segovia Department in the northern part of the country, 2 km south of the Nicaraguan-Honduran border. Both parties confirmed Army chief Humberto Ortega sent the rebels a message that presumably established the terms for their demobilization and subsequent integration into civilian life. The content of the document was not revealed to the press, however. For its part, the 3-80 Northern Front gave the CIAV a document with its demands which consists basically of guarantees for physical security for the disarmament process. The Peace Commission will give the document to the government. A new meeting will then be called on an as yet unspecified date, CIAV representative Sergio Caramanga has explained. Both the Army and rebels have maintained a unilateral truce since last week to pave the way for the disarmament talks. Caramagna said at the end of the meeting the objective of "exchanging proposals" had been achieved. Esteban Talavera, one of the rebel leaders, said the participation in the talks of the 3-80 Northern Front's foremost leader, his brother Jose Angel Talavera, alias Chacal, was impeded by the strong presence of military troops in the region. According to him, approximately 120 special Army troops were deployed to the region in the past few hours. This prevented Chacal from reaching the area. It is believed Chacal is in a region bordering Honduran territory. The 3-80 Northern Front leaders reiterated their readiness to disarm without the political conditions they had established several months ago, including the resignation of Army chief Humberto Ortega and Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo. "We will insist on these demands in a civic struggle, because the political climate has improved in Nicaragua," Esteban Talavera said. As a goodwill gesture, Talavera released a soldier who was captured several days ago in fighting with the Army.
