Here's our reporter Reis Cico: [Cico] A delegation from our country attended the Crans Montana Forum in Switzerland. Prime Minister Aleksander Meksi, who heads the Albanian delegation, took the floor today. In his speech Meksi made a summarizing overview of the changes and developments in Albania, pointing out achievements in political, institutional, legislative, and economic reform. Prime Minister Meksi said that the results achieved in these two years of democratic government encourage us to go quicker toward the road of transformations and the country's democratization. The changes and transformations toward the construction of a new democratic society in former socialist countries, Meksi stressed, require above all a favorable climate of international relations and an increase in technical and economic assistance on the part of relevant bodies. Dwelling on Balkan problems, Prime Minister Meksi said that Albania thinks that the United Nations and the Western countries should contribute more to the establishment and preservation of peace in our region. After condemning the aggression in Bosnia, Meksi stressed the danger that the spread of the conflict to the south of the Balkans would include many regional countries in a direct war. Meksi continued to say that Albania considers it compulsory to preserve stability in the Balkans and maintains that problems should be solved through dialogue, he concluded. All the Crans Montana Forum participants addressed an appeal to the Western countries to contribute more to the democratic transformations of former socialist countries, considering this an investment for Europe.
