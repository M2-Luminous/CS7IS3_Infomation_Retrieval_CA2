"We must thus prepare a solid blueprint for peace. We must strive to establish a world free from the fear of war and nuclear holocaust. In this context, North Korea's lack of nuclear transparency is an ever more urgent issue," Kim told a lecture meeting at Japan's prestigious Waseda University. His remarks came one day after Hans Blix, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported to a meeting of the U.N. Security Council that North Korea broke its vow to allow IAEA inspectors full access to nuclear facilities. Kim, dressed in a purple and black academic gown given to him by Waseda officials, issued the appeal in front of some 1,000 Japanese and South Korean students, academics and journalists who packed the university's Okuma auditorium. Minutes before, Kim was awarded the university's honorary doctorate. Some 400 South Korean students are studying at the university out of a total student population of 46,000. During the president's speech, about 200 ultraleftist radicals demonstrated outside the hall, demanding the cancellation of the South Korean Government's plan to deploy a Patriot antimissile system to counter North Korean ballistic missiles. The president, now on a three-day official visit to Japan, denounced the Pyongyang government for defying the IAEA's demands for full inspection of its nuclear facilities in Yongbyon, some 90 kilometers north of Pyongyang. "It is depressing that North Korea continues to disregard the global demand for its nuclear transparency, casting a dark cloud over the Korean peninsula and the future of the Asia-Pacific region," the president said. In his speech entitled, "A Blueprint for a New Asia and a New World," he said, "During this past century of Western inroads into the East, Asia was thrown into a state of shock and confusion. From that point on, Asia has been anxious to catch up to Western civilization." "Now however, the world's center stage is shifting to the Pacific and East Asia is becoming the focus of world attention. Asians should now reflect on themselves and see Asia in a new light. We Asians must join hands to build a new Asia and a new world as well," he said. "Our two peoples should discard past prejudices for good and accept each other with open hearts and minds. We should honestly recognize the truths of history and have the courage to accept their lessons. A nation that fails to learn these lessons is bound to repeat past mistakes. We should join hands to shape a fulfilling future based on mutual trust." "To that end, young people of both countries, who are not steeped in old attitudes, must take the lead. If our young people march onward hand in hand, the future of the Asia-Pacific region will be ever more peaceful and fruitful. Our future hinges on their resolve and deeds," the president said. In the afternoon, Kim delivered a speech at Tokyo's Waseda University, where he elaborated on his vision of a "blueprint for a new Asia and a new world." Kim urged North Korea to accept unimpeded inspection of its nuclear facilities to prevent an outbreak of a "nuclear holocaust."
