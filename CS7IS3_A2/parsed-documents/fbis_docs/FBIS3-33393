Presidential spokesman Francisco Baker denied the president of the Republic is thinking of resigning to run for election. Baker remarked that Franco cannot run for a seat in the Senate, as a Brasilia daily reported last weekend, because he is not affiliated with any political party. Moreover, the deadline to become affiliated expired in early January. President Franco will only be at Planalto Palace a few days this week because on 24 February he will travel to Caxias do Sul, where on 25 February he will open the grape harvest. On 26 February, he will travel to Porto Alegre, where he is scheduled to meet Rio Grande do Sul Governor Alceu Collares; from there he will go to Canoas, where he will dedicate the expansion of the (Aupec Pascualinho) refining plant. On 27 February, Franco will travel to Sao Jose dos Campos, Sao Paulo, to attend the launching of General Motors' economy model, (Costa). Franco will return to Brasilia on 28 February after the launching ceremony, but he will only remain here a few days. On 3 March, he is supposed to leave for Guaira, near Caracas, Venezuela to discuss issues related to border affairs, gold diggers, and the preservation of the environment.
