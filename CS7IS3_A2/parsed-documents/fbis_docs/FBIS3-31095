However, he rejected the possibility of Hungarian political parties participating in this coalition. The SNS chairman thinks that the parties with pro-Slovak orientation are the parties capable of declaring, regardless of their positions in the past, their support for the national and state interests of Slovakia and, in particular, for the integrity and prosperity of the Slovak Republic. Those parties suitable to form a broad coalition are said to be the Party of the Democratic Left, the Christian Democratic Movement, the Alliance of Democrats, and practically all of the factions of the ruling Movement for a Democratic Slovakia. According to Cernak, Hungarian political parties do not meet the requirements for creating a broad coalition of pro-Slovak forces because of their behavior in the process of Slovakia's admission to the Council of Europe.
