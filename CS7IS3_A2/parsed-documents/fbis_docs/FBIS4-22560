America simply does not know what damage it would be easier to reconcile itself with: either to rid itself of such an essentially pacified Russia or to abandon certain of its own strategic spheres of influence. The United States is constantly following the policy of share, share, and share. I am amazed at its patience, but I understand it very well indeed. As a narcotic, as a ruinous passion, Russia captivated American statesmen. It has become the most expensive wild animal ever tamed, and--therefore--to deprive it of breakfast or--Heaven forbid--to beat it would be equivalent almost to a courtship. But this is only the emotional side of the matter. The pragmatic analysts in the White House understand other things too: A dextrous and capable Russia constitutes the backbone of United States foreign policy, and if the backbone is broken, the entire organism would be paralyzed. However, this is also understood by the pragmatic analysts in the Kremlin. And, therefore, taking advantage of its own seeming value, Russia is endeavoring to gradually return into its own hands the world which it lost. Russia knows how to frighten the Clinton administration. The latter can be frightened by the dictatorial policy of the Zhirinovskiy people. Moscow has used this fright in order to obtain the right to keep troops in Moldova and the Baltic states, despite the attitude toward this on the part of the governments in those places. It has likewise been allowed to conduct "peacekeeping" operations on the territory of the CIS, as well as to protect and defend the Russian-speaking population abroad. The Clinton administration can also be frightened by a change of allies. A possible rapprochement between Russia and Great Britain, for example, and the distancing of the latter from the United States was very clearly demonstrated by Yeltsin in February. For three whole days he did not answer Clinton's telephone calls, citing illness as an excuse, and after this he spent two days with John Major, who was visiting Moscow. All this occurred against the background of the exacerbation of the British-American "special" relationship following a sharp anti-Clinton campaign in the English media and after Washington granted an entrance visa to Gerry Adams, the leader of the anti-government, Northern Ireland Sinn Fein Party. A third fright is that of a renewal of global confrontation and a slide toward World War III. Nothing global can happen without Russia. This thesis of the Russian Federation's minister of foreign affairs, Kozyrev, has already been espoused in two unexpected initiatives by Moscow--the introduction of Russian troops in Sarajevo and Russia's attempt to allocate to itself the role of peacemaker in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. But in the latter case Russia seems to have gotten itself into a sticky wicket. The United States could reconcile itself with Russia's action in the Balkans, but not in the Middle East. The Russia idea of holding a second round of the Palestinian-Israeli conference in Madrid was rejected both in Washington and in Tel Aviv, even though it was passionately supported by Yasir Arafat. Let's recall that the first round, which was co-chaired by the United States and the USSR, ended without any positive results in 1991. The apotheosis of the Russian turn to the East had to be Andrey Kozyrev's secret visit to Tunisia and Israel. Its secrecy could not be maintained, nor could his statement concerning Russia's desire to send its own military observers to this region. It was not without reason that Israel warned about the activities of Russian intelligence in Syria and other Arab states. Another two directions in which Russia has been conducting a diplomatic offensive since the beginning of this year are Inner and Central Asia and Inner and Central Europe. Its pushing through into the former is attested to by the visit of Andrey Kozyrev's deputy, Anatoliy Adamishin, to Tehran, during the course of which a discussion took place concerning the possibility of Iran exerting an influence on fundamentalist terrorist groups which are blocking the road to peace in Palestine. Also discussed here was a common policy with regard to the Asian republics of the former USSR. Additional testimony was the appeal by the chairman of Tajikistan's Supreme Council, Rakhmanov, to the UN that the Russian troops in his state should be granted the status of "sky-blue helmets." As to the Central European sphere, Russia likewise achieved an incontestible success--something which is called the "Partnership for Peace." Together with political methods, use was also made here of an age-old Russian insuperable weapon--energy resources. The drastic March reduction in the norms of gas deliveries to almost all the European ex-Soviet republics. The January attempt to cut off access to oil in the Czech Republic and Poland. The plans for building a Yamburg-Belarus-Poland-Western Europe Gas Pipeline. Participation by Russian shareholders in Estonian, Belarusian, Ukrainian, and Hungarian energy-transport and petrochemical enterprises. The energy war may become a geopolitical occupation. All these movements and shifts in Moscow's renovated foreign policy have recently encountered a broader and more favorable response in Britain. This is obviously connected with the following two factors. On the one hand, London has always expected from Washington restraints placed on Germany and a less reflex-type attitude toward Japan. But Clinton--on the contrary--has adopted for himself the goal of restricting Tokyo, while unleashing Bonn. On the other hand, at the end of February Azerbaijan's President Aliyev signed an agreement in London providing for the Apsheron Oilfield to be developed by a certain consortium of eight British and American companies headed up by British Petroleum. At almost the same time the Russian Federation government prohibited the export of oil by the principal competitor of these companies--the Russian firm known as Lukoil. This is sharply different from last year's Russian stance, as a result of which a contract between Azerbaijan and Great Britain was almost broken off. In addition to everything else, Russia's efforts cast doubts upon Clinton's promise to Kravchuk (made during the latter's American tour) to the effect that the United States would become the guarantor of Ukraine's security and integrity. But, of course, the White House does have the power to play a certain role here. It is certainly true that Ukraine is viewed in Russia as a kind of traditional patrimony--a role similar to that played by Israel to the United States. Russia's meddling in the Middle East could engender a responding effort at an intervention by America in the post-Soviet space. Russia's "rollback" from the Arab region could also evoke a corresponding American response in Ukraine or in the Baltic region. It is entirely possible that such a "reciprocal clarification" could be Russia's actual purpose in making its unrealistic and precipitous foreign-policy initiatives. This is called a tactical preventive strike. But this is not an offensive but instead a defensive tactic. Its principal goal is not to snatch something belonging to somebody else, but rather to safeguard something of one's own. Unfortunately, Moscow regards Ukraine as "its own," just as it does--in the final analysis--all of Eastern Europe and Central Asia.
