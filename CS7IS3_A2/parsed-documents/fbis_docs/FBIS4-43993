Kliridhis will meet Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou at 1945 and European Commission President Jacques Delors around 2030 today. The Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation correspondent in Corfu reports that the Greek presidency and the Cypriot Government are convinced that tonight's meeting between Papandreou, Delors, and Kliridhis will mark a step forward in comparison with the previous EU decision to review Cyprus' membership application in January 1995. Well-informed sources have told our correspondent that Athens and Nicosia have set three goals for the Corfu summit. First, to specify that official talks on Cyprus' accession to the EU will begin in January. Second, if the first goal is not achieved, to secure a commitment that the timetable for the beginning of accession negotiations will definitely be set next January. Third, to see that the EU summit's closing statement mentions specifically that the next EU expansion will include Cyprus and Malta. Kliridhis will meet British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd at 2330 today. Hurd went to Corfu following his talks on the Cyprus issue in New York with the UN secretary general and with U.S. officials in Washington. Tonight's meetings come after the Cyprus visit by Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's special representative for Cyprus.
