The moderate daily KYONGHYANG SINMUN in Korean carries a 600-word report by Washington-based correspondent Kim Hak-sun under the headline, "50 Percent of U.S. Ground Forces in the ROK Are To Be Reduced Under Long-Range Plan--Research and Development Expenses for F-16 Included in U.S. Defense Budget." The report writes that in an annual defense report to Congress, the U.S. Defense Department revealed that the U.S. ground forces in the ROK consisting of two brigades will be reduced to one brigade. However, the Defense Department is also reviewing "a possibility of deploying more military equipment in the ROK in order to promote capabilities of coping with a U.S. crisis." The report stresses that "the research and development expenses" for F-16 fighters, which the ROK decided to introduce as "the next-generation fighters" will be increased every year until fiscal year 1996. The report then gives details of the amounts of these expenses to be increased each year. The leftist-leaning daily HANGYORE SINMUN in Korean publishes on page 3 a 500-word article by Washington-based correspondent Chong Yon-chu, with the headline "Additional Deployment of Weapons Reviewed--the U.S. Defense Report." Noting that the United States is planning to reduce the scale of U.S. ground forces in the ROK from two brigades to one brigade on a long-range basis, the article says that the U.S. Defense Department pointed out in its annual report to the President and the Congress that "because of North Korea's continued threat, the United States has frozen the withdrawal of U.S. Forces from the ROK, and is modernizing military power of the ROK and U.S. Forces in the ROK." The report also reveals that "the U.S. Defense Department is reviewing a possibility of deploying more military equipment in the ROK in a bid to enhance its capabilities of dealing with the crisis situation." The article says that according to the report, the budget for purchase of F-16 fighters will be "reduced" each year except 1996 but the "budget for modernization of fighters will be somewhat increased beginning in 1994." The article then gives a detailed amount of the budget for the purchase of F-16 fighters and for their modernization each year.
