SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Several parties have requested that EPA extend the comment period for the July 27, 1994 mercury-containing lamps proposal (59 FR 38288). Because EPA believes that the mercury-containing lamps issue is very complex and that the quality of a final rule may be greatly improved if all interested parties are able to fully explore the many issues raised in the proposal prior to submitting comments, the Agency has determined that an extension of 60 days is appropriate. Dated: September 12, 1994. Elliott P. Laws, Assistant Administrator. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;22975 Filed 9&hyph;15&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;P
