According to judicial sources, the incident occurred last night on the Pan-American Highway, in Santa Cruz Michapa jurisdiction, 20 km from San Salvador, in Cuscatlan Department. The reports said that the vehicle Perdomo was driving was machine-gunned, and that his wife, Rosa de Perdomo, and their daughter were seriously wounded. The three of them were returning to the capital from eastern El Salvador. Authorities said today they have no clues to determine if the attack was politically motivated or if it was carried out by common criminals who hold up vehicles on certain points of the highway at night, shooting at the drivers when they refuse to stop. Ambassador Bermudez said today she has no further details on the incident, adding that Perdomo's body will be returned to Panama tomorrow. Perdomo had been working for the IICA -- which is an OAS regional organization -- in El Salvador for approximately two and a half years. Perdomo's wife, who is recovering at a private hospital in San Salvador, is the key witness to help authorities clear up this incident, in which a Panamanian citizen was killed in El Salvador.
