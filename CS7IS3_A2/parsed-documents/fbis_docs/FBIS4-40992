Under this former Yugoslav republic's constitution all questions with a republic-wide dimension were to be tackled solely on the basis of consensus among the three Bosnian communities -- Serbs, Muslims, and Croats. Karadzic is a psychiatrist by profession. He is also a poet and a winner of the Sholokhov literary prize. [Sidorov] Mr. Karadzic, during more than two years of war in Bosnia talks to end it have been held in various dimensions, as it were. Many prominent politicians, including Western figures, even claim that the international community's more active intervention has merely prolonged the war and increased the suffering of innocent people. What is your forecast: Will the plan proposed by the Washington contact group mark a decisive step toward peace or will the next round of discussions about peace end in a renewed escalation of the war? [Karadzic] I do consider that the international community is largely to blame for the unleashing of this war. And if that community or, more precisely, the United States decides that it is time to end it, then a solution acceptable to the Serb side will not fail to emerge. If, however, they decide that it is not yet time and that the war should continue, they will propose a remedy that spells catastrophe for the Serbs in Bosnia. In that case the war will continue, and the Serbs will appear to be to blame. We have, alas, had to contend with just such a technique of interference. During my present visit to Moscow I have been able to see for myself yet again that Russia sincerely wants stability in the Balkans and is ready to support us in our striving for peace. If the United States built its relations with the Muslim side in the same way, there would already be peace in Bosnia. But the Americans are urging the Muslims to seize the greater part of the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina. They are encouraging the Muslim leadership in its ambitions and its desire to dominate in the Balkans. This means in effect continuing this exhausting war. A war by one side to secure an Islamic bridgehead in Europe, while on our side it is a war for survival.... [Sidorov] How are relations shaping up inside the Croat-Muslim Federation, created through U.S. mediation? Does it have any prospects? [Karadzic] We do not think it has any serious prospects. The deep-rooted conflicts between the Muslims and the Catholic Croats constitute a separate and pretty extensive topic. The Americans have restored the Croat-Muslim alliance not so much to reconcile the Croats and the Muslims, who have fought each other over the last year, as to recreate an anti-Serb front. I am, unfortunately, forced to say that some American circles are openly working for war. The war is now in their hands, and they refuse to let peace and stability prevail in the Balkans.... [Sidorov] Tell me, have you come to that standpoint recently or have you held it since the start of the war? [Karadzic] We had our suspicions. But over time we became convinced of the following: As soon as the sides came close to a common solution, the Americans, who had started to pretend that they wholly supported the Muslims, would enter the "game." And that would prompt the Muslims to continue the war. [Sidorov] If that is so, what, in your view, might be the next step by the United States on this plane? [Karadzic] As I have already said, an attempt to impose terms unacceptable -- absolutely unacceptable -- to the Serbs. If the United States does actually want peace, then at least half of its initiatives will be acceptable to us and half not. Let the terms be equally disadvantageous to the Muslims and to us. [Sidorov] As far as I recall, the Washington contact group's plan, that is to say the division of territory between the Serb community and the Croat-Muslim Federation in a 49:51 ratio, does not suit the Serb side, as you hold 70 percent of the territory. [Karadzic] That formula does indeed fail to suit us because prior to the war 64 percent of the territory belonged to Serbs. We did not start the war and we have not lost it either. Why, then, should the Serbs have less territory after the war than before? Yet we are ready to surrender something in the interests of peace. We will surrender the 10 percent of the territory which is not ours. We are holding on to it at the moment in the interests of defense. But we are also ready to surrender Serb land provided there is peace. To break the deadlock we could even accept the 49:51 formula provided that an exchange of territory -- quality for quantity -- subsequently took place. [Sidorov] Does that mean that it is far from being a matter of numbers and percentages? [Karadzic] It is not just a matter of them. Discussion should also proceed in terms of the viability of the states formed in place of the former Bosnia-Herzegovina. Of course, the conditions for viability are important not just for the Croat-Muslim state but also for ours. After all, if the international community were to accept the arguments of one side and ignore those of the other, that would be an obvious injustice. Our terms are as follows: the mouth of the Una river, a sufficiently wide corridor in the Posavina, and the rejection of any border along the Drina river, which was a symbol of the Serbs' separation (half the Serbs were in the Austro-Hungarian empire and half in Serbia). In addition, we need our part of Sarajevo and access to the sea. [Sidorov] But you know that these terms are regarded as unacceptable by the Muslim side. [Karadzic] No, I consider that if they were in favor of peace they would accept these terms, as they pose no threat to the security of their state. [Sidorov] How do you now rate the state of contacts with Moscow? [Karadzic] We feel that Russia -- particularly the people -- understands us. The government is in a difficult position. Russia cannot afford to get into conflict with the West, but we do not want that either. For us Moscow's objectivity is the main thing. The Russian government really can play the role of mediator, as it understands both us and the Muslims. Unfortunately, the United States demonstrates a different approach. We have no right to ask Russia to intercede in everything, but it is in Russia's own interests to see that the Serbs always have been and remain the country's most consistent allies in the Balkans. And we are, after all, now paying the price for our traditional friendship with Russia. By dividing the Serb people and weakening their state system the West has always sought to weaken Russia in some hypothetical conflict. The double standards which Western countries and Turkey are demonstrating in Balkan affairs -- in their assessments, say, of the actions of the Croat-Muslim and Serb sides -- cannot be explained any other way. [Sidorov] What do you think of the intentions of your opponents -- the leaders of the Muslim community? Do you concede that they are sincere in their desire for peace for their own people? [Karadzic] We are convinced, unfortunately, that our opponents are essentially not seeking peace. These are politicians of a fundamentalist, pro-Iranian persuasion. They have already promised their coreligionists in Sudan and Iran that they will take all of Bosnia-Herzegovina under their control and become a member of the Islamic Conference. This despite the fact that there are fewer Muslims than Christians in Bosnia.... Not so long ago Nijaz Durakovic, former leader of the Bosnian Communists, said that the Bosnian Muslims would be the best terrorists among the Islamic revolutionaries because they look like Europeans. Alija Izetbegovic expressed himself in similar vein a few days ago. I have to say that we are facing the first threat of Islamic fundamentalism in Europe -- the first but not the last. Europeans' heads will continue to ache from what has happened in Bosnia.
