The recommendations focus on bringing forward planned production cutbacks of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other solvents that destroy the Earth's ozone layer and expanding the scope of materials subject to output restrictions. They are contained in an interim report by the chemical product council, an advisory body to the trade minister. The package is in response to a provision in the revised Montreal Protocol, which calls for complete abolition of five types of CFCs by the end of 1995, instead of 2000 as recommended originally. The protocol, revised in November 1992, also called for total cessation of halon production by the end of last year and of trichloroethane manufacture by the end of 1995. The panel also recommended establishing a legal framework to ensure adequate control and management of CFC production and curbing discharge of ozone-depleting materials. Item-by-item output, however, should not be restricted because such a step would run counter to the market mechanism, it said. The interim report called for efforts by the government and the private sector to promote effective recycling of CFCs.
