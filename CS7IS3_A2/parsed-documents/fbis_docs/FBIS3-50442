He also is convinced that this project is not a winner for his other colleague deputies. Let us listen to Mr. Antoine Joseph at Edner Jean's microphone: [Begin Joseph recording in Creole] I encourage all ideas that allow Haitians to sit together and discuss, whether it is at an international or national conference. However, I think that the political parties in the Parliament should give their opinion on the idea of the national conference, as the invitation was sent to them. If they reject it, then the idea will fail. Right now, many political parties favor the national conference. Some of them have said no. As I had already supported the national conference, I still support it. This is because I think it can embrace more subjects than an international conference. Many people think that the Haitian crisis must be repatriated, and I am not totally against that idea. Let me remind you that the Washington protocol agreement was signed between the international community and partly the Parliament. Although two Haitians signed the Governors Island Accord, it was with the mediation of the international community. What would be better is to have the international community broaden the framework of the negotiations and the search for a solution by inviting several sectors-- such as political parties, the labor unions, the peasant organizations, the active sectors of national life, and the social professional associations. All those people should sit together in order to find a solution. [passage omitted] [end recording]
