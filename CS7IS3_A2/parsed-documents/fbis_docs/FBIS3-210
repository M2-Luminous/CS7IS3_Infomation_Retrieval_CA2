Addressing a kwaZulu legislative assembly caucus meeting in Ulundi, Mr Buthelezi said: "We need to separate the kingdom of kwaZulu from the rest of South Africa." "If this can be done through a constitutional principle in the 1993 Constitution then we will entertain constitutional amendments to this effect." If the African National Congress and the SA Government went ahead with the April poll without the Zulu king's demands being met, "the kwaZulu government cannot be held responsible for the anger of the Zulu nation". Mr Buthelezi made no mention of his talks with ANC [African National Congress] President Nelson Mandela on Tuesday at which he agreed to consider registering the IFP for South Africa's first all-race elections in April. Repeating his rejection to recent constitutional concessions, the IFP president said these did not even begin to address demands for exclusive provincial powers, autonomous regional taxing powers, and the protection and guarantee of regional constitutions against arbitrary decisions of the constituent assembly. King Goodwill Zwelithini was demanding formal recognition and constitutional accommodation of the kingdom of kwaZulu, he added. Furthermore, the constitution had to make provision for the "establishment of a constitution by the provincial legislature of kwaZulu/Natal which shall recognise and protect the institution, status and role of the king of the Zulus, the kingdom of kwaZulu and the traditional leaders as well as their powers with regard to indigenous laws, customs, culture, language and land tenure system". The "intractable" problem concerning the problem of King Zwelithini and the kingdom of kwaZulu could not be resolved through amending sections of the present constitution, but through a constitutional principle only. The new constitutional principle on self-determination was not compatible with the king's demands, said Mr Buthelezi. "The position of our government regarding the failure of the SA Government and the ANC to accommodate our reasonable demands remains exactly the same as before. "To deny the citizens of kwaZulu the right to self-determination is a savage attempt to strip us of our cultural heritage, to belittle the traditional importance of his majesty the king of the Zulus, and to eradicate all evidence of our Zulu existence." Mr Buthelezi again slammed the ANC for "manipulating" the constitutional process to subject Zulus to the "illegitimate sovereignty of the ANC/SA Communist Party alliance without our consent, without these people having defeated us, and against our will". "As far as his majesty the king is concerned, elections in kwaZulu can only take place once this issue of sovereignty has been resolved." The Zulu nation was demanding an end to the illegitimate domination of its territory, said Mr Buthelezi, and "what the king is demanding is not so wild when one has been watching the ease with which the (State President F W) de Klerk government has just handed back Walvis Bay to Namibia".
