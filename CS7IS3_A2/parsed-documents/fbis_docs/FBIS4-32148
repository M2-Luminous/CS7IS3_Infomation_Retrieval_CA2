Organizational and personnel matters were the focus of the talks. Attila Csaszar, our staff member, sent the following report from the site: [Csaszar] The coalition talks ended just a short time before the beginning of this program. For the time being, here are some brief notes on the results. The MSZP, the winner of the elections, will have nine ministries in the future government, while the SZDSZ will have three: the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Culture and Public Education, and the infrastructure portfolio [Ministry of Transport, Telecommunications, and Water Management]. Political state secretaries will be provided by the MSZP. Names have not yet been mentioned, according to SZDSZ Chairman Ivan Petoe. An agreement has also been reached on which party will provide the parliamentary speaker. This post will be filled by an MSZP deputy. The three deputy speakers will be nominated by the SZDSZ, the MDF [Hungarian Democratic Forum], and the FKGP [Independent Smallholders Party]. The FKGP will have the opportunity to delegate a deputy speaker only if it signs the six-party agreement on parliamentary matters. A preliminary decision was taken on matters relating to parliamentary committees. The SZDSZ can delegate the chairmen of three committees -- the Constitutional, Defense, and Foreign Affairs Committees. The chairmen of the other committees will be delegated by the MSZP. The opposition is still expected to make demands in this matter, however. It was also said that in the current situation, the two sides might even sign the coalition agreements as early as Friday. It is also very likely that in accordance with earlier reports, Gyula Horn will be the prime minister.
