"We have been working on this for a long time. It takes several years to work on such a candidacy. Honduras is going to obtain that post at a world level for the first time," he said. He said the election will take place at the next UN General Assembly scheduled for September in New York. We are now trying to garner our votes, he said. There are more than 160 states in the United Nations, and therefore we have to hold good negotiations with friendly countries. Concerning the election of the next OAS secretary general, he said Honduras will keep its promise to support Costa Rica in the first round, and "there will be an ample debate among the Latin American countries for the second round." Regarding the candidacy of Colombian President Cesar Gaviria for that post, the Honduran foreign minister said there are different opinions as to the person who should direct the Inter-American organization. He said it is very important for Honduras to be a member of the Security Council, because this would practically entail making decisions on world issues. There are permanent and nonpermanent members on the Security Council. The great powers are the permanent members, the others the developing nations. "For the first time, there is going to be a Honduran representative on the Security Council. The only countries that have had this privilege in the past are Panama, during the government of Omar Torrijos, and Nicaragua, during the time of the revolution," he said. The foreign minister said, however, no decision has been reached yet on the candidate.
