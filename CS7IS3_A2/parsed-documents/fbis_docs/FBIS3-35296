Citing eyewitnesses, the reports said that the Israelis have built asphalt roads through the al-Malikiyah gateway, which they set up in 1948, to these hills, which they now have linked to the farms in Shab'a. They occupied the latter in 1967. The reports add that the occupation forces set up many camps and observation posts in these heights and surrounded them with barbed wire. In addition, they set up iron pillars, flood lights, and other military equipment. They also imposed a curfew under the pretext that these are military areas. It is worth noting here that the Israelis established many settlements among the farms of Shab'a and built roads linking them to the Tiberias area many years ago.
