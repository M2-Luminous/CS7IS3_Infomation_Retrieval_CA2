Boris Fedorov said today in an interview with the Ekho Moskvy radio station that he looks upon Yegor Gaydar's decision with understanding. Fedorov called this move the beginning of a turning point. As far as he himself is concerned, in the finance minister's words, he has not yet received an offer to enter the new government. If he does receive one, Fedorov remarked, he will reach his decision this Monday or Tuesday.
