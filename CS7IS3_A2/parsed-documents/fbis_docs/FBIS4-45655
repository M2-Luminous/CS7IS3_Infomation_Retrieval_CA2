Wood producers and the recycling industry are in strong disagreement over whether it should be permitted to burn wastepaper for energy purposes. The Danish Forest Federation has come right out and said it: Burn the paper instead of increasing demand for recycled paper. There is quite enough of it on the market, a fact that is reflected in the price, which, roughly speaking, is next to nothing. A growing recycling industry is destructive of forests, which cannot dispose of new wood. And at the same time only recycled paper, through its production process, helps increase CO[.sub]2[/] emissions. The paper industry in Denmark is also involved in the debate. Not surprisingly, it holds the opposite point of view. In a letter to the minister for industry, the environment, and energy and the [Folketing standing] Committee on the Environment, Stora Papyrus Dalum, Inc., Skjern Papirfabrik, Inc., and Grenaa Papir, Inc. state that burning wastepaper would destroy the supply of wastepaper to the Danish paper industry. The Liberal, Conservative, and Progressive Parties have proposed to the Folketing that the ban that has existed since 1986, under which paper collected by cities and towns must not be used as an energy source, be lifted. That is to say, that it must not be burned. The proposal has just had its first reading in the Folketing and has not been sent to the Committee on the Environment, and the Danish Forest Federation has asked to appear before it. Recycling Paper Increases CO [.sub]2[/] Emissions The Environment Administration has prepared a note on the issue that shows the advantages and disadvantages of burning paper. Among other things, it looks at when there is increased recycling the consumption of fossil fuels and thus CO[.sub]2[/] emissions increases. "This squares with both common sense and foreign analyses. On the other hand, it does not square well with Danish environmental policy to prohibit an energy source that could cut down on the repercussions of the greenhouse effect by using fossil fuels," said Martin Einfeldt, who works in the information department at the Danish Forest Federation. He pointed out that in its note the Environment Administration makes the proposal to rescue scrap paper's CO[.sub]2[/] record: namely by using the wood, which the forests are saving, for energy purposes. "They came up with that idea out of the blue. At the moment Europe's forests are experiencing a growth rate that is 50 percent greater than the cutting rate, so the tree surplus is growing by 200 million cubic meters per year," Einfeldt said. The paper industry has told the Environment Committee that it is not able to use new wood as a raw material either technologically, economically, or on the market. The industry is set up to use wastepaper and cannot help the forest industry out of the crisis it is in owing to a shortage of sales opportunities. Analysis Not Good "In its note on recycling, the Environmental Administration is hinting indirectly against burning and depositing that the analysis cannot be used as a basis for making a decision in the Folketing. The Danish Forest Federation is entirely in agreement with this point of view," Einfeldt said. Environment Minister Svend Auken has so far rejected the need to change the current law pertaining to burning in the waste sector.
