FR940916-1-00090 FR940916-1-00016 D. Charging of Air Brake System. Present regulations for air brake testing basically require that cars that have previously been tested in accordance with the regulations either ``be kept charged until road motive power is attached'' or be retested. 49 CFR 232.12(i). Based on longstanding administrative interpretation and practice, FRA presumes that a brake system is no longer adequately charged if disconnected from the charging device (supply of pressurized air) for more than two hours before coupling of locomotives; otherwise, retesting is required. In the ANPRM (57 FR 62556), FRA requested comments from interested parties regarding the viability of this interpretation and sought information for developing alternative procedures that would not jeopardize safety. The AAR and several railroads stated that there is no reason to assume that once a train is charged and tested and then left standing without being provided with a source of compressed air that the brake system would become defective. These parties suggested that leakage on standing trains has been greatly reduced through the use of welded brake piping and fittings and ferrule-clamped air hoses. These commenters felt that FRA's interpretation of allowing trains to sit without air for only two hours is from an era when this new equipment was not used. They also stated that FRA's current interpretation costs the industry money, fuel, and time and creates pollution because trains must be either reinspected or left with a locomotive attached and idling in order to avoid performing a full initial terminal test. Several railroads suggested that trains could be off air indefinitely if the consist is not altered, or at least as long as 24 hours, and remain in the same condition. Several commenters recommended that if a set of cars is off air for an extended period, all that should be required is a set-and-release test to assure the continuity of the brake pipe. CP Rail Services mentioned that there is no such two-hour rule in Canada and stated that in Canada if cars are off air for any length of time a set-and-release continuity test is required. Every commenting railroad felt the current two-hour interpretation is onerous and unrealistic. The BLE, BRC, and several individual carmen felt that the current interpretation is reasonable. Most of these commenters expressed concern for the integrity of the brake system if a consist were left standing for longer than two hours. These concerns were aimed at the effect that climate might have on the equipment and the increased possibility of vandalism to the equipment if consists sat without air for longer periods. One conductor recommended returning to a four-hour limit as a minimum. FRA Conclusions. FRA agrees that our longstanding administrative interpretation, that requires the retesting of cars disconnected from a charging device for longer than two hours, was established prior to the development of new equipment that has greatly reduced leakage problems, such as welded brake piping and fittings and ferrule-clamped air hoses. However, contrary to several railroads' assertions FRA does not believe that cars should be allowed to be off air for extended periods of time without being retested. FRA believes that the longer cars sit without air attached the greater the chances are that the integrity of the brake system will be compromised. The longer cars sit the more susceptible they may be to weather conditions or even vandalism, as some commenters suggested. Consequently, based on today's equipment, operating practices, and overriding safety concerns, FRA feels that cars should not be disconnected from a supply of pressurized air for longer than four hours without being retested. E. Specifications for Power Brake Systems for Freight Service Currently, Appendix B of Part 232, entitled ``Specifications and Requirements for Power Brakes and Appliances for Operating Power-Brake Systems for Freight Service'', contains the specifications for AB valves, as were adopted in the early 1930's, and has not been modified since, although several deviations have been permitted. No improvements or new features, as reflected in present-day control valves, have been added to the appendix. Consequently, FRA sought comments from interested parties as to how the specifications and requirements contained in Appendix B could be updated and changed. See 57 FR 62556. The AAR and several railroads recommended that Appendix B be eliminated and a reference made to the appropriate AAR specifications. These parties felt that the AAR specifications are far more stringent than those contained in Appendix B. One railroad suggested that if Appendix B were to be rewritten it should encompass operating parameters of brake performance, such as transmission speed of service and emergency reductions and time periods in which control valves should respond to these signals. New York Air Brake Company (NYAB) also recommended that Appendix B be deleted and reference made to the appropriate AAR specifications, which require performance that is far above that contained in the appendix. Westinghouse Air Brake Company felt that Appendix B as currently written is too restrictive and detailed to allow for technological development. This commenter stated that newer valves are being developed which are above and beyond the specifications contained in the appendix and suggested that more flexibility be incorporated into the specifications to allow for the development of new equipment. The BRC recommended the possibility of adding some type of addendum to Appendix B regarding new technology without eliminating the minimum requirements contained in the appendix.
