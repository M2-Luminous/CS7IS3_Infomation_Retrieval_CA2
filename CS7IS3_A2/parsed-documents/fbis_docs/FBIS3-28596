The political reform bills which are based on reform of the election system had only just begun to be deliberated in the upper house, but the coalition government camp had begun work on making a list of prospective candidates in the single-seat election districts, and anticipating the election results. Among the candidates backed by the coalition of the ruling parties are listed even the names of incumbent LDP Diet members, and Diet members who will be urged to "switch sides" are also revealed. Within this is concealed a level-headed, shrewd calculation which foresees a re-restructuring of political circles.

The "Other" of the candidates backed by the coalition governing parties includes such persons as those who are not at present members of the coalition government parties, but who will become candidates backed by the coalition government parties at the time of the election. The "Other" of the opposition parties are such persons as independents linked to the LDP. Even Formation at One Stroke of a New Unified Party Even if the political reform bills on which deliberation has begun in the upper house were to be passed in the current Diet session, the work of dividing into single-seat election districts would not be settled until about next summer. But predicting the division of the new districts is not difficult for an election professional. And the "fitting (into election districts)" of candidates based on the division of districts is already progressing steadily behind the scenes. One cannot do the "fitting" unless one grasps the trend of opposing candidates, not to mention the votes received in the past by candidates on the government-party side based on the division of districts and the analysis of vote-gathering organizations. It is no exaggeration to say that this ability to collect information before the fact makes the difference between victory and defeat. This table of predictions was made by executives of the coalition governing parties, based on information from every party, as material for the purpose of advancing as quickly as possible the coordination of candidates within the coalition governing parties. The system of single-seat election districts is advantageous to large political parties. If the current coalition governing parties were to each field their own candidates without cooperating in the election, there would be no doubt of a strong victory by the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] in virtually every election district. If the coalition camp also desires to survive after reform of the election system, it has no choice but to merge and form a new party, or to narrow down to a single candidate by coordinating candidates among a number of parties. Even if it does not go so far as to form a new unified party at one stroke, the building, as soon as possible, of a system of election cooperation which has a re-restructuring of political circles in view is a question of life or death for the coalition government parties. That is, the election situation summarized in the prediction table not only constitutes reference material for devising the governing parties' election strategy and reconstruction strategy, it also constitutes material for persuasion when urging candidates of other parties to switch sides. Prediction for Diet Seats in Proportional Representation Districts (Total: 226) Coalition government parties (total of 140 seats) Social 32 Democratic Party of Japan Shinseito 25 Komeito 28 Japan New 36 Party Democratic 7 Socialist Party United 3 Social Democratic Party Sakigake 9 Opposition parties (total of 86 seats) LDP 73 JCP 13 "It Is Painful for the Social Democratic Party of Japan, But It Is an Accurate Reading" Incidentally, what one notices as soon as one looks at the table is that even though the parties in the same coalition government, members of Sakigake [Harbinger] and the left faction of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] have not been made coalition-backed candidates. Sakigake is forming a unified group with the Japan New Party, and both Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura and Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Hatoyama, who guard Prime Minister Hosokawa's flanks, are from Sakigake. But it has been rumored more than once that they are not on good terms with the Komeito-Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] bloc, which forms the root and trunk of the party side. Outwardly, the people involved deny that they are not on good terms, but to the extent that one looks at this chart, one can see that there seems no likelihood that the split between the two will be healed. To the executives who made the table, the nucleus of the governing party is strictly Shinseito, Komeito, and the Democratic Socialist Party, plus the Japan New Party; furthermore, the ideal appears to be to form a new group, if possible, by drawing in the right faction of the SDPJ. In election districts in which it is judged that members of Sakigake and incumbent members of the SDPJ's left faction will run, they are throwing coalition-backed candidates against them without mercy. In that sense, one can say that the prediction table's selection of coalition-backed candidates is rather arbitrary. But if one bases it on the present situation of the Shinseito-Komeito bloc holding leadership power, there is no doubt that this prediction is a simulation with a high degree of probability. "I feel it is a bit painful for the SDPJ, but it is an accurate judgment. It is certainly the work of a pro." Political commentator Minoru Morita said that in a positive manner after just glancing over the table. "About the time of the Kaifu government people were saying things like young politicians will fight in election districts and elders need only move to the proportional representation section, but after all, ultimately there is no choice but to field candidates who can fight. The most important thing to politicians and political parties is being elected, so water flows downward, and politicians try to survive. That is very clear when one looks at the table." A considerable portion of the single-seat election districts were formed by dividing existing midsized districts into two. In such cases, it appears that if the governing parties' strongest candidate chooses one of the two districts, there will be a tendency for the opposition party's strongest candidate to choose the other district. If that happens, it means that both sides will be able to survive. But at the same time, the agricultural sector of LDP Diet members and the urban sector of governing party Diet members will not "get in," no matter how they adjust. In the end, candidates who are relatively weak in elections will have to switch to other parties, or transfer to proportional representation districts. Young Japan New Party Candidates Will Be Pursued in Urban Sectors The table on the preceding page brings together those among incumbent Diet members who will very possibly lose their election districts. In the agricultural sector the names of LDP party elders are conspicuous, and in urban sectors it is the names of young Diet members of the Japan New Party, who were elected in the previous new party boom, and of SDPJ Diet members who have an air of decline. Needless to say, to political parties it is more welcome for former Prime Minister Nakasone and Diet member Yuriko Koike of the Japan New Party to collect votes from throughout Japan as a person on the proportional representation list, than to have them fight a close race in a single-seat district where winning the election is not necessarily guaranteed. But it also remains to be seen whether this kind of fastidious person will move to proportional representation with little fuss. Well, if we take it that things work out as predicted by the executives, the total Diet seats for the coalition parties in the single-seat election districts will be 153, exceeding the LDP's 115 Diet seats by nearly 40 seats. In particular, Shinseito will win 41 seats and be the top party of the coalition governing parties. Why is Shinseito strong? Morita analyzes it as follows. "At present the only ones that have grassroots vote-gathering ability are the Komeito-Shinseito bloc and the LDP, which still has power. It is inevitable that in the single-seat election districts the basic pattern of the election will be a battle between these two." Komeito, which possesses the firm support base of the Soka Gakkai, and Shinseito, which has been skillful in elections since the time of the LDP's Takeshita faction, are currently at the core of the government, so it is natural that they will gain strength. On the other hand, the hollowing out of the LDP will progress increasingly with the passage of time. That is the centripetal force of power. Even so, the provincial organizations that were built up over the course of 40 years will not crumble that easily. It seems likely that the LDP will continue to maintain a force that will account for a third of all Diet seats. The Key to Understanding the Route of Reorganization of the Government Is... The downward trend will be spurred still more for the SDPJ, which, along with the LDP, shouldered one wing of the 1955 system. In single-seat election districts it will be overtaken by Shinseito and fall to second place among the governing parties. According also to the prediction for proportional representation districts (see the table) concerning which SANDE MAINICHI made an estimate based on analysis of such things as recent public opinion polls and the past voting behavior and rate of votes gained for each party, the result will be that the SDPJ will be overtaken by the Japan New Party, and barely be able to garner more than 30 Diet seats. It appears that because of the breakup of the prefectural, regional and district councils, the local labor union organizations, which occurred along with the start of Rengo, the SDPJ will not be able to put a brake on the loss of support. Morita dismisses it, saying, "The trend of the times is to seek persons with individuality. The SDPJ and Sakigake, which have vague policy lines, will be weeded out in the end." When we look at the increases and decreases for all Diet seats which adds together the Diet seats which the governing-party executives predict for single-seat election districts and the Diet seats which SANDE MAINICHI predicts for proportional representation districts, the LDP will decline by nearly 40 seats from the number it has now, and, conversely, the governing parties will add the large number of 17 independent Diet members, so it will increase by about 30 Diet seats. If the combination of parties remains as it is now, it would probably mean that the Hosokawa coalition government will continue to shoulder the responsibility for government, and will also become more stable. But it is to be expected that that is not the only aim of the single-seat election district predictions. What deserves attention here is that, even if one excludes the group that will switch from the LDP and which is counted as independents, the core governing parties bloc, consisting of Shinseito, Komeito, and the DSP, will total 140 Diet seats, which means that whether this number joins with the 62-seat SDPJ, or with the 54-seat Japan New Party, it will surpass the 188 seats of the LDP. In other words, the three parties of the core bloc would now for the first time gain a free hand in re-reorganization of political circles. It seems likely that the aim hidden in the prediction chart will be the key to understanding the route to a new reorganization.
