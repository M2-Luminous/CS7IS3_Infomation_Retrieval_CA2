Then, I spent a month wholeheartedly studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping. Together with Volume 2 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping that was published 10 years ago, this book is the foundation for the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics--the Marxism of contemporary China; are the best teaching material and glorious banner to educate the people, to seek unity of thought, and to create a new situation in socialist cause; and are a scientific guide for us to march triumphantly. These books are rich, extensive, and profound in contents, are filled with a clear-cut spirit of our times and spirit of nationalities, and are illuminated with splendid light. In as short as a month, it is impossible for us to comprehensively and profoundly understand this book, the "true scripture" of the Marxist theoretical literature of our times. Hereafter, I will report to you on how Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping was compiled and relay the superficial understanding and experience gained from my first reading of this book. Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping Inherits and Develops Marxism With New Ideas and Viewpoints Proceeding from the reality of China and by upholding the principle of combining Marxism with China's reality, Comrade Xiaoping has keenly throbbed with the pulse of our times, emancipated the mind, pioneered the road, blazed new trials, and led the party and the people create new and earth-shaking causes since the commencement of reform and opening up, thus changing the outlook of China and affecting the world. Just as pointed out by the report of the 14th CPC Congress: "We have inherited and developed Marxism with new ideas and viewpoints." The Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping is Comrade Deng Xiaoping's overall understanding of the law of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, while Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping is a representative work of Marxist theory that enters a new state and attains new heights in contemporary China. To put it briefly, Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping has primarily set forth the following new ideas, new viewpoints, and new concepts: 1. The essence and fundamental task of socialism. Comrade Xiaoping said: "The essence of socialism is to liberate productive forces, develop productive forces, abolish exploitation, eliminate polarization, and finally achieve common prosperity." This points out that the fundamental task of socialism is to develop productive forces and the fundamental purpose is to eventually achieve common prosperity. This new viewpoint breaks away from the past fixed mode of thinking in which the essence of socialism was understood from the angle of production relations and superstructure, has set up a new mode of thinking in which the essence of socialism is understood from the standpoint of combining productive forces with production relations, thus completely placing the understanding of the essence of socialism on a scientific foundation of historical materialism. This new viewpoint has broken with the past limitations of regarding revolution as the liberation of productive forces only and has set up the new thinking mode of liberating and developing productive forces and constantly changing and perfecting socialism through reform, thus completely putting the understanding of the essence of socialism on a scientific foundation of dialectical materialism. This new viewpoint has set up the new thinking mode of "abolishing exploitation, eliminating polarization, and finally achieving common prosperity," thus making a clean break not only with the traditional socialism of "simultaneous prosperity" but also with capitalism characterized by exploitation and polarization. Then, this new viewpoint laid a completely new theoretical foundation stone for the establishment of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and this viewpoint can be considered a programmatic viewpoint commanding the whole book. 2. The criterion with regard to judging the "three advantages". Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: "In the final analysis, not taking a full step in reform and opening up and not boldly pioneering a road means the fear of accumulation of more capitalist things and of taking a capitalist road. The crucial point in this regard is "being capitalist" or "being socialist." In following the criterion of judging these advantages, we should chiefly determine whether they are favorable for the development of productive forces; for enhancing the comprehensive strength of socialist countries; and for upgrading the people's living standard." This is a fundamental standard of judging all gains and losses in line with the socialist essence, which has been raised by Comrade Xiaoping after his several inferences of "practice being a sole criterion in testing the truth;" of freeing the entire party from the serious fetter of two whateverism; and of realizing the shifting of work emphasis. The criterion is also to free the entire party from the serious fetter of "being capitalist or socialist" and to orient reform and opening up into the new historic period of establishing the systems of socialist market economy. 3. The initial stage of socialism. Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: "The 13th congress of our party has clarified the initial stage in which China's socialism is and socialism practiced by China belongs to the initial stage. Socialism itself is in the initial stage of communism. However, China is still at the initial stage of practicing socialism. This means that China is staying in an undeveloped period. Therefore, we should formulate plans based on this theory and according to it." The theory of socialism's initial stage represents an important conclusion made by Comrade Xiaoping in understanding socialism over again. It has done away with the traditional socialist concept of "bigger in size, a more developed socialist nature, pure socialist essence." The theory has also placed the changes of the relations between ownership and distribution on the undeveloped level of productive forces. All of these have been the theoretical basis and fundamental starting points for the party to formulate its basic line and all principles or policies. 4. The economic development strategy with three steps. Comrade Xiaoping said: "We should take three steps in developing the economy. By the end of this century, we should accomplish the work of two steps by having people dress warmly and eat their fill as well as finally become better-off. We will spend 30 or 50 years in the next century on reaching the level of medium-developed countries. This is our strategic target as well as our lofty aspiration and great ideals." Realizing the target of modernizations step by step and in line with the periodical goals has not only reflected the spirit of respecting the economic law, seeking truth from facts, and stably making progress; but also drawn up a blueprint for Chinese nation to join in the strong nationalities in the world and to make socialism and itself prosperous. It also represents a grand program of uniting with the entire party and the people throughout the country to wage arduous struggles, to make unswerving efforts, and to head for the 21st century. 5. The seizure of opportunity, the acceleration of development, and efforts to improve the national economy to a new level every several years. While holding talks with several central comrades in 1991, Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: "It is right for us to stress stability, however, it is possible for us to lose the opportunity if we overly stress it." "The large turn in the world at present just means opportunity." "All people are saying: What position we will be in the `century of Asia and Pacific'?" "If we fail to seize the opportunity and to improve the economy to a new level, other people will surpass us much faster and we will lag behind." In his speeches given during his 1992 south China inspection tour, Comrade Xiaoping also said: "The key to seizing the opportunity to develop ourselves lies in developing the economy," "in their process of development, some countries also have had the period or stage of high-speed development," "in developing the economy, China should strive to reach a new height every few years," and "judging from our experiences in the past few years, it is possible for us to reach a new height in economic development every few years." The viewpoints Comrade Xiaoping has put forward not only seize the opportunity provided to China's economic development by the abrupt changes in the situation of the world, but they also conform to the objective law governing the periodic and wave upon wave of development and set forth an important historical responsibility for the entire party and people across the country to build a strong country amid the intense competition in the world. 6. Poverty is not socialism, nor is too sluggish a development. In his article "Learning From Historical Experiences and Preventing Erroneous Tendencies," Comrade Xiaoping said: "Many strange things emerged during the 10 years (meaning the 10 years of the Great Cultural Revolution). People were asked to be content with poverty and backwardness and to have impoverished socialism and communism rather than affluent capitalism. This was what the gang of four advocated. How can we have impoverished socialism and impoverished communism!" He emphasized repeatedly: "Socialism cannot hold its ground if it is always poverty-stricken," "socialism should eliminate poverty, and poverty is not socialism, still less communism," and "sluggish development is not socialism, either." The viewpoints Comrade Xiaoping repeatedly emphasized have clarified the long-standing serious chaos created by the "leftist" ideological trend and conformed to the basic requirements of the socialist system and the common desires of the millions of people. 7. Reform is China's second revolution. Comrade Xiaoping said: "Revolution is meant to liberate productive forces, and so is reform. It was a revolution to overthrow the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism to liberate the productive forces of the Chinese people. Therefore, revolution is to liberate the productive forces. After the establishment of the socialist basic system, we should still fundamentally change the economic system that fetters the development of productive fores and establish a socialist economic system that is full of vigor and vitality to promote the development of productive forces. This is reform. Therefore, reform is also to liberate productive forces." Judging from China's practice, reform has effected and is effecting profound changes in the economic, political, social, scientific and technological, and cultural fields and major changes in people's standard of behavior, lifestyle, mind-set, concept on value, and criteria for right and wrong. Comrade Xiaoping's expositions indicate that the nature of the revolution is not an amendment to the minor details of the original economic system but a fundamental transformation of the economic system and a thorough change of the mechanism for economic operation. This has ideologically and theoretically mobilized our party to effectively promote reform. 8. China's development cannot be apart from the rest of the world. Self-blockade and self-isolation must be opposed. Comrade Xiaoping sets forth: "Now, the world is open. Following the industrial revolution of the Western countries, China became backward. One of the important reasons for this was that China closed itself to the international arena. After the founding of the PRC, they blockaded us and to a certain extent we closed ourselves to the international arena even more. All this has brought us some difficulties. Experience and the lessons of the past 30 years or so told us that construction could not be developed if the door is closed." "China's development cannot be apart from the world." Comrade Xiaoping's viewpoint deeply sums up China's experience and lessons in being reduced from a secondary powerful country to a backward one in the 100 years or so, conforms to the historical trend of internationalizing the world economy and making the world economy an organic whole, and sets forth a strategic issue of rejuvenating the Chinese nation. 9. Science and technology are the first productive forces. Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: "Marx said that science and technology are productive forces. This is very accurate. Now, it seems that this saying is not enough. I think that science and technology are the first productive forces." This is the distillation of the theory on the current economic development and the practical experience in scientific and technological progress as well as the new development in Marxism. 10. Socialism and the market economy have no fundamental contradictions. Comrade Xiaoping said on several occasions: "The difference between capitalism and socialism does not hinge on planning or the market. Socialism has the market economy and capitalism has the control by planning." "There is no fundamental contradiction between socialism and the market economy." "The market economy can be developed under socialism." Comrade Xiaoping's inference has laid a theoretical foundation for setting up the socialist market economic system. If we say that encircling the cities from the rural areas is the only way to win the victory in China's first revolution, building the socialist market economic system is the only way to win the second victory in China's second revolution. 11. The reform of the political system must suit the reform of the economic system. Comrade Xiaoping said: "It will be difficult to reform the economic system if we do not reform the political system." "Along with the development of reform, we will inevitably come across obstacles." "What is more important is that the political system cannot suit the requirements for the reform of the economic system." "Whenever we make a step to promote the reform of the economic system, we deeply experience the necessity for reforming the political system. Without the political structural reform, there will be no guarantee for making achievements in reforming the economic system. If we cannot continuously promote the reform of the economic system, the development of the productive forces and the realization of the four modernizations will be obstructed." Comrade Xiaoping's inference brings to light the obstacles for deepening the reform of the economic system, develops the basic Marxist principle that the superstructure should suit the economic foundation, and clearly points out the orientation of reform. 12. Grasp with two hands and be tough with both hands. This is Comrade Xiaoping's consistent idea. In Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, Comrade Xiaoping repeatedly pointed out: "We should grasp with two hands. One hand is the economic policy on opening to the outside world and enlivening the domestic economy. The other hand is to resolutely deal blows to various kinds of economic criminal activities." "There must be two hands in promoting the four modernizations. The four modernizations cannot be realized with only one hand. The two hands indicate that we should grasp construction with one hand and grasp the legal system with the other." "We should grasp reform and opening up with one hand and grasp the struggle against various criminal activities with the other. These two hands must be tough." This indicates that "Grasping with two hands has become a key strategic principle and task for building socialism with Chinese characteristics." 13. One country, two systems. This is an idea put forward to resolve the Taiwan and Hong Kong issues. Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: "One country, two systems, specifically means in the PRC, to implement the socialist system in the mainland with a population of 1 billion and to implement the capitalist system in Hong Kong and Taiwan." The idea of "one country, two systems" is an example of Comrade Xiaoping's creative development of Marxism and an important development of the theory of the state--the political and theoretical core of Marxism. His pioneering work will not only create a new situation for China's great cause of reunification but also exert a far-reaching historical influence on the peaceful undertakings of the entire world. 14. Check turmoil and prevent peaceful evolution. Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: "China's four modernizations will not succeed without a stable political environment," "all the things that oppose and hinder our taking the socialist road and all the factors leading to chaos and even turmoil in China should be eliminated," and "a need for stability is an issue above all other issues in China, and, without a stable environment, nothing will be accomplished, and the achievements already won will also be lost." Comrade Xiaoping also pointed out: "The Western countries are fighting a third world war without the smoke of gunpowder, meaning the peaceful evolution of socialist countries," and "therefore, we should educate well our Army, our organs of dictatorship, Communist party members, the masses, and youths." As time goes by, the lessons in the disturbance of some countries, China's political and social stability, and the development experiences in people's living and working in peace and contentment have all the more proved Comrade Xiaoping's viewpoints to be scientific and truthful. 15. Be on the alert against right tendencies, but mainly guard against left tendencies. Comrade Xiaoping said during the past 10 years: "We should oppose both `leftism' and rightism when emancipating the mind," "but the largest danger comes from `left' tendencies," and "right tendencies may ruin socialism, and so may `left' tendencies; and China should be on the alert against right tendencies but should mainly guard against `left' tendencies." Comrade Xiaoping's theory summarizes the historical experiences and lessons of China's revolution and construction, exposes the extremely great danger of the "left" tendencies that are seemingly revolutionary, and clearly points out the major tendencies we should guard against in the process of reform, opening up, and the modernization drive. It pinpoints the current problems and has a far-reaching guiding significance. 16. Adhere to the party's basic line without wavering for 100 years. Comrade Xiaoping repeatedly emphasized during the past 10 years: "We should tell the world that no one can change the principles, policies, and strategies that we have now formulated," "the basic line, principles, and policies we have formulated should be continued and unswervingly carried on," "not only should the current leaders adhere to them, but also the leaders to serve the next terms of office should adhere to them," and "the basic line should take charge for 100 years without wavering." The party's basic line represents the precious experience gained by the CPC by summarizing both the positive and negative experiences and lessons during the decades of practice in the revolution it led millions of people to carried out. It is the lifeline of our party and is where the basic interests of Chinese people lie. Comrade Xiaoping's call for keeping the party's basic line unchanged for 100 years which he issued after careful consideration is an immediate need in China's reform and development and also a need in China's marching toward the 21st century. 17. Peace and development are two major topics of the present world. Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: "One of the really big issues of the present world which are of global strategic importance is the issue of peace and the other is the economic issue or we may call it the development issue. The issue of peace is one concerning the East and the West and the issue of development is one concerning the South and the North. We can summarize them into four words-- East, West, South and North." This figurative summation of Comrade Xiaoping has great foresight, scientifically analyzed the development and changes in the world situation after the war, promptly made theoretical analysis that conforms with the objective trend of the development situation, provided a reliable guarantee for our country to develop foreign relations and to seize the opportunity to develop itself, and it is becoming a common understanding of the whole world and the common task facing the whole world. 18. We should view the international situation soberly, try to maintain our position, and cope with it calmly. In September 1989, in face of the sudden changes in the world pattern, such as the great changes in East Europe, the disintegration of the Soviet Union, and the reunification of East and West Germany, Comrade Xiaoping said earnestly to several central responsible comrades: "Regarding the international situation, we can summarize it into three sentences. The first is to view it soberly; second, try to maintain our position; and third, cope with it calmly. We must not be impatient because impatience may lead to failure. We must be calm, quietly immerse ourselves in practical work, and accomplish one affair, our own affair." This is one of the important aspects of the political briefing which Comrade Deng Xiaoping gave to leaders of the new generation of our country after he accumulated the experiences gained during scores of years of domestic and international struggles, and is a basic stand which our country should uphold during a considerable long period of external struggle, and has been proven by practice over recent years that it is a correct foreign principle. 19. The crucial issue of China is to internationally improve the Communist party. Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: "China's problem will come from inside the Communist party. We must approach this issue soberly, pay attention to training personnel, and select people of ability and political integrity into the leading bodies in line with the criterion of selecting revolutionary, young, well- educated and vocationally proficient cadres. We should rely on this point if we want to uphold the basic line the party has kept for 100 years and maintain a long period of peace and stability. This is an affair that really affects the overall situation." "In the final analysis, the crucial issue is to improve the Communist party inside. If nothing happens we may sleep at ease." Comrade Xiaoping's directives have exposed where the key and the vital part of the problems of China lie, and provided a major task for party building. 20. We should strengthen the building of politics and fight corruption. During recent years, Comrade Xiaoping unceasingly stressed: "We should do several things that satisfy the people. There are two aspects. One is to boldly conduct reform and opening up, and the other is to step up efforts to fight corruption." "To rectify our party and realize our strategic objective, there will really be the danger of failure if we fail to fight corruption, in particular, the corrupt phenomena in the upper layer of the party." "Facts show that the Communist party is capable of eliminating repulsive things. We should fight corruption during the whole course of reform and opening up. As far as cadres and Communist party members are concerned, they should grasp the building of clean politics as a major affair." Comrade Xiaoping expounded the major significance of conducting anticorruption struggle from the perspective of the party's life and death, which is a new development of the Marxist theory on party building. Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping has many new ideas and new viewpoints which I will no longer list here one by one. In Studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, We Should Have a Good Command of and Make Clear Some Major Issues In studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, we should give prominence to focal points, grasp the essentials, and make clear some major issues in line with realities. What major issues on earth should we center in conducting study and discussion and how should we combine the study and discussion with the realities of ideology and work? For this, Comrade Shan Rongfan will set forth demands on behalf of the provincial party committee. Here, I will only make a report on my personal experience in study. 1. Emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts constitute the quintessence of all theoretical viewpoints of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping. When meeting with foreign guests, Comrade Xiaoping appraised himself as the "group of seeking truth from facts." In the beginning chapter of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, Comrade Xiaoping demanded us for the first time to "take our own road and to build socialism with China's own characteristics." From the very beginning of this book, he expounded the ideological line of "seeking truth from facts and proceeding from reality in doing everything," that was always advocated by him. In the concluding chapter, namely, the world-famous important speeches made during his south China trip, he repeatedly stressed: "Seeking truth from facts constitutes the quintessence of Marxism." "I have not read many books. But, I have always believed what Chairman Mao said is realistic." "Without a little spirit of being fearless and without a little spirit of rush advance, we will be unable to beat a good and new path and to pioneer a new cause." This has again gone back to the quintessence of "emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts," that runs through the whole book. Comrade Xiaoping is the pioneer of the emancipation of the mind. He pointed out: "What we are engaged in now is a new cause. It has not been mentioned by Marx, has not been engaged in by our ancestors, and has not been engaged in by other socialist countries. Therefore, there are no ready experiences for us to learn from." "Marxism should develop, and socialism should also develop, developing along with the development of the practice of human society and with the development of science." In his guidance to the great practice of reform, opening up, and modernization drive, he stressed: "We should not only refrain from copying the methods of Western capitalist countries but also refrain from copying the methods of other socialist countries;" "many problems cannot be tackled with old methods;" and "we should boldly try a thing and go ahead." Otherwise, "daring not to emancipate the mind and daring not to untie our hands will result in missing opportunity, just like the saying "a boat sailing against the current must forth ahead or it will be driven back." When the household output-related contract system displayed its advantages for the first time, Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: "Becoming rich is not a sin. It can be affirmed as a very good policy. When the individual and private sectors of the economy and the three types of foreign-funded enterprises met with reproach for competing with state-owned enterprises, Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: "Developing a little individual sector of the economy and attracting foreign enterprises to run plants in China constitute the complement to the socialist economy." When the economy of special zones was much debated by the people, Comrade Xiaoping solemnly answered: "Special zones constitute the window, the window of technology, the window of management, the window of knowledge, and the window of opening up policy." "Special zones are the new thing of socialism. Special zones are of socialism but not of capitalism." When some people and some localities became rich ahead of others and some people could not accept them, Comrade Xiaoping stressed: "We stress on common wealth but also allow differences." It is impossible to develop equally. The thing will be easier if we let some localities become rich first and then make them help the poor." With a profound understanding of the interest and aspirations of the people, with a correct command of the law of the development of things, and with a flexible application of the Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Though, Comrade Xiaoping gave a clear and correct answer to the major questions concerning the overall situation of reform, opening up, and economic construction, and greatly promoted the emancipation of the mind throughout the party. Comrade Xiaoping is a model in seeking truth from facts. He pointed out: To emancipate the mind, we should have our ideas conform to the objective reality, seek truth from facts, proceed from reality to do everything, and proceed from the actual conditions of China and the world. Comrade Xiaoping thoroughly analyzed the actual conditions of China and the world. He pointed out that the greatest reality of China is that China is in the initial stage of socialism where the productive forces are not well developed and that the great reality of the world is that peace and development become the main subjects, there will be no world war in a longer period of time, and we can strive for a peaceful international environment that is conducive to the domestic construction. Just in line with these two greatest realities, Comrade Xiaoping set forth the "political line of boldly, wholeheartedly, and perfectly developing the four modernization;" the key policy on grasping favorable opportunities and making self-development; and the basic state policy on reform and opening up. In regard to the unprecedented reform undertaking, Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: "Our policy is to be bold enough, make stable steps, and take one step and look around before taking another." "The key is to be good at summing up experiences and avoid making big mistakes." Whenever reform has been developed for a period of time, Comrade Xiaoping constantly exhorts the whole party: "Now, it is time to look back. We have to see what has been done right and what has been done wrong so as to decide the next-step reform work." Here, Comrade Xiaoping organically combined emancipating the mind and boldly blazing new trails with seeking truth from facts and respecting the objective law and fostered a brilliant example for the whole party to persist in the ideological line of "emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts." Proceeding from the reality of the province and using Xiaoping's theory to arm our heads, emancipate the mind, and renew our ideas in the historical turn of setting up the socialist market economic system is of prominent necessity and urgency. Our productive force development level lags behind that of the advanced areas. Therefore, we must eliminate the fixed ideas of doing everything according to books and proceeding from the traditional socialist ideas and principles and foster the new idea that emancipating and developing productive forces is the essential characteristics, fundamental purpose, and fundamental standard of socialism. The state-owned sector of the economy accounts for an excessive large proportion of the economy in the province. Thus, the existing managerial forms lack vitality. We must eliminate the traditional public ownership idea characterized by state ownership and state management; define various kinds of ownership forms characterized by state ownership, collective ownership, cooperative ownership, and various sectors of ownership; define various kinds of property organizational forms characterized by independent investment, shareholding system, and shareholding cooperative system; and define the public ownership idea where ownership is separated from the property right of legal persons. Along with the promulgation of the state key reform measures in 1994, we must change the existing forms to regulate and control the administrative distribution of loans, tax reduction and exemption, and the readjustment of contract base figures; and define the regulation and control ideas of separating government functions from enterprise management, capital, and business dominated by indirect means. Under the circumstances where reform measures should be standardized by laws, we must change the policy idea characterized by a policy for a piece of land and a policy for a plant and the policy idea of development in reliance on reducing taxes, conceding profits, and special preferential policies; and define the policy idea of creating equal competition conditions to enliven the mainstay of markets. Under the new situation of carrying out the market economic system, we must eliminate the inherent ideas that land is not a commodity, labor forces are not able to enter markets, and socialism does not have capital category and foster a market idea that all production factors, such as land, labor forces, capital, and property rights, can be circulated and exchanged. Under the new situation of further opening to the outside world, we must eliminate the managerial form, method, and traditional idea of totalling excluding capitalism and define the open idea of handling affairs according to the general market economic laws and the international practice. 2. What socialism is and how socialism with Chinese characteristics should be built are the theme of the third volume of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping." In the eighties, Comrade Xiaoping took the overall situation, the reality, and the future into consideration and meditated, in retrospect, why the Soviet Union's pattern was not desirable, why there was evolution and disintegration later, and why Comrade Mao Zedong encountered setbacks one after another during his later years in his exploration on the practice of the "three red banners" and the continued revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. In his speeches given when meeting with foreign guests, Comrade Xiaoping repeatedly said: "Even the Soviet Union failed to completely clarify what socialism is like after many years' of efforts," "the Soviet Union's pattern later became ossified," "our past understanding of what socialism and Marxism are was not totally clear," "it is all right to decide to take the socialist road, but we should first understand what socialism is," "a problem in understanding Marxism and socialism has existed for many years," "we have not clarified how to understand and develop Marxism in changing conditions," and "people who do not inherit and develop Marxism with new ideas and new viewpoints are not true Marxists." When talking with some central responsible comrades before the 13th party congress, he once again pointed out: "The report to the 13th party congress should provide a theoretical exposition on what socialism is and should clearly explain whether our reform is socialist." We can see that Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, where the theme of what socialism is and how socialism with Chinese characteristics should be built appears repeatedly from the beginning to the end, is continuously developed in content and deepened in ideology and shows ever enhanced understanding of laws. According to my understanding, the reason why Comrade Xiaoping painstakingly considered and repeatedly emphasized this theme was that the detours and mistakes we had experienced before reform and opening up started and the misgivings and doubts we experienced after reform and opening up started, in the final analysis, resulted from our failure to thoroughly clarify this question. After the initial study of the third volume, I feel that, to clearly understand this theme, we should clarify the following basic theoretical questions: Why do we develop socialism? This question concerns the origin and non-origin of change in the socialist system. Historical materialism holds that productive forces are the ultimate decisive force in the development of human society. The reason the socialist system will unavoidably replace the capitalist system lies not in its conformity to "eternal truth and justice." The reason is, just as Marx said, that the capitalist system has become the "shackles of production forms that were developed, that the concentration of the means of production and the socialization of labor have reached an extent incompatible with their capitalist shell, and that the shell will soon blow up." (Das Kapital, Vol 3) This is to say that the development of productive forces is the original, first, and ultimate decisive factor, and socialism, as a social system, is the non-original and second factor decided by the development productive forces. It is just like Engels pointed out that socialism is an inevitable demand when the development of productive forces has reached a certain stage. In addition, "it is possible to develop socialism only when the development of productive forces has reached a certain stage and when the practical conditions for realizing it are all ready (from socialist ideal to scientific development). Comrade Xiaoping has profoundly understood this historical dialectical quintessence and pointed out: "Although we have conducted socialism, actually we are not up to standard. Only when we enter the middle part of the next century and reach the level of a moderately developed country can we say that we have really conducted socialism." When he met with presidents of Tanzania and Uganda, he said: "According to your own conditions, perhaps, you should not be too anxious to engage in socialism right now." He said that we are "actually not up to standard" to carry out socialism at present, and that we should not be "too anxious to carry out socialism." This is implied to the fact that our conditions are not ready for developing the productive forces. This has clearly told us that our purpose of carrying out socialism is to develop the productive forces and that we should not develop the productive forces for the sake of socialism. In terms of the objective law of the development of human society, this has strategically and thoroughly solved the most basic issue of why we engage in socialism. What is socialism? There is an issue of the essential and nonessential aspects of socialism. For a long time, the people have believed that the essence of socialism is public ownership, planned economy, distribution according to work, and later, the dictatorship of the proletariat, the party's leadership and spiritual civilization. From the perspective of the times, Comrade Xiaoping introduced for the first time the idea of productive forces to the essence of socialism in the history of development of Marxism, explicitly proposed that the essence of socialism is to "emancipate and develop the productive forces, eliminate exploitation and polarization and finally lead to common prosperity." This thesis has ended all kinds of distortion and erroneous understanding of the essence of socialism, eliminated some principles, forms, and methods that do not belong to the essence of socialism. Of this, the principles of public ownership and distribution according to work are determined and served by the essence of socialism, and are essential to the essence of socialism, and therefore, they are correct and must be upheld; there are also some principles, forms, and methods, such as the planned economy, are not needed by the essence of socialism, and, therefore, they are not necessary to be upheld. In addition, some principles, forms and methods, such as the commodity economy, the market economy, and the shareholding system, that conform with the demands of the essence of socialism or cause no harms to the essence of socialism must be used for reference and be applied. For a long time, we have been used to regarding some things that are not the essence of socialism as the essence of socialism and upheld them, and regarding things that meet the demands of the essence of socialism, such as the family-based contracting system and reform of property right system, as "heretical beliefs," and opposed them. The reason for this is that we have failed to completely clarify the essence of socialism. The thesis of Comrade Xiaoping on the essence of socialism has scientifically answered the basic question of what is socialism. This is a big emancipation of the ideology of the communist people and a major breakthrough of the scientific socialist theory. How should socialism be developed? This question concerns the purpose and means of socialism. According to Comrade Xiaoping's thesis on the nature of socialism, the purpose of socialism is to "ultimately achieve common prosperity," and all others are the means. This idea of Comrade Xiaoping's took shape as early as the 1960's. His famous talk on "cat," namely "regarding the best form of production relation, we should have an attitude of adopting whatever forms that can fairly easily and rapidly restore and develop agricultural production in a locality," and "all cats, white or black, are good cats as long as they catch mice," profoundly brought to light in extremely simple language the relations between the purpose and means of socialism. That is, we may adopt whatever means that helps develop productive forces and ultimately achieve common prosperity. In Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, Comrade Xiaoping repeatedly emphasized that the ultimate purpose of socialism is common prosperity, "poverty is not socialism, nor is too sluggish a development," "we adopt all methods that help develop productive forces, including bringing in capital and advanced technology from abroad," and "many operating forms are the means and methods for developing productive forces, which can be adopted by both capitalism and socialism, and they serve those who use them well." After studying Comrade Xiaoping's theses, I feel that we should truly break with the outdated concept of persisting in means by regarding it as the purpose and sticking to the means at the expense of the purpose and should never again do such a silly thing as "pursuing the weed of socialism rather than the seedlings of capitalism." We should truly take development as the essential criterion ad proceed from and aim at developing Heilongjiang and making the people prosper in doing everything. 3. Introducing the market economy system to the socialist society is a major breakthrough and innovation of the theory of scientific socialism that Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping has made, and it blazes a road for China's socialist modernization that conforms to the objective law governing socialized large-scale production. The traditional concept on socialism held that the market economy was the basic characteristic of capitalism and only the planned economy is the intrinsic attribute of socialism, and, therefore, the market economy was not for socialism. With the dauntless courage and insight of a proletarian revolutionary, Comrade Xiaoping challenged the traditional concept on the relationship between planning and the market. He pointed out as early as 1979 that "the market economy may also be developed in socialism." In Volume 3, he again spoke on the issue of market on seven or eight occasions: "There is no basic contradictions between socialism and the market economy," "to have more planning or to have more market force is not the basic difference between socialism and capitalism," "planning and the market are all economic means," and "it is necessary to persistently combine the planned economy with the market economy." Comrade Xiaoping's theses have laid a theoretical foundation for the socialist market economy. Engaging in the socialist market economy is an essential demand in socialized mass production. Comrade Xiaoping maintained: "Marxism stresses development of productive forces the most." Attempting to "build all state organizations into a large machine and into an economic organism whereby hundreds of millions of people work in accordance with a single plan," (Lenin) has made enterprises become "dead spare parts" of this "large machine" and restrained the source of social wealth under the conditions of modernized and socialized mass production, has given rise to unwieldy, overstaffed, and low-efficiency managerial organizations and skewed the proportion in various economic sectors off balance; and affected by interests of respective localities and departments, has caused serious barriers between different regions and different departments, hampered the rational flow and optimum organization of production elements, and caused sharp contradictions to the socialist mass production. After summarizing the experiences and lessons gained from history, Comrade Xiaoping repeatedly stressed that the planned economy was no longer workable. "In the past, we copied the modes of other countries, thus hampering the development of productive forces." "Old methods have been proven ineffective by practice in the past tens of years." Then, he pointed out: "Combining the planned economy with the market economy will be conducive to liberating productive forces and accelerating the development of productive forces." Engaging in the socialist market economy conforms to the aspirations of the people and the demand of the essence of socialism. Comrade Xiaoping has always combined the people's aspirations with the essence of socialism. He maintained that only liberating and developing productive forces and achieving common prosperity conform to the fundamental interests of the people. He also maintained that only by fully mobilizing the initiative of the people could we liberate and develop productive forces. Therefore, in approaching a thing, Comrade Xiaoping has always considered "whether the people support it," "whether the people agree to it," "whether the people are happy," and "whether the people favor it." In the past, we continuously propagated that laborers were masters of the means of production. However, under the highly centralized planned system, enterprises were the accessories of party and government organs, staff and workers were passive executors of the mandatory targets of production, staff and workers ate from the "common big pot" of enterprises, and enterprises ate from the "common big pot" of the state. As a result, enterprises could not feel that they were the mainstay of management, laborers also could not feel that they were masters of their enterprises, and thus their enthusiasm was seriously dampened. In the light of this situation, Comrade Xiaoping sharply pointed out: "Refusing to delegate powers to enterprises, enterprises will have no autonomy and will no responsibilities to assume, and the state must assume responsibilities for both success and failure. If the state takes on everything, how can we do our work well and mobilize initiative? Implementation of the socialist market economy will give rise to a pattern characterized by diverse investment mainstays, diverse ownership forms, diverse distribution forms, and diverse asset management forms. Under this pattern, laborers are either owners of individual and private enterprises or shareholders of shareholding enterprises and shareholding cooperative enterprises, or staff and workers, who are closely linked with the destiny of their enterprises, of the wholly state-funded enterprises that enjoy the property right of legal persons. Under any circumstance, all laborers will become masters of their enterprises in gaining property right and in sharing personal interest, and then we will enhance the labor productive forces to the maximum and accelerate the speed of marching towards common prosperity. From this, we can see that only by developing the socialist market economy can we meet the demand of the essence of socialism. Developing the socialist market economy is the inexorable direction of reform and opening up. A basic idea dominating the third volume is to break with the closed economy and open to the outside world. When considering the issue of reform, Comrade Xiaoping also proceeded from the idea of opening up. He said: "Reform is meant to invigorate the economy, and invigorating the domestic economy means to open to other localities of the country, and this is, in reality, called the open policy," and "the basic content and basic experience of both the rural reform and the urban reform are to open up." He also repeatedly emphasized: "Courage is needed to raise the banner of further opening up." How should we open further? The situation is very clear -- over 90 percent of the countries and regions in the world are enforcing the market economy system. If we become an "isolated island" of planned economy, it will be very difficult for us to further march toward the world. Only when we develop the market economy and act according to international practice, can we "connect" with the market economy which is universally implemented in the current world and coordinate China's economy with the economy of the world. 4. Attending to two tasks simultaneously and being competent in both constitute the basic principle repeatedly emphasized in Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping. Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: "We should pay close attention to and never, even on a single day, slacken efforts in building the spiritual civilization and improving party style and social conduct," and "what is the sense of succeeding in economic development if social conduct deteriorates? Deterioration in the other area will lead to the deterioration of the entire economy." He repeatedly emphasized that in building socialism with Chinese characteristics, it is necessary to develop reform and opening up on the one hand and punish corruption on the other, develop economic construction on the one hand and improve democracy and the legal system on the other, and build the material civilization on the one hand and develop the spiritual civilization on the other; and that "not only should the economy be developed, but social order and social conduct should also be improved and the two civilizations should surpass those in the capitalist countries. Only this is socialism with Chinese characteristics." Only when we use patriotism and socialism to unite the Chinese nation, uplift our national spirit, and enhance all the people's national self-respect, self-confidence, and self-pride, can we develop our country and our nation. To understand Comrade Xiaoping's idea of attending to two tasks simultaneously, we should strengthen party building and the spiritual civilization in line with reality, bring about a turn for the better in public security and social conduct, unite the people throughout the country, raise spirits, work hard, and develop Heilongjiang.
