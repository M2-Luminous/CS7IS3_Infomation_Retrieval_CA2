Anaya told PRENSA LATINA that Cuba and Bolivia have nearly completed an air navigation agreement. The accord, once signed, will allow for Cubana de Aviacion and (Lloyd) Aero Boliviano planes to fly between La Paz and Havana. Anaya emphasized the importance of this accord, based on increased tourism to Cuba, not only from Bolivia, but also from other nations of the region's southern cone. Anaya added in his statement to PRENSA LATINA that Cuba and Bolivia are analyzing increased trade in several areas. La Paz is studying the possibilities of a visit with Cuban authorities in Havana by Bolivian businessmen, enabling them to identify possibilities for investment. Anaya noted that politically, Bolivia condemns the inhumane U.S. blockade against Cuba just as it condemns other measures that oppress the people. Anaya pointed out that in the area of culture, the work done by Cuban teachers in all fields has been positive, with emphasis on ballet specialists and various artistic groups.
