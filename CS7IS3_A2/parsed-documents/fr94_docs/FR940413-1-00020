FR940413-1-00020 FR940413-1-00006 The main thrust of this revised proposed rule parallels the recordkeeping agreements now in place between MMS and a majority of NPSL operators. Because of this substantial change from the June 1990 proposed rule, MMS is publishing this revised proposed rule in the Federal Register for public review and comment. The MMS received comments from one industry respondent on the June 1990 proposed rulemaking. Those comments were considered in this revised proposed rulemaking; they are discussed in paragraph III below. The revised proposed rule is summarized and discussed in paragraph IV below. III. Comments Received on June 1990 Proposed Rule The June 1990 proposed rule provided for a 30-day public comment period ending July 9, 1990. We received comments from one industry source. (a) The commenter felt a period longer than 30 days should be allowed for comments on the proposed rulemaking. They felt MMS had ample time since FOGRMA's enactment to make the proposed amendment, and to allow only a 30-day comment period was not justified. MMS Response: The MMS received comments from only one source, and no one else asked for more time. Thus, MMS believes the 30-day comment period was long enough for all interested parties to reply to the proposed rule. (b) The commenter said the amendments must be prospective from the effective date of the final rule. MMS Response: Section 305 of FOGRMA states that the provisions of this Act shall apply to oil and gas leases issued before, on, or after the date of the enactment of this Act, except that in the case of a lease issued before such date, no provision of this Act or any rule or regulation prescribed under this Act shall alter the express and specific provisions of such a lease. Since NPSL lease terms do not include time periods for keeping records, NPSL's have been subject to FOGRMA's requirements as a matter of law since its enactment in 1983. Thus, the proposed changes would not be ``retroactive.'' (c) The commenter said there were a number of leases issued under the initial regulations_i.e., 10 CFR 390.030, 390.033, and 390.034, now unchanged at 30 CFR 220.030, 220.033, and 220.034_but after enactment of FOGRMA section 103, and these leases must be grandfathered. MMS Response: As discussed above, section 103 of FOGRMA applies to all NPSL's; section 305 is clear on this point. The fact that some NPSL's were issued while the initial regulations were in effect, but after FOGRMA's enactment, has no bearing on the applicability of section 305 or the section 103 recordkeeping requirements. Statutory requirements always supersede inconsistent regulatory obligations. (d) The commenter did not agree that §220.033, Audits, should be removed in favor of §217.50. The commenter gave no reasons for this objection. MMS Response: The MMS proposed to delete §220.033 to clarify that NPSL audits will be subject to procedures already described in 30 CFR part 217. The MMS is preparing a proposed rulemaking to revise 30 CFR part 217; it will address NPSL audits. There is no need to duplicate the NPSL audit requirements in §220.033. IV. Summary of Revised Proposed Rule (a) Need for Rule This revised proposed rulemaking amends §220.030 to clarify that the minimum period for maintaining records on NPSL's, like all other lease subject to FOGRMA, is 6 years after record creation. In some cases lessees create NPSL cost records, but production may not start for several more years; thus an MMS audit logically may not start for more than 6 years past first record creation. Although the audit may not begin before production starts or before long cost accrual periods pass, all costs accumulated in the NPSL capital account after lease issuance affect the account balance in later periods. Thus, unlike leases where production costs do not affect royalties, NPSL records need long-term maintenance so MMS can properly verify the capital account balance at the start of any period.
