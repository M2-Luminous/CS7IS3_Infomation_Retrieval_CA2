The clinical picture of the injury focus was used as the equivalency criterion in determining the CIE, and the radiation energy, under equal or very close to equal action conditions, was used for comparison. Analysis was performed for LR with a 1.064 mcm wavelength and 10-100 nspulse length. Based on the analysis of presented results it was concluded that eye immunity of 21-27 years old people to threshold action of laser radiation with the above parameters is higher than average eye immunity of rabbits and monkeys by a factor of not more than 2.8 - 2.1 mean with a mean deviation of plus or minus 0.7. This can be considered the maximum CIE value when determining maximum allowable levels of laser radiation based on data of experimental studies of laboratory animals.
