Shulunov: "Conversion: New Approaches"] [Text] According to the experts, 7-10 years and approximately $150 billion and purposeful management of this process by the government were needed for the current conversion. Actually, 117 billion rubles (in 1992 prices) were allocated for conversion during the last two years. The matter is also being complicated by the absence of precise prospects in the sphere of production of defense products and any plans for the production of needed civilian products, the mechanism for financing conversion and the appropriate normative documents. In fairness, I must note that the foundation of conversion was laid in 1989 already within the framework of the USSR. The increase of the volumes of production of complex appliances and consumer goods in 1993 is largely not only the consequence of the initiative of the labor collectives of converted enterprises but also of the stockpile of unfinished products created based upon the plans for 1989-1990. Furthermore, approximately 1,000 conversion programs, including 14 federal programs like "Vozrozhdeniye rossiyskogo flota" [Rebirth of the Russian Navy], "Razvitiye grazhdanskoy aviatsionnoy tekhniki" [Development of Civilian Aircraft] and "Razrabotki i proizvodstva novykh vidov meditsinskoy tekhniki" [Development and Production of New Types of Medical Equipment], were fundamentally produced, have undergone an examination by experts and have partially begun to be realized during the last two years. A number of regional conversion programs have been developed and are being implemented in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Udmurtiya, and in Sverdlovsk and Rostov Oblasts. Three are quite a few positive examples of financing and the realization of some conversion programs by the state, domestic and foreign commercial structures and banks, but there are many more shortcomings. Perhaps the most substantial is the inadequate level and discontinuity of financing. In 1994, they planned to allocate approximately R4.4 trillion to complete work begun on 1992 programs and on programs that were approved by the RF Government in 1993. However, a total of R900 billion remained in the 1994 draft federal budget. Not a single federal targeted conversion program was financed normally. Furthermore, the incorrect scheme for financing conversion projects under which both the customer and the executor, as a rule, act as one person of the converted enterprise and financing of conversion projects is carried out through commercial banks without the required monitoring is a fundamental error. Parallelism in the development of a new conversion product that is not needed by anyone is a consequence of this scheme. For example, 12 plants simultaneously set up the production of oil-producing bellcranks. Up to 70-80 percent of conversion resources didn't reach converted enterprises or were placed at their disposal at the end of the year. Essentially, conversion credits went for the formation and consolidation of commercial banks. In our opinion, conversion money must be allocated only to the customer of the civilian product (to those customers involved with transportation, gas, oil, and agriculture), who themselves select conversion program executors on a competitive basis. Under this variant of financing, the customer is capable of finding additional resources if he is interested in carrying out his project. For example, today the RF Ministry of Fuel and Energy annually spends up to $7 billion on the purchase of spare parts and new equipment for petroleum extraction and transportation of energy resources. The enormous production capacity of the missile builders, aircraft builders and engine builders that has been freed up is standing idle or is producing "frying pans". The slogan about hard currency replacement technologies has been proclaimed in state conversion programs but it practically doesn't work for the time being. We have not been able to completely utilize the already created production capacity for the production of civilian products due to the serious financial situation of converted enterprises, the reduction of consumer solvency, and the systematic delay and reduction of the amount of state resources being allocated to the defense complex. But under these extreme conditions, the defense industry is increasing the output of civilian products by 1.5-2% per year. And the main issue remains--financing conversion and effective utilization of limited resources. In our opinion, the state is obligated to assume responsibility for retooling defense enterprises to develop import replacement production; to introduce effective energy and resource-conserving equipment and technologies; to transfer dual-use technologies to the civilian sector of the economy that were previously developed in the military industrial complex; to develop export opportunities for converted enterprises; and, to render support to those defense enterprises whose conversion programs are not part of federal programs but are effective and directed at saturating the market with goods. But regional conversion programs must pursue the goal of offering the opportunity to combine freed-up incomplete scientific production capacity to the region's enterprises of various sectors of industry and to integrate them in sufficiently long technological chains for the production of an end product. Therefore, regional management (through financing of conversion) of the process of the formation of new cooperative production ties between converted enterprises and also civilian sector enterprises can turn out to be an important factor for increasing the operating effectiveness of Russian industry. Conversion cannot be successful without the state's substantial support. But the experience of recent years attests that super-preferential credits indiscriminately allocated to everyone provokes enterprises to knowingly submit unrealistic conversion projects. We think that the enterprise conversion projects must have serious technical-economic substantiation, undergo an examination by experts and be financed on a competitive basis. Commercial banks can be involved in the dissemination of conversion credits only under the following conditions: Prevention of the diversion of allocated resources for commercial credits to third parties; precise determination of the time periods for the completion of documents associated with obtaining credits; strict sanctions with regard to commercial banks for the violation of credit granting terms; and, Russian Central Bank monitoring of the activities of commercial banks that are financing conversion projects. We need to intensively utilize the finances of various stock companies and banks and attract foreign capital for the successful resolution of conversion problems under stingy state financing. Foreign investments of not only the MVF [International Monetary Fund] and EBRR [European Reconstruction and Development Bank], but also of companies that are interested in our products and scientific-technical achievements could render enormous assistance in the implementation of conversion. However, the absence of guarantees and the instability of the legislative and tax base is restraining foreign investors. Many managers of regions and major enterprises have understood that without the creation of outside-budget conversion assistance funds [several words unreadable] which is the most rational form for the accumulation of resources designated to finance conversion at the regional level is the creation of the appropriate--oblast, kray, republic--conversion assistance fund. Its income portion must be formed through deductions from the local budget, payments of interested commercial structures of any form of property, and payments of founders. We can also recommend to the local authorities such steps as the allocation of raw materials to provide guarantees to foreign investors, the transfer of the primary funds of enterprises to leasing, and the direction of resources from the privatization of defense enterprises for their conversion. State support of these funds could be carried out by granting them various types of tax and other financial benefits. And, in my opinion, we need to develop and approve a typical charter of a regional conversion assistance fund on the governmental level in order to move this work off of dead center. It is also advisable to grant conversion credits to enterprises under the deposit of property with the completion of the appropriate documents stipulated by tax legislation or through the obligations of insurance companies. The Russian Ministry of the Economy has developed and approved the appropriate statute.
