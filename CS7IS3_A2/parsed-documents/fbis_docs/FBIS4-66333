Ni said that the high-speed information networks now being developed worldwide can bring into reality for mankind the type of things only dreamed about in the past and incorporated in the science fiction novels of the past few decades. In closing, Ni noted that the ``Three Golden Projects'' now being implemented under State direction are without question the proper direction that China should take and will inevitably promote domestic S&T development into the next century.
