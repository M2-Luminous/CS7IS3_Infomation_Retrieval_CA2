[passage omitted] Although Azerbaijan signed the agreement for a cease-fire, it has violated the agreement several times. The NKR Defense Army Headquarters Press Service has informed us that fighting continued yesterday in Agdamskiy and Mardakertskiy Rayons. Azerbaijan's military forces tried to penetrate the NKR defense positions to reach Yusifdzhanly in Agdamskiy Rayon; however, the defense units counterattacked. The enemy forces lost several men and were forced to retreat to their former positions. The NKR military subunits have succeeded in obstructing several attacks in the northern and northeastern part of Mardakertskiy Rayon. The Azerbaijan Military Command Headquarters is trying to amass several units in those areas at the present time. Azerbaijan's military units fired on Vartashen in Martuninskiy Rayon with Grad rocket launchers the night before last night. Initial reports said two women were killed and 10 residents were wounded. The attack also caused material damage. No incidents have taken place in the border region between Armenia and Azerbaijan during the past few days.
