Chen Chongtian, deputy director of the special economic zone's Bureau of Radio and Television, said all dish owners, except for hotels with foreign guests and financial companies, must pull down their dishes by the end of the week. There has not yet been a decision to use force to implement the six-month-old nationwide ban on private dishes, and circumstances under which force might be deployed were "not yet clear", Chen said. However, the Public Security Bureau and the Bureau of State Security in Shenzhen would play "coordinating" roles. The bureau is aware of the location of 110 dishes in Shenzhen, some of which are presumably legal. But some have been installed by private individuals without permission, Chen said. "We're calling on people to take the initiative. It would be best if they took them down themselves," he said. Notices were published in Shenzhen papers yesterday announcing the crackdown. Chen said the uncontrolled dishes had caused "flaws", notably the government's loss of control over the watching of foreign programmes. "Some of those programmes from Hong Kong and Taiwan have a bad effect on the masses," he said. "Violence and other evil depictions are not appropriate for our national situation." Chen said that dishes make Shenzhen look ugly and require more investment than cable television. The city expected to finish building a 400 million renminbi (HK$355m [Hong Kong dollars] ) cable television system by 1996 or 1997, which would reach 100,000 households. "Cable television will replace satellite dishes," Chen said. "After the system is built, we will decide which Hong Kong and Taiwan programmes can be aired." However, at least one satellite dish salesman in Shenzhen was already issuing instructions yesterday on how to get around the threat of police inspectors roving the streets looking for dishes. "As long as they can't be seen from the street, then there should be no problem," said the salesman, whose electronic components store was set up with backing from the Shenzhen government last year. "There's likely to be crackdowns in areas where there is a concentration of dishes, but dishes which are dispersed and hidden will be OK," the salesman said. The Premier, Li Peng, announced a nationwide crackdown on private satellite dishes last October 8, giving local governments six month to implement the ban. Individuals found with unauthorised dishes could be penalised up to Rmb5,000 [renminbi], while work units faced Rmb50,000 fines. Detailed regulations issued at a national ideological work conference in February spelt out the strict conditions for registering dishes and empowered local governments to "take positive action" to pull down unlicensed dishes. Beijing's Ministry of Radio, Film and Television is reported to have extended the grace period for implementing the ban until June. However, analysts say it would take many years to search every hutong in China for the metal dishes, which are familiarly known as "pot lids"
