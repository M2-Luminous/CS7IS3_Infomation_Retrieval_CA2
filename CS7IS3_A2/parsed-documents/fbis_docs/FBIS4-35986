It has escalated its attacks on southern Lebanese villages and townships, and massed additional military forces and heavy weapons. Israeli officials have made a series of threats to commit more acts of aggression. Even the most naive of observers can see that beyond what Israel gained from the Gaza-Jericho agreement -- direct Israeli hegemony and real Israeli trusteeship over the Palestinian people's resources -- Israel wants to deal a final blow to both the U.S. peace initiative and the peace process based on the Madrid conference. As usual, Israel chose Lebanon, in its capacity as the weakest link in the Arab body, to remove every vestige of the atmosphere of peace from the region, replacing it with an atmosphere of war. Only a few days ago, the Israeli prime minister clearly announced that he sees no benefit in a new tour of good offices in the Middle East by the U.S. secretary of state to promote the peace process on the Syrian track, because Israel does not intend to withdraw from the Golan, while Syria links peace to this withdrawal. In fact, Rabin's statement is a flagrant call on the United States to forget its peace initiative and relinquish its commitments to achieving a just and comprehensive peace on all fronts of the conflict, based on Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 and the land-for-peace principle. This is not the first serious Israeli attempt to undermine the peace process. At a similar time last year, Israel sent large forces into occupied southern Lebanon and used various kinds of weapons to systematically destroy hundreds of Lebanese villages. At that time, Yitzhaq Rabin announced he wanted to create a new refugee problem in the region. Indeed, hundreds of thousands of Lebanese civilians were evicted. If the United States, through Secretary Christopher, had not quickly salvaged its regional initiative, and if Lebanon and Syria had not responded to the U.S. endeavors, the peace process would have been a memory from the past. Now, Rabin is doing it again. He has publicly announced he will not withdraw from the Golan or southern Lebanon and that he will commit large-scale acts of aggression on the pretext of protecting Israel's security. Meanwhile, the Lebanese people are the ones who are being buried under the rubble of destroyed buildings in savage Zionist raids. Peace can be achieved only by deeds. Israel's deeds, however, flagrantly conflict with the simplest fundamentals and principles of peace. The substance of both the U.S. initiative and the Security Council resolutions is to exchange land for peace. Israel, however, refuses to return the land. If the U.S. initiative aims to spread a climate of detente and calm in the region that will help parties engage in genuine peace talks, then Israel is beating the drums of war and translating its words into action, using its aircraft to attack defenseless Lebanese areas, and ceaselessly shelling, from land and sea, the villages and towns of southern Lebanon. Where is Israel today after the Washington initiative? Where is Israel after the Madrid Conference and its clear, well-known principles? Have the Lebanese-Israeli talks taken a single step forward? Have the Syrian-Israeli talks taken a single step forward, knowing that Syria is the key to peace in the Middle East? By involving the Palestinian side in an unfair separate agreement, by deceiving the Palestinian side in order to keep Jerusalem out of the agreement and to maintain the Israeli occupation, and by waving material temptations at this deceived side, although they were soon to be discovered to be a big lie -- by doing all that, Rabin thought he had won a big prize and could, consequently, undermine the entire peace process, particularly on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks. He ignores the fact that peace is made by peoples, not individuals, and that peace is strengthened when it is based on principles of justice, right and UN charters. He also ignores the fact that an illusionary peace will inevitably collapse in the face of the people's strikes and struggle for the sake of their usurped rights and occupied lands. Hence, we can see his attacks on Lebanon and his flagrant avoidance of the requirements of the peace process on the Syrian track, that is, complete and comprehensive withdrawal from the Golan Heights. This Israeli subversion damages the U.S. peace initiative, the United States' credibility and its commitments, as well as the efforts of the world community. It will inevitably lead to a great failure for U.S. policy in the Middle East. The United States, Russia, and other parties in the world community have a rare opportunity to return things to their proper order and to revive the peace efforts. This can be done by denouncing Israel's aggression, in a clear and decisive way, especially because Lebanon has made an urgent protest to the UN Security Council. Naturally, denunciation alone is not sufficient. Deeds must accompany words. Israel must be asked to precisely implement the UN Security Council resolutions and withdraw from all Arab territories. Syria will always support Lebanon. Israel's threats and actions will have no influence whatsoever on the two countries' determination to regain their occupied territories in full, regardless of sacrifices.
