FR940617-0-00141 FR940617-0-00026 The Agency believes that this definition of ``new'' comports with the language, intent and structure of the Clean Air Act and is a permissible construction of the statute. Contrary to the assertion of some commenters, EPA's definition of ``new'' is consistent with the dictionary definition of the word as ``having existed or been made but a short time.'' Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary, 1990. Generally speaking, manufactured products are sold soon after they are made and are considered new until they are sold or used. The commenters' definition of new_anything manufactured after the Clean Air Act Amendments' enactment or an applicable regulation's promulgation_would mean, by contrast, that any engine manufactured after a certain date would be new forever. This is certainly not the plain meaning of ``new.'' Congress could have stated that the federal preemption applied to certain equipment manufactured after a certain date, but Congress did not do so. Elsewhere in title II, Congress specified that a provision only applied to products manufactured after a certain date (see, section 218 requiring a ban on engines manufactured after the 1992 model year that require leaded gasoline) or first introduced into commerce after a certain date (see, section 211(f) regarding prohibition on fuels that are not substantially similar to fuels used to certify vehicles as meeting emission standards). The lack of such a date here further supports that Congress intended ``new'' to mean newly manufactured and not yet sold. The legislative record also shows Congressional intent that ``new'' should refer to newly manufactured products. In his colloquy with Senator Wilson explaining the final version of section 209(e), Senator Chafee notes that ``because the preemption is limited to new engine standards only, States can continue to require existing and in-use nonroad engines to reduce emissions *␣*␣*'' [Emphasis added] 136 Cong. Rec. S17237 (October 26, 1990). This language is echoed by similar language from Senator Baucus in his report to the Senate on the conference bill. 136 Cong. Rec. S16976 (October 27, 1990). If Congress intended the definition of new nonroad engines or equipment, and as a result the preemption, to apply to an engine for its entire life, then it would appear that there would be no distinction between new and in-use nonroad engines, as an engine manufactured after a certain date would always be new. Yet the statements of Senator Chafee and Senator Baucus clearly contemplate such a distinction. The Agency's definition of new is also consistent with the way the Act approaches motor vehicle emission control. As noted earlier, section 216 defines new in the context of motor vehicles as ``a motor vehicle the equitable or legal title to which has never been transferred to an ultimate purchaser.'' The Act applies federal emissions standards to ``new'' vehicles. These federal standards are enforced through certification, assembly line, and recall testing. States, on the other hand, have a role in motor vehicle emission control through inspection/maintenance programs and are not restricted from controlling used vehicles. The section 209(a) prohibition of state regulation of motor vehicles addresses only ``new'' motor vehicles and engines and prohibits state regulation that occurs before sale, titling, or registration of the vehicle. 19 19 Section 209(a) provides, in part, ``.␣.␣. No State shall require certification, inspection, or any other approval relating to the control of emissions from any new motor vehicle or new motor vehicle engine as condition precedent to the initial retail sale, titling (if any), or registration of such motor vehicle, motor vehicle engine, or equipment.'' The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 take a parallel approach to nonroad standards and enforcement. Section 213 provides EPA with authority to set standards for ``new'' engines and provides for federal enforcement of such standards in the same manner as motor vehicle enforcement. Furthermore, nothing on the face of section 209(e) or section 213 indicates that Congress intended ``new'' to be interpreted differently in the nonroad and motor vehicle contexts. 20 Given that the preemption provisions for new motor vehicles and new nonroad engines appear in the same section of the Clean Air Act, it is reasonable to believe that Congress did not intend for the word ``new'' to be defined differently within the same section without stating this intent explicitly. 21 20 Much of the argument below discusses the definition of ``new'' as applied to section 209 of the statute. However, these arguments are equally valid for the purposes of defining ``new'' under section 213, especially given the integrated nature of Part A of Title II, the legislative and statutory history, and practical necessity. For example, consistent definitions of new under sections 209 and 213 are likely to ensure that there are no unintended gaps in regulation or unintended dual regulation. Also, the statutory definition of ``new motor vehicle'' and ``new motor vehicle engine'' are applicable equally to federal regulations and preemption of state regulations. EPA generally sees no logical reason to treat nonroad engines differently. However, see the discussion in footnote 21. 21 EPA recognizes that regulation of locomotives presents unique circumstances, including questions regarding interstate commerce, that require special attention. EPA therefore believes that the definition of ``new'' as used in ``new locomotive'' and ``new engine used in a locomotive'' may need to be treated differently for the purposes of determining preemption of state regulation under section 209(e) than it is treated for the purpose of federal regulation under section 213(a). This issue will be addressed in a later rulemaking.
