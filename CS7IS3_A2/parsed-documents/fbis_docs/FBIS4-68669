The preamble of the document states that the criminal situation which has arisen in the kray creates a real threat to political, economic and social transformations. By coincidence, on the eve of the appearance of the decree, Krasnodar had buried four victims of crime. Two men in masks had broken into the jewelry store "Zhemchug," and shot the salesgirl, a customer and the duty militiaman with an automatic weapon. Another woman was wounded by a stray bullet. During the ensuing chase and gun battles which took place in crowded places, one more militia worker was killed. Later, during the capture of the robbers, one of them was killed... According to the decree, the internal affairs agencies must significantly increase the density and mobility of units of the militia patrol-duty service. Among the measures introduced were operations for preventing and curtailing the activity of armed groups, as well as a set of measures for maintaining the safety of citizens in places of possible inter-ethnic conflicts. The document devoted much attention to outsiders. Those who violate the public order will be deported outside the boundaries of the kray. Anyone who is not carrying documents shall be detained and placed in receiving-distributing centers until their identity can be established. Some measures are extraordinary. Thus, the agencies of the tax police, if they are unable to collect taxes due to the budget and other mandatory payments, receive the right to impose administrative arrest (seizure) of the property of legal persons and individuals and to later sell it through auctions. Juveniles are also not overlooked. It has been decided "to limit the presence of minors under 16 years of age in public places after 10:00 p.m. without their parents or persons acting in lieu of them." One of the points of the decree is an innovation, although the mechanism of its realization has not yet been explained. "In necessary cases, to provide for the allocation of facilities for the temporary residence of persons who have become victims of domestic violence, to create publicly funded counselling centers for provision of legal and other aid to citizens in the resolution of social-domestic conflicts." Aside from the internal affairs agencies, military servicemen of the internal troops and Cossack social organizations will also be involved in the fight against crime. The heads of the law enforcement agencies have been told to implement organizational measures for utilizing the capacities the kray's radio and television broadcasting network for emergency transmission of current announcements. Citizens who report the whereabouts of especially dangerous criminals who have committed or are planning to commit serious crimes will be given a monetary reward in the amount of up to 5 million rubles (R). The extraordinary measures, the need for which Russian Minister of Internal Affairs Viktor Yerin pointed out during his recent visit to Kuban, shall remain in effect up until 1 October of this year.
