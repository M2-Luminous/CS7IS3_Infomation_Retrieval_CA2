The Indian spokesman dismissed assertions by Tibetan sources that up to 30,000 Chinese soldiers had moved into Tibet during the past three weeks and that many of them had deployed along Tibet's border with India. "We don't have any information like that," the defence ministry spokesman said. "The situation (along the border) is absolutely normal." Noting that Indian and Chinese officials held a round of talks on border questions in Beijing last week, the spokesman said "this is the time when these troop numbers should go down. "And we are making quite smooth progress in that regard," he added. The London-based Tibet Information Network, citing sources in the Tibetan government-in-exile based in the Indian hill town of Dharamsala, reported Sunday that China had sent some 30,000 additional troops into Tibet. "The troop movements, the largest reported from the area since martial law was lifted from the Tibetan capital in 1990, appear to be concentrated around the Tibetan border with India," the Network said. Tibetan sources here contacted by AFP said three divisions of People's Liberation Army soldiers had entered Tibet in the last week of March and first week of April. They said many of the troops had moved to the Tibetan region bordering the far northeastern Indian states of Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim. The Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader, has been based in India with some 100,000 of his followers since fleeing his homeland following a failed anti-Chinese uprising in 1959. Indian and Chinese officials meet regularly to discuss ways to keep the peace on the border, subject of a dispute that took the two countries to a brief but bitter war in 1962.
