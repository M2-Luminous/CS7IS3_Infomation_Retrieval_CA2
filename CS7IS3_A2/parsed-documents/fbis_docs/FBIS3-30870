"They prove that a dangerous policy is currently conducted in the Republic of Moldova, either for political reasons or because of pressure from elsewhere. An anti-Romanian policy comes to the fore, which we have mentioned before. We were contradicted then, were told that the anti-Romanian policy was not a policy deliberately conducted in Chisinau. Now, we see that in fact these things were being secretly articulated in the basements of the policy of the Republic of Moldova. I believe our brothers across the Prut will know how to adequately react to these shifted stresses and even changed road in the policy promoted by the leadership in Chisinau. As for ourselves, we will have to draw the necessary conclusions for the future as concerns those with whom we can develop important, constructive and efficient political links in the period ahead," the Chamber of Deputies speaker said.
