An Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] spokesman told SAPA unofficial results from the smaller counting stations could be available on Saturday afternoon. Other results, including the national poll, would follow, but he could not say when. The IEC initially said it would take 26 hours to certify the elections. Legally a period of ten days is allowed. The IEC announced earlier on Thursday that counting at the 800 stations countrywide would only start at 6AM on Saturday. IEC Chairman Mr Justice Johann Kriegler said counting would be delayed because an additional day of voting in KwaZulu/Natal, Northern Transvaal and Eastern Cape, where voters were unable to cast a free and fair vote, had been recommended. The commission spokesman was unable to say when the election would be certified. All disputes needed to be resolved before the commission could certify the elections substantially free and fair or otherwise, he said.
