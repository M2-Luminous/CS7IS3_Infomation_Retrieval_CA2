He said the MOU between Malaysia External Trade Development Corporation (Matrade) and British Board of Trade (BBOT) would allow exchanging information on areas such as market intelligence and training. If the MOU is signed, we would be able to have the British assistance in exporting our trade services abroad as the country was considered as a significant trade in services, he told reporters this after holding discussion with British Trade Minister Richard Needham at his office here. Needham is on a four-day official visit to Kuala Lumpur beginning June 4, his third official visit in nine months. He is accompanied by three officers and 19 senior British businessmen. Chua said that Malaysia is a strong importer in services and as at last year, its imported services amounted to US $7.7 billion, which put Malaysia on the number 21 spot as the world's largest importer of services. Since we do not rank in the top 25 countries that export trade services, we have been encountering deficit in trade services, he said adding that Malaysia's deficit in trade services was RM [Malaysian ringgit] 14.4 billion (about US $5.76 billion) last year. Chua said the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) scheme which urged Western nations to source for automotive parts abroad, also augured well for Malaysia's automotive industry. Malaysia's automotive industry had been making an important on the local front as well as abroad especially with the production of the first national car and the second national car, said Chua. This new policy will be a boost for our automotive trade as we have exchanged ideas with the British on the possibility of setting up an automotive parts and components industry in Malaysia, he added. He said with the set up, the two countries could work together in terms of joint venture or technology licensing whereby the British would transfer their technology to Malaysia. It would also enable Malaysia to be the regional centre for production and export of automotive parts and components, he added. Meanwhile, Needham said the British Government would continue to send trade missions here regardless of the action taken by Malaysia not to award government contracts to British companies recently. We are determined to continue to show our interest in Malaysia and the best way of doing that is to continue sending trade missions here, he said adding that there will be another six trade missions on the way. He said Britain had vast interests in Malaysia and what other way of showing that than by setting up joint ventures between companies of both countries, form British companies in Malaysia or any other possible way. Understandably, with our history of long relationship, we encountered problems but I believe that it can be worked out for the benefits of both countries, he added.
