This decision follows the fact that when elections were held to the City Assembly on March 20 and 21 and also after a repeat voting on April 3, 1994 the St. Petersburg mayor violated with his orders a number of articles of the basic regulations on elections to representative bodies of state authority. Vyacheslav Marychev, a State Duma deputy who was present at the session, after saying emotionally that "whole military units were forced to vote", demanded that the commission should not limit itself to recommendations, but revoke the results of the repeated voting. But Aleksandr Ivanchenko, deputy chairman of the Central Electoral Commission, explained that only the president has this kind of competence. In the event of the St. Petersburg mayor failing to meet the commission's recommendations, it can only draw the president's attention to Sobchak's actions. The session was also told that the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation today left unsatisfied a complaint by the St. Petersburg City court that the City Assembly elections were unlawful.
