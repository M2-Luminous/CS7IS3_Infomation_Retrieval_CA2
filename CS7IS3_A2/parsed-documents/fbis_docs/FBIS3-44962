Quoting sources in Beijing, it said Cavaco Silva's trip would mark the seventh anniversary on April 13 of a treaty which he signed to return Macao to Chinese administration in December 1999. Macau Governor Vasco Rocha Vieira is expected to be part of the prime minister's entourage, the news agency added. In stark contrast to Sino-British conflicts over nearby Hong Kong, which reverts to China in 1997, Lisbon's relations with Beijing over Macao are officially described as "excellent." Portugal has occupied Macau since 1557, but has recognized Chinese sovereignty over the enclave on the south China coast since 1974. Chinese Premier Li Peng invited Cavaco Silva to visit China when he visited Lisbon in February last year, Lusa said.
