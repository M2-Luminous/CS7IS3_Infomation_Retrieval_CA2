RM87&hyph;5&hyph;012 and CP87&hyph;238&hyph;003; Order No. 497&hyph;E] Inquiry Into Alleged Anticompetitive Practices Related to Marketing Affiliates of Interstate Pipelines and Ozark Gas Transmission System; Order on Rehearing and Extending Sunset Date Issued December 23, 1993. AGENCY: Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. ACTION: Final rule; order on rehearing and extending sunset date. SUMMARY: This order rules on requests for rehearing of the Commission's order on remand issued following the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit which upheld in substantial part the Commission's final rule governing the relationship between interstate natural gas pipelines and their marketing or brokering affiliates. The order on remand, among other things, narrowed the scope of the contemporaneous disclosure requirement by pipelines with respect to sales and marketing information and extended the sunset date of the final rule's reporting requirements. The order on rehearing, among other things, deletes the remaining categories of gas sales and marketing information from the contemporaneous disclosure requirement and further extends the sunset date. EFFECTIVE DATE: This final rule is effective January 1, 1994.
