To the contrary, Eda said, the successful launching earlier in the day of an H-2 series rocket, the first to use wholly Japanese components "turned space from a theater for Soviet-U.S. military competition into a sphere of activity for people who want to give wings to peaceful dreams." Eda told a news conference following a regular cabinet meeting that Japan's plutonium program and its rocket development, which have sparked international concerns over the country's nuclear intentions, are both strictly devoted to peaceful purposes. He said Japan would "pay careful attention" so that no such concern need arise.
