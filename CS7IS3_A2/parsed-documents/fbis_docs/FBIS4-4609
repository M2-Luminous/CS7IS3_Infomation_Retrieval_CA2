The students accused the United States of heightening tensions on the Korean peninsula by ordering the deployment of U.S. Patriot missiles in South Korea. The raged students burned a painting of U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry, models of Patriot missiles and U.S. flags, shouting the slogans "Yankee go home" and "No Patriot missiles". Black smoke billowed into the air as the students burned the painting and models of Patriot missiles with the U.S. flags drawn on the sides. About 200 police were on alert to prevent the students from marching into the streets. But they did not yield to it. Upset by the anti-U.S demonstration of the students, the Kim Yong-sam pro-American flunkeyist traitorous clique posted more than 400 riot police in front of the U.S. Embassy, making itself open to criticism.
