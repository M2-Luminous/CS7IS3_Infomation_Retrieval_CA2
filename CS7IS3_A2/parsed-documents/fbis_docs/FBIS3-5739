He urged Watanabe to use his political influence to help Cambodia get SDF assistance, Japanese officials said. Watanabe, however, said it would be difficult to realize such a project as the Japanese Constitution allows SDF dispatch abroad only for United Nations peacekeeping operations. Hun Sen suggested the experts could also be retired SDF personnel, the officials added. Hun Sen and his co-premier Norodom Ranariddh, who are currently in Japan to attend an international conference on assistance for Cambodia's reconstruction, met Watanabe at a Tokyo hotel.
