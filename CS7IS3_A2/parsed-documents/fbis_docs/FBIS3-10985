In Jacmel, a first step was taken by the president of the lower chamber, Frantz Robert Monde, who presented the plan to the population there. He did so during the inauguration of an information and communication office for the Southeast deputies and their constituents. Our correspondent in Jacmel, Pierre Nazon Beauliere, filed a report: [Begin Beauliere recording, in Creole] On Sunday, 13 March, Deputy Frantz Robert Monde, president of the Chamber of Deputies, inaugurated a deputies' office in Jacmel, an office serving as part of a transmission network between the Chamber of Deputies and the voters in all the constituencies. Following the inauguration ceremony, Deputy Joseph Lambert and Frantz Robert Monde met with the population at the Samba Night Club for a conference-debate on the topic: analysis of the current political situation, the settlement plan voted by the deputies, and its future. Agronomist Joseph Lambert, deputy of Jacmel's first constituency, presented an analysis of the plan, then outlined the current political situation with a retrospective dating from 7 February 1986. The deputy assessed the eight years since the overthrow of Jean-Claude [Duvalier], during which 12 governments have come and gone, with the country regressing further and further. Deputy Lambert strongly criticized the seven months of Father Aristide's presidency. The president of the House of Deputies, Frantz Robert Monde, presented the crisis settlement plan called the Legislators' Plan. Deputy Monde detailed the plan, stating that it came from President Aristide's laboratory and that it is not an American plan, as many people believe. Deputy Monde did not hesitate to criticize President Aristide, who he says rejected the plan while enjoying millions of dollars in the United States. Deputy Monde asserted that President Aristide never knows what he wants. Monde believes the entire world will soon realize that President Aristide does not want the crisis to be solved. Deputy Monde let it be known that he will not be a hostage of either Father Aristide or General Cedras. He stated that he is defending his country while being destroyed by an embargo. He advised that if within a month, this legislators' plan does not pass, they in the parliament will consider a Haitian solution for the crisis. Senator Margaret Martin intervened to explain the reasons the senators made the decision to dismiss the office presided over by Sen. Firmin Jean-Louis. According to Sen. Martin, it was because Firmin never held a session. The Senate is blocked and the country is collapsing. She added that Sen. Firmin is spreading corruption in the Senate. She said he had offered her $130,000 and a diplomatic post abroad to resign. Many people came to the news conference and asked questions. It had been a long time since the population of Jacmel had participated in such a conference. The population is not at all informed on the Haitian crisis. Deputy Jose LaFrance, Rita Frederick Moncoeur, and Joseph Elisca Bomier attended this conference. Deputy Lambert had hired the band, Les Invincibles, to play in front of the building. Many people believe that this conference is a campaign for a second mandate that Deputy Joseph Lambert has begun. Pierre Nazon Beauliere for Radio Metropole. [end recording]
