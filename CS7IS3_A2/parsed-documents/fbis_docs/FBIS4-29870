FBIS4-29870 "dreas120_a_94011" FBIS-EAS-94-120 Daily Report 21 Jun 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Tokyo Buys $15.5 Billion Auto Parts in FY 1993 Tokyo Buys $15.5 Billion Auto Parts in FY 1993 OW2106141994 Tokyo KYODO in English 1400 GMT 21 Jun 94 OW2106141994 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, June 21 KYODO -- Japanese automakers purchased 15.53 billion dollars worth of U.S. auto parts in fiscal 1993, up 14.1 percent from the year before, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association said Tuesday [21 June]. The figure totals such purchases by local units of Japanese automakers operating in the United States and imports by their parent companies at home, said Tatsuro Toyoda, head of the association. Toyoda, also president of Toyota Motor Corp., expressed concern, however, that such purchases have not been increasing enough to reach the earlier targeted amount of 19 billion dollars by the end of the current fiscal year through next March 31. "I hope each automaker will make further efforts so we can accomplish the target," Toyoda said at a meeting with the press. In fiscal 1993 which ended on March 31, local units of Japanese carmakers bought about 12.9 billion dollars worth of U.S. auto parts, up 15.7 percent from the year before. Purchases by their parent companies amounted to 2.6 billion dollars, up 6.8 percent. Parent firms were less active in buying because of sluggish sales in the recession-hit domestic market. The year-on-year 14.1 percent increase in the total figure compared with a 29.4 percent rise in the previous year. The association said that as long as domestic sales remain slack it will be hard for Japanese automakers to reach the target this year. The United States has suggested making annual purchase targets for American-made car parts by Japanese automakers for fiscal 1995 to 1997 one of the "objective criteria" for the bilateral trade "framework" talks. The two countries are discussing what kinds of criteria are suitable for evaluating Japan's efforts to open its market for foreign products and services. Industry sources see the slow increase in car parts purchases by Japanese automakers this business year as possibly affecting the talks.
