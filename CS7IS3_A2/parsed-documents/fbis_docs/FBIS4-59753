These forces, together with the masses of our people, are defending justice, freedom, and honor. This was preceded by false statements, such as those of al-Ansi and al-Iryani, that the barbaric forces advanced behind a human shield [words indistinct] into a deadly battle. Our armed forces repulsed these forces by striking heavy blows on them on the fronts of al-Karish, Abyan, Qa'tabah, and Bayhan during which many of them surrendered, while the remnants (?fled) toward Qa'tabah, al-Rahidah, and al-Bayda with our forces still behind them. Our forces captured many arms and vehicles abandoned by the oppressors.
