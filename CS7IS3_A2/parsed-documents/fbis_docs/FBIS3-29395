A team of officials from the Finance Ministry and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) will be sent to Pakistan soon, and on the basis of its findings the government will decide within a year whether or not to levy a countervailing duty on cotton yarns imported from Pakistan. This is the second time that the Japanese Government has investigated alleged dumping of goods in Japan by foreign interests. The first case involves the dumping of ferrosilico-manganese in Japan by Chinese, Norwegian and South African concerns. The Finance Ministry took up the yarn dumping issue in response to a suit filed last December by the Japan Spinners' Association, which claimed about 200 Pakistani manufacturers had exported cotton yarn for towels and sheets to Japan below the fair market value, causing damage to Japanese yarn manufacturers.
