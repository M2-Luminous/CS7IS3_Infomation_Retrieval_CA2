Today the Japanese reactionaries, holding a wicked intent to become the chief [maengju] of Asia just as the Imperial Army of the past, are accelerating Japan's becoming a big military power, its armament, and overseas expansion. Thus, Japan has become a new hotbed of war. This is proven, first of all, by Japan's reorganizing its self-defense forces into leading aggressive forces of the world. Japan has already adopted and put into effect the law on cooperation for UN peacekeeping activities. With this, Japan legalized dispatching of its self-defense forces overseas, and is now attempting to create legal conditions for executing a war of aggression while raving about amendment of the law on self-defense forces and about research and formulation of the law on emergency. What one should not overlook in particular is that the Japanese Defense Agency is turning the core combat power of its ground self-defense forces into the stronghold deployment system [kochom paechi cheje] in order to effectively cope with an emergency on the Korean peninsula by reviewing the main points of the defense plan. This clearly illustrates that the Japanese reactionaries, openly exposing their attempt to invade Korea again, are accelerating the preparations for reinvasion on a full scale. The Japanese reactionaries' maneuvers of aggression against the Korean peninsula have been clearly seen in the fact that Japan is dashing to become a big military power and toward nuclear armament. Japan is drastically increasing its military expenditure. The rate of increase in Japanese military expenditure cannot be compared to any nation in the West, marking the second highest rank in the world in terms of the amount of military expenses. The Japan self-defense forces have grown into a top leading aggressive force of the world. The plan of adjusting defense power during the period from 1991 to 1995, pushed ahead by the Japanese Government, is designed to reinforce self-defense forces so that they can independently execute local wars by arming them with ultramodern military equipment. Today the Japanese reactionaries claim that Japan is not a big military power by pointing to the number of active military personnel of the self-defense forces. However, more than 70 percent of the troops of the self-defense forces consists of officers and noncommissioned officers. As the result, Japan's self-defense forces will be increased to several millions on a single morning in an emergency. The Japanese reactionaries, attaching an importance not only to quantitative expansion of armament and equipment of self-defense forces but also to their qualitative reinforcement, are actively accelerating promotion of fire power, introduction of ultramodern technology and equipment, and increase in mobility and remote control capability. The Japanese Defense Agency is trying to drastically increase the offensive ability of self-defense forces by arming them with ultramodern equipment, including war command airplanes, Patriot antimissile missiles, new-type tanks, large-size transport ships, and aircraft carriers. The Japanese militarists, engrossed with the ambition for overseas invasion, have reorganized the defense structure of self-defense forces into offensive, and changed their military strategy from the total defense strategy to preemptive attack strategy. Besides, they expanded their operational zone into wide areas in Northeast Asia and the Pacific with the Korean peninsula as the center. Furthermore, Japan is running amok with nuclear armament in a bid to realize the ambition for its overseas expansion by all means. As the result, Japan's nuclear armament maneuvers have reached a dangerous boundary. As has been widely known to the world, Japan has stockpiled scores of tons of plutonium--a basic material for producing nuclear weapons--and completed construction of the plant with a view to producing a large quantity of plutonium at any time. In addition, Japan has armed self-defense forces with various artillery guns capable of firing nuclear warheads and with F-15 fighter-bombers that are capable of loading nuclear bombs. Japan has also completed domestic production of cruise missiles that are capable of loading both nuclear and conventional warheads. By staging test firing of a domestic-produced satellite rocket, Japan is creating daily-increasing danger on the Korean peninsula and in Northeast Asia. Today the Japanese reactionaries' overseas aggression maneuvers have become even more grave. As has already been reported, the reactionary Japanese government is scheming to provide a legal basis for overseas aggression under a pretext of coping with an emergency on the Korean peninsula. In a speech in Washington, Aiichi, former director-general of the Japanese Defense Agency, confessed that the Japanese Government is working measures to cope with an emergency on the Korean peninsula, and openly stated that Japan is going to establish a crisis management system. The Japanese reactionaries' maneuvers for formulating laws for the state of emergency and for establishing a crisis management system are aimed at invading our country and dispatching of unlimited troops overseas, thus arousing worries and concerns of the Asian countries. All facts show that the Japanese reactionaries' maneuvers of aggression have an extremely haughty nature, and have reached a reckless stage. Today our people, the Asian people and the peaceloving people of the world, are closely watching with high vigilance the military moves of Japan which has emerged as the dangerous force of war. The Japanese reactionaries should not forget the historic lesson of their disgraceful defeat in the past. They must look straight at the trend of the time and act with discretion.
