FBIS3-39522 "drweu033_k_94004" FBIS-WEU-94-033 Document Type:Daily Report 17 Feb 1994 PORTUGAL > * Inflow of Macao Immigrants Feared 94P20378C 94P20378C Article Type:CSO [Editorial Report] The 1 February Lisbon weekly O DIABO notes that over 20,000 Chinese immigrants from the PRC and Hong Kong may arrive in Portugal from Macao. Once in that territory, which does not have a Chinese consulate, these individuals can legally obtain a Portuguese special passport for foreigners, a tourist document of a different color that does not bear the inscription "European community" and entitles the bearer to a 90-day stay in Portugal with a right of renewal. The paper expresses the fear that members of the "Triade," the Oriental Mafia involved in gambling, prostitution, and money laundering, may be included among the immigrants, as has already occurred in Italy and Spain. It also notes that both Portugal and a number of European governments are concerned about the easy entrance into Portugal of such immigrants, who can then travel uncontrolled to other parts of Europe.
