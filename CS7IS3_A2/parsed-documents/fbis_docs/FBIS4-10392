The government also raised the level of extra budgetary resources that can be used to pay for budget items from 20 percent to 30 percent. This mini-economic package is the fourth approved by Economy and Finance Minister Ignacio de Posadas' administration to contain public spending. The previous packages were approved in February 1992 and March and June 1993. The first decree released yesterday establishes that overtime is work completed in addition to the normal workday, in either a six-hour or an eight-hour workday regime, according to the case. A normal work week cannot exceed 30 or 40 hours. The overtime period cannot exceed one and a half or two hours per day, or 26 to 40 hours per month, for the six-hour day or the eight-hour day, respectively. Exceptional work periods can be authorized when there is a lack of personnel to do the job. Overtime on public holidays may not exceed four hours per day. Overtime financed by third parties may not exceed 80 hours per month per employee. Overtime will be paid at 50 percent over the normal hourly rate. Permanent overtime will not be authorized in any case. As of 1 January 1994, the public administration will reduce its overtime by 25 percent compared to the previous year. The second decree that was approved yesterday suspends the purchase of vehicles by state offices until 31 December 1994. Funds used to purchase new vehicles must come exclusively from the sale of used units. Vehicles will be replaced starting with those purchased before 1 January 1986 and those that are unusable. The decree establishes the obligation to sell vehicles older than 1986 by 31 December 1994. Unusable vehicles, up to 25 percent of the total fleet, will also be sold by that date, except for vehicles belonging to the Interior and Public Health Ministries.
