However, while he affirmed that the legal rules of competition must be strictly applied without being able to take account of other criteria, he also assured that the Commission -- a collegial body -- is able to assume its political responsibilities -- as the Vallourec affair proved. The only path for Bull and Air France is a drastic recovery plan, which often means significant cuts in capacity. More generally, he expressed his desire for a better world trade organization that integrated the requirement for competition, and deplored the handling of the GATT negotiations, which held back our strategic interests in industry. [LES ECHOS] What inflection have you given to competition policy? What have you achieved, and what are your goals? [Van Miert] I have tried to act pragmatically, without taking ideological sides. First of all, the very concept of "competition" had to be thrashed out and it also had to be a sound definition. Then it was possible to include other elements in so far as that was possible, but without endangering the coherence of demand: We must treat everyone the same. For example, as regards state aid, we cannot say "yes" in one case and "no" in another comparable case. The hard thing is staying consistent while sticking to economic reality. [LES ECHOS] Does that mean that there are new criteria that go beyond merely analyzing the competition? [Van Miert] In the liquid crystals sector, we have authorized joint ventures between three large groups because this is a world market. Even from the competition point of view, this attitude was preferable: The question is knowing whether tomorrow there will be European companies that can measure up to the Japanese. We do not have a view strictly limited to the Community market. This is especially true in the telecommunications sector, or even in the aviation sector, where you have to look at what is happening outside the Community. [LES ECHOS] Does that mean that you are introducing elements of social dumping with regard to wage costs? [Van Miert] No. We can only apply the rules of the Single Act, in which, unfortunately, important elements of a situation in a given market are not all taken into account. When judging cases of state aid or competition, there is no minimum rule that must be complied with regarding wages. This is also true in the monetary sector. What are the rules when a country devalues its currency? In the area of taxation, social affairs, and monetary affairs, the game is not equal even within our single market. This is a structural defect. [LES ECHOS] Do you think this must be corrected? [Van Miert] It must be corrected because the game is partially biased. The Commission can only work within the framework of the treaty given to it. Sometimes our instruments are not enough. Let us take the steel sector: If you must pay state aid while at the same time obtaining unanimity, i.e., negotiate with governments that have a veto right, that is like a referee going up to a player on the field and asking him if he can give him a penalty. [LES ECHOS] So, should a new treaty be negotiated? [Van Miert] We must not be naive about a market. Everyone uses the texts and possibilities available to him. If a match is to be acceptable, everyone has to follow the same rules and there must be a referee capable of enforcing the rules. We are not there yet. The single market is not balanced structurally. It can be modified either through Community legislation, or by amendments to the treaty. With monetary union, there will be the necessary provisions. Are there minimum rules for all those who use the social aspect to unravel other peoples' policies? That is the question. [LES ECHOS] How do you analyze the French Government's attitude in the Bull matter? [Van Miert] When I took over this file, France, as well as other countries, was in the midst of an election campaign. It is often difficult to take things into consideration. Generally speaking the Commission observes a certain amount of self-restraint. Once the new government was in place, I had very good meetings with Gerard Longuet, and I was pleased with that. We have a relationship based on mutual confidence. He thought he was in a position to send us a restructuring plan in good and due form before the summer vacation. As it turned out, that was not realistic. Then there was a change of management, and -- from one extension to the next -- Bull could no longer survive without another substantial injection of money. This is illegal. If there is "bailout" aid, the company can be financed during a period of time so that it will survive. But that was not allowed. "Normal" aid can only be given via the Commission's approval of a restructuring plan that organizes a return to profitability. It seems to me that we cannot doubt the French authorities' desire to do what it must to ensure that the company becomes viable and a candidate for privatization. However, to get out of the illegal situation, we quickly need a restructuring plan making it possible to judge the validity of the return to viability. In the meantime, there can no longer be any state aid. [LES ECHOS] Can you specify what ensures that this will be a restructuring plan you feel is reliable? [Van Miert] It is up to the French authorities to demonstrate this. It is not up to the Commission to impose a plan. [LES ECHOS] But what are the criteria for it? [Van Miert] The first criterion is that after a capital injection, there can no longer be any aid. This is the criterion we used for the airlines. One must be able to demonstrate that we can assume, in good faith, that this will be the case. In terms of a reduction in capacity, this means -- because normally our rules insist that there is a reduction in capacity even if it is not absolute -- that there must be proof that all the factors that made the company lose this incredible amount of money have been eliminated. [LES ECHOS] You gave the French Government one month to submit a plan. It still has two weeks. [Van Miert] The situation is clear. There can be no more capital injections or aid until the Commission has had a chance to decide on a restructuring plan. [LES ECHOS] You are telling Bull that it has reached the maximum limit of money from which it can benefit. [Van Miert] More than that...because an illegal situation now exists. [LES ECHOS] Do you think there will be a quick decision about Air France? [Van Miert] Air France CEO [chief executive officer] Christian Blanc said that there would be a plan in good and due form within a few weeks, as was the case with Sabena, Aer Lingus, and Iberia, all of which have already experienced similar operations. However, this sort of commitment is a last chance. It is a single operation. It can only be used once. Christian Blanc is aware of this. Here too, there must be a credible plan. [LES ECHOS] As regards the recovery of Air France, do you think it would be legitimate to take into account the wage differences between British Airways and Air France? [Van Miert] No, because we have no rule governing that. Nor can we do that within a single country. In Bremen, Germany, wages are roughly 55 percent what they are in Stuttgart. On the other hand, the Commission can take action in different ways. If we introduce a minimum level of rules in the social domain, we must first do what is necessary to ensure that they are complied with. If that is not the case, it would become unfair competition. [LES ECHOS] A report to the "wise men" commissioned by the Commission suggests making plans for exceptional aid, especially if the aim of such aid is to privatize the company. [Van Miert] That is the opinion of the wise men. The Commission cannot become mixed up in a debate on whether or not we should privatize, since that is the domain of the national authorities. However, it is true that if the national authorities want to privatize, as is the case with Bull, then that is a sign of the seriousness of their desire to reorganize the company. The significance of this is not lost on the Commission -- quite the opposite. But it is not up to us to demand this. [LES ECHOS] In a recent case, the Vallourec matter, we had the impression that you were disowned by the Commission since you were in favor of banning the merger, while in the end the Commission decided to authorize it. [Van Miert] There were eight in favor, eight against, and one abstention. So just one vote was needed. As for the analysis itself, I was in no way disowned. On the contrary, it is in the decision. However, there was a difference of opinion regarding the "threat" of East Europe. Certain colleagues said: "They will be ready pretty soon and will therefore be serious competitors," while our analysis did not confirm this opinion in the foreseeable future. The differences of opinion had their roots in that. [LES ECHOS] As for the announced sanctions against the steel sector, is there not too big an economic gap between the period of events aimed at and the immediate economic reality? [Van Miert] The Commission is not at liberty to close its eyes for reasons of circumstance. This infraction should be separated from the current handling of the steel crisis. If we had to approach things differently, the time would never be right. The examination procedure is long and complex. The proven facts are very serious. Incidentally, the steel sector has benefitted from a certain amount of leniency. As for the fines, payment can be spread over a period of five years. [LES ECHOS] What future do you see for state monopolies, especially in the telecommunications sector? [Van Miert] As regards antitrust legislation, we must take action to create the most normal market conditions. With telecommunications, the goal is deregulate local telephone communications for the vast majority of the member states (except for Ireland and Portugal, which have been granted an extra extension) beginning 1 January 1998. Infrastructure is another problem, and one which remains to be discussed. However, here too, in several member states things are moving very quickly. There is going to be a second telecommunications firm in Germany. So why in Belgium should Belgacom still be able to maintain a monopoly? The very foundation of the monopoly has been eroded. The political elements are in place to accompany this development in the telecommunications sector, except as regards infrastructure. There will be a Community market and, for certain services, a world market. [LES ECHOS] Can the same reasoning be used for the import or export of electricity? [Van Miert] In a single market, it is clear that monopolies on the import and export of energy between the member states do not correspond to the fundamental principle. Increasingly, there are complaints where it is hard to say that the applicants are wrong. Thus, a company set up in the Netherlands must pay a lot more for its electricity than on the other side of the border. [LES ECHOS] Are you prepared to have the notion of the public utility included in the jurisprudence? [Van Miert] Definitely. I have no problem with that. In any case, even in the event of privatization, we must be able to maintain the concept of universal service. None of that is in question. There must be a gateway between the state monopoly and universal service. The situation is evolving for electricity because the French Government is prepared to review its positions. [LES ECHOS] How do you judge the GATT negotiations? [Van Miert] I was greatly in favor of the cultural exception. That is also a lesson for the French, because it must be understood that there are other cultures in Europe that are defending themselves against the others. However, in more general terms, I regret the fact we got wrapped up in agriculture because it prevented us from doing a better job of deciding what is the strongest industrial strategy for the future. The negotiations were hemmed in by agriculture and culture. Our strategic interests were not given concrete form in sectors where exports can be maximized. We accepted because we were cornered. There was a response concerning tariffs, but there was none at all in many other areas, such as the environment or the social domain, or even in the behavior of countries like Japan where it is difficult to gain access to the market in a number of sectors -- not because of tariffs or legislation, but because of the behavior of a sector or a lack of competition policy. Even if they have legislation in this area, it is not enforced. We should now side with the Americans against the Japanese. The game must be balanced sufficiently at world level, with a degree of openness that is measured not merely in terms of tariffs, but also in terms of other obstacles. For the time being, nobody is obliged to have a competition policy, so let us at least discuss that.
