This was stated by Qian Qichen, Chinese vice-premier and foreign minister, while addressing the opening of the symposium on the post- Cold War security situation in the Asia-Pacific region and its prospects here today. Dozens of scholars and strategic studies experts from the United States, Japan, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, Russia, India, Singapore, the Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam are participating in the three-day symposium. They are expected to focus on the security situation in the region, the security policies of the United States, Japan, China and Russia in the region, and approaches and measures to strengthen regional political and security co-operation. The overall international situation has moved toward greater relaxation since the Cold War came to an end. However, there are still severe turmoil and unceasing military conflicts in most of the world, Qian said at the symposium. In contrast, the political situation in the Asia-Pacific area is rather stable, as the progress there towards multipolarity started rather early and the Cold War impact was drastically reduced. Most countries in the region have long since given priority to domestic economic development, which has helped bring about a "virtuous circle of mutual promotion" between political stability and economic development, the foreign minister noted. The situation of relative political stability in the region is the result of the close co-operation and concerted efforts of the relevant countries, who should all treasure and continue to consolidate and develop it, Qian said. On the other hand, one should also note that there are indeed some factors of instability in the Asia-Pacific region in the post- Cold War period. Some of them are left-overs from the Cold War such as the Korean question; others are issues that have come to the fore over the end of the Cold War, such as economic friction and conflicts over territorial land and waters; still others have been caused by failure to adapt national considerations to the post-Cold War situation, as manifested in highlighting ideology and imposing one's will on others in handling relations between states. Qian called on all countries in the region to base their relations with other countries entirely on the purposes and principles of the United Nations charter, the five principles of peaceful coexistence and other universally recognized norms governing international relations. Mutual respect and co-operation on an equal footing between states should replace hegemonism and power politics. Peaceful negotiation, dialogue and consultation should replace the threat or use of force. Equality, mutual benefit and complementarity should replace protectionism and economic sanctions in trade. "Only in this way can the existing and potential unstable factors be brought under effective control and be removed altogether, so as to help maintain and develop the present situation of peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region," Qian stated. He said that China is also in favor of a variety of channels and levels of bilateral or multilateral dialogue on Asia-Pacific security. Therefore, in addressing the security issues of the region, it is necessary to proceed from the realities and particular needs of the Asia-Pacific region and its sub-regions, and to improve communications and enhance mutual confidence among various parties. China appreciates the efforts of ASEAN to promote multilateral security dialogues in the region and will take an active part in the ARF (ASEAN Regional Forum), Qian said.
