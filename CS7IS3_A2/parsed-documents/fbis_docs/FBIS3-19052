The Forza Italia candidates will acquire only 3 percent; this figure will rise to 17 percent in case the Snake's [Berlusconi nickname] people run with the National Alliance, and to 21 percent when they align with the Northern League. The centrists will obtain 16 percent, Pannella 1 percent, and the others 2 percent. These are the results of an opinion poll commissioned by TG5 [fifth channel TV news] with CIRM [Italian Center for Market Research], which interviewed 2,077 voters. In the proportional voting the first party is Forza Italia with 29 percent, followed by the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] with 20 percent. The undecided voters are at 28 percent, whereas 44 percent confirm to have made a definitive choice. However, 36 percent says that they might still change their minds. This uncertainty is confirmed by the researchers of Datamedia and Noima di Accademia who questioned a sample of 6,174 people. Approximately 40 percent still do not know yet for whom to vote. However, the researchers instead wanted to know "what" they will vote for, "how" they are making up their minds, and "how much" their choice was influenced by the media. On these issues, 46.1 percent believe that television is the most reliable source, 15.3 percent the newspapers, 1.5 percent the magazines, 0.9 percent the radio, 0.7 percent books, 27.4 percent personal knowledge, and 3.6 percent one's friends.
