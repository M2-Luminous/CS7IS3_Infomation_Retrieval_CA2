This was said after the results of December's elections, which shocked us all. Let me remind readers that at the time journalists were also blamed for paying excessive attention to Vladimir Volfovich himself. Until today, I personally have tried not to write about Mr. Zhirinovskiy, because any mention of his name in the press is an indirect advertisement for him. But having looked through some documents I received from an acquaintance in the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR], I realized that the time has now come to refer to the leader of this party in print. Well then. The first document is "A Blueprint for Broadcasts by the `Radio Zhirinovskiy' Radio Station." First of all we have the preamble: "The existence of his own radio station will make Vladimir Zhirinovskiy even more popular and boost the number of his potential voters." I invite you to memorize this statement carefully; we will have reason to recall it. Now for the details. The authors of the blueprint give a detailed description of the planned items that will be broadcast on "Radio Zhirinovskiy." There will be Zhirinovskiy Hour -- an hour of listeners' questions answered live by the LDPR leader. Then there is music from Zhirinovskiy's childhood -- a program specially for older listeners. Zhirinovskiy request time will consist of several hours a week of the great man's musical requests dedicated to "Travkin, Burbulis, Yeltsin, Lukyanov, Saddam Husayn, and Clinton." Zhirinovskiy's favorite tunes will acquaint listeners with the leader's preferred melodies. Finally, It's Your Line to Zhirinovskiy means that anyone who wants to talk on air with Mr. Zhirinovskiy can send a postcard to the radio station indicating his telephone number. Here is another quotation: "For people weighed down by constant problems who find themselves continually depressed owing to their unbearably difficult way of life, we propose the `Russian Dream' propaganda program. Analogous to the American version, the Russian dream means faith in one's future, a strong country, prosperity for one's children, peaceful twilight years, stability, and security. Studio guests will include people who have made something of themselves and overcome a host of problems." Most of the station's broadcasting time, according to the authors' plan, will be made up of patriotic music from all eras. This is no joke. As far as I can tell, negotiations are already under way with two radio stations -- "Avto-radio" and "Vozrozhdeniye." It is planned to broadcast between 1900 hours and 0400 hours, presumably starting this March or April. And so to the second document. "The `Zhirinovskiy Nighttime' Youth Club." Its founders believe that "the club's name will give rise to plenty of jokes regarding its activities, but the parties we intend to hold will always differ from those in other night clubs by their marked accessibility, immediacy, and quality program." So what are Zhirinovskiy's clowns planning? "While primarily intended for a youthful audience, the club will also enable us to hold parties for disabled people and pensioners, organize programs devoted to a particular event, or simply invite deputies from a particular faction to celebrate their leader's birthday." The night club also plans free lunches for pensioners, performances by artistes for the residents of children's homes, and meetings with the press. One can of course make fun of the unwieldiness of the plans put forward by Zhirinovskiy's supporters. It is possible to do so. Only we should remember the background against which all this is taking place. Meanwhile in over 30 Russian cities television programming has been cut back exclusively to news broadcasts, since both Russian Television and "Ostankino" owe the Ministry of Communications approximately 80 billion rubles. Moreover, the Ministry of Finance has halved Russian Television's budget, and now Russian Television has been forced to halve its programming. At the same time, in accordance with an instruction by government apparatus leader Vladimir Kvasov, even news agency and television correspondents are not being admitted to government sessions for the first time in two years. The explanation looks like a joke that has fallen flat -- we are being told that the sessions are a "working process, and therefore only mass media accredited to the Council of Ministers may attend the sessions, namely ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA and the government newspapers." In my opinion we are already witnessing a trend whereby the numerous press services, which were originally designed to impart as much information as possible about their department's work to the press and hence to society, are turning into a press whose purpose is to squeeze journalists out of the corridors of state structures. I am not even going to mention the country's top leaders. An acquaintance of mine shudders whenever he catches a speech by the president on television. Well, here is Yeltsin telling us about his edict which will stir up the entire country, he comments. Of all Russia's politicians, Vladimir Volfovich is virtually the only one who converses with the people. He travels around the country, around our country, moreover, not America or Switzerland. He directs his appeals to specific groups of voters. He knows what he wants. I have no doubt that Zhirinovskiy will be our next president. So what will you do then, Messrs. Democrats? Absolutely nothing. You seem to be implying that life will be awful if Comrade Zyukin comes to power. Comrade Zyukin has already arrived. But he does not wear a sober suit from the "Bolshevik" factory, nor does he go around with a long face. Comrade Zyukin wears denims and listens to rap music. While you preserve a haughty silence, he is running a disco. I can only hope that our people are more intelligent en masse than any one politician or minister. They may be able to see exactly what Comrade Zyukin represents. But you democrats, if you have learned nothing since 12 December, will never learn anything at all.
