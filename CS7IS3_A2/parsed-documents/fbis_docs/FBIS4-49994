The austerity measures initiated by Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji last June, but largely lifted later due to pressure from senior leader Deng Xiaoping, would be reimposed, the State Council said in a recent circular. Besides reviving the original 16 measures, the government has also banned new investment in fixed assets and banned further expansion of approved projects, expansion of new economic and technology zones, and the expansion of those zones already approved. It has also banned land auctions by local government agencies for commercial buildings, villas, and luxury residential housing or the further expansion of such projects that have already been approved. Economic analysts said both Hong Kong business and the mainland economy would be affected by the revival of the tough policies. In the circular, the government said the economic rectification measures introduced in the middle of last year would continue because the policies had not yet achieved their objectives in full. Admitting that the economy was now on the brink of being overheated, the central government called on regional governments, economic agencies, and financial institutions to work together to check uncontrolled growth. Prompted by alarming figures for the first quarter of the year, the State Council and the Communist Party's central leading group on finance and the economy called a joint meeting recently to discuss measures to rescue the fragile economy, Chinese sources said. The circular said statistics in the past months showed that three major economic indicators had been broken by great margins, which it said was a dangerous signal. The government had set three major economic targets for overall economic development this year: The annual gross national product growth rate should be 9 per cent, of which the industrial output growth rate should be 10.2 per cent. Consumer price inflation should be maintained at less than 10 per cent. Total capital investment should be kept to 1,300 billion yuan (HK$1.16 trillion), an increase of about 9 per cent over last year. However, statistics showed industrial output had increased 18.7 per cent in the first quarter of the year and 20 per cent in April; the overall price index had risen about 20 per cent, with 35 leading cities at 26 per cent, and investment had increased by 40 per cent, 31 percentage points higher than the state plan called for. Mr Zhu unveiled a 16-point austerity plan in June last year which was aimed at tightening credit, attaining financial discipline and monetary order and laying down precise directions on economic growth. The controversial plan was largely undone a few months later after a remark by reclusive leader Deng Xiaoping, who apparently favoured a faster pace of reform and growth. He said that only a certain pace of development would pass the test of truth. Mr Zhu's program, which included raising interests rates, calling in speculative loans, and cutting government administrative spending by 20 per cent, was a mixture of methods from China's old planned command-economy and from the new market-oriented system. It demanded: Forced bond sales, rolling back an earlier market reform experiment; suspension of new price-reform measures; a ban on most new government imports of cars and smaller investment projects; and an end to dubious fundraising schemes. The current circular said the revival of the austerity measures was aimed at containing the three major economic indicators, saying it was the major task for government departments and economic officials at all levels. "Local governments and economic officials at all levels should work hard to contain the situation from further deterioration," a Chinese economic source quoted the circular as saying.
