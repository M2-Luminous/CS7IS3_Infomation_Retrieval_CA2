Firms that used to deal with Slovak enterprises had to start using customs documents and transfer from domestic to foreign trading relations. Changes also continued in the structure of imports and exports according to the individual categories of goods. The share of fuels and raw materials in imports declined in comparison with the preceding year. The share of machines and vehicles in exports increased. While import prices declined, export prices rose, and real trade relations developed favorably. If we do not include trade with Slovakia, for which there are no 1992 data, in comparison with the preceding year, exports grew faster than imports in 1993. While exports grew by 20 percent, imports rose by only 2.7 percent. The volume of foreign trade increased by 10.6 percent. The total value of imports, including imports from Slovakia, reached Kc366.4 billion, and the total value of exports, including exports to Slovakia, amounted to Kc372.3 billion. The trade balance was in surplus each month until May, there was a small deficit in June, and this trend continued in July as the deficit grew. Then there was a surplus in August, September, and October, while the balance showed a deficit again in November and December. From the territorial vantage point, the share of the total foreign trade turnover (including trade with Slovakia, which is responsible for 18.9 percent of the total) with states with an advanced market economy amounted to 58 percent (European Union [EU] states 43 percent and EFTA [European Free Trade Association] countries 10.4 percent), the former Soviet Union to 8.7 percent, developing countries 6.8 percent, European states with transitional economies (except for the former USSR) 6.1 percent, and states with a state trade system 1.5 percent. According to preliminary calculations, in January to November 1993, import prices declined by 1.1 percent in comparison with the same period of the preceding year, and the physical volume of imports rose by more than 17 percent. Export prices rose by 2 percent, while the physical volume of exports rose by 15 percent. Real trade relations reached a value of 103.1 points. In trade with the Slovak Republic, imports reached Kc65 billion in 1993, and exports Kc74.6 billion. The trade surplus amounted to Kc9.6 billion. Industrial goods were dominant in the exchange of goods and raw materials, with 33.8 percent of total imports and 26.3 percent of total exports, and machines and vehicles, with 23.8 percent of total imports and 25.9 percent of total exports. Imports from countries with an advanced market economy rose by 7.5 percent in 1993 in comparison with the preceding year, and exports to these countries by 24.2 percent. The trade balance was in deficit to the tune of Kc12.1 billion, but there was a surplus of Kc7.5 billion in trade with EU countries. Trade with the EFTA countries resulted in a deficit of Kc12.0 billion. The single most important trading partner among these countries was the FRG, with a 26 percent share of the total turnover of Czech foreign trade, followed by Austria (6.9 percent) and Italy (4.9 percent). Imports were dominated by machines and vehicles, which made up almost half of all goods and materials; exports by industrial goods with a 31.9 percent share of the total. Trade with the OECD countries also flourished. Imports from these countries reached Kc209.9 billion, increasing by 7.5 percent in comparison with the preceding year; exports amounted to Kc200 billion and increased by 24.1 percent. The trade showed a deficit of Kc9.9 billion. Imports from the developing countries increased by 8.7 percent and exports to this region by 29.2 percent, in comparison with 1992. The trade surplus amounted to Kc13.5 billion. Almost 30 percent of imports were food and livestock, and 35.6 percent were machines and vehicles. About 45 percent of exports were machines and vehicles, and, at almost 38 percent, the industrial goods share was also high. The so-called Asian tigers (Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, and Malaysia) have become interesting partners. They contributed only 2 percent to the total volume of Czech foreign trade, but the exchange of goods with these countries is growing fast. Imports increased by 38.9 percent and exports by 65.8 percent, in comparison with 1992. Imports from the European states with transitional economies, excluding the former Soviet Union, increased by 4.6 percent, while exports declined by 11.9 percent. The trade surplus amounted to Kc8.5 billion. The largest trading partner in this group was Poland, with a 2.7-percent share of total foreign trade, and Hungary, with 1.7 percent. The Czech Republic mostly exported industrial goods to these countries (31 percent of total exports) and machines and vehicles (24.3 percent). Approximately 20 percent of total imports were mineral fuels, lubricants, and related products, industrial goods, machines, and vehicles. The trade surplus achieved with states with the state trade system--the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Laos, China, Cuba, Vietnam, Mongolia--amounted to Kc6.3 billion. The volume of imports from these countries was 32.6 percent higher than in 1992, and exports almost tripled. Dominant in imports were various finished products, with 50 percent of the total; in exports it was industrial goods, with 55.5 percent of the total, and machines and vehicles, with 43.8 percent. Imports from the former Soviet Union steadily declined to 80.1 percent of the 1992 volume. Exports remained approximately at the level of the preceding year. The trade deficit amounted to Kc19.8 billion. In the structure of imports, according to the category of goods, imports of mineral fuels, lubricants, and related products were dominant because crude oil and natural gas are in this category, which accounted for 71 percent of the total. The largest category of exported goods was machines and vehicles (45 percent). The same share of exports, approximately 15 percent, was taken by food, livestock, and industrial goods. In the structure of imports, according to categories of goods, the share of imports of mineral fuels, lubricants, and related products declined in 1993 in comparison with the preceding year by 3.1 percent to 12.4 percent of total imports. In 1993, 5.6 million tonnes of oil were imported (7 million tonnes in 1992) and 7 billion cubic meters (6.8 billion) of natural gas. The share of imported machines and vehicles also declined by 3.1 percent, to 38.4 percent. The share of imported finished products of all kinds increased by 2.7 percent to 12 percent, industrial goods by 1.8 percent to 12.1 percent, and chemicals by 1.7 percent to 11.5 percent. The structure of exports according to categories of goods was characterized in 1993, as compared with 1992, by the growing share of machines and vehicles (by 2.4 percent), which reached 27.8 percent of total exports. On the other hand, the share of food and livestock declined by 2 percent to 6.1 percent. The export share of the most important category of goods, industrial products (at 31.9 percent of total exports), marginally declined.
