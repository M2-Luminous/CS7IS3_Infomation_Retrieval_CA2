FBIS4-1496 "drafr083_cs94020" FBIS-AFR-94-083-S Daily Report 28 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Violent Incidents Reported at Polling Stations Violent Incidents Reported at Polling Stations Gunman Fires on Bophuthatswana Voters MB2804210594 Johannesburg SAPA in English 2044 GMT 28 Apr 94 MB2804210594 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Text] Mmabatho April 28 SAPA -- A white gunman who opened fire on voters at a polling station at Taung in Bophuthatswana was under police guard in hospital, SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio reported on Thursday [28 April] night. Police spokesman Col Dave George said the suspect was severely burnt when angry voters set his vehicle alight after the shooting. The incident was one of several rumoured developments in the Western Transvaal which the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [AWB, Afrikaner Resistance Movement] has earmarked as the base for the Afrikaner "volkstaat" [homeland]. South African Police said they could not comment on the incident because it occurred in an area under the control of the Bophuthatswana police. Information filtering from the region said right-wingers were involved in the incident. There were also reports that AWB members and security forces levelled their weapons at each other in the Rustenburg area on Thursday, but police could not confirm any such incident. Defence force Ratel armoured vehicles and black defence force troops lined the streets of Rustenburg on Thursday when an AWB convoy of about 100 cars moved through the town for an AWB rally. Whites in Rustenburg were seen to give the white right-wingers thumbs-down signs. Observers said the ranks of the AWB appear to be dwindling, with 200 people attending Thursday's rally. Few attended a rally addressed by AWB leader Eugene Terreblanche in Brits last weekend. Police on thursday continued their investigations into bombings on the reef. Police Commissioner Johan van der Merwe earlier said some of the suspects arrested were AWB members. A number of right-wingers' farms had been searched for weapons and explosives in the past few days, according to Western Transvaal police sources.
