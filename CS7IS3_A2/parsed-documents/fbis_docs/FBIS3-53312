The foreign secretaries have admitted that they have not been able to narrow their differences on the Kashmir issue. Pakistan has proposed a five-point formula to resolve the dispute. Under this formula, Islamabad has asked India to withdraw troops from occupied Kashmir; lift the siege of the Hazratbal Shrine and allow the people to pray there; improve the human rights situation in occupied Kashmir; immediately release detained Kashmiri leaders; and allow representatives of international organizations, the news media, and diplomats to visit Kashmir so that the world is aware of the actual situation there. In response to these Pakistani proposals, India has displayed its traditional intransigence. For the first time, it sat across the negotiating table allegedly without any preparations and described the relevant UN resolutions as outdated. In his news conference the Indian foreign secretary reiterated that the UN resolutions have become irrelevant and that India has repeated this position over and over again. By this, the Indian foreign secretary meant to convey that New Delhi considers Kashmir an integral part of India. Only a day before the start of the current round of negotiations, Indian Defense Minister Dinesh Singh also reaffirmed this policy. In light of these statements, the process of dialogue was nothing but a totally meaningless and futile exercise. The only salient feature, if there was any, of this dialogue was that for the first time India accepted Kashmir as an item on the agenda for discussion, but New Delhi maintained its usual intransigence, showing no change in its attitude toward the Kashmir issue. It is, however, worth noting that the Indian foreign secretary was given extraordinarily warm treatment. Both the president and the prime minister spared time to meet him and the Pakistani foreign secretary held a record two-hour one-on-one meeting. On the other hand, the fact that the president went hunting in his ancestral district of Rajanpur and the prime minister left Islamabad and convened a meeting of her Cabinet in Karachi, some 1,000 miles away, reflects how serious they were about these negotiations. It is only the government that can understand the logic of this contradictory attitude -- the flurry of publicity on one hand and the leaders' apathy on the other -- toward these talks. Nonetheless, the fact that the talks would fail was no secret. With India describing Kashmir as an integral part, there was no room for any dialogue and no meaning in conducting that futile exercise. If Pakistan knew all this in advance, then why did it agree to hold the dialogue? Was it intended to please India or did it not have the courage to resist U.S. pressure? Had we created a national consensus on this extremely sensitive national issue by mobilizing the support of all opposition parties and political and national leaders before the talks and then faced the Indian delegation at the negotiating table from a position of strength, it would have served us well. Earlier, in the hope of promoting goodwill, Pakistan also withdrew its resolution [on Kashmir] from the UN General Assembly, thereby failing to gain the advantages it could have by introducing it in the international body. Now, after the conclusion of the dialogue, the government has announced that there will be no further talks with India, but none of the authorities, including the foreign secretary, foreign minister, prime minister or president have taken the trouble to tell the people what their policy is for at least resolving the Kashmir dispute, or -- God forbid -- they have decided to leave the oppressed and helpless Muslims of the Jammu and Kashmir valley to the mercy of the Indian beasts. We hope such thinking does not exist at any level of the government. Wisdom demands that a national policy on the Kashmir cause be adopted, rising above partisan prejudices. For this purpose, the government should convene an all-party conference which should emphasize the need for resolving the Kashmir dispute only on the basis of the UN resolutions. Later, efforts should also be made to form a strong Islamic bloc at the global level to place the Islamic community on a single platform to help resolve all serious problems, like Bosnia, Palestine, and Kashmir. Several Muslim countries call Pakistan "brother" and India "friend," and are not ready to displease the "friend" for the sake of pleasing the "brother." So long as the Islamic community is not persuaded to enforce an economic and political boycott of India, nothing good can be expected from New Delhi. As the proverb -- a nod for the wise and a rod for the fool -- goes, we need to increase our strength to deal with India.
