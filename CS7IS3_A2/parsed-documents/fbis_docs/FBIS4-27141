Discussions were held on the government's measures against the North Korean nuclear issue which faces a serious crisis due to the failure in the negotiations between the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and North Korea. Following is a report by Kim Chol-min. [Begin Kim Chol-min recording] Today, the government decided to actively promote sanctions against the North based on the international cooperation system if North Korea does not accept the separation and storage of the fuel rods at its five-megawatt atomic reactor in Yongbyon by 6 June, the date slated for the IAEA Board of Governors meeting. In accordance with President Kim Yong-sam's yesterday's order to come up with a countermeasure according to each situation of the North Korean nuclear issue, the government held a coordination meeting on reunification and security-related policies and discussed this matter today. The government confirmed that it will not stop its efforts to continue to hold dialogue with North Korea until 6 June. In particular, the government decided that if North Korea does not accept the IAEA's demand, even after a final warning is sent to North Korea through a resolution stronger than the UN Security Council presidential statement adopted by the United Nations today, it will strongly convey to the United States the inevitability of carrying out sanctions against the North at the UN Security Council level. Along with this, the government discussed ways to deal with China, which might exercise a veto when voting on a resolution on sanctions by the UN Security Council. It also decided to actively encourage China's participation, and examine the possibility of taking sanctions focusing on allies such as the United States and Japan, aside from the UN Security Council.
