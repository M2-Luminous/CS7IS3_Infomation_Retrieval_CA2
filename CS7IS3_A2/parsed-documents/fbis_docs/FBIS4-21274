De Greiff called several U.S. officials liars and accused President Gaviria of unnecessarily criticizing him for his fight against drug traffickers. De Greiff said the president wanted to calm the U.S. Government's temper by attacking him. The prosecutor general said of the Colombian Government: They wanted to make themselves seem subservient to the U.S. Government by attacking me. As for the accusations that Colombia is a narcodemocracy, de Greiff said it is an exaggerated perception and once again called Senator Kerry and Assistant Attorney General Harris liars.
