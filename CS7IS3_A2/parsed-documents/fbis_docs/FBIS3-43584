At the end of the meeting, the executive committee unanimously decided to support his candidature and called on him to swiftly perform the required administrative formalities in accordance with the Constitution and the electoral laws. Meanwhile, the ABASA secretary general, Mr. Sadiki Ruvako Dieudonne, has resigned from the ABASA party. He feels that, quote: Since the beginning of the 21 October 1993 crisis in which the lamented Melchior Ndadaye, president of the republic, was assassinated in a cowardly way along with some of his close collaborators, he has been witnessing with regret the political harassment orchestrated against the remaining government members by the opposition parties, including ABASA, end quote. Mr. Sadiki Ruvako Dieudonne feels that before his compatriots and his conscience, he finds it very painful to defend a policy in which he does not believe, and he has therefore taken the firm decision to resign from the ABASA party.
