The trend of the first round of elections continued and even became stronger in the second round: Down with the ruling coalition parties and no to the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] too; one should vote for the Socialists, or for the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ]! The only question now is whether the new government will be a one-pattern one, or are there parties that will accept the Socialists' coalition offer. If the SZDSZ, which came in second with 20 percent of the mandates, accepts the role of coalition partner even with such a percentage, the new government will have a majority of more than 70 percent in parliament. This means that this government will have a free hand in governing and, in the sense of the constitutional law, it can do whatever it wants. The weightless opposition will actually have nothing to say in managing Hungary's affairs. If the SZDSZ does not accept the coalition, most probably the Horn government will have an unstable parliamentary majority but, compared with the previous parliamentary cycle, this government will face a much more divided opposition. The MSZP election victory is the success of the policy the party has conducted in the past four years and in the election campaign, as well as the consequence of the voters' deep disappointment in the government led by the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF]. The Socialists succeeded in convincing one-third of the voters that the MSZP not only represents a real alternative to the conservative forces, but it is also able to replace them. The Socialists' message was clear: They accept government responsibility, they endeavor to come to an agreement rather than confrontation, they have a modernization plan that can be implemented, and they represent a real governing force with their professionalism and political experience. Their electoral alliance with the largest trade union bloc, namely the National Federation of Hungarian Trade Unions [MSZOSZ], also brought them many votes. In addition, with Gyula Horn, the MSZP presented a front man who was facing the often base attacks directed at him while increasing the popularity of his party and of himself (and probably his car accident also played a role in this), and this also attracted many hesitant voters to the Socialists. One can predict with certainty that, having the majority in parliament, the MSZP congress will nominate Gyula Horn for the position of prime minister and will probably make a coalition offer to the SZDSZ. The MSZP is aware of the fact that the number of its parliamentary mandates is considerably larger than the social representation of one-third of Hungary's voters who supported the party, and inviting the SZDSZ into a coalition might effectively increase the political and mass support of the government; and there is urgent need for this, given Hungary's current situation. However, this will put the SZDSZ in a serious dilemma. Although the SZDSZ fared well in the campaign finish, it failed to repeat its previous result of 91 mandates in 1990. The rhetoric it used in the period between the two rounds of the present elections did not seem to work, namely that people should vote for the SZDSZ because this is the only party capable of counterbalancing the numerical superiority of the MSZP within the government and it is the only party whose candidate for the position of prime minister, namely Gabor Kuncze, could represent an alternative to Gyula Horn. The SZDSZ has to decide: It will either become a fifth wheel on the socialists' cart or it will get into opposition and will try to exercise pressure from outside. It is worth pondering about what erodes the party and its support more: accepting government responsibility from a relatively weak position or remaining outside. However, it is also questionable whether the SZDSZ is able to bear another four years of opposition and whether it can be regarded as a governing force at all. Whatever the outcome -- either a one-pattern government or a coalition -- the winners will not have time to celebrate.
