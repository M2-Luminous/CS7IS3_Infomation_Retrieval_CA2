The Sichuan Provincial State-Owned Assets Administration and Finance Office is encouraging enterprises to dispose of assets in various categories that are no longer applicable for use or indispensable, while giving permission to sell some workshops or factory branches with an unreasonable product mix and poor economic results, as well as some state-owned enterprises suffering serious deficits. It is stipulated that before state-owned assets are sold, they must be assessed by an asset-appraisal organization, which will set a base price for the sale to a legal person; alternatively, their sale must be reported to state-owned asset departments at the same level and gain their consent.
