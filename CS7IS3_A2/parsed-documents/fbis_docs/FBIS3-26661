The "Washington Post" newspaper quoted a senior U.S. official as saying that the administration was obliged to act firmly after the failure Friday by President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to reach agreement on reducing Japan's 60 billion dollar trade surplus with the United States. By taking the actions, U.S. officials said, the United States wants to maintain its negotiating credibility, but no decision has been made on which products to target. At the same time, the U.S. administration is seeking to persuade the Japanese Government that the trade actions should not cause a rupture of the entire relationship. Hosokawa cautioned the United States Saturday against imposing trade sanctions on Japan. "I very much hope the U.S. will refrain from such actions," Hosokawa told reporters before leaving Washington for home. His top aides warned that such action would cause Japan to retaliate with sanctions on American products.
