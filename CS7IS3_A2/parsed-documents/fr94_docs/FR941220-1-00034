FR941220-1-00034 FR941220-1-00009 3. Sulfate Analytical Methods a. Choice of analytical method. The reliability of analytical methods used for compliance monitoring is critical at the MCL. EPA evaluated the availability, costs and the performance of analytical methods for measuring sulfate, and considered the ability of laboratories to measure consistently and accurately for sulfate at the level of the proposed MCL. In selecting analytical methods, EPA considers five factors: (a) Reliability (i.e., precision/accuracy) of the analytical results; (b) Specificity in the presence of interferences; (c) Availability of enough equipment and trained personnel to implement a national monitoring program; (d) Simplicity of analysis to permit routine use; and (e) Cost of analysis to water supply systems. Sulfate has an SMCL of 250 mg/L for which EPA recommends measurements be made with an EPA method or a Standard Method (SM) method (40 CFR 143.4(b)), each of which uses a turbidimetric analytical technique. The July 1990 proposal listed analytical methods for sulfate that use one of four analytical techniques: turbidimetry, colorimetry, ion chromatography, and gravimetry. The July 1992 regulations did not regulate sulfate, but specified a colorimetric analytical technique to measure sulfate as an unregulated contaminant (40 CFR 141.409(n)(12)). However, the regulations did not list specific colorimetric methods. In an analytical methods proposal (58 FR 60622, December 15, 1993) EPA removed this ambiguity by identifying several colorimetric methods. The December 1993 proposal also proposed methods that use other analytical techniques, and improved laboratory efficiency by allowing all sulfate methods to be used for both secondary and unregulated contaminant monitoring. Today EPA is proposing methods that use colorimetric, gravimetric or ion chromatographic analytical techniques. The methods are proposed for analysis of sulfate as regulated and as a secondary contaminant. For information on the precision and accuracy of these methods, EPA refers readers to the references in Table 4.

EPA is not proposing turbidimetric methods because the methods are inadequate. The operating range of turbidimetric methods is 0 to 40 mg/L, which requires excessive dilution of the sample to cover the range between the SMCL (250 mg/L) and the proposed MCL (500 mg/L). EPA recommends that compliance samples not be diluted more than four or five-fold to obtain reliable and reproducible results. The gravimetric and colorimetric chromatographic methods require acceptable dilution of the sample to measure samples containing more than 350 mg/L of sulfate. Colorimetric and gravimetric methods have been used for many years to measure sulfate in water, and were described in the July 1990 proposal. As stated in the July 1992 rule, EPA agrees with comments that only methylthymol blue, not chloranilate, colorimetric methods are suitable for sulfate analysis. Therefore, EPA is only proposing methylthymol blue colorimetric methods for sulfate analysis. Ion chromatographic methods have been approved for measurement of nitrate and nitrite (40 CFR 141.23) in drinking water. These methods have been described or discussed in the July 1990 and the December 1993 proposals, and in 54 FR 22097 (May 22, 1989). EPA is proposing ion chromatographic methods for sulfate analysis only with the suppressed column option. EPA has no data to support use of a ``non-suppressed'' column (57 FR 31800), and the Agency is not proposing to approve this option in any ion chromatographic method. EPA believes the proposed analytical methods are technologically and economically feasible for sulfate monitoring. The analytical cost for sulfate is $10 to $30 per sample. EPA believes these costs are affordable. Actual analytical costs may vary with the laboratory, analytical technique selected, the total number of samples and other factors. The number of laboratories that routinely participate in EPA's Water Supply and Water Pollution performance evaluation studies indicates that many laboratories have the capability to conduct analysis for sulfate. Sulfate has a long history as a water quality parameter. There is a large body of performance data available for water pollution studies. The proposed analytical methods have detection limits much lower than the proposed MCLG for sulfate. The detection limit for a given contaminant varies with the analytical method (Table 5). b. Method detection limits and practical quantitation levels. EPA determines practical quantitation levels (PQLs) for each substance for the purpose of integrating analytical chemistry data into regulation development. The PQL yields a limit on measurement and identifies specific precision and accuracy requirements which EPA uses to develop regulatory requirements. As such, PQLs are a regulatory device rather than a standard that labs must specifically demonstrate they can meet. The PQLs for inorganic compounds are determined based on the method detection limits (MDLs) and the results from performance evaluation data. Table 5._Proposed Methodology and Detection Limits for Sulfate 1Contaminant 1Method 1Detection limit (mg/L) Sulfate Colorimetry 3 ␣ Gravimetry 1 ␣ Ion chromatography 0.02 The PQL for sulfate was determined using the MCL as well as EPA and State laboratory data from Water Pollution PE studies using the procedure described in 54 FR 22100 (May 22, 1989). A PQL of 10 mg/L was proposed for sulfate in the Phase V proposed rule (55 FR 30411, July 25, 1990). Since the detection limit using the colorimetric method is 3 mg/L, EPA is soliciting comment on whether a higher PQL of 30 mg/L should be set in order to retain the colorimetric method. c. Sulfate sample preservation, container and holding times. Requirements for sample preservation, containers and holding times listed in Table 6 were proposed for sulfate in the 1990 proposal. No comments were received on these specifications. The Agency is reproposing these requirements today.
