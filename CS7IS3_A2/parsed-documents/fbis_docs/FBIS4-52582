FBIS4-52582 "dreas091_j_94011" FBIS-EAS-94-091 Daily Report 25 Mar 1994 Indonesia * Poverty Rate Said To Decline Over Past 3 Years * Poverty Rate Said To Decline Over Past 3 Years 94SE0111A Jakarta KOMPAS in Indonesian 25 Mar 94 p 2 94SE0111A Jakarta KOMPAS Indonesian CSO [Text] Over the last three years the number of Indonesians living below the poverty line declined by about 1.8 million people (1.39 percent). In 1990 27.7 million Indonesians (15.08 percent) were living below the poverty line; according to a 1993 National Socioeconomic Survey (SUSENAS), this figure has dropped to 25.9 million people (13.67 percent). Minister of State for National Development Planning/Chairman of BAPPENAS [National Planning Board] Ginandjar Kartasasmita, Minister of State/State Secretary Moerdiono, Deputy Chairman of BAPPENAS Rahardi Ramelan and Deputy Chairman of the Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS) Sugito reported the results of the 1993 SUSENAS to President Suharto at the president's office in Jakarta yesterday. The report also included preparations for submitting the DIP [Approved Projects List], including REPELITA VI [Sixth Five-Year Development Plan]. Ginandjar told the press that the decrease in the number of people living below the poverty line or below the sufficiency limit shows that development has resulted in fewer poor people, in both absolute and relative terms. The 1993 SUSENAS used new methods which are more accurate and broader and which had a lot of input from international institutions, including the World Bank. "The World Bank used to criticize the way we made our calculations," he said. "Now there is a higher percentage of poor people in the villages than in urban areas, whereas previously it was the opposite," Ginandjar continued. He also stressed that under the new way of calculating, which takes into consideration the pace of inflation and the price index, the number of poor people, in the villages as well as in the cities, has decreased in both absolute and relative terms. "So as we come to the end of the PJP I [First Long-Range Development] the number of poor people has declined from the 70 million at the start of the New Order (about 60 percent) to 25.9 million (13.67 percent). This is a very satisfying figure," he said. Improved Method Deputy Chairman of the BPS Sugito said that the method used in 1993 for calculating the number and percentage of poor people was an improvement over the method used in 1990. He explained that the method had to be improved because given the developments that have taken place since REPELITA I there are some commodities which the masses, even those of the lowest class, had not consumed at that time but were being consumed a lot now. Sugito said that formerly only 14 commodities were consumed in urban areas and 12 in rural areas. Starting with 1993 and into the future 46 commodities will be used in the nonfood commodities package. A distinction will be made between rural and urban areas. The commodities will be the same, but the patterns of consumption will differ. For example, it turns out that expenditures for those 46 commodities are different for people in the lowest class in rural and urban areas even though the commodities are the same. The volume of consumption differs. For example, more meat is consumed in the cities than in the villages. Rice consumption is relatively higher in the cities since it turns out that in the villages people consume corn, dried cassava, yams, etc. as well as rice. He said the number and percentage of poor people was calculated by setting a sufficiency or poverty limit. The figures used are SUSENAS's expenditure figures. The poverty limit is calculated by adding the food sufficiency limit to the nonfood sufficiency limit. The food sufficiency limit used under the old method was based on the minimum requirements for food in order to lead a healthy life, i.e., the equivalent of 2,100 calories per capita per day. The value of the food sufficiency limit was obtained by calculating the rupiah value of 2,100 calories, without taking into consideration the type of food commodities consumed. Under the new method, the food sufficiency limit is calculated by first determining the commodities package which should be consumed by a person so that he can live a healthy life, a caloric content of 2,100 calories. The BPS considers 52 food commodities representative of the consumption patterns of lower-class people. The rupiah value of these 52 commodities is defined as the food sufficiency limit. Under the old method the nonfood sufficiency limit was calculated by defining a number of nonfood commodities as the commodities which should be consumed. A distinction was made in the number of commodities in rural and urban figures, 14 for urban areas and 12 for rural areas. This commodities package, said the deputy chairman of the Central Bureau of Statistics, was felt to be increasingly unrepresentative of the consumption patterns of our developing nation. Under the new method the package of nonfood commodities covers 46 commodities, undifferentiated for urban and rural areas. So the difference in the value of the nonfood sufficiency limit between the urban and rural areas may be due to a difference in the volume and price of the commodities consumed. The nonfood commodities were selected on the basis of the weight given to each commodity in the consumption pattern of the people, reflecting the quality, price and frequency [of the commodities] which the people consume. Results of the Calculations The Deputy Director of the BPS said that under the new method the poverty line for urban areas in 1993 was 27,905 rupiahs, which consists of a food sufficiency limit of 23,303 rupiahs and a nonfood sufficiency limit of 4,602 rupiahs. The rural poverty line was calculated at 18,244 rupiahs, which consists of a food sufficiency limit of 15,576 rupiahs and a nonfood sufficiency limit of 2,668 rupiahs. He also explained that based on the new method there were 8.7 million poor people (13.45 percent) in urban areas in 1993 and 17.2 million (13.79 percent) in rural areas. The number of poor people thus totaled 25.9 million (13.67 percent) in 1993. Under the old method the total number of poor people was 25.5 million, 9.1 million (14.20 percent) in urban areas and 16.4 million (13.13 percent) in rural areas. The number and percentage of poor people under the new method was thus not much different from the figures obtained under the old method. Under the new method, the number and percentage of poor people in rural areas was slightly higher than under the old method. On the other hand, the number and percentage of poor people in urban areas was lower than under the old method. This difference was caused, in part, by the fact that under the new method the nonfood sufficiency limit for rural areas was higher than under the old method, i.e., 2,668 rupiahs compared to 1,149 rupiahs. The figures for the poverty level and the number and percentage of poor people at the provincial level in 1993 are shown in the table.
