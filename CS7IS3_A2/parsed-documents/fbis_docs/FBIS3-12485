They should do this in response to our people's desire and in view of the fact that the majority of the PLO Executive Committee members have boycotted the Tunis meetings. The following members have boycotted the Tunis meetings, either because they have resigned, withdrawn, or frozen their membership: Taysir Khalid, 'Abd-al-Rahim Malluh, Mahmud Isma'il, 'Abdallah Hurani, Shafiq al-Hut, Mahmud Darwish, Sulayman al-Najjab, Yasir 'Amr, and Jamal al-Surani. The DFLP spokesman continued: Only eight members met in Tunis. Three of them urged a halt to the negotiations. Thus, 12 out of 18 members are urging a halt to the negotiations. Only five members support 'Arafat in responding to Clinton's invitation to go to the negotiations in Washington.
