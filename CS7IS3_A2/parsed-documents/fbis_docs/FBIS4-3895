The official being interviewed responded to questions raised by our staff reporter. His compiled answers are as follows: [ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE] The Xi Yang case has caused much concern in Hong Kong. Could you please give us an idea of what this case is all about? [Unidentified official] In June and July 1993, Xi Yang arrived in Beijing in his capacity as a journalist covering "Project Hope," the Sino-British talks, and the Preliminary Work Committee of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Xi Yang confessed that after he came to Beijing, he started mainly to gather classified financial and economic information, as was specifically instructed by MING PAO executives. After learning that his friend Tian Ye was working for the People's Bank of China [PBC], he took the initiative to contact Tian and had him steal, pry, and illegally provide a large quantity of state financial and economic secrets, which included: China's banknote designs, top- secret information about the PBC's plan to sell gold on the international market, exchange rate adjustments, and the PBC's plan to raise interest rates on saving deposits again in July 1993, as well as a document, "Notes on Provisional Control Measures for Foreign-Funded Financial Institutions Engaged in Renminbi Transactions," which was labeled as "classified." Xi Yang wrote stories according to the data obtained from Tian Ye and sent them to Hong Kong's MING PAO for publication, causing great losses to the country's economy. The Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court heard the case and concluded that Xi Yang's acts constituted the crime of stealing and prying into state secrets and that this was an especially serious case. In accordance with the National People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee's "Supplementary Provisions on Punishing the Crime of Divulging State Secrets" and Article 51, Section 1 of the "Criminal Procedural Law of the People's Republic of China," the Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court sentenced Xi Yang to 12 years in prison and three years deprivation of political rights. [ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE] Was the penalty too heavy for Xi Yang? [Unidentified official] The NPC Standing Committee's "Supplementary Provisions on Punishing the Crime of Divulging State Secrets" read: "Stealing, prying, and illegally providing state secrets to overseas institutions, organizations, and persons," "in an especially serious case, shall be punished with a prison sentence of 10 years or longer, life imprisonment, or the death sentence, with deprivation of political rights." The Beijing Intermediate People's Court heard the case and came to the conclusion that Xi Yang's stealing and prying into a large quantity of Chinese financial and economic secrets had caused great losses to the country's economy, so this was an especially serious criminal case which should be penalized with a prison sentence of 10 years or longer, life imprisonment, or the death sentence. Taking into consideration the fact that Xi Yang had shown signs of repentance, the court handed down a lenient punishment. Therefore, the 12-year prison sentence and two-year deprivation of political rights passed on Xi Yang was appropriate. [ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE] Why is Xi Yang's case considered especially serious? Could you please specify what kind of serious losses were incurred? [Unidentified official] The classification of state financial and economic information stolen and pried into by Xi Yang was very high, the quantity was big, and the losses caused were serious. But the specifics are still state secrets, so we cannot publicize them. [ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE] Was Xi Yang's case heard in accordance with the law? [Unidentified official] After receiving the indictment filed by a branch of the Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate in reference to Xi Yang's case on 14 December 1993, the Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court formed a collegiate bench according to law and started the hearing process for this case. During that time, because some evidence required verification, the Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court returned the case to a branch of the Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate on 27 January 1994 for further verification. On 20 February, the branch of the Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate once again handed the case over to the Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court for hearings. On 28 March 1994, the Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court passed judgment on this case according to law. Xi Yang refused to accept the judgment of the first hearing and lodged an appeal. The Beijing Municipal Higher People's Court heard the case and on 15 April issued a final judgment, which rejected the appeal and upheld the original verdict. Hearings on this case held by the courts were in strict conformity with legal procedures. [ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE] Why was the hearing on Xi Yang's case not a public one? [Unidentified official] Article 111 of the "Criminal Procedural Law of the People's Republic of China" reads: "The first hearing of a case by the people's court should be conducted publicly. But no public hearing should be held on cases that involve state secrets or personal privacy." Xi Yang's case involved state secrets, so the people's court, pursuant to the law, did not hold a public hearing on this case, but explained to the defendant the reasons for an in camera hearing at the court session. But during the process of the hearings, all the defendant's rights in relation to litigation were protected. Article 121 of the "Criminal Procedural Law of the People's Republic of China" reads: "All judgments shall be announced publicly." The judgment of the first hearing and the ruling of the second hearing on Xi Yang were both announced publicly, and written judgments and rulings were forwarded to Xi Yang himself after the public announcements. [ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE] Was Xi Yang's right to a defense protected? [Unidentified official] The criminal procedural law stipulates that, besides exercising his right to defend himself, the defendant may also engage a counsel to plead for him. When forwarding a copy of the indictment to Xi Yang, the Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court informed Xi Yang that he had the right to defend himself or to engage a counsel to plead for him. Xi Yang declined to engage a counsel and said that he would exercise his right to defend himself when the court opened. During the first hearing, Xi Yang made a full defense of himself. At the second hearing, the Beijing Municipal Higher People's Court also informed Xi Yang of his right to a defense. Xi Yang said that besides exercising his right to defend himself, he would also ask his father to engage a lawyer to plead for him. Xi's father first went to a lawyer working with the China Legal Affairs Center to act as Xi Yang's counsel at the second hearing. Later, because this lawyer turned down the engagement, Xi's father approached two lawyers, namely, Peng Xuejun [1756 1331 6511] and Xu Cheng [6079 2892], who were affiliated to the Beijing Municipality's Jingtian Law Firm, and asked them to defend Xi Yang. After they accepted the engagement, the lawyers looked through the relevant dossiers and had a consultation with the appellant, Xi Yang. Afterward, they submitted a written defense statement to the court. At its scrutinizing session, the collegiate bench gave full consideration to the defense statements made by Xi Yang and his counsels. Therefore, the courts at both levels protected Xi Yang's right to a defense in handling this case. [ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE] Some people said the second hearing on Xi Yang's case was too rushed. Is this true? [Unidentified official] Article 141 of the "Criminal Procedural Law of the People's Republic of China" reads: The procedure by which the people's court handles an appeal or a counter-appeal at a second hearing shall conform to the procedure of the first hearing. After the Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court pronounced the verdict according to law on 28 March, Xi Yang refused to accept the judgment and lodged an appeal. The Beijing Municipal Higher People's Court filed the case on 30 March and formed a collegiate bench in accordance with the law. The collegiate bench listened to Xi Yang's grounds for the appeal, examined the dossiers, verified the relevant evidence, interrogated the appellant Xi Yang, and the defendant in the first hearing, Tian Ye, and studied defense statements submitted by Xi Yang and his counsels. After a full examination of the facts established at the first hearing and the applicable legal provisions, the Beijing Municipal Higher People's Court made a final ruling on 15 April. Article 142 of the "Criminal Procedural Law of the People's Republic of China" reads: "After the people's court takes up an appeal or a counter-appeal for a second hearing, it should wind up the case within one month or a maximum of one and a half months." In Xi Yang's case, the facts were clear and the evidence was conclusive and sufficient. Neither Xi Yang nor his counsels challenged the facts established by the initial verdict. Therefore, it was very normal for the second hearing court to conclude the case within 17 days. Xi Yang's counsels submitted their written defense statement to the court on the morning of 13 April, and the court made its final ruling on 15 April. There was enough time for studying and considering the counsels' recommendations. [ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE] Why was Xi Yang's behavior considered a crime rather than normal activity of a journalistic nature? [Unidentified official] According to relevant stipulations, Hong Kong and Macao reporters who wish to gather news on the mainland must apply to the relevant authorities, stating the object, content, and period of coverage, and they may not come to the mainland to gather news until approval is obtained. If a reporter needs to gather some additional news after completing the task originally approved, he should apply to the relevant local authorities and may not proceed until approval is obtained. Hong Kong and Macao reporters gathering news on the mainland are protected by the laws of the state; in the meantime, they must abide by the laws and decrees of the state as well as the relevant regulations. They may not engage in activities which are incompatible with their status as reporters. Hong Kong and Macao reporters entering the country for the express purpose of visiting relatives or sightseeing may not engage in news gathering activities. Xi Yang did not apply for permission to interview the PBC, let alone obtain approval. His act was an obvious violation of the relevant state stipulations regarding overseas reporters' journalistic activities in mainland China. Xi Yang violated the relevant stipulations on gathering news on the mainland. To make this point clear is for the sole purpose of illustrating the fact that as far as news gathering is concerned, he was not doing this in a normal way either. But the penalty passed on him according to law was not because he failed to apply for permission to gather news through normal procedures, but because he violated the law, and, worse still, did so knowingly. It was Xi Yang who took the initiative to incite Tian Ye to steal, pry, and illegally provide state secrets. Anyone with a bit of common sense understands that the financial and economic intelligence Xi Yang stole and pried into were important state secrets. Xi Yang, who is a reporter and had lived and worked on the mainland for a long time, should have known better. After the case was discovered, the Chinese financial and economic information that Xi Yang stole, pried into, and published in an overseas newspaper was identified by the state institution concerned as important state secrets. Therefore, Xi Yang's behavior was nothing to do with freedom of the press, but was an act in violation of the law.
