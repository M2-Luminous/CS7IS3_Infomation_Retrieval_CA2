FR940817-2-00086 FR940817-2-00043 F. Comments on Health Assessment and EPA Response The focus of most of Ethyl's comments regarding the effects on public health and welfare resulting from the use of MMT in unleaded gasoline deal with issues related to EPA's risk assessment and specifically to the calculation of an RfC for manganese by the utilization of various analytical methods, to the uncertainty factors used by the Agency in determining the RfC for manganese, and to the exposure assessment for manganese. A summary discussion of the significant issues related to these comments follows. 61 61 For a complete description of the EPA response to Ethyl's comments, the reader is referred to Air Docket A&hyph;93&hyph;26, (Docket A&hyph;93&hyph;26, II&hyph;A&hyph;15) ``ORD's Response to Public Comments on the Reference Concentration for Manganese and on the Draft ORD Risk Assessment of MMT.'' Generally, Ethyl states that ``ORD openly concedes that after four years of efforts it is unable to conclude that a public health risk would exist for even the most highly exposed segment of the population.'' The Agency indicated to Ethyl in 1991 the research it could conduct to provide for a more quantitative assessment of the MMT issue. Thus, assessment of the risks or benefits of MMT could be, or perhaps could already have been, improved if more empirical information were provided by Ethyl to the Agency. Ethyl commented on ORD's April 28, 1994 draft MMT Risk Assessment that, depending on the methodology used for the derivation of the RfC for manganese, the level of manganese concentrations ``without appreciable risk'' lies somewhere within the range of 0.1 to 3.0 μg/m 3 and that all of ORD's RfC calculations fall within this range. Contrary to Ethyl's statement, the inclusion of Ethyl's proposed RfC estimate of 3.0 μg/m 3 in tables and figures summarizing the RfC estimates obtained by different methods was merely an attempt by the Agency to illustrate all of the RfC estimates. The Agency did not imply or state a conclusion that ``The majority of ORD's RfC calculations fall in the 0.1&hyph;3.0 μg/m 3 range.'' ORD focused on a leading candidate RfC estimate of approximately 0.1 μg/m 3 , while explicitly noting that the current official RfC of 0.05 μg/m 3 is not meaningfully different from a possible alternative RfC estimate of 0.1 μg/m 3 . To more effectively avoid possible ambiguity that is reflected in Ethyl's comment, Figure 1 of the final MMT Risk Assessment (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1994b) shows all of the RfC estimates contained in Table A&hyph;39 of Appendix A. Ethyl's preferred RfC estimate of 3 μg/m 3 is now omitted from Figure 1 because it is not a value obtained by any of ORD's analyses. Moreover, it is ORD's view that the best estimate of an alternative RfC estimate for Mn, based on the analyses and data considered to date, probably lies in the range of 0.09 to 0.2 μg/m 3 . This judgment is based on the strengths and weaknesses of the various analytic approaches considered by ORD in the April 28 draft assessment. 62 62 The reader is referred to Air Docket A&hyph;93&hyph;26, II&hyph;A&hyph;15, ``ORD's Response to Public Comments on the Reference Concentration for Manganese and on the Draft ORD Risk Assessment of MMT, for further evaluation of the various analytical approaches that were investigated by the Agency. ORD views the 10 and 5% benchmark and Bayesian analyses of dichotomous data and the Bayesian analyses of continuous data using the quantal linear model as having greater scientific strengths than the other analyses considered by ORD or by Ethyl.
