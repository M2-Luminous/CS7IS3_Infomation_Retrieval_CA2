"We have encouraging reports from certain regions, while in other areas the fronts have remained active," a UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] spokesman stated. "The German press describes us as `reasonable Serbs' and I am very pleased to hear it." Mirko Pejanovic is certainly a courageous man: A Bosnian Serb but "a Bosnian above all," he heads the Council of Serb Citizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina, a body set up on 27 April in Sarajevo that opposes the partitioning of the republic and wants to maintain a multiethnic Bosnia. Denouncing the fact that the international community treats Radovan Karadzic as the sole representative of the Bosnian Serbs, he is on a three-day visit to Paris, after visiting a number of European capitals, including Moscow. "In the history of Bosnia, no war has succeeded in destroying tolerance and the ability to live together." A political science professor at Sarajevo University and a member of the Bosnian collegial presidency since June 1991, Mirko Pejanovic claims to represent the 200,000 Serbs residing in areas controlled by the Bosnian Army, the majority of them Muslims. "You must also take into account the 400,000 Bosnian Serb refugees who want to return," he pointed out. "In total, we represent nearly as many Serbs as those living in Karadzic's republic, who number almost 600,000, many of them wanting peace." The Council of Serb Citizens supports the Croato-Bosnian federation which is currently being organized, although it had asked for the Constitution to include a clause stating that in addition to the Croats and Muslims, the Serbs, who constitute a national minority, were also one of the federation's founders. A decision on this question has been postponed until later, to be settled in the framework of a global settlement. "We do not want to become second-class citizens within the federation," stated Pejanovic, "First of all there was Karadzic's war and the secession; then in Sarajevo, we felt growing hostility toward us. We refuse to become Palestinians within our own country." "Only Russia and France can exert pressure on the Serbs to accept a political solution," he stresses. In Moscow, Pejanovic claims to have "obtained the assurance that Russia is opposed to the partitioning of Bosnia and against ethnic cleansing." Pejanovic believes that any solution must include a federation organized into cantons. In order to permit the return of 1 million refugees, there is also a need to set up "international miniprotectorates in the gray (or contested) zones." These areas are now controlled by Serb forces but had Croat and Muslim majorities before the war. Invited to the French National Assembly by the France-Bosnia-Herzegovina friendship group, Pejanovic, who is also to have talks at the Quai d'Orsay [Foreign Ministry], paid homage to the initiators of the "Europe Begins at Sarajevo" list: "Europe has slumbered throughout this war. This party is an awakening of conscience. For the first time, moral principles have been raised rather than concentrating primarily on political imperatives." Pejanovic shows little concern at being described as a "traitor" by Karadzic and his henchmen: "If you are a traitor because you reject ethnic cleansing, then I am happy to be described as one."
