FBIS4-48534 "drafr098_c_94028" FBIS-AFR-94-098 Daily Report 21 May 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 20 May South African Press Review for 20 May MB2005112994 MB2005112994 BFN [Editorial Report] THE STAR Constitutional Court Selection -- Johannesburg THE STAR in English in an editorial on page 12 on 20 May calls for "openness" in the selection of a Constitutional Court. After noting that the Judicial Service Commission will nominate ten people for membership on the Constitutional Court, the editorial warns that "there is no guarantee" that the commission's hearings "will be open to the media. On the contrary, arguments are even being offered in defence of closed hearings. The new democratic order owes it to itself...to ensure that the questioning of candidates by the Judicial Service Commission is audible and visible -- through the media -- to ordinary citizens." BEELD The Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans of 17 May says in a page-10 editorial: "The new constitution came into effect last month. The first full session of Parliament will take place next week. But one of the cornerstones of the new constitutional dispensation, namely the Constitutional Court, is still lacking. This court is the most important mechanism built into the constitution to guard the constitution....Already there are indications that several important matters will land on this court's table within months, relating especially to such sensitive issues as lanOuage and land rights. It is therefore of the utmost importance that the president sets the wheels in motion as soon as possible to establish the Judicial Services Commission -- which must recommend suitable members for appointment to the court -- and the Constitutional Court itself....In order to ensure broad credibility in the institution as a watchdog over the constitution, it will be necessary that the appointment process is as transparent as possible. There must be no secret deals between political parties wishing to get their candidates appointed; that could discredit this cornerstone. Every possible care must be taken to ensure that the most qualified people are considered for this exceptional task." Educational Issues A Priority -- A second editorial on page 10 says: "The insistence in black educational circles that all empty and underused schools be put to full use as quickly as possible has merit. However, this is a relatively small part of a solution to the educational problems in South Africa. Put another way, overfull schools in black areas are certainly a problem, but an even greater problem is that most of those schools stand empty for much of the school year. That is due to the culture of absence, strikes, and boycotts which has developed among black students and teachers over the past two decades as a result of various factors. Many of the reasons for these actions still remain, but the major political grievance was removed last week with the inauguration of President Nelson Mandela, and the remaining problems can now be tackled in all seriousness....The greatest educational priority for South Africa now, though, is getting all school children back in their desks and all teachers in front of the blackboard." BUSINESS DAY Regional Economic Leadership Urged -- Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English in a page-10 editorial on 20 May argues that the election in Malawi is an opportunity for South Africa to begin "to lead our part of the continent out of the morass." The editorial continues: "We must not only ditch the controls that restrain our own economy, we must be prepared to accept the consequences of assuming regional leadership -- a free flow of skills, goods and capital from and to our neighbors." The paper calls on President Mandela to use next week's state-of-the-nation speech to encourage emigres to return to South Africa and to "enunciate a credible economic strategy that cannot be derailed by expedient politicians." WEEKLY MAIL & GUARDIAN Understaffed Ministries -- Johannesburg WEEKLY MAIL & GUARDIAN in English, in an editorial on page 30 of its 20-26 May issue, voices concern over the small number civil servants in key government ministries. It cites the Housing Ministry as one example of an understaffed ministry, and expresses particular concern that the Defense Ministry and the Safety and Security Ministry do not have enough muscle to effectively take charge of the army and the police. The editorial concludes: "Although under pressure to cut civil service costs, the cabinet must face the fact that some critical departments may have to grow if they are to assert civil and political control over the state bureaucracy." Labor Unrest -- Johannesburg NEW NATION in English publishes on page 14 of its 20 May edition an editorial expressing concern that labor unrest among civil servants in some former homelands represents a threat to the country's democratic process. "We believe," the paper notes, "that workers...would be prepared to delay mass action to allow all channels of communication to be exhausted....It surely cannot serve the best interests of the same workers to undermine or sabotage the new government without giving it a chance to prove itself." If workers strike before exhausting all other avenues of communication, the editorial argues, they risk "falling into the hands" of the "enemies of our new democracy." The editorial concludes: "We urge Public Service and Administration minister Zola Skweyiya to immediately put together a team of Directors-General to travel with him throughout the country to assure civil servants that their grievances are being addressed."
