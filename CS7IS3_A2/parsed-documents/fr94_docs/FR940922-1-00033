FR940922-1-00033 FR940922-1-00008 EPA believes its general policy in favor of protecting public health and welfare is particularly appropriate to evaluate whether a particular measure is needed to solve an inter-state problem. EPA believes that pollution transport and the states' obligations under section 110(a)(2)(D) to control emissions that would contribute to nonattainment or interfere with maintenance downwind are critical to the integrity of the states' attainment plans under title I. Especially in a region such as the Northeast, where extensive transport makes states inter-dependent on their collective pollution control programs, EPA believes that its general policy should apply to make sure that states adopt controls necessary for other states' attainment. These states depend for their own citizens' health on the actions of upwind states that may lack an incentive to bear the costs of protecting downwind citizens' health. In such circumstances, EPA's general policy of prudence is particularly appropriate in evaluating what is necessary in the upwind states to protect health downwind. Moreover, these states' independent efforts (and their residents' support for them) to address emissions within their own borders may depend significantly on the confidence these states have that the other states in the region are acting as ``good neighbors.'' High officials closely involved in the SIP planning process in these states have now come to EPA, after extensive public processes of their own, believing a particular measure is necessary for them and their neighbors to do their part to address a substantially collective public health problem. These officials, as the chief state officers responsible for ensuring state compliance with the Clean Air Act, are the closest to the air quality planning information in the states. Whether EPA responds under section 184 or by exercising its authority under section 110(k)(5), EPA believes that it makes policy sense to apply its general approach of prudence in favor of environmental protection to scientific uncertainties. EPA believes sound policy dictates that it has a responsibility to do so. The legislative history reviewed in EPA's April 26 proposal reflects that at least some in Congress intended that EPA follow this approach. To the extent EPA's analysis reveals that other measures are reasonable and practicable but are not sufficient to achieve the necessary reductions, EPA would have authority directly under section 110(k)(5) to require the states to adopt those measures, too. But, for the reasons described above in section III.B., EPA does not believe it need exercise its authority in this manner at this time. Of course, states will need to adopt many of these measures as part of their attainment demonstrations due November 15, 1994, and this may go a long way toward these states' contribution to downwind nonattainment or their interference with downwind maintenance. But EPA believes that it should require this measure now, in light of the states' recommendation, the time needed to yield emissions benefits (due to the lead-time requirement and time for fleet turnover), and the need for a coordinated decision to adopt the program for the entire region collectively. Since it is both necessary to address the transport problem and very difficult for the states to adopt the OTC LEV program without assurance that their neighbors that need to will also do so, the Agency believes that there is adequate reason to act now to require this measure under sections 184 and 110(k)(5). EPA recognizes that, under this approach, certain states would have to adopt the OTC LEV program even though they did not vote to make this recommendation to EPA. In its April 26 proposal, EPA questioned whether the ability of certain states to override the wishes of others by vote could militate against an environmentally conservative approach to uncertainty. EPA does not view the objection of certain states as justifying a different approach. Rather, EPA currently believes that the weight of a recommendation from high officials in a majority of the states justifies an environmentally conservative decision regarding whether the measure in question is necessary. While the minority states might understandably wish to reserve their options for compliance, their adopted attainment demonstrations are due in a matter of two months, and the work that those states have accomplished toward assembling their attainment plans has not convinced EPA that the OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent) program will be unnecessary to address the transport problem. As noted above, EPA believes that even if these officials presented this recommendation without invoking the formal section 184 process, EPA would appropriately take an environmentally protective approach to deciding whether to issue a SIP call for the measure directly under section 110(k)(5). Moreover, as discussed above, EPA is proposing to explore the possibility that alternatives will become available and adopted so that states would no longer need the OTC LEV program, or that the states may demonstrate that they have adopted sufficient measures without LEV (potentially including those that EPA might otherwise dismiss as unreasonable or impracticable) to comply with section 110(a)(2)(D). 2. Analysis of Need for OTC LEV (or LEV-Equivalent) Program (a) Magnitude of Reductions Needed for Attainment in 2005. i. General Conclusions. The first step in EPA's analysis of whether the OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent) program is needed is to consider what emissions reductions are necessary to bring all areas into attainment. Based on EPA's region-wide modeling analyses, it is clear that very large reductions in emissions of both NO X and VOC are needed for the serious and severe areas of the OTR to come into attainment. Based on the best analysis available to EPA to date, NO X emission reductions on the order of 50% to 75% are needed throughout the OTR to reach attainment with the ozone NAAQS. VOC emissions reductions on the order of 50% to 75% are needed for attainment particularly in the East Coast urban corridor. These estimates are based on modeling analyses that used a 1985 emissions baseline. Updated inventory information indicates the 1985 inventory underestimated base case NO X and VOC emissions. Therefore, EPA believes that at least a 50% to 75% reduction in emissions is necessary from the 1990 baseline. 19 Given EPA's belief that in addressing areas of factual uncertainty here it should err on the side of environmental protection, EPA requests comments on whether reductions from reasonable and practicable measures should be in the middle of these ranges before EPA would determine that the OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent) program is unnecessary. 19 The Clean Air Act requires states to develop 1990 base year emissions inventories of actual emissions on which to base planning requirements, including attainment demonstrations. Therefore, the remainder of the document will generally refer to emissions reductions required or obtained from a 1990 emissions inventory. EPA is relying on the above-noted relationship between the 1985 and 1990 inventory to draw conclusions about necessary emissions reductions from the 1990 baseline inventory.
