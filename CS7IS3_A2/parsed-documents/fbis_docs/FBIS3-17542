Our Correspondent Reports From Tajikistan"] [Text] Army General Pavel Grachev, Russian minister of defense, has visited the area where the Collective Peacekeeping Forces [CPF] and Russian Border Guards serving on the Tajik-Afghan border are conducting exercises. On arrival in the exercise area he joined the Uzbek and Tajik defense ministers and the Republic of Tajikistan leaders attending the exercises to hear a report by Colonel General Boris Pyankov, commander of the CPF in Tajikistan, who is charge of the exercises. The exercise schedule first involved halting an "attacking enemy grouping" jointly with border guard defenders. A defensive engagement was conducted in collaboration with the air force and artillery and tank subunits. Over 1,000 targets, along with around 60 decoys, were set up on the battlefield for the air force and artillery. According to plan the attacking enemy first came under fire from three artillery batteries, three mortar batteries, and three "Uragan" rocket-launcher batteries. The ground forces' operations had helicopter support. Once the "enemy" had been halted, it was subjected to a 20-minute bombardment involving all forces and means of firepower. In addition, helicopters dropped a reinforced company by parachute into an area of possible "enemy" breakthrough. Then came a counterattack with the support of artillery subunits and ground-attack aviation. In the course of the exercises their commander, Col. Gen. Boris Pyankov, commented on the actions of the CPF, who demonstrated high combat teamwork and coordination, staunchness in defense, and swiftness in offense. At the end of the exercises the defense minister emphasized that the troops' actions merited an overall high assessment. On the basis of obervers' reports, artillery and mortar subunits received an excellent rating. The rest were rated "good." It must be stressed that the exercises involved long-range aviation, ground-attack aircraft, and fighters, which provided the area with air cover. Observers report that over 50 percent of the targets, around 100 of which were mobile, were hit during the exercises. The thorough engineering preparation of the exercise area must be pointed out. Within a short space of time the troops equipped a defense area and fully prepared the training zone. Army Gen. Pavel Grachev pointed to the increased proficiency of the Russian troops and the Uzbek and Tajik troop subunits. He once again underlined that these exercises were planned and are in no way connected with a show of strength, a charge that people are trying to level at the CPF. After the exercises he thanked all the personnel who took part in the exercises, handed out orders and medals, and also issued an order awarding early promotions to a large number of officers. Pavel Grachev then went to Parkharskiy Rayon, where an epidemic of toxipathic hepatitis broke out in 1993. He gave doctors there 5,000 disposable syringes and met with local residents, who thanked Russia's defense minister for his attention and concern.
