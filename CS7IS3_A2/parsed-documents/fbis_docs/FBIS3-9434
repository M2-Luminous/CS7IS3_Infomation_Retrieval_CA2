Aleksander Hall and Jaroslaw Kaczynski have spoken about it, while Bronislaw Geremek turned his attention to the fact that only candidates coming from broad camps have a chance in the elections, and not people put forward by individual parties. Pawel Laczkowski also made an appeal to the parliament members who formed the Citizens Parliamentary Club in 1989, to hold a meeting on the fifth anniversary of the June elections, with the goal, among others, of discussing a possible joint candidate for head of state. It is not yet known who could possibly be the "man of the moment" able to prevent the "communist camp" from taking over the highest post in the Republic of Poland. "Solidarity"-derived politicians, even though they have been declaring their will to nominate just one candidate, may face some serious problems with making it happen. A majority of the more than 10 potential candidates has quite big ambitions, and it is probable that it will be hard to convince at least a few of them that they should not run in the 1995 elections. Prime Minister's Award There has been talk for quite some time now in Democratic Union [UD] circles concerning Hanna Suchocka's candidacy. She, just like some other former prime ministers, has presidential ambitions. But the current period of left-wing domination in public life is a burden for the former prime minister. Until the presidential elections come, left-wing activists will be blaming the Suchocka government for the economic difficulties, which the Pawlak Cabinet will find it hard to overcome. At any rate, it seems that Hanna Suchocka's candidacy has become less and less likely. Even though UD politicians may think that accusations concerning Suchocka's having granted a 140-million-zloty award to herself are unjustified, it is doubtful that the view will be shared by the voters or by other post-Solidarity parties. Under this situation, Tadeusz Mazowiecki may be UD's only "serious" candidate (or, actually, a candidate for the new party formed along with the Liberal-Democratic Congress [KLD] ) who could be acceptable to at least some right-wing parties. He has probably not given up his presidential dreams entirely. The political time in Poland has been flying by very quickly since 1989, and the wounds are also healing fast.That is why Mazowiecki would like to just forget (and hope that this is what the voters have done, as well) about his disgraceful defeat of [presidential candidate in the previous elections] Tyminski, especially because right now he is the leader of one of the most powerful and most influential parties in Poland, which will be further strengthened by its merger with the KLD. Mazowiecki's departure for a "deserved rest" at the Belweder would be beneficial to his party because it would make him leave the post of party chairman, which could then be taken over by someone younger and more dynamic. Both Suchocka and Mazowiecki would like to be candidates of the entire Solidarity-derived camp. They would be approved by an overwhelming majority of UD and (as representatives of UD's right-wing faction) would also hope to be supported by at least a part of the extraparliamentary opposition. However, it does not seem very likely that the right wing, for which the presidential elections will be one of the last hopes for a political existence in Poland, will forgo coming up with their own candidate. And alas, it is very likely that it will not be just one candidate. Dignitaries From the Right Wing Jaroslaw Kaczynski (just like other parties' leaders) and other leaders of the Center Accord [PC], which is the most dynamic right-wing party of all, have already mentioned a few possible candidates, while stressing that these would have to be candidates for the entire noncommunist camp. Some time ago, PC leaders seemed to think that a woman would be a good candidate for president. The names of Senator Alicja Grzeskowiak and former Sejm Deputy Teresa Liszcz were mentioned. But, in the final analysis, the right wing will most probably be looking for a candidate among its representatives or sympathizers who occupy high posts in the state hierarchy. Adam Strzembosz, chief justice of the Supreme Court, is the most serious candidate and the only one about whom there is talk currently in Kaczynski's bloc. Strzembosz is an unquestioned--and, importantly, a nonparty--authority on the right-wing side. If he agreed to run, Strzembosz could probably gather around himself the electorate of all of the parties that call themselves right-wing or center right-wing, and even the electorate of Solidarity. But, if he decides not to run after all, then, according to talk in the Christian-National Union [ZChN]-PC-Movement for the Republic-Peasant Accord bloc, Lech Kaczynski (who is also nonparty) would have to replace him. But Kaczynski is burdened with the odium of "being one of the Kaczynski brothers," and so the Supreme Chamber of Control chairman will be held accountable by the voters for real or fabricated deeds by himself and his brother. By the way, the latter categorically denies the possibility of Lech Kaczynski's candidacy. Out of Solidarity In the right-wing camp, the possibility of nominating Andrzej Stelmachowski (Senate speaker in the First Term and education minister in Jan Olszewski's government) continues to be considered. Olszewski himself, about whom there was talk after 4 June 1992 that he was the center right wing's main candidate for president, after the election defeat by the Coalition for the Republic and after his party was taken over by Romuald Szeremietiew, says (although recently in a less persistent manner) that he will not run in the presidential elections. Jan Olszewski could be a candidate for that part of the right wing that is associated with Solidarity. Jan Parys also made connections with the trade union. His enthusiasts presented him as a candidate for president even shortly after his dismissal in 1992. There is a contest also within Solidarity itself on who will be the Solidarity-right-wing candidate for president. It seems that the trade union's chairman, Marian Krzaklewski, began displaying presidential ambitions. The success of the Warsaw demonstration by Solidarity, in which thousands of people took part, and also the initiation of a wave of strikes throughout Poland strengthened his position a great deal. But, on the other hand, some politicians associated with the trade union would gladly support Zbigniew Romaszewski, the man who is an anticommunist opposition legend, a senator, and chief of the Solidarity Parliamentary Club. At present, Romaszewski is in serious conflict with Krzaklewski. There is even talk that the setting up of a Warsaw Solidarity club marks the beginning of Romaszewski's election campaign. From among the somewhat more exotic right-wing candidates, the chairman of the Union for Real Politics [UPR], Janusz Korwin-Mikke, will not run this time around. His party wants to come up with just one presidential candidate within the entire "Accord of 11 November" consisting of UPR, the Party of Christian Democrats [PChD], the Conservative Party, and the Peasant-Christian Party [SLCh]. Christian-democratic activists from Pawel Laczkowski's party would like to suggest somebody else to the alliance (and to the entire Solidarity-derived camp): Even though PChD leader Pawel Laczkowski denies that, there is unofficial talk about Ryszard Kaczorowski, Poland's former president-in-exile. SLCh's Artur Balazs would like Leszek Balcerowicz to run in the elections, but it is not very likely that other right-wing parties would support the former deputy prime minister; UD would also most probably prefer someone better associated with the party. Fight With Walesa Whoever from the Solidarity-derived camp runs in the elections will have to fight Lech Walesa for the support of noncommunist voters. The incumbent president is a candidate for the Nonparty Bloc in Support of Reforms [BBWR], which he himself established, even though he has not yet made a decision on whether to run in the elections. Officially, the reason for Walesa's hesitation is said to be uncertainty about the powers of the head of state under the new Constitution. If the powers were to be the same as now or even less, then, according to a close associate of his, Professor Lech Falandysz, Walesa might give up trying to win the office. But that scenario is not very likely. Falandysz himself admits that it is possible that Walesa will think that he has worked enough and can now afford to become a "president on the picture" and drink champaign during official functions. But, if the incumbent president cannot or does not want to run in the 1995 elections, the BBWR has a reserve candidate: Zbigniew Religa, a cardiologist and the BBWR's chairman, who is enjoying enormous popularity (recently, it has been even greater than Walesa's). So far, Religa has been stressing that Walesa is the BBWR's only candidate, but he will not refuse to face the responsibility if it comes to that. Lech Walesa will be trying to build a presidential party before the elections, perhaps using the BBWR as its basis, although, recently, he has been leaning toward Solidarity again, when he made it clear that he had proposed his "citizens' constitutional initiative" precisely as a gesture toward his old trade union. Walesa has already given up trying to win the support of the right-wing "bunglers," even though it is probable that he could have gained the support of some minor parties not so long ago, but the president's good relationship with the ZChN, the SLCh, the PChD, or part of UPR is already in the past. Limited Market All signs are that the "market" of presidential candidates is limited and that next year's battle for the supreme post in the country will take place precisely among those people on the "market"--they are well known to the political public, and they know each other well--perhaps with the participation of a few ambitious outsiders such as Andrzej Lepper snd Janusz Bryczkowski.
