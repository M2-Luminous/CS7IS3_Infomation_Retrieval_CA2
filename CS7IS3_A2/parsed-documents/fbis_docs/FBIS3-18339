The entire investment amounts to 1.5 billion schillings, making Austria one of the most important investors in Poland. The strongest Austrian commitment has been in the construction sector. Yet, Austria is also represented in the trade, consulting, and the banking sectors. "Austrian companies should invest more in Poland now," trade delegate Rudolf Orisich recommended at a seminar in Vienna. He emphasized that Poland could boast the best economic figures in East Europe. GDP has increased by 4.5 percent, industrial production by 7 percent, the agricultural sector by 1.5 percent, and private consumption by 9 percent (estimated figures for 1993). At the moment, some 40 percent of the economy has been privatized, and a third of industry, 50 percent of foreign trade, and 90 percent of retail trade has been denationalized. In 1993, Austrian exports decreased by 8.8 percent to 6.4 billion schillings, while imports fell by 6.6 percent to 4.7 billion schillings. The agreement between Poland and the European Free Trade Association is intended to stimulate relations.
