The bill was defeated in a third debate by a 28-to-11 vote, while 11 abstained. The bill, which was passed in a second debate on Monday, was defeated by an overwhelming majority after the PDC faction requested a recess so its members could agree on what to do in view of the imminent approval of the bill. The legislators who abstained include Guillermo Cochez, Alfredo Ehlers, Alcibiades Alvarado, Jose Hill, Gloria Moreno de Lopez, Luis Narvaez, Elba Aizpurua, Benito Vega, Julio Velarde, and Enrique Degracia. Those who opposed the bill said it was the PRD legislators themselves who secured its defeat by insisting on including in Article 1 a clause exempting from culpability all those who perpetrate offenses "through actions for political purposes." PDC Representative Raul Ossa said that the PRD criticized the very nature of the proposed amnesty by attempting to leave "a loophole" to legalize the ill-gotten fortunes and the homicides perpetrated by Manuel Antonio Noriega and his followers, who undoubtedly were engaged in political activities. Ossa said that, in view of the failure of the PRD trick, President-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares as of 1 September will have to go ahead and declare an amnesty that will benefit everyone. "They will have to face the consequences of such a move," he said. Alonso Fernandez, of Molirena [Nationalist Republican Liberal Movement] who, together with fellow party member Arturo Vallarino, proposed the bill, said this rejection is an assembly "blunder" and that it represents a new frustration for the families of political prisoners who had set their hopes on an amnesty law. In addition, PRD Representative Alberto Aleman Boyd said that the Legislative Assembly last night went from "the sublime to the ridiculous" and that it is not interested in reconciliation but revenge. PRD President Gerardo Gonzalez said that the rejection has opened a "Pandora's box," which will bring to light the whole gamut of offenses committed by the current government which, "with the support of the U.S. personnel carriers," has perpetrated all types of injustices against those who deserve to be pardoned. Gloria Moreno de Lopez, former PDC leader, said that, although she had earlier backed an amnesty law that specified the names of those who would benefit from it, she will never support a proposal in favor of those who perpetrated all kinds of abuses and who could be released by invoking the phrase "acting for political purposes." Furthermore, PRD's Franklyn Rivera said that it never crossed the minds of those who rejected the amnesty bill last night that in the assembly there are legislators involved in crimes, who receive salaries from several institutions, have profited from reverted properties, are involved in attempted rapes, and in the future will have to account for these crimes. Alberto Cigarruista, of the Authentic Liberal Party, dismissed the PRD threats and reaffirmed his position that everyone guilty of common crimes, including members of the Guillermo Endara administration, should end up behind bars.
