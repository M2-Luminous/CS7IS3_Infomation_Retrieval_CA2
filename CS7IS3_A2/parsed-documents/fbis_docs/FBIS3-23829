The document was sent to leading parliamentary committees yesterday. KOMMERSANT-DAILY's scientific editor, Nikita Kirichenko, comments on the results of implementing Russia's budget. Just as KOMMERSANT-DAILY experts expected, the Ministry of Finance put together a budget which deviates substantially from the indicators set by legislation in July 1993. Revenues of the federal budget were on the order of 17 trillion rubles [R] with a shortfall of R7 trillion against the plan. Receipts from the NDS [value-added tax] (a shortfall of R2 trillion), excise taxes (a R1.6 trillion shortfall), and incomes from foreign economic activity (a R2.1 trillion shortfall) "lagged behind" substantially. Now about expenditures. Despite the fact that the Ministry of Finance indicated the figure of R34 trillion in its official record of the 1993 results, in order at the very least to blend with the maximum figures of the budget deficit designated in the Ministry of Finance-Council of Ministers statement No. 1-10/2-204 of 18 October. Let us remind you that the statement said the budget deficit in 1993 may be "squeezed" to R17 trillion as opposed to a possible R22 trillion as a result of the combination of measures being proposed by the Ministry of Finance. However, the KOMMERSANT-DAILY experts are inclined to appraise the actual sum of budget expenditures in 1993 not at R34 trillion, but R42 trillion. As we have already written, the point is that liabilities in unsequestered expenditures from the 1993 budget totaling R8 trillion were carried over to the beginning of 1994. Including debts to the Ministry of Defense (R1.2 trillion), to the APK [agroindustrial complex] for crop purchases last year and subsidies (R2.7 trillion), and to the construction complex for work already completed (R1.5 trillion). Now this fact has been acknowledged officially by members of the cabinet--by Aleksandr Shokhin, Sergey Dubinin, and Viktor Gerashchenko. They managed to "turn over" this debt to some extent through a simple strategem--the money was sent to numerous budgetary enterprises in the last days and hours of 1993, and the enterprises were physically unable to pay ewmployees' wages in time. This created a serious problem for them, inasmuch as beginning on 1 January 1994, the budgeted money not taken out was automatically entered as unclaimed income for the 1994 budget. It was claimed, naturally, but in 1994. After carrying over the old debts to the new year, the Ministry of Finance asked the TsB [Central Bank] for R7.5 trillion in credit for the first quarter of 1994. But what will come out of all this? First of all, the real budget deficit in 1993 may be estimated at R25 trillion, or 15.4 percent of the gross domestic product. (According to the latest data from the Goskomstat [State Committee for Statistics], the GNP in 1993 totaled R162.3 trillion.) Secondly, credit for the budget in the first quarter of 1994, asked for by taking into account the old debts, essentially exhausts the Central Bank limit for this period and completely deprives it of the opportunity to refinance the country's economy in the first quarter through the commercial banks. (Let us remind you that in 1993, the Ministry of Finance was ashamed to take more than 50-60 percent of the total sum of the Central Bank's credit investments for itself--the rest went to extend credit for the economy anyway.) Thirdly, repayment of the old debts will inevitably turn into a powerful inflationary surge by the end of the first quarter. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Implementation of the Russian Federation's Federal Budget in 1993 (in Trilli-| |ons of Rubles) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Item |Precise Budget Indicators|Actually Implemented | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Total income |24.4775 |17.1538 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Total expenditures |39.4539 |34.0832 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Deficit |14.9764 |17.2514 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |including what was finan-|11.9264 |15.8006 | |ced through national sou-| | | |rces | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |The deficit in percentag-|38.0 (30.2)* |50.6 (46.4) | |e of budget expenditures | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |The deficit in percentag-|13.1 (10.4) |10.6 (9.7) | |e of GNP | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |*The deficit financed from national sources is indicated in parentheses. | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sources to Cover the Budget Deficit in 1993
