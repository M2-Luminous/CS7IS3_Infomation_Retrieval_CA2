Whereas the OTC received and analyzed an alternative proposal from the automobile manufacturers which, while an improvement over Tier I Federal vehicles, would require programmatic and timing enhancements and the addition of an electric vehicle component to ensure that enforceable vehicle emission reductions comparable to those achieved by the OTC LEV program could be achieved in a more timely manner; and Whereas the OTC expects the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, through the consultation process provided in Section 184(c) of the Clean Air Act, to evaluate alternatives (including the program presented by the automobile manufacturers with enhancements) which are comparable in terms of enforceability, timeliness, and quantity of emission reduction to those achieved by the OTC LEV program, are consistent with the Clean Air Act, and advances technology;
