It is an initiative that has been criticized by the OAU and to which many of France's allies have given a muted reception. The least we can say is that, even in the event of the Security Council rubberstamping the operation, French intervention in Rwanda is turning into a fiasco before it has even begun. The fact is that Paris was not, initially, the ideal candidate for such an intervention. As a former colonial power suspected of having moved its pawns at the expense of its Belgian competitor, even of defending this French-speaking outpost, and guilty of years of complicity with the former Kigali dictatorship, France has further aggravated its position by its attitude in recent months. Why, in April, was France happy to selfishly repatriate its nationals and approve, together with everyone else, the withdrawal of the 2,000 blue helmets from Rwanda at the very time one of the worst massacres of this century was beginning in that country? Why was France so slow in coming round, coincidentally just as the RPF had won the upper hand on the ground? Not only does France stand accused of, once again, coming to the aid of the former power, but its initiative has had the effect of returning prestige to African regimes that are just as guilty, such as that of General Mobutu in Zaire. It is nonetheless true that the "duty of humanitarian intervention" in which Paris has become expert is a quite legitimate and necessary notion and that what is termed, rather pompously, the "international community," has once again overwhelmingly failed in its mission. Some 18 months ago, the aforementioned community spectacularly came together, led by the United States, to act in the face of the famine in Somalia. Somalia is still home to 18,000 blue helmets, whereas there are only 550 in Rwanda. Given the estimated 500,000 victims of the massacre, this amounts to one "peacekeeper" for every 1,000 persons who have died. Since then, hasn't there has been a kind of a media saturation, tinged with a touch of racism ("let the Africans kill each other")? A few days ago, UN diplomats were seriously discussing whether we should talk of "peacekeeping" or "peacemaking" in Rwanda, or if the term "genocide" was appropriate. It is possible that the five "conditions" laid down by Edouard Balladur will be the start of a return to order. However, the worse thing would be if the "international community" stopped there. It, too, is responsible for this mess.
