FR940104-0-00066 FR940104-0-00015 VIII. Analysis of Potential Costs and Benefits A. Executive Order Requirements Executive Order 12866 Under Executive Order 12866, (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or state, local, or tribal governments or communities; (2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order. It has been determined that this rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the terms of Executive Order 12866 and is therefore not subject to OMB review. Nevertheless, the Agency prepared an abbreviated RIA or ``Economic Assessment'' (EA) in order to examine costs and benefits likely to occur as a result of that action. B. Description of Costs and Benefits of This Rule Because the Agency has decided not to list wastes generated from the use of chlorophenolic formulations in surface protection operations, no specific action is required under this Rule. Facilities, however, may choose to take some remedial action as a result of publicity surrounding this action. A detailed analysis of work performed is described in the background document for this final rule. IX. State Authority Under section 3006 of RCRA, EPA may authorize qualified States to administer and enforce the RCRA program within the State. (See 40 CFR part 271 for the standards and requirements for authorization.) Following authorization, EPA retains enforcement authority under sections 3007, 3008, 3013, and 7003 of RCRA, although authorized States have primary enforcement responsibility. Before the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA) amended RCRA, a State with final authorization administered its hazardous waste program entirely in lieu of the Federal program in that State. The Federal requirements no longer applied in the authorized State, and EPA could not issue permits for any plants located in the State with permitting authorization. When new, more stringent Federal requirements were promulgated or enacted, the State was obligated to enact equivalent authority within specified time frames. New Federal requirements did not take effect in an authorized State until the State adopted the requirements as State law. By contrast, under section 3006(g) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6926(g), new requirements and prohibitions imposed by the HSWA take effect in authorized States at the same time that they take effect in non-authorized States. EPA is directed to implement those requirements and prohibitions in authorized States, including the issuance of permits, until the State is granted authorization to do so. While States must still adopt HSWA-related provisions as State law to retain final authorization, the Federal HSWA requirements apply in authorized States in the interim. Although this final rule does not list, as hazardous, chlorophenolic wastes from the wood surface protection industry, it does add four constituents to appendix VIII of 40 CFR part 261. These additions will not be effective in authorized States since the requirements are not being imposed pursuant to HSWA. These requirements will be effective only in those States that do not have final authorization. In authorized States, these requirements will not be applicable until the States revise their programs to adopt equivalent requirements under State law. Section 271.21(e)(2) of EPA's state authorization regulations (40 CFR part 271) requires that States with final authorization must modify their programs to reflect Federal program changes and submit the modifications to EPA for approval. The deadline by which the States must modify their programs to adopt this proposed regulation, if it is adopted as a final rule, will be determined by the date of promulgation of a final rule in accordance with ยง 271.21(e)(2). If the proposal is adopted as a final rule, Table 1 at 40 CFR 271.1 will be amended accordingly. Once EPA approves the modification, the State requirements become RCRA Subtitle C requirements. States with authorized RCRA programs already may have regulations similar to what is being finalized in this rule. These State regulations have not been assessed against the Federal regulations being proposed today to determine whether they meet the tests for authorization. Thus, a State would not be authorized to implement these regulations as RCRA requirements until State program modifications are submitted to EPA and approved, pursuant to 40 CFR 271.21. Of course, States with existing regulations that are not less stringent than current Federal regulations may continue to administer and enforce their regulations as a matter of State law. It should be noted that authorized States are required to modify their programs only when EPA promulgates Federal standards that are more stringent or broader in scope than existing Federal standards. Section 3009 of RCRA allows States to impose standards more stringent than those in the Federal program. For those Federal program changes that are less stringent or reduce the scope of the Federal program, States are not required to modify their programs. (See 40 CFR 271.1(i).) This proposed rule, if finalized, is neither less stringent than nor a reduction in the scope of the current Federal program and, therefore, states would be required to modify their programs to retain authorization to implement and enforce these regulations. X. Regulatory Flexibility Analysis This final rule amends the hazardous waste regulations by adding four chemicals to appendix VIII of 40 CFR part 261 and amending SW&hyph;846 by adding Method 4010. These are impacts with negligible effects to small entities. Therefore, there is no need to consider its impacts on small entities by preparing a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis. XI. Paperwork Reduction Act This rule does not contain any information collection requirements subject to OMB review under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.
