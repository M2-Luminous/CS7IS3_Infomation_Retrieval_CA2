This is what UGTA Secretary General Abdelhak Benhamouda was saying. In a statement published in yesterday's issue of the newspaper EL-MASSA, Benhamouda said that an agreement in the aforementioned field will turn the IMF into a gendarme in Algeria. The UGTA secretary general explained that talks on the question of the debts should be assigned to an Algerian negotiator who has the backing of the people. Benhamouda also pointed out that workers are not the only ones to be blamed for the state of complacency that one sees in the national enterprises. He called for work to be valued by practical and material encouragement and that the law must be respected by everyone.
