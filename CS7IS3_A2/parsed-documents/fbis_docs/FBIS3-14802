Rybkin said they need most interaction with the president, the government and the Federation Council. The interaction has been discussed with Presidential Assistant Georgiy Satarov. There is also need for a memorandum to include a system of criteria and a mechanism to ensure national reconciliation, civil peace and accord. Speaking of possible consequences of the amnesty, Rybkin said "street political fighting and gladiators a la Rus are inadmissible. If someone tries to do it, one can be sure: the State Duma and the president will be able to put them in place." The speaker also reminded that "amnesty as a rule suggests toughened punishment for repeated violation". As for persons liable for political amnesty, they are expected to "actively join Russian life and the search for interaction". Those who do not want to involve in "the common cause" should better say at home, said Rybkin.
