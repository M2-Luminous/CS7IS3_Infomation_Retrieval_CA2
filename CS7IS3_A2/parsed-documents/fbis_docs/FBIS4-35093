Authorities of the Central Bank of Honduras, BCH, decided yesterday to hold daily dollar auctions beginning 23 June. Bank spokesman Juan Soto said the auction will operate much like a stock market. (San Pedro Sula EL TIEMPO in Spanish 22 June 94 p 2) An official source reported today the BCH sold $2.9 million during its first U.S. currency auction. The post-auction exchange rate was 8.67 lempiras per dollar. These auctions are among the measures recently adopted by Honduran banking authorities to stop the increasing devaluation of the local currency. Local bank figures indicate the lempira suffered a devaluation of at least 13 percent during the first five months of 1994. (Panama City ACAN in Spanish 1800 GMT 24 June 94)
