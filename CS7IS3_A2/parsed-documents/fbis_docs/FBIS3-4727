This good news has been attested to by the report on requests by the Thai military for the police to arrest Lao General Vang Pao, accused of having built a clandestine headquarters on Thai territory to wage war against the Lao Government and Mon generals who used strongholds on Thai soil to lead rebellion against the Burmese Government. This is a good omen because it indicates that Thailand is readjusting its foreign policy in line with the global trend. Formerly, Thailand used areas under the control of minority rebels as buffer states to maintain distance from the neighbors and used them as a shield against external aggression. The Thai Government has come to realize that some of our neighbors, although they may pursue different political systems or be under the rule of a military regime or a single-party system, are all pressured by internal forces to open their economies for free trade. It does not matter how Thailand manages to profit from more economic and trade ties with neigbors, but the point is that it must first revise its policy in dealing with them. NAEO NA believes that as long as there are rumors about the presence of minority rebels on Thai soil, suspicion and hatred from neigboring governments will continue to linger. In other words, Thailand will certainly lose to third countries the opportunity to benefit from open markets in their neighbors. The ongoing readjustment of the Thai Government policy is indeed correct.
