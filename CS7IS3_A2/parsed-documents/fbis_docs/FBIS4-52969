The visiting army later executed a near-perfect mock attack to secure three buildings at the Safti [Singapore Armed Forces Training Institute] training area under the watchful eyes of Singapore trainers. The PA soldiers were part of a 200-strong contingent which is in Singapore for Exercise Anoa-Singa 2/94. The exercise allows for cross-training between the troops of the two countries. This is the first bilateral army exercise between the two countries to be held Singapore and the second the Anoa-Singa series. The previous exercise was held in the Philippines last year. Anoa-Singa 2/94 is conducted under a memorandum of understanding the the countries signed last week. It provides for regular joint exercises between the two armed forces. The two countries take turns to host it. Among those observing yesterday's attack were the chief of Defence Force, Major-General Ng Jui Ping, and the chief of staff, Arme Forces of the Philippines, Lt-General Arturo T. Enrile. The Fibua practice was also one of the activities which kicked off Anoa-Singa 2/94. While the men tackled urban warfare, their commanders were put through a fully computerised wargaming system. The seven-day bilateral exercise is being held in the Safti training area. Maj-Gen Ng and Lt-Gen Enrile opened the exercise at a short ceremony at the SAF Wargame Centre in Jurong earlier in the morning. Maj-Gen Ng, in his speech, said the SAF had always valued joint exercises with friendly forces. He said: "Not only do such exercises provide good avenues for us to learn from one another, they forge close understanding between the leaders, officers, and men of both armed forces. Over time, as the officers advance in the careers, they bring to defence relations that special insight into the other armed forces and that special rapport with its leaders." Lt-Gen Enrile said the bilateral initiative underpinned the desire of the two sides to expand their interaction. About 600 officers and men from the 1st and 2nd Battalions, Singapore Guards are involved in the exercise. Their Filipino counter are from the PA's 56th Infantry Battalion (56IB). The troops arrived here last Friday and will leave on May 21. The Defence Ministry said Exercise Anoa-Singa reflects the warm and friendly ties between the two countries' armed forces.
