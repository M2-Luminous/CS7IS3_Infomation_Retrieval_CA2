In his speech, the President hinted that the restrictions of domestic demand in Japan and the high interest rates in Europe, especially in Germany, were part of the reason for the high unemployment rates in the West. "Have we balanced our fears of inflation with the need for economic growth?" Clinton asked the G-7 delegates, which include economic, finance, labor and trade ministers of the world's major industrial nations. "One lesson is clear," Clinton said. "There is no rich country on Earth that can expand its own job base and its income unless there is global economic growth." In previous G-7 meetings, Clinton said, the U.S. was criticized for its high budget deficit. And now, with deficit on decline and 2.1 million new jobs created in the past 13 months, the U.S. should be proud, Clinton said. The President, meanwhile, asked the participants to talk together "openly and honestly" about the problems of growth. "Every advanced nation is facing that choice between hope and fear, between stagnation and change, between closing up and opening up," Clinton said. "America has chosen the path of change." He said that while the U.S. should continue to bring its deficit down, Japan should increase domestic demand, Europe should continue to work for lower interest rates "so that these three things together can spark a new round of worldwide growth which will create more economic activity and more jobs." The President said that trade was not a zero-sum game. In the U.S., the export-related jobs pay on average 22 percent more than the jobs that have nothing to do with exports. The President also asked the summit to address the three challenges: training high-skilled workers to meet job changes, increasing productivity without shedding workers, and ensuring a social safety net for workers, from health care, welfare, training to family leave and child care. "We cannot turn away from the notion that modernization is the key to employment," he said, adding that the trick for the government and private sector was to keep finding new area that productivity will succeed. "If we allow ourselves for a minute to try to resist the growth of productivity, we are in deep trouble," the President said.
