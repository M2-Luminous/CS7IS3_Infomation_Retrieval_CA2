The aim of the study is to predict the forces from the road acting on the axle system of a truck by mechanical analysis, and similarly, do a structural analysis and fatigue life analysis. 1. Introduction In the early development of the automobile, new designs and specification modifications were arrived at in the planning and design stage by estimating the forces acting on a vehicle during operation, and estimating the loads of component parts receiving those forces. That eventually made it necessary to perfect a comprehensive method for estimating such forces by mechanical analysis CAE and structural analysis CAE. In Figure 1, we show a flow chart of that process. In specific terms, it means establishing a basic structural analysis model during the initial vehicle development stage and then creating applied models based on the intended use of the vehicle. In this paper, we try to estimate the forces acting on the axle system of a vehicle from the road surface under different driving conditions, and apply those results in a structural analysis of the axle system components in question, and try to estimate and assess the strength and fatigue life of those parts. 2. About CAE Model 2.1 CAE Application Focusing on the front independent suspension of a compact truck, we simulated driving over rough terrain, turning, and braking, and also simulated driving over an irregular road surface. Treating those results as input conditions, we assessed the fatigue life of the system by performing a structural analysis of the knuckles in the front independent suspension. In Figure 2, we show a schematic drawing of the double-wishbone front independent suspension used for the simulation. In commercial vehicles, in particular, there is very little data available on actual performance and knowhow because independent suspension systems have only been around for a fairly short time. The tough conditions under which the vehicle is used, the many specifications, and the difficulty in testing critical states make it hard to determine test conditions. Figure 2. Front Independent Suspension For those reasons, we did additional studies to determine what effect the CAE method may have on improving development efficiency. 2.2 Structural Analysis Vehicle Model In Figure 3, we show a structural analysis model of the vehicle used in the simulations (double-axle rear wheel drive cargo truck). The model used for the simulations was a full vehicle model consisting of a frame, rear body, axles, suspension system, tires, cab, engine, and transmission. To analyze vehicle movement, a mechanical movement analysis software (ADAMS and ADAMS/Tire) was used. The models used in the simulation included a basic model prepared by a group of specialists during the design and planning stage of the vehicle based on a structural analysis of the solid body elements, as well as applied models depending on the intended use of the vehicle.[.sup](1,2)[/] Our main aim here was to do a mechanical analysis of axle system parts, and being concerned about computational efficiency and accuracy, we worked with a model of the main solid body elements. Figure 3. Vehicle Model Produced by ADAMS 2.3 Mechanical Analysis Model of Axle Parts In Figure 4, we show a mechanical analysis model of the knuckle. For boundary conditions, we used the forces acting on the tires obtained by mechanical analysis. For support conditions, we used a model in which mechanical linkages are supported simply. With this level of modeling, the initial evaluations verified that an allowable accuracy had been achieved based on a comparison between actual and calculated measurements. Figure 4. BEM[.sup]*[/] Model and Boundary Conditions The analytic solving was done using SURFES (general-purpose boundary element method),[.sup](3)[/] and the preprocessing was done using a general-purpose CAE software (concept station/I-DEAS). By being able to modify the shape of components having a complex three-dimensional walled structure such as was found in this study (e.g. making light-weight walls), we found the boundary element method to be better at sticking two-dimensional elements to the parts surface and easier to study than the finite element method which has three-dimensional solid elements. Computers are limited, however, in the number of possible contacts, so this method is really unsuitable for large models. In order to give direction to CAE design in the design department,[.sup](4)[/] we found it effective to make the analytical models as small as possible and do studies of models having mobility. 2.4 Assessing Fatigue Life First, we created a mechanical analysis and structural analysis model based on actual operating conditions of a truck to produce a frequency drawing of the stress fluctuation stress amplitude in order to evaluate the strength of the truck, and following that, estimated the fatigue life of the truck based on fatigue failure from cumulative linear wear and tear. The study was done here based on actual operating conditions while driving on the irregular road surface described above. A special-purpose software known as MALIAN was used for the evaluation. 3. CAE Simulation 3.1 Road Simulation We compared the calculated forces acting on the tires from the road surface derived from the mechanical analysis model with the measurements taken from actual on-road operations. Measuring the stress of the axle components at certain points, we used the following conversion factor _a_[.sub]i[/] in order to find the road surface forces acting on the tires. conversion factor _a_[.sub]i[/] = (force acting on tires)[.sub]i[/]/(stress values at evaluation points)[.sub]i[/] (1) [.sub]i[/] = up/down, right/left, and forward/backward directions The conversion factor was derived from actual data taken from bench tests performed on the axle parts. In Figure 5, we show a comparison of the calculated and actual forces acting on the tire from the road surface when driving over a sinusoidal projection. Next, we discuss the simulation of irregular road surfaces to assess the durability of axle components. In Figure 6, we show a portion of the data obtained by measuring the irregular road surface using a laser displacement gauge.[.sup](6)[/] In Figure 7, we show a comparison of the calculated and actual forces acting on the tire from the road based on mechanical analysis using the road surface data obtained in Figure 6, and a distribution curve calculated from actual measurements. Figures 5 and 7 show that a correlation exists between the two, and that the analysis model is valid. Figure 5. Force Acting on Tire Driving Over Sinusoidal Projection (Actual and Calculated) Figure 6. Profile of an Irregular Road Surface Figure 7. Tire Force Response and Frequency Distribution 3.2 Stress Analysis Simulation In Figure 8, we show a comparison of actual and calculated stress generated at the R part of the axial root of the spindle when driving over a sinusoidal projection. We found these to be in virtual agreement. Figure 8. Stress Response at Root of Spindle In Figure 9 [figure not reproduced], we show a stress analysis of the knuckle while a car is driving over an irregular road surface. In Figure 10 [figure not reproduced], we show a stress analysis of the knuckle while the car is being turned. This is when maximum stress is being generated at the R part of the axial root of the spindle. The different forces acting on the tire from the road causes changes in the position of maximum stress produced at the knuckle, so additional studies are needed for each vehicle operating mode. In Figure 11, the response data of forces acting on the tire from the road is used to show a response time and stress-frequency distribution curve for stress calculations at the place where maximum stress is generated, which was found assuming a linear alignment of forces acting on the tire. Figure 11. Stress Response and Frequency Distribution Figure 11. cont. 3.3 Simulation To Evaluate Fatigue Life In Figure 12, we show an evaluation of fatigue life using a stress-distribution curve for places where maximum stress is generated while driving over an irregular road. Here, we used a P-S-N diagram to make the evaluation based on cumulative linear wear and tear, and degree of stress damage.[.sup](5)[/] We used a Miner calculation to compensate for values less than the stress limit. In the case of Figure 12, the degree of stress damage in the knuckle is less than 1, and passes the target set. Figure 12. Fatigue Life Estimation Chart 3.4 Approaches Used for Special Conditions In Figure 13, we show the actual and calculated results of stress generated at the R part of the axial root of the knuckle spindles when driving a vehicle over a sinusoidal projection, turning, and braking quickly. A closer concurrence was obtained with turning than with either of the other two, but this may be because the precise tire characteristics, particularly the rigidity along the horizontal axis and road surface ï¿½, cannot be ascertained with any degree of accuracy. Figure 13. Maximum/Minimum Stress at Root of Spindle Provided that there is linear alignment, we found that by integrating various vehicle conditions that we could produce accurate simulated models under dangerous and hard to verify conditions, and even under particularly bad conditions. 4. Conclusion Our research into innovative ways to analyze the component parts in development vehicles included the following: (1) We estimated the road load acting on the components of a moving truck by mechanical analysis, and did a structural analysis of the parts. We tried a systematic approach to evaluate fatigue life, and getting good results, came up with a technology to do analysis based on CAE. (2) We found that the application of this technology was particularly essential in the planning stage while in development and design, and that promoting CAE design (structural analysis) based on expert CAE support contributed enormously to development efficiency. (3) In order to further improve this technology in the future, we concluded that we need to improve how CAE is used and build an engineering database with certain CAE models in mind. Bibliography 1.
