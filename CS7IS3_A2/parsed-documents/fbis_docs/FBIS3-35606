City Administration Backs Yuriy Shoykhet"] [Text] Omsk Mayor Yuriy Shoykhet, dismissed by a recent presidential edict, handed over his powers to his deputy, Valeriy Roshchupkin, yesterday. The city administration collegium, however, does not agree with Boris Yeltsin's decision and intends to demand the creation of a special commission to assess objectively the former mayor's work. According to Nikolay Terekhov, head of the information center under the city administration, the president's edict on Mr. Shoykhet's removal caused total bewilderment among the workers of the city administration and supporters of democratic reforms in Omsk. Yuriy Shoykhet was appointed to the post of mayor by Boris Yeltsin in person right on the heels of the 1991 August putsch largely because of his reputation as a firm opponent of the putschists. The wording of the reasons for the mayor's removal was more than sharp. The edict points out that Yuriy Shoykhet "systematically performed actions aimed at destabilization of the political and economic situation in the city, and repeatedly exceeded his powers." In the meantime, according to information from sources close to the city and oblast administrations, the edict on Shoykhet's dismissal was signed by the president 40 minutes after Omsk Oblast Governor Leonid Polezhayev, who is chairman of the interregional "Siberian Agreement" association, had walked into his office. Mr. Polezhayev was one of Yuriy Shoykhet's main enemies. In particular, the mayor opposed in every way the subsidy-based approach to the shaping of the city budget preached by the oblast administration. Thanks to the oblast administration's policy, food and essential goods prices, subsidized from the local budget in Omsk, are being maintained at a lower level than in the other oblasts in western Siberia. Shoykhet insisted on targeting subsidies at the poor, which would release considerable funds for city and oblast needs. The mayor thought that the policy of the oblast governor had denied the city the funds for civic improvements and the maintenance of city utility systems. According to a staffer in the city administration, "Omsk is choking for want of funds and simply falling apart while low-priced goods are being swept out by visitors from other oblasts." On 27 January, the collegium of the city administration with Yuriy Shoykhet's participation decided to pass a request to Boris Yeltsin to appoint a competent commission of the president's staff to conduct an expert assessment of the Omsk mayor's work. The collegium voiced the hope that the edict may be revoked.
