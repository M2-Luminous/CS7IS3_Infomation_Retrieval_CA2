Satarov, aide to the Russian Federation president, by Vasily Kononenko; date and place not given: "Those Not Signing Accord Treaty Will Not Be Branded `Enemies of the People'"] [Text] The concluding phase of work on the Treaty on Social Accord has clearly run into a holdup. A number of State Duma factions have delivered virtually an ultimatum demanding that their "specific interests" be taken into account. It is possible that this show of dissidence was organized in order to reserve themselves a place on the sidelines of the system, which not everyone in society is greeting with applause. Most likely greater clarity will emerge in this process following the meeting between B. Yeltsin and representatives of Federal Assembly factions. What are expected at that meeting are a speech from the president, a report on the attitude to the treaty of the main political forces and regions, which will be delivered by S. Filatov, leader of the president's administration, and speeches from the leaders of both houses of parliament, and also faction leaders. Nevertheless, the main approaches and stances with regard to this most important document can be seen right now. The president's aide G. Satarov answered the IZVESTIYA correspondent's questions. [Kononenko] Georgiy Aleksandrovich, does it surprise you that only three factions in the State Duma as of today support the treaty, or do you accept it as logical? [Satarov] It is not surprising in the least. The opponents of this document advance no convincing arguments, but they do uphold their own political interests. In other words, it is a matter not of the document's contents but of the factions' attitudes. Just take a look at the similar theses of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR] and the Communists! They say: This agreement represents the preservation of the present regime until the elections. In the language of political scientists this means: It is possible to fight for power right now -- therefore, we will fight for power. [Kononenko] But perhaps these factions' proposals were not taken into consideration? [Satarov] They were all initially agreed on the following approach: No proposals should impinge on the sides' constitutional powers. The LDPR representatives' demand for the removal of six ministers from the government, for example, impinges on the executive's constitutional powers. Therefore they cannot be a subject for discussion. [Kononenko] What is the assumed list of participants in the treaty? [Satarov] It will evidently be signed by the president, the prime minister, the patriarch of All Rus and the leaders of other religions creeds, the leaders of factions and the main trade union organizations and regions, and so forth. [Kononenko] What is the mood in the regions? [Satarov] Judging by the information arriving from the regions, no one disagrees with the document. There is a readiness to sign it without criticism and with the corresponding proposals. These proposals have already been received by the working group. I have not come across anything unacceptable in them. [Kononenko] Can attacks be expected on those who do not give their signatures to this treaty? [Satarov] No one intends to declare them "enemies of the people." Everyone still has a chance to accede to this document.
