FR940919-2-00073 FR940919-2-00044 A DSH, eligible for PHS pricing, must first request that the Office of Drug Pricing include in the PHS drug discount program the outpatient facilities that are included in its Medicare cost report. A list of these outpatient facilities along with Medicaid billing status information must be included with the request. Second, an appropriate official of the DSH must sign a statement that he/she is familiar with HCFA guidelines concerning Medicare certification of hospital components as one cost center, has examined the list of outpatient facilities, and certifies that the facilities are correctly included on the DSH's Medicare cost report. When these facilities are added to the master list of eligible and participating covered entities, the off-site facilities will be able to access PHS discount pricing. On-site clinics that are not included on the Medicare cost report will not be eligible for PHS discount pricing. This information will be posted on the Electronic Data Retrieval System (EDRS), maintained by the Office of Drug Pricing, on a quarterly basis. To access this information, call (301) 594&hyph;4992. DSHs which have questions concerning this process, or manufacturers which have questions concerning the eligibility of certain DSH outpatient clinics, should contact Elizabeth Hickey (301&hyph;594&hyph;4353), at the Office of Drug Pricing. Dated: September 13, 1994. James A. Walsh, Acting Administrator, Health Resources and Services Administration.
