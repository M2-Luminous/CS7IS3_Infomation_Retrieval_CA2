In Oslo, the government consented to set up Palestinian executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government. It agreed to withdraw the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] from all Arab-populated areas in the territories (and not just from Gaza and Jericho). It handed over to the PLO responsibility for security in all areas of withdrawal. It is bringing the "Palestinian Liberation Army" (the so-called "police") into the territories, equipped with armored cars, helicopters, and machine guns, and introducing a multinational force to give this PLO army international cover. And it is letting the PLO fly its flag on the border with Jordan and in the heart of Jerusalem. The real aim of all this is, clearly, not to create autonomy, but to establish a full-fledged state. What will be the results of this policy? We have witnessed an unparalleled deterioration in security since the signing of the Oslo accords and the government's subsequent capitulation to PLO demands. Hardly a day passes without Jews being murdered, wounded or maimed on both sides of the "Green Line." On Wednesday, there was the horror of the massacre in 'Afula, and yesterday the shooting in Ashdod. Accompanying this renewed terrorism is a violent resurgence of the old-style intifadah, with rocks and fire-bombs being hurled in record numbers. But heightened terror and violence does not cover the full extent of the threat to Israel posed by the government's policies. For a PLO state in Judaea and Samaria will not be limited to the West Bank alone. It will be only a matter of time before such a state topples the Hashemite regime in Jordan and incorporates the East Bank into its realm as well. Israel will then be confronting a Palestinian-Islamic state four times its size, one which will have assimilated the Jordanian army into its forces, and which will be forging military pacts with the PLO's allied regimes in Iran and Iraq. As rulers of this state, the PLO will open its gates to millions of Arabs who will claim the "right of return" not only to Judaea and Samaria, but to 'Akko, Yafo and Haifa. The creation of a PLO state will inexorably lead to the formation of an emboldened Arab Eastern Front, stretching from Tehran to Israel's coastal plain. Who can seriously argue that such a neighboring state portends peace for Israel? Indeed, 'Arafat isn't negotiating with Rabin over peace, but over the creation of a Palestinian state, which he says will constitute the first stage in the notorious "phased plan" to destroy Israel. The alternative to the government's policy aims to save Israel from this kind of "peace." It consists of four main elements: -- Israeli sovereign control of the area west of the Jordan River; -- autonomy for the Arabs of Judaea, Samaria and Gaza; -- exclusive IDF responsibility for security in the territories; -- association with Jordan in the final settlement. The gist of the difference between the Likud and the government is that we seek autonomy and not a state, while the government seeks statehood and not autonomy. Autonomy, by definition, isn't sovereignty. It is an arrangement by which a national or religious minority can run its affairs with minimal interference from a central government, which retains such sovereign responsibilities as control of the borders, external and internal security, and foreign relations. Israel would thus continue to be the sovereign power, but it would enable the Arab population to conduct most areas of its communal life. In a final settlement of Arab autonomy under Israeli sovereignty, the overwhelming majority of the West Bank's Arab residents who are currently Jordanian citizens should be able to retain that citizenship. A suitable but necessarily different arrangement would have to be negotiated for the Arabs of Gaza, since, unlike the West Bank Arabs, they possess no citizenship. The idea of the Israeli left, that any minority unsatisfied with mere civic equality and demanding sovereignty should be given an independent state, is patently absurd. Were it widely accepted, Lithuania would have to grant an independent state to its Russian minority, Slovakia to its Hungarian minority, and so on, down the long list of countries which have unhappy minorities embedded within national majorities. Further, if Israel applies this principle to the Arabs of the territories, why stop there? Why not apply it to the Arab minority living inside pre-1967 Israel, the Arabs of Galilee, for example? Such an approach necessarily leads to the resurfacing of the 1947 "Partition Plan," which the PLO says it will press from its West Bank state. Enshrining the idea that the demands of minorities for independence should be met is a surefire path to the dismantling of the Jewish state, and of many other states. Not surprisingly, autonomous arrangements are increasingly being seen as the way to satisfy minorities' aspirations for greater freedom without smashing entire countries into tribal mini-states. I am often asked: Would the Palestinian Arabs accept autonomy? My answer is that they would accept it if they knew Israel wouldn't give them an independent state. This was precisely their understanding when they went to Madrid to negotiate peace with a Likud government. But today, they know there is no limit to what they can get from the supine government in Jerusalem. Thus they have no reason to demand anything less than independence. When the Palestinians know there is a government in Israel that steadfastly refuses to establish a Palestinian state, they will agree to a compromise on autonomy. In such circumstances, important Arab parties preferring autonomy to statehood will undoubtedly emerge. The present government in Jordan would certainly not want to see a PLO state that endangers its future. Equally, Syria and Saudi Arabia are likely to prefer the continuation of King Husayn's nonthreatening regime to a Palestinian state aligned with Baghdad or Tehran. The Rabin government's mad rush to create a Palestinian state in Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza is reminiscent of the Carter administration's peculiar cooperation in the rise of the Khomeyni regime in Iran in 1979. Now as then, the results of such a precipitous policy would be devastating not only for Israel, but for the entire Middle East, and ultimately the entire world. Autonomy under Israeli sovereignty is the only political alternative that can ward off the dangers inherent in the government's bogus "peace" plan. It offers hope for a genuine and durable peace between Israel and its neighbors.
