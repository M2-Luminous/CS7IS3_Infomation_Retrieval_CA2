To advise that, in accordance with Ukraine's Constitution and current legislation, a. The Crimean Republic is an autonomous constituent part of Ukraine and has extensive rights in the sphere of economics, the utilization of natural resources, ecology, culture, the organization of social life, and so on. However, the Crimean Republic, as an autonomous constituent part of Ukraine, has no state sovereignty and cannot establish political relations with foreign states; b. Ukraine's Constitution is effective on the entire territory of Ukraine, including the territory of the Crimea, and the Crimean Republic's Constitution cannot contradict the Ukrainian Constitution; c. In accordance with Article 70 of the Ukrainian Constitution, the territory of Ukraine, including the territory of the Crimea, is unitary, indivisible, inviolable, and integral. Any changes to Ukraine's territory or state borders without the consent of the Ukrainian people are inadmissible. At the same time, as is envisaged in the legislation on the status of the Crimean Republic, Ukraine has no right to make decisions on changing the territory of the Crimean Republic without that republic's consent; d. The Crimean Republic has no citizenship of its own, separate from Ukraine. Citizens of Ukraine who permanently reside in the Crimea are citizens of the Crimean Republic. The Crimea cannot have its own military formations or its own monetary or financial systems separate from Ukraine. That is why, in accordance with Ukrainian legislation, the supreme bodies of the Crimean Republic's power cannot resolve these or other questions that are under the exclusive jurisdiction of Ukraine's authorities. 2. All bodies of state power of Ukraine and of the Crimean Republic, as well as their officials must be guided in their activity by Ukraine's Constitution and laws and also by this present decree. 3. The Supreme Council of the Crimean Republic must, within one month, bring the Constitution and other legislative acts of the Crimean Republic into conformity with Ukraine's Constitution and legislation. 4. The president of Ukraine must ensure the fulfillment of Ukraine's law "On the Ukrainian Presidential Representation in the Crimean Republic." 5. The president of Ukraine and Ukraine's Procurator General must react in time to violations of the Ukrainian Constitution and laws. [Signed] Chairman of Ukraine's Supreme Council I. Plyushch [Issued] Kiev, 24 February 1994
