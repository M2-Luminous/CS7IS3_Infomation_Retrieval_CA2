Dear brothers and sons, soldiers, and officers of the police: It was not strange for the Egyptian police to choose one of the greatest days of national struggle to mark its day and for us to remember the sacrifices of honorable men who gave their lives in the line of duty. They defended their position to the last man to make this day a national holiday for all Egypt, a day that elevates the value of duty, shows the meaning of sacrifice, and emphasizes the determination of a people to stand fast. The steadfastness of a limited number of policemen in Ismailia on 25 January 1952 against the foreign occupation forces and their courageous resistance of the aggression until the end was a glorious chapter in the epic of our national struggle. They stood fast in the face of military forces equipped with all types of heavy weapons. They chose to die defending their small post to show the steadfastness of all Egypt in the face of the occupation's arrogance and violence. They were a splendid symbol of the steadfastness of a nation that rejects submission and surrender. They were an eternal example of a splendid national courage that rejects coercion and violence. They were a true embodiment of a great Egyptian call to defend the dignity and honor of the homeland. The Egyptian police chose this great day in the history of Egyptian patriotism to emphasize the meaning of devotion and sacrifice and to emphasize the commitment of this longtime national institution to the objectives of national struggle. Policemen are a part of the fiber of this people. Their duty is to defend the people's hopes and aspirations; guard the security of every citizen; protect citizens' honor, freedom, and property; safeguard the country's stability; maintain respect for the law; restrain the oppressor; assist the needy; defend society against the evils of outlaws; and fight illegal profiteers, drug traffickers, mishandlers of the people's interests, and those who dare to tamper with the country's security and stability. This sublime and noble message is not easy to carry out. Only those who are able to give of themselves and sacrifice can shoulder its burdens and difficulties, those who are ready to sacrifice for the sake of the country, those who do not hesitate to confront the most difficult dangers to defend the security of every citizen, and those who compete to sacrifice their lives to fulfill their duty. The sacrifices of Egyptian policemen, represented by the events of January 1995, are continuing every day in numerous forms of heroism and sacrifice while defending the people's right to a secure and stable country, which should be not affected by the designs of a deviated and blinded group. This group has launched a war against its country, destroying its economy, undermining its interests, and killing and wounding many innocent victims without any restraint from religion or conscience. Righteous police officers and soldiers have been martyred. They have offered their blood to defend the right of every Egyptian to a safe homeland that protects his present and future. Some of them were martyred in confrontations sparked by the growing criminal inclinations of those groups. Others were treacherously martyred, fired at while going about their daily business only because of their affiliation with a national agency whose primary responsibility is to maintain the homeland's security and stability. Brothers and sons, police officers, and soldiers: I am fully confident that all of Egypt is joining us today as we celebrate a national day associated, in history and meaning, with the sacrifices of honorable men who were, and still are, pioneers in confrontation and sacrifice. They are doing all they can to confront an imminent danger that is laying in wait for the future of the homeland, a danger linked to the conspiracies of known foreign forces that do not want Egypt to have stability or progress, forces that use local individuals and groups whose conscience is blind to the interests of the homeland. Society has discovered the truth of the police prediction made long ago that those groups seek to impoverish Egypt and hinder its progress in favor of foreign forces that want our country to remain burdened with the problems of unemployment, poverty, and a lack of job and investment opportunities so that it will not contribute to human progress. First and foremost, those groups are a tool of sabotage and destruction. Their other role is to block Egypt's democratic march and undermine the achievements of successive Egyptian generations that have struggled throughout history to turn this homeland into a beacon of faith and a torch of science and culture. Their aim is to frighten and force darkness onto the mind of the nation and turn the homeland into a large prison, where there is no place for opposition or debate and no room for divergent views or opinions except under guillotines. The objectives of those groups have been revealed. They rid themselves of any deterrent from religion or conscience and continue with their growing criminal inclination, committing extremely shameful and horrible acts. Their true face has been flagrantly exposed to all: They are merely hired gangs shedding the blood of innocent people and violating the interests of the majority of our silent people. They kill for the sake of killing, unconcerned with the fall of scores of innocent victims. Police officers have never hesitated to confront the groups of terrorists. They have waged the confrontation battle boldly and courageously, enjoying the support of a great nation that has realized the dimensions and dangers of the conspiracy. The people have strongly supported their police officers, protecting their backs, blessing their efforts, and helping them as much as they could. The people have helped chase the culprits and have led police to the dens of saboteurs. At the decisive moments, the people have closed their ranks in calling for uprooting terrorists, who seek to impoverish Egypt, destroy its national economy, and disrupt its security for external goals and do not care about the interests of the homeland or the people. The masses have closed their ranks while paying tribute to victims from the police and the people, openly announcing their decision to confront terrorism, the enemy of God and the homeland, while condemning its abominable crimes and raising their voices against its atrocities, which run contrary to heavenly messages and human values, target innocent victims, and waste the homeland's present and future. This increasing cohesion between the people and the police in the face of terrorist groups shows whoever has vision and insight that terrorism has no future on this good and tolerant soil, that it is inevitably doomed to fail and recede, and that it will remain isolated and besieged until it is uprooted. Terrorism has no future on this ancient land because its abominable deeds and crimes are carried out by aberrant groups that have broken away from the national unanimity. They are at odds with the spirit of the people, run contrary to the people's nature, and undermine their interests. A minority who is isolated from the national mainstream will not be able to humiliate the will of the people or dictate to this noble nation a fate that has nothing to offer but ignorance, despotism, oppression, and poverty. Brothers and sons: The Egyptian people's decision to side with their police marks a decisive development in the confrontation with the phenomenon of terrorism because the security of any homeland cannot be fully and properly attained without cooperation between the people and the police in combating crime, exposing corruption, and uncovering criminals. The awareness of each citizen of his responsibility for the security of the country and his realization of the importance of assisting police officers in their mission will ensure stability in every part of the country, broaden the respect for the law, and keep crime to a minimum. No matter how capable the state may be in intensifying security measures on Egyptian streets, it has limits that are difficult to go beyond. Police cannot put a security guard in every part of the country, but each citizen could contribute toward maintaining the security of the neighborhood he lives in. By doing this we could contain terrorism in limited areas that are easy to narrow down. Cooperation between the police and people is important because of several other factors. The most important factor is that it is the duty of the police to provide security for each Egyptian and that police officers are part of the people and are doing their duty toward their families. We all must remember that security is not just the responsibility of the regime or of those in charge of it. It is also the responsibility of each citizen to help protect his livelihood, honor, children, life, and property. It is the responsibility of society now and in the future. Brothers and sisters. The arm of the state is strong and capable of uprooting the terrorist elements in the quickest time possible. But we do not want to invalidate the rule of the law and we refuse to bypass our national commitment to let our ways and means of combating terrorism remain confined to the framework that protects our democratic choice. Police behavior toward the enemies of the homeland will remain civilized and governed by the rule of law and will remain above the methods of revenge. The police will not punish anyone for a crime committed by someone else but will put the whole matter into the hands of a fair and honest judiciary that is not subject to any authority other than conscience and the law. The recent terrorist incidents that aimed to frighten society and to destroy the homeland's structures could have been the excuse for stringent emergency measures that strengthen the police force's ability to confront the terrorist elements and cut short the time needed for the confrontation. But we refused to do this out of respect for the rule of law, the authority of the judiciary, and human rights. We refused to do so out of belief in the ability of the democratic course to confront terrorism if all the efforts of society combine to confront this phenomenon and the political responsibility of the parties and the national action institutions rise to the level of commitment to the homeland's supreme interests. This great cooperation between the police and the people is now available. The fact is that some of our national parties have taken a step in the right direction. They condemn terrorism and strongly call for eliminating its lairs, causes, and roots. Only some of the enemies of democracy, who still hide behind false slogans that propagate terrorist ideas and actions, have remained outside this national consensus. Brothers, before the referendum on the new term of office, I called for a statewide national dialogue in which all national parties and forces take part in order to define clearly the priorities of national action in light of the circumstances and the challenges that the homeland is going through. My objective from this dialogue -- and it is still my objective -- is to reach a national agreement that will position the issue of security and stability correctly among the national action priorities because society will not have the opportunity to advance along the course of economic or social reform in the absence of stability. Stability is the basis and the support for a democratic and capable homeland that is not distracted from continuing its progress by ambition, the chaos of conflicts, or the struggle between forces. In my comprehensive speech at the recent opening of the People's Assembly's parliamentary session following the referendum, I urged that the objectives of the national dialogue should extend to include a scientific, objective, and comprehensive concept of Egypt's future at the start of the 21st century. My aim has been and still is that this comprehensive concept should lead to a widely based national accord committed to the homeland's supreme interests and rallies the efforts of all forces behind the homeland's strategic objectives about which there can be no argument. The political parties, national forces, public action establishments, intellectuals, and those who care about the homeland's future responded positively to the call for a national dialogue. I believe that this dialogue could be a good opportunity to achieve a comprehensive vision that goes beyond our narrow party interests, places our national priorities in their right place, and draws the dividing lines that no one should go beyond for the sake of protecting this homeland's interests. We are not trying to remove the differences among the various parties, nor do we want to abolish points of divergence in their views and programs. It is in divergent programs and views that the meaning of democracy lies. In essence, democracy is a dialogue between opposing views to attain the truth or agree on common objectives. From this national dialogue, we do not seek to abolish differences in views, but we call for respecting the priorities and principles of the democratic action, which suppose a minimum level of agreement among the various parties on the homeland's high interests when it faces one of its main challenges. Brothers and sons, police officers and soldiers: We are not the only ones suffering from terrorism. In many countries, there are terrorist groups led by disobedient ones, mutineers, and outlaws. Despair eroded their souls, and frozen minds prevented them from keeping up with the developments of the age. They were turned into a destructive force against their homelands. They wanted to obstruct society, antagonize history, and move backward to escape the burdens of the future. But these groups soon disappear without achieving anything. They are scattered remnants that do not represent a basic trend in society. Perhaps the difference between one particular situation and another lies in the ability of each society to prepare itself to confront the phenomenon through firm, unwavering national unanimity--one that does not tolerate ambiguity or compromise, and is not spoiled by a sinful desire to use the situation to achieve small party interests, often at the expense of the society. I do not need to stress the importance of our national consensus on the issue of stability. The message of security and stability is never separable from the message of economic and political construction. Without stability, it is impossible for democracy or the economy to flourish, and it is impossible for us to aspire to a strong state capable of meeting its people's demands. This is the fact that we must keep before our eyes; it is a fact that cannot tolerate denial or one-upmanship. I am confident that the wave of terrorism will recede and vanish in the face of our national consensus and the determination of the great Egyptian people to eradicate this phenomenon. Then, Egypt will continue the march of construction and development, more strongly and vigorously, under a safe and stable umbrella where investment capabilities are redoubled, the tourism boom is restored, new projects are spread over every inch of this homeland, and all efforts are devoted to a fair and continuing development that takes into consideration Egypt's less-developed geographic regions and the slums most in need of services. The wave of terrorism will be broken and will disappear through the sacrifices of the heroic men who offered their dear souls so that this homeland will remain, as it has always been, safe and stable, built by the hands of its virtuous sons--hands that do not know destruction, only construction. The country will continue its message as a beacon of light and culture, with a history that has produced a succession of intellectuals, thinkers, creative people, and esteemed ulema and judges. They have been the conscience of this nation, spreading the values of justice, enlightenment, and support for life. The sacrifices of these martyrs will remain a beacon exuding the values of sacrifice and loyalty, embodying the offerings of brave men who defended the people's right to live, and immortalizing the loyalty of a great people who will continue to remember with gratitude their heroic and innocent sons. Greetings to the policemen who continue to offer sacrifices in defense of the security of every citizen. Greetings to their innocent martyrs who offered their souls to redeem a homeland aspiring to security, stability, and progress. Greetings to other martyr citizens who treacherously fell victim to abominable crimes, including innocent children in the age of flowers, youths who were sources of hope for their relatives and homeland, and ordinary innocent Egyptians. Brothers, the forces of treachery and darkness cannot undermine this high edifice built by the Egyptian people with their sweat, sacrifice, and struggle. The Egyptians have realized great construction and progress, which will not be obstructed by terrorist crimes that the whole people have denounced when they discovered they are seeking to ruin this edifice and squander the homeland's interests. We have agreed on building a free and democratic society that respects the right to disagreement within the framework of a real multi-party system and that gives full opportunity for opinion and counter-opinion. The achievement of this goal has not been easy under the difficult circumstances that could have eroded our nascent democracy. However, we have stood fast and fought. We now have a correct democracy, the course of which is being strengthened day by day. This democracy is based on a multi-party system, a free press, and an independent judiciary. We have agreed on establishing a society capable of fulfilling the people's demands and harnessing their resources. This society is pervaded by mutual confidence and does not deny the opportunity for participation to any citizen. The achievement of this goal has not been easy in a society governed by vestiges and shackles trying to pull it backward and squander its strength. We now have a society capable of shouldering the burdens of the future, a society that opens the doors of participation for whoever wants to enter, and that accepts any contribution that increases its strength and potential. We have agreed to build a society not governed by the complexes of the past. This society looks forward to the future, upholds a just peace, seeks to reclaim its pioneer position in the world, and extends bridges of cooperation to all. The achievement of this goal has not been easy in an Arab and international climate permeated by apprehensions and doubts. We now have an open society that has relations with all states and that plays its vanguard role in the Arab world as a force for justice and solidarity. It spreads the umbrella of peace over the whole region. It lifts Egypt's banners high. We have agreed to build a strong state having a national deterrent force, thus preserving the homeland's destiny and protecting its peace and security. Achieving this goal has not been easy in difficult economic conditions. We now have armed forces capable of undertaking their national tasks, defending peace and participating with rare efficiency in preserving national security and world peace. Officers and men, let us be confident that falsehood will retreat because truth is bound to triumph and falsehood cannot survive in a country full of light, riches, and faith that labors for a better future for its future generations. Falsehood will not stand a chance of surviving in this good and tolerant land. It will remain outcast and isolated and pursued by the people's anger and wrath until it recedes and disappears. The wave of terrorism will retreat and break by virtue of the valiant men's courage and the awareness of a nation that cannot be deceived by falseness and perversion so that Egypt will become again, as it always has, a safe and secure country. This is Almighty God's promise. Peace and God's mercy be upon you. [applause]
