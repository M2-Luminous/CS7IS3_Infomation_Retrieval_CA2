FR940511-0-00070 FR940511-0-00015 Section 925.9 sets forth the procedures for applying for a National Marine Sanctuary permit to conduct a prohibited activity and the criteria governing the issuance, denial, amendment, suspension and revocation of such permits. A permit may be granted by the Director of the Office for Ocean and Coastal Resource Management or designee if he or she finds that the activity will not substantially injure Sanctuary resources and qualities and will: Further research related to Sanctuary resources; further the educational, natural or historical resource value of the Sanctuary; further salvage or recovery operations in or near the Sanctuary in connection with a recent air or marine casualty; assist in the management of the Sanctuary; further salvage or recovery operations in connection with an abandoned shipwreck in the Sanctuary title to which is held by the State of Washington; or promote the welfare of any Indian tribe. In deciding whether to issue a permit, the Director or designee may consider such factors as the professional qualifications and financial ability of the applicant as related to the proposed activity, the duration of the activity and the duration of its effects, the appropriateness of the methods and procedures proposed by the applicant for the conduct of the activity, the extent to which the conduct of the activity may diminish or enhance Sanctuary resources and qualities, the cumulative effects of the activity, the end value of the activity, and the impacts of the activity on adjacent Indian tribes. In addition, the Director or designee is authorized to consider any other factors she or he deems appropriate. Section 925.10 sets forth procedures for requesting certification of leases, licenses, permits, other authorizations, or rights in existence on the date of Sanctuary designation authorizing the conduct of an activity prohibited under paragraphs (a)(2)&hyph;(8) of §925.5. Pursuant to paragraph (f) of §925.5, the prohibitions in paragraphs (a)(2)&hyph;(8) of §925.5 do not apply to any activity authorized by a valid lease, permit, license, or other authorization in existence on the effective date of Sanctuary designation and issued by any Federal, State or local authority of competent jurisdiction, or by any valid right of subsistence use or access in existence on the effective date of Sanctuary designation, provided that the holder of such authorization or right complies with the requirements of §925.10 (e.g., notifies the Director or designee of the existence of, requests certification of, and provides requested information regarding such authorization or right) and complies with any terms and conditions on the exercise of such authorization or right imposed as a condition of certification by the Director or designee as she or he deems necessary to achieve the purposes for which the Sanctuary was designated. Section 925.10 allows the holder 90 days from the effective date of Sanctuary designation to request certification. The holder is allowed to conduct the activity without being in violation of the prohibitions in paragraphs (a)(2)&hyph;(8) of §925.5 with regard to which the holder is requesting certification pending final agency action on his or her certification request, provided the holder has complied with all requirements of §925.10. Section 925.10 also allows the Director or designee to request additional information from the holder and to seek the views of other persons. As a condition of certification, the Director or designee will impose such terms and conditions on the exercise of such lease, permit, license, other authorization or right as she or he deems necessary to achieve the purposes for which the Sanctuary was designated. This is consistent with the Secretary's authority under section 304(c)(2) of the Act. The holder may appeal any action conditioning, amending, suspending or revoking any certification in accordance with the procedures set forth in §925.12. Any amendment, renewal or extension not in existence as of the date of Sanctuary designation of a lease, permit, license, other authorization or right is subject to the provisions of § 925.11. Section 925.11 states that consistent with paragraph (g) of §925.5, the prohibitions of paragraphs (a)(2)&hyph;(8) of §925.5 do not apply to any activity authorized by any valid lease, permit, license, or other authorization issued after the effective date of Sanctuary designation by any Federal, State or local authority of competent jurisdiction, provided that the applicant notifies the Director or designee of the application for such authorization within 15 days of the date of filing of the application or of the effective date of Sanctuary designation, whichever is later, that the applicant is in compliance with the other provisions of §925.11, that the Director or designee notifies the applicant and authorizing agency that he or she does not object to issuance of the authorization, and that the applicant complies with any terms and conditions the Director or designee deems necessary to protect Sanctuary resources and qualities. Where the applicant is the governing body of an Indian tribe, the Director shall consider and protect the interests of the tribe to the fullest extent practicable in keeping with the purposes of the Sanctuary and the U.S. trust responsibility to the affected tribes. Section 925.11 allows the Director or designee to request additional information from the applicant and to seek the views of other persons.
