FR940628-0-00067 FR940628-0-00019 The state agency commented that if piping on plant grounds does not include a device necessary to control pipeline pressure, the jurisdiction of part 195 over the pipeline should not end at the plant boundary. Instead, the state agency recommended ending jurisdiction at a component inside the plant, such as a flange, where the pipeline can be isolated for purposes of testing. Although operators may use such components, part 195 does not require that they be on the pipeline. Also, we believe the plant boundary is a more convenient demarcation of in-plant piping than an unspecific inside-the-plant component. Thus, the state agency's comment is not incorporated in the final definition. The state agency, an operator, and a pipeline-related association were concerned that because segments of transfer piping located off plant grounds were not included in the proposed definition, a large number of short pipelines would come under part 195. RSPA recognizes that production, refining, or manufacturing plants often install transfer piping off plant grounds. A plant may use this piping to transfer hazardous liquids between its different facilities located on the same grounds; between its different facilities located on separate grounds (usually separated by a roadway, railway, waterway, or industrial area); between its facilities and a transportation system, such as a railroad or pipeline; or between its facilities and the facilities of another plant or industrial consumer. The three commenters thought the off-grounds segments should qualify as in-plant piping if they connect facilities of the same plant. The association also wanted to include under the definition off-grounds segments that connect facilities of different plants. In addition, the operator and association argued that the off-grounds segments pose minimum risk to public safety and the environment, because the segments generally are located in industrial areas, roadways, or railways. The association further argued that a plant has the same operational control, including response capability, over the off-grounds segments as it does over piping on plant grounds. In response to these comments, we note that ยง195.1(b)(6) echoes section 201(3) of the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act of 1979 (HLPSA), (49 U.S.C. app. 2001(3)), which excludes certain ``in-plant piping systems'' from regulation under the HLPSA. Since neither the HLPSA nor its legislative history explain ``in-plant piping,'' we adopt an ordinary, reasonable understanding of the term. Therefore, we do not accept the interpretation that the term includes piping that crosses the property of others outside plant grounds. However, many plants are separated by a public thoroughfare, and plant transfer piping crosses the thoroughfare. A single public thoroughfare would include any road, from a country lane to an interstate highway, but it does not include a railroad. Because transfer piping that crosses such thoroughfares is comparable in most respects to other in-plant piping, RSPA considers the in-plant piping exception to include the thoroughfare crossings. The thoroughfare exception does not apply to inter-facility lines or delivery lines, because these lines are distinct from in-plant piping. We did not intend the proposed definition of ``in-plant piping systems'' to expand our present interpretation of the term. So the final definition does not incorporate any of the comments concerning piping located off plant grounds other than for thoroughfare crossings. However, the proposed definition's first use of the term ``pipeline'' is changed to ``pipeline or other mode of transportation.'' This change is needed to include, within the definition, piping on plant grounds that transfer hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide between plant facilities and modes of transportation other than pipeline. Terminal facilities. Part 195 does not apply to the transportation of hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide by vessel, aircraft, tank truck, tank car, or other vehicle, or by terminal facilities used exclusively to transfer hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide between such modes of transportation (ยง195.1(b)(7)). RSPA proposed to amend ยง195.1(b)(7) to clarify that terminal facilities located off terminal grounds are subject to part 195, and to distinguish unregulated terminal facilities from a regulated pipeline entering or leaving the terminal. As with the proposed in-plant piping definition, any device and associated piping on terminal grounds necessary to control pressure in a regulated pipeline would not be excepted from part 195.
