Beilin told reporters in Tel Aviv that Christopher received a detailed Israeli proposal representing official thinking on the nature of the settlement. He had received the Syrian reply, which was very different from Israel's proposal, but was sufficiently detailed to envisage a common denominator between the two sides, he said. Beilin also said there was no serious prospect of development between Israel and Syria without American intervention. Referring to the agreement with the PLO, Beilin stressed 'Arafat's biggest test would be the manner of the entry of the Palestinian police and 'Arafat's ability to stand up to the opposition against him. Israel would not agree to any PLO agreement with Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] enabling Hamas to operate outside the autonomy, because it would be a violation of the agreement.
