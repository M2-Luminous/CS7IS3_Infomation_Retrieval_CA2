Yegor Gaydar, leader of Russia's Choice faction in parliament, said in an exclusive interview to ITAR-TASS. The main directions of the programme of Russia's Choice Party have been defined, Gaydar said. He described it as the programme for the next stage of Russian reform. Gaydar said the main purpose of Russia's Choice Party is to pass on from weak market mechanisms that have just begun to function to a steady market system based on private property. Gaydar believes Russia now has two main strategic problems: The creation of reliable guarantees for property and the easing of the tax policy. He said the simplest truth which the party wants compatriots to understand is that the cutting of state expenditures is the only way to cut taxes. The leader of Russia's Choice Party is aware that it will be very difficult to enlist public support for the implementation of what is planned. He has confidence in the interests of skilled workers in the increase of capital investment in production and of the number of well-paid jobs. The intelligentsia is interested in the preservation of democracy in Russia, and business people are interested in long-term prospects for the activity to form private economy, Gaydar said. He said Russia's Choice Party will have fixed membership, broad freedom in debating tasks and rigid discipline in fulfilling decisions.
