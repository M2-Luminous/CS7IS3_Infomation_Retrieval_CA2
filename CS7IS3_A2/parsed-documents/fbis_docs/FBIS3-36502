"Two hundred years ago Georgia became part of Russia forever as Tiflis [Tbilisi] Province and had no right to secede. For us Georgia is a state that does not exist," Zhirinovskiy told Interfax. He said Georgia should be allowed to exist on its own, "without Russian subsidies, without our assistance." "Let Turkish troops come and show them what Turkish democracy means if they don't want Russian democracy," he said.
