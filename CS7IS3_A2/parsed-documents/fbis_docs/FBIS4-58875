He said: We should not worry about Egypt. Speaking at a meeting with members of the Egyptian community in Jordan before leaving Amman this afternoon, the prime minister said that compared with other countries, terrorism in Egypt is decreasing in a big way. Answering a question, he said that attempts were made over a long period to hold a dialogue with these terrorists at times between 1980 and 1987 or 1988. He added: The dialogue continued in one way or another but they were not ready to listen to the voice of reason and their ideas rendered the dialogue useless. When they started to use bullets and kill, the security organs confronted them decisively and firmly. Dr. Sidqi stressed that achieving a lasting, just, and honorable peace in the region lies at the core of Egypt's policy. He said: Egypt welcomes the Israeli-Palestinian Agreement signed in Cairo on Wednesday on the basis that it is a step toward the comprehensive solution for all the countries in the region.
