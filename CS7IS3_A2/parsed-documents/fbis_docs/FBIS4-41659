Sergey Shakhray Believes That the Situation in the Post-Soviet Space Is Related to Internal Processes in Russia"] [Text] [Vasilyev] Sergey Mikhaylovich, Nursultan Nazarbayev has put forward the idea of creating a Eurasian Union. A few months ago the Party for Russian Unity and Accord [PRUA] published its own draft Confederal Agreement... [Shakhray] Our interest in the problem can be said to be "transparent." First, the party's course toward deepening integration was stated in the PRUA electoral platform, and we think we are obliged to deliver on the pledges given to our voters. Second, these processes are directly related to what is going on inside Russia itself. The Russian Federation is far from indifferent to how our compatriots feel in the "new abroad." And finally, third, entirely new economic and geopolitical foundations have now had time to emerge in order to bring closer together peoples who have traditionally been linked for historical and economic reasons. [Vasilyev] What specific steps are you going to take in that direction? [Shakhray] You probably know that literally a week ago we held a "roundtable" of scientists and politicians devoted to the problems of the new integration within the post-Soviet space. It luckily coincided with the initiative by our Kazakhstani colleagues -- Nursultan Nazarbayev's blueprint for a Eurasian Union. The roundtable brought together representatives of nearly all Commonwealth republics, some delegations were represented by deputy prime ministers and ambassadors. We discussed all sorts of aspects of the emerging integration process. Matters of the legal formalization of these processes and phases of agreed actions were also discussed. Participants in the discussion agreed that only consistent, businesslike, and balanced talks on forging new interstate relations can help set up a rational basis for cooperation, whether it is called a European Union or a Confederal Commonwealth. [Vasilyev] Don't you fear that initiatives of this kind may "explode" the existing Commonwealth of Independent States by proposing in its stead still vague forms of a new, albeit closer, integration? After all, any fruit must be given time to ripen.... [Shakhray] What you call the "fruit" has long been overripe. It is another matter that it would by no means serve our interstate interests to allow processes to unfold outside official collaboration channels. Following up on your metaphorical argument, one might say that the fallen fruit should be picked up by the "right" partners suited for international relations, namely official structures and officials entitled to resolve these matters. I state with the utmost responsibility that the logic of the new unification must fit in with the logic of the development of cooperation within the CIS regardless of whether 5 or 10 states are willing to form the confederation. We insist that the Commonwealth be maintained and enhanced, and we see agreements within the CIS as the sine qua non for holding talks on setting up a confederation. The Russian leadership should finally name official participants in the process so as not to leave this to extremists. This is our first condition. Second, we oppose a rash, "across-the-board" solution to the problem. A decision based on considerations of political expediency. Third, we do not think it possible to hold talks within so "narrow" a circle of participants, even if it is made up of historically and ethnically close countries such as Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia. Russia is more than just an Orthodox country. Moreover, Muslim peoples account for one-third of its population. Here there can be no prior "selection" on the basis of ethnic or political criteria. [Vasilyev] How do you see this future state alliance so far cautiously called a form of "further deepening of integration"? [Shakhray] The initiatives of the PRUA and the Kazakhstani president have sparked an unexpected discussion of the following question: What is preferable -- a confederation or a Eurasian Union? We do not think that these initiatives are in any way opposed to each other. The project of our counterparts from Kazakhstan effectively also entails a confederal form of integration. This is the reason why Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's statement that Russia is certainly ready to hold talks on a confederation, but as for the Eurasian Union plan, it will do so only after "specific decisions are made by parliaments and political leaderships" does not appear valid. The problem lies completely elsewhere: What forms of confederal cooperation are currently acceptable -- economic, political, or security collaboration? Can one set up new confederal structures covering the entire range of interstate relations or not? In that regard, the practice of the current CIS institutions, including its Executive Secretariat, can give us lots of hints. Evidently we should pick and choose among agreements within the CIS that have already been signed: Some of them have already surpassed the level of interstate agreements and evolved into confederal ones without asking for permission; some documents do not work at all; in other areas "virgin territory" from a legal point of view is emerging, and so forth. This expert appraisal of sorts, for starters, will make it possible to single out the legal framework for effective integration and to identify "bottlenecks" and "blank spots" in the treaty foundation. Just as important for the search for the foundation of a confederation is analysis of agreements concluded at the interregional or, if you like, "border" level between the CIS countries. For instance, between Russia's Omsk, Orenburg, Chelyabinsk, Kurgan, Tyumen, and Novosibirsk Oblasts and Altay Kray and Kazakhstani oblasts bordering them; between Russia's Belgorod, Kursk, Bryansk, Rostov, and Voronezh Oblasts and the neighboring Ukrainian oblasts. In many instances these are readymade "prototype" models for the regulation of future relations. It is the border areas closely tied together by the need to pursue a coordinated economic policy, intensive trade, and, in a way, "regional diplomacy" that have brought into being forms of cooperation that come closest to the model of a confederation. Finally, we should make up our mind with regard to medium- and long-term tactics in solving the following problem: Who will be integrated and on what basis, and also when and in how many stages can the integration be carried out? [Vasilyev] Are you also a proponent of giving the economy priority in integration? [Shakhray] Not quite. At present, the new confederation's most urgent task is finding a solution to the problem of crime, which, as is well known, does not recognize borders. The second most important task is to ensure the CIS states' collective security. Economic cooperation sort of "permeates" these clusters of problems, ensuring that urgent economic and financial matters are resolved. In particular, the problem of nonpayments and mutual settlements with the states where the Russian ruble still "operates" has yet to be resolved. Something else that is on the agenda is joint investment in projects of "Eurasian importance," for instance, those same problems of border protection or the struggle against crime. But large-scale economic integration will become possible only when we are able to harmonize the legal foundations of economic activity, which have already "run far away" from each other, and to settle mutual debts. There should be no illusions here. [Vasilyev] To what extent are the CIS countries' new entrepreneurial structures and banking capital interested in the new integration? [Shakhray] There is no need to rack one's brain for examples. For instance, back in April there was an international conference of central and commercial banks of the Commonwealth countries. They called for an Interstate Bank and a payment union within the CIS. They are already drawing up independent proposals on these matters. From this point of view, we should welcome and give every possible support to private and state initiatives by industrialists, entrepreneurs, and financiers objectively aimed at "sewing together" the economic fabric of the CIS countries, which has come unraveled. It is important to support the particular trends that have emerged very recently that I would call manifestations of personal freedom. The new entrepreneurs, new economic managers, and new financial-industrial groups are interested in such integration just as much as those who still feel nostalgia for "the greater homeland." These people born of the new epoch can devise forms of economic integration that cannot be broken by any "iron fist" or someone's nationalist logic. Our multinational working group is ready to cooperate with all business leaders who see integration as something they have a long- term personal stake in. After all, these are the interests of the Russian state. [Vasilyev] What other forms of dialogue at the interstate level could you suggest? [Shakhray] Why shouldn't we suggest that the presidents of our republics -- members of the CIS Council of Heads of State -- set up a new deliberative body at this level modeled on the Presidential Council? Why shouldn't this "CIS Presidential Council" set as its main goal the enhancement of the strategy and tactics of reintegration? Let this council be formed not ex officio, but by mutual consent by those who can really contribute to taking efficient, effective, carefully weighed steps along the path of integration between the Commonwealth countries. In that regard it is important that it include not only public figures, scientists, experts, and analysts, but also industrialists, bankers, and also distinguished mass media leaders, those of them who have already made significant headway in creating a single cultural-information space in the CIS countries. [Vasilyev] At what other levels can the negotiating process also unfold? [Shakhray] This is already happening in reality. Our "roundtable" and a number of other forums devoted to this particular problem held in a whole range of the CIS countries within the past month alone have shown that the main sponsors of the movement are citizens themselves -- members of political parties, public organizations, scientists. If we manage to set up an interstate commission, it will be tasked with preparing an analysis of the entire body of CIS documents with a view to enhancing integration and working out an official stance on forming confederal bodies that will be presented in a report to a CIS summit. Another group that will operate in parallel with the interstate commission is the multilateral working group to be set up in accordance with the results of the "roundtable." It will be assigned the role of a civic expert on confederation matters. We invite representatives of political forces in all the CIS countries, not just Russian public groups, to take part in its activity. A significant number of public action centers have already emerged -- they are reintegration's "spearheads," as it were: the multinational working group, the Eurasian Commonwealth Charter, the "Eurasia 21st Century" project, and others. Given the lack of a coordinating strategy, this multipolar movement is already giving rise to jealous fears that "everyone is beginning to grab more than their fair share of the Eurasian cake." I think that there should be no such fears. As for me, I do not cling to priorities or personal trappings of distinction. It will be good if the multinational working group makes an effective contribution to furthering the ideas of a confederal Eurasian Union, but it will be not bad, either, if the forum called "Toward a New Accord" sends strong impulses in that direction as well. Let us join forces and try to raise our civic, public initiative to an even higher level. [Vasilyev] Kazakhstani President Nursultan Nazarbayev has chosen the idea of Eurasia as the ideological component for the new integration processes. Do you think it will be a sufficient basis for an effective future confederation? [Shakhray] There is no denying that the idea of Eurasia in itself symbolizes the unity of the destinies of the peoples in the current so-called "post-Soviet space." It cannot be ruled out that public opinion might more naturally accept some other integration ideology -- this is still a matter open for discussion. But at present it is clear that Eurasianism, as was the case earlier, has again become the banner of a very difficult, "transition" period. It has yet again reminded us of "the desire for a common cause" typical of our peoples, a desire that tends to awaken at the direst moments of history. Let us hope that this time around the idea will serve as a reminder of common roots, traditions, and joint, fruitful policy.
