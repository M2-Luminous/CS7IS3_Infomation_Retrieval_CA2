FR940705-2-00127 FR940705-2-00090 Tuesday July 5, 1994 Part III Department of Health and Human Services National Institutes of Health Recombinant DNA Research: Actions Under the Guidelines; Notice Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 127␣/␣Tuesday, July 5, 1994␣/␣Notices DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES National Institutes of Health Recombinant DNA Research: Actions Under the Guidelines AGENCY: National Institutes of Health, PHS, DHHS. ACTION: Notice of actions under the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules (NIH Guidelines). SUMMARY: This notice sets forth four actions to be taken by the Director, National Institutes of Health (NIH), under the May 7, 1986, NIH Guidelines (51 FR 16958). FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Additional information can be obtained from Dr. Nelson A. Wivel, Director, Office of Recombinant DNA Activities (ORDA), Office of Science Policy and Technology Transfer, National Institutes of Health, Building 31, room 4B11, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, (301) 496&hyph;9838. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Today four actions are being promulgated under the NIH Guidelines. These four proposed actions were published for comment in the Federal Register announcements of August 11, 1987 (52 FR 29800); April 18, 1988 (53 FR 12752); December 30, 1988 (53 FR 53262); April 29, 1991 (56 FR 19776); November 9, 1993 (58 FR 59612); and February 11, 1994 (59 FR 6702). These proposed actions were reviewed and recommended for approval by the NIH Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RAC) at its meetings on September 21, 1987; December 3, 1988; January 30, 1989; May 30&hyph;31, 1991; December 2&hyph;3, 1993; and March 3&hyph;4, 1994. In accordance with Section IV-C-1-b of the NIH Guidelines, these actions have been found to comply with the NIH Guidelines and to present no significant risk to health or the environment. A revised version of the NIH Guidelines is published in a separate section of the Federal Register following this announcement. These revised NIH Guidelines differ from the previous version promulgated on May 7, 1986 (51 FR 16958) by incorporating within them the major actions to the NIH Guidelines that were promulgated on August 24, 1987 (52 FR 31848); July 29, 1988 (53 FR 28819); October 26, 1988 (53 FR 43410); March 13, 1989 (54 FR 10508); March 1, 1990 (55 FR 7438); September 12, 1990 (55 FR 37565); July 18, 1991 (56 FR 33174); October 15, 1991 (56 FR 51784); November 21, 1991 (56 FR 58800); January 28, 1992 (57 FR 3212); April 22, 1992 (57 FR 14774); August 26, 1992 (57 FR 38734); February 18, 1993 (58 FR 9102); April 23, 1993 (58 FR 21738); September 13, 1993 (58 FR 47906); October 18, 1993 (58 FR 53814); and the changes that are promulgated in this announcement. I. Background Information and Decision on Action Under the NIH Guidelines A. Amendment to Sections II, III&hyph;C, III&hyph;D, V, Appendices C&hyph;I, and G and Addition of Appendix P, Physical and Biological Containment for Recombinant DNA Research Involving Plants, and Appendix Q, Physical and Biological Containment for Recombinant DNA Research Involving Animals of the NIH Guidelines The NIH Guidelines were originally developed to cover research in laboratories in which recombinant DNA techniques were used. It is recognized today that these techniques are being used by scientists working with plants and large animals, and that procedures for containment of these plants and animals have not been specifically described in the NIH Guidelines. Institutional Biosafety Committees (IBCs) have requested guidance on the containment procedures that should be recommended for specific experiments with these organisms since they have the responsibility of approving such experiments under containment appropriate for the organisms. The principles of biological safety that are used to categorize experiments involving microorganisms, for example, are equally applicable to plants and animals. These safety procedures have been employed successfully for many years and have been recognized for their efficacy in biological containment.
