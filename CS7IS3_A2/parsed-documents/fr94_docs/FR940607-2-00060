ACTION: Grant of Variance. SUMMARY: This notice announces the grant of a permanent variance to Envirosafe Services, Inc. from the standard that prescribes procedures to be used in draining and flushing combustible/flammable liquids (29 CFR 1910.106[b][2][viii][ f ]). DATES: The effective date of the variance is June 7, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Hank Woodcock, Acting Director, Office of Variance Determination, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20210, Telephone: (202) 219&hyph;7065 or the following OSHA Regional and Area Offices: U.S. Department of Labor_OSHA, 1111 Third Avenue, suite 715, Seattle, Washington, 98101&hyph;3212 U.S. Department of Labor_OSHA, 3050 N. Lakeharbor Lane, suite 134, Boise, Idaho 83703. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background Envirosafe Services, Inc. ( i.e. , ``Envirosafe'' or ``applicant''), 200 Welsh Road, Horsham, Pennsylvania 19044, has made application pursuant to section 6(d) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. The address of the place of employment affected by this application is: Envirosafe Services of Idaho, Inc., Highway # 78, Missile Base Road, Grand View, Idaho 83624. Envirosafe states that its employees are being provided with employment and a place of employment as safe and healthful as required by 29 CFR 1910.106(b)(2)(viii)( f ) ( i.e. , ``the standard''), which specifies the procedures to be used in draining and flushing combustible and flammable liquids; Envirosafe, therefore, requests a permanent variance from this standard under 29 U.S.C. 655 and 29 CFR 1905.11. The Federal Register notice of September 28, 1993 (58 FR 50568) informed the public that OSHA has received the applicant's variance application. This notice invited interested persons, including affected employers and employees, to submit written comments, data, views and arguments regarding the variance requested. In addition, affected employers and employees were notified of their right to request a hearing on the variance application. No comments or requests for a hearing were received in response to this notification. II. Facts The applicant operates a commercial storage and chemical-waste landfill facility for disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Transformers and other articles containing PCBs received at the facility must be drained and flushed, and the flushed liquid placed into storage tanks. According to the applicant, two of its employees drain transformers containing PCB-contaminated oil into one of the two 10,000-gallon outside tanks. The transformers then are filled with diesel fuel and allowed to sit approximately 18 hours. The diesel fuel subsequently is drained into one of the two outside tanks previously mentioned. It is during this draining and flushing operation that the filling and emptying connections controlled under the subject standard are made and broken. These draining and flushing operations occur within the processing and storage building, as opposed to outside the building as required by the standard. As a result of these draining and flushing operations, a conflict exists between OSHA's requirement 29 CFR 1910.106(b)(viii)( f ) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requirements specified under 40 CFR 761.65(b)(1) concerning the draining and flushing of combustible/flammable liquids. Specifically, the EPA requires that processing and storage facilities for PCBs be located inside enclosed structures to avoid exposure to weather, with specially-designed steel floors to properly drain spills, while OSHA requires that transfer of combustible/flammable liquids_diesel fuel in this case_be accomplished outside enclosed structures. Outside storage tanks used to store the flushed liquid are provided with a continuously-welded steel secondary containment unit that is 30 feet in diameter and 3 feet, 6 inches high. The tanks also are placed on 2-inch x 1/14-inch heavy-duty welded steel grating to allow immediate identification of any leaks from the tank bottom. The secondary containment structure has the capacity to hold 100 percent of the volume of the largest tank within its perimeter plus the volume of water that would be added from a 24-hour rainfall totalling 1.75 inches. Auxiliary equipment ( e.g. , pumps and pipelines systems serving the tanks) also is above ground and subject to daily visual inspections. All pumps and disconnect units are within the processing/storage building (the ``processing building''), which has a welded steel floor for containment.
