Robert Bykov, consultant for the CIS Joint Armed Forces Headquarters business manager, told MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS' correspondent that the Finance Ministry proposes abolishing free medical services for reserve officers and retirees (approximately 1.3 million people); compulsory insurance of officers' property; interest-free loans to military school graduates (at a level of 12 monthly salaries); and interest-free loans to officers for housing construction (including for military servicemen and participants in the Chernobyl cleanup operation). The Finance Ministry also proposes that retiring officers be paid the equivalent of not 20 but only five salaries. The Finance Ministry is planning to submit these proposals to today's government session devoted to approving the 1994 budget.
