FR940831-1-00002 FR940831-1-00001 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Commodity Credit Corporation 7 CFR part 1425 RIN 0560&hyph;AD70 Cooperative Marketing Associations; Eligibility Requirements for Price Support AGENCY: Commodity Credit Corporation, USDA. ACTION: Proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) is proposing to amend the regulations governing the participation of cooperative marketing associations (CMA) in CCC price support programs to ensure: the equitable treatment of CMA members and individual producers; the Government does not accept undue risk in providing CMA price support program benefits; and the efficient delivery of CMA price support program benefits. This proposed rule: changes CMA bylaw requirements to reflect current CMA organizational and operational procedures; requires approved cotton CMA retention of services provided by servicing agent banks; requires approved CMA monitoring of payments they receive on behalf of their members to ensure that member payments do not exceed payment limits; and makes other administrative changes. DATES: Written comments must be received on or before September 30, 1994 in order to be assured of consideration. ADDRESSES: Send comments to Director, Cotton, Grain, and Rice Price Support Division, Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service (ASCS), U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), P.O. Box 2415, Washington, DC 20013&hyph;2415. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Richard M. Ackley, Chief, Cooperative and Analysis Branch; Cotton, Grain, and Rice Price Support Division, ASCS, USDA, P.O. Box 2415, Washington, DC 20013&hyph;2415. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Executive Order 12866 This proposed rule has been determined to be significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866 and, therefore, has been reviewed by OMB. Federal Assistance Program The title and number of the Federal Assistance Program, as found in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance, to which this rule applies are Commodity Loans and Purchases_10.051. Regulatory Flexibility Act It has been determined that the Regulatory Flexibility Act is not applicable because CCC is not required by 5 U.S.C. 553 or any other provision of law to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking with respect to the subject matter of these determinations. Environmental Evaluation It has been determined by an environmental evaluation that this action will have no significant impact on the quality of human environment. Executive Order 12372 This program is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. See the Notice related to 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V, into Federal Register at 48 FR 29115 (June 24, 1983). Executive Order 12778 This proposed rule has been reviewed pursuant to Executive Order 12778. To the extent State and local laws are in conflict with these regulatory provisions, it is the intent of CCC that the terms of the regulations prevail. Prior to any judicial action in a court of competent jurisdiction, administrative review under 7 CFR part 780 must be exhausted. Paperwork Reduction Act The information collection requirements for CMA participation in the price support program on behalf of their members have been approved for use by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) through March 31, 1996, and assigned OMB No. 0560&hyph;0040. The amendments to 7 CFR part 1425 set forth in this proposed rule impose new or revised information collection requirements in monitoring the application of statutory payment limitation provisions to members of CMA when the CMA participates in CCC price support program on behalf of their members. ASCS will submit an addendum to OMB to revise the information collection supporting statement for OMB No. 0560&hyph;0040. Public reporting burden for all collections is estimated to average from 1 to 2 hours per response, including time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and competing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to the Department of Agriculture, Clearance Officer, OIRM, P.O. Box 7630, Washington, DC 20250&hyph;0001; and to the Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project (OMB No. 0560&hyph;0040), Washington, DC 20503. Background CMA participation in CCC price support programs on behalf of their members must be approved by CCC. When approved, a CMA may participate in price support programs in much the same way as individual producers. The regulations at 7 CFR part 1425 contain the requirements for CMA participation. This proposed rule amends those requirements. In a previous amendment, canola, flaxseed, mustard seed, rapeseed, safflower, and sunflower seed were added to the list of authorized commodities for which a CMA may apply for price support. However, these additional commodities were inadvertently omitted from §1425.3(d). This proposed rule revises §1425.3(d) by adding these commodities to the list of authorized commodities. Regulations are being prepared to authorize price support for shorn mohair and shorn wool to individual producers. This proposed rule adds these commodities to the list of authorized commodities for an approved CMA in §1425.3(d). This proposed rule adds a new §1425.3(i) to provide that an approved CMA may receive loan deficiency payments, when applicable, on behalf of its members. This reflects an earlier decision to allow an approved CMA to obtain loan deficiency payments on behalf of its members in the same way individual producers participate in price support. This proposed rule defines, by reference, the terms ``person'' and ``producer'' by amending redesignated §1425.3(j) and (k) using the definitions contained in part 1413 of this title. These are the same definitions used for individual producers participating in various price support programs. This proposed rule revises §1425.4(a) to indicate that a CMA must apply to ``participate in a price support program'' as defined in added §1425.3(i). This proposed rule revises §1425.4(b)(7) to change the reference from §1425.17 to §1425.18. The CMA annual recertification requirement is currently contained in the title to §1425.5(c). This proposed rule places that requirement in the text of §1425.4(c). An approved CMA may alter its organizational structure or operations after its initial approval in such a way to affect compliance with this regulation. This proposed rule adds §1425.4(e) to require an approved CMA to resubmit complete ``initial'' applications every 5 years, or more often, as required by CCC. The information submitted will be used to evaluate the continued compliance with these regulations by each approved CMA.
