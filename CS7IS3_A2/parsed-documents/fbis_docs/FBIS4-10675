Puertas] [Text] Guadalajara, Mexico, 12 Apr (AFP) -- The new Venezuelan Government has designed an economic program that will help overcome fiscal and financial difficulties in the short run and establish the bases for a sustainable growth with decreasing inflation, Venezuelan Finance Minister Julio Sosa Rodriguez said on Tuesday in Guadalajara. Speaking to the 35th Annual Assembly of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) which is being held in this Mexican city, the Venezuelan minister assured that his government will only apply "the most orthodox mechanism of healthy macroeconomic management, that is, it will finance the deficit through higher domestic taxing and expense reduction." Sosa's speech generated great expectations among the representatives of the international financial community who are attending the IDB assembly, because of the uncertainty, created by the inflation and fiscal deficit, that President Rafael Caldera found when he was inaugurated in February. Several bankers described his speech as "positive" and "encouraging." Sosa Rodriguez listed five guidelines for his strategy: adequate macroeconomic management, comprehensive tax reform, an economic stabilization program, promotion of domestic and foreign investment, and continuation of economic opening through free exchange agreements with its commercial partners. The effort will be supported by reaching a consensus with the labor and business sectors in order to voluntarily restrain price increases during the transition to the economic structure proposed by the government. He described it as "a competitive economy with social justice." As for the assembly's agenda, Sosa Rodriguez said that he was pleased with the $40 billion increase in IDB capital, but complained about a lack of generosity on the part of non-borrowing members reflected by their contributions to concessionary [concesionales] funds used to assist countries that have lower revenues. He pointed out that although there was an agreement to reduce their contributions [participacion accionaria] to non-regional countries, Latin America and the Caribbean have had to bear a higher financial burden in its contributions to the bank. "[Word indistinct] the financial difficulties of non-borrowing countries, but they cannot be compared to the fiscal restrictions facing other countries of the region," the Venezuelan minister added. He made it clear that Venezuela does not support one of the commitments included in the agreement to increase resources, that is, the capitalization of various funds through the transfer of net revenues produced by regular capital. This mechanism will increase financial charges on loans and will recycle resources within the region rather than channel additional resources into it, he pointed out.
