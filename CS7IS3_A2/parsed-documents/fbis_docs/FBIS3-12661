If the world Muslims gave only one-tenth of the importance that the Islamic Republic gives to the Bosnian Muslims, and if the governments of other Islamic countries possessed only one-hundredth of the resolute will that our Islamic system has in its attitude toward the conditions of Muslims in that country -- as well as Muslims in Palestine and other parts of the world -- then the situation in Bosnia, or for that matter Palestine and other parts of the Islamic world would have been totally different today. It is because of indifference that we have this situation today. In particular, during this auspicious month of Ramadan, the great number of preachers who deliver so many Friday prayer sermons in so many great and splendid mosques throughout the vast land of Islam must undertake efforts to make the people aware of their issues and inform them about what the world is doing to them: that is that world arrogance is taking control of some Muslim countries while at the same time attempting to bring the rest of them under its control too. It is one of our duties to make people fully aware of such matters. [passage omitted]
