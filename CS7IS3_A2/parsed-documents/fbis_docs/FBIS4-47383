Based on one-degree grid elevation values, lengths of various topographic isolines were computed for seven grades of averaging. The perimetric method is used to determine that at the 100-2000 km scale the relief isolines are actually fractal lines with dimensions which substantially exceed unity (1.30 and above). Several additional considerations make it possible to expand these limits to 5 and 20,000 km. The dimension of isolines depends on their hypsometric position. A simple model is proposed which illustrates the mechanism of this scale-dependent self-similarity of relief contours at different scales. Figures 6; references 9: 2 Russian, 7 Western.
