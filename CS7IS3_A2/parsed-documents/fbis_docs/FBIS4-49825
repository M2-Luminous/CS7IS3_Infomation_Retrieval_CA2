Every day more than 400 people come to the Bureau of Telecommunications to apply for installation of phones. An official of the bureau noted that the number of applicants peaked at 1,900 one day. Experts attributed this tendency to the increase in people's income in the past decade. On average, the cost for a telephone line for a private home is about 5,000 yuan. Ten years ago, people would naturally regard the person with a home telephone as a leader or a celebrity. But now things are quite different, and telephones have entered common people's homes. From the mid-1980s on, Shenyang has invested a lot of money to introduce automatic telephone exchanges, program-controlled telex switching equipment, mobile telephone systems and radio tracking systems from Belgium, Sweden, and Taiwan. The telecommunications network in Shenyang became program-controlled last year, and its capacity has been expanded to 420,000 lines. From the beginning of the 1990s, applicants for telephone installations in Shenyang have multiplied year after year. In 1993, those who applied for prIvate telephones aCcounted for 80 percent of the total applicants. From 1990 to 1993, the number of telephones installed each year was 13,000, 20,000, 40,000 and 100,000. But the rate of installation is still far lower than that of the increasing number of applicants for private telephones. Now there is a telephone for every ten people in Shenyang, said the official. Private telephones have become popular because of the convenience they bring. On the first day of the spring festival, more than 600 people extended greetings to relatives abroad by telephone from their homes. This year, Shenyang will enlarge its telephone capacity by an added 377,000 lines and install 150,000 telephones for citizens. The city will also construct and reconstruct 10 urban telephone service bureaus. By 1995, the total telephone lines in the city will reach 1.15 million or a telephone for every five people.
