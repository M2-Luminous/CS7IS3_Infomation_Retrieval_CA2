Bekes; place and date not given: "Bela Kadar on the NGKM's Four Years -- We Will Repeat Our Forefathers' Country-Renewing Activities"] [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Bekes] You have been leading the Ministry of International Economic Relations [NGKM] for four years. During this time, the activities of the ministry have been repeatedly attacked from time to time, now again by the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ]. Certain opposition politicians have stated that the NGKM should be wound up. What are your views on these accusations? [Kadar] I have indeed been heading the NGKM's activities as minister since 1990 in implementing the change of the foreign economic system and emphasis, and the tasks of opening up the economy to the world. According to international assessments, Hungary has solved these problems more successfully than some other countries in the same situation. This is reflected in the essential elements of our economic diplomacy negotiations, in our foreign trade performance, in the number of enterprises by foreigners -- some 1,800 foreign ventures were operating in Hungary at the end of 1989 and 19,000 at the end of 1993 -- capital investment -- at the moment, foreign capital investment in Hungary exceeds $7 billion, which is 60 percent of the foreign capital invested in the East- Central European region -- and, in general, in the smooth operation of the ministry. After all this, I wonder why certain political forces and politicians, who are noticeably annoyed about the country's successes, have been wanting to eliminate the NGKM with a stubborn consistency. We are now dismissing the statements that are made regularly every month, showing that those who make them want to eliminate a professional culture. Even the most obstinate of these people have to admit that the ministry is doing a good job and its elimination would not result in budget savings. Therefore, "just because" remains the most convincing reason for eliminating the ministry. It is especially interesting to hear this from those who had very different views on this issue a few years before the elections. [passage omitted] [Bekes] Can you please give a general assessment on Hungary's foreign economic performance over the past four years? [Kadar] It should never be allowed to assess the foreign economy on the basis of subjective views because statistical information is available. As a result of the change of the regime, the U.S. dollar value of exports of the former CEMA countries was reduced by 10 to 60 percent between 1989 and 1992. In that period, only Hungary of the former socialist countries managed to exceed the peak export level of the 1980's. The exceptionally long Western recession, the decrease in Russian imports, the consequences of the south Slav [Yugoslav] war, and a Hungarian economic policy that had very little support for the foreign economy, caused a halt to the Hungarian export offensive in 1993. Our exports calculated in U.S dollars decreased by 17 percent. The export-stimulating measures taken by the Hungarian Government in September 1993 have brought the improvement of the economy's competitiveness to the forefront. As a result of this, the 27-percent fall in the first half of 1993 had finally been dampened by the end of the year. In my view, the assumption is not without basis that these -- rather limited -- measures, in addition to slowing the decrease in 1993, have actually helped exports to start to increase in the first quarter of 1994. The fact is that certain members of the mass media who only yearn for bad news do not even bat an eyelid in saying that it is all success propaganda when I note that monthly exports in dollars exceeded the monthly average of the first three quarters of 1993 by 15 percent in November and 20 percent in December 1993. [passage omitted] [Bekes] You have said it many times -- also at the Uruguay Round of the GATT talks -- that the central axis of the world economy has moved away from Europe. What are the prospects of Hungarian foreign trade in the Pacific region and what can we expect on the traditional European markets? [Kadar] For almost two decades, Hungary has been struggling with the problem that the focal point of the world economy and world trade increases have been shifted further away from Hungary to countries in the Pacific and the Far East. The resources and experience of the new domestic foreign trade salesmen and entrepreneurs do not yet make it possible for us to rely more on the Far Eastern markets, which are expanding more rapidly than the average. Naturally, Hungarian foreign economic policy has already been doing all it can to promote this, but we must not forget about the realities. In Hungarian foreign trade, the proportion of foreign economic cooperation with the world's most dynamically developing area will for a long time continue to reach only a few percent. Our place is in Europe. Some 90 percent of Hungarian foreign trade is with the countries of old Europe. In this area, it is a positive result that, except for Serbia and Montenegro, we managed to halt the decrease in turnover with our neighbors in 1993. In Russia and the CIS countries, the general crisis and slump are still having their effects. In the near future, we will extend our system of free trade agreements to Slovenia. We also assume that the improving economic situation in Western Europe, the lifting of the market restraints affecting Hungarian goods, and our free trade agreements will contribute to an increased Hungarian foreign economy and exports. The current major proportions show that, in 1993, some 47 percent of our exports went to the countries of the European Union [EU] and 14 percent to the countries of the European Free Trade Association [EFTA]. Our free trade agreement with EFTA has been in force for six months now. If the EU accepts Austria and the Scandinavian countries as members in 1995, nearly two-thirds of Hungary's exports will be going to the EU. This clearly indicates to what the Hungarian economy and society must adjust. [passage omitted]
