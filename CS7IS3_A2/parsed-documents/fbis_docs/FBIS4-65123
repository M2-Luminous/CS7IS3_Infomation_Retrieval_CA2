The post of under secretary to the prime minister -- which was once filled by [former Prime Ministers] Giulio Andreotti and Giuliano Amato -- will very soon be occupied by the tireless navigator of the sea of Italian politics, the soloist of drawing room diplomacy, the Second Republic's great chamberlain. Nobody is better qualified to guide the inexperienced prime minister along the insidious paths of the former party empire. Letta knows all its inhabitants, and, for all of them, he had a word of praise, a compliment, a piece of flattery. From Abruzzo, just turned 59 (precisely on the day when the new parliamentarians took up their duties), Gianni Letta started busying himself very early in life. If, at home, he was the second of lawyer Vincenzo Letta's eight children, at the Avezzano lycee he was top of the class. At 18, he decided to earn his own living and applied for a job at the Torlonia sugar mills. He was hired as a laborer. The following year he had joined the administrative staff. Two years later he was promoted to manager in the chemistry department. However, Letta was more interested in newspapers than in sugar. He started sending articles to IL TEMPO in Rome, and was immediately noticed. They gave him a post in Aquila, then in the Rome office, and his rise continued . A career like many others -- until Renato Angiolillo appointed him editorial secretary. This was a key position: In fact, young Letta became the mouthpiece of the newspaper's founder-director-chief editor. As Angiolillo grew older, the young man rose higher: executive officer, managing director, and finally director. Once at the top, he looked around and developed a passion for electronic media: television. There was not a single debate of which he was not a protagonist, not a single round table which could start without him. Letta quietly disseminated his moderate common sense. Only once did he lose his temper, on [Fininvest talk-show host] Costanzo's show. During a debate on heart transplants, he and professor Azzolina exchanged some scathing remarks (a long survey on heart transplant followed in several issues of IL TEMPO). When he was not appearing on TV, Letta spent his evenings in Maria Angiolillo's (the wife of IL TEMPO's founder) living room, where the capital's most powerful men -- including Andreotti, Rumor, Bisaglia, and Fanfani -- have met for the past 30 years. Yet, late at night, Letta never failed to visit the editorial office: Not a single item was published without his approval. Legal problems also arose at one point: Cornered into a tight spot, Ettore Bernabei told the judges that he had handed over 1.5 billion lire in CCT's [treasury credit certificates], which had been taken from the IRI's [Institute for Industrial Reconstruction] hidden funds. Letta shrugged his shoulders: "The IRI was funding a promotional campaign. How could we know the money was dirty?" However, the newspaper was beginning to misfire, and its director decided the moment had come to quit. However, his holiday did not last for long. Three months later Silvio Berlusconi appointed him as his ambassador to the political elite in Rome. They had a clear-cut agreement: Berlusconi had only one friend, called Bettino [Craxi]; Letta had to take care of the others. He did very well at his job. He was the discreet manager of the Fininvest counteroffensive over the Mammi law [on broadcasting], suffering, over each of Veltroni's amendments which was passed. Then, when Berlusconi tried to turn the Mondadori publishing house into an empire, Letta acted as an ambassador with LA REPUBBLICA's besieged staff. It was at his home that Berlusconi and Scalfari first met, on the evening when LA REPUBBLICA's chief editor told Berlusconi: "Let us address each other informally. Otherwise I cannot discuss an agreement." This was one of the few battles that Berlusconi did not manage to win. Within Fininvest he behaved with skillful tact. He did not ask for anything for himself, he did not ever show himself in the editorial offices, he only appeared in the studios for his own show ("Italy Asks"), until the Rome public prosecutor requested his arrest over the frequency scandal. The Court of Cassation blocked the arrest, but Letta himself decided to suspend his broadcasts. He remained behind the scenes also during Berlusconi's drive to enter the political scene (which Letta had advised him against doing), although he acted as a "guarantor" for Fininvest's polling information. Few were aware of this, apart from Giuliano Ferrara, who saw his last-minute appeal to vote for Berlusconi censored. Last famous words: "I like to watch and judge politics, rather than experience them from within." As from next week, you will find him at Palazzo Chigi.
