In his opinion, during a visit to coal regions of the country at the end of last year Gaydar managed to realise the situation in the coal industry after which documents were signed to ease critical tension in miners' collectives. A mechanism of interaction between the government and miners was found and Gaydar took a great deal of responsibility in the realisation of this mechanism, Kislyuk said. "The resignation of the first vice-premier makes miners doubt that their interests will be understood by the government," he said.
