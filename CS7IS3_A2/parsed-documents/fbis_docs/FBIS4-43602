Parliament capped an eight-hour debate yesterday by voting 163 to 6, with six deputies casting blank ballots, to try Mr Mitsotakis before a special 13-member court. "If you can legally and morally support (this action) and believe it will benefit you politically, then continue this political persecution," the former premier told the 300-seat chamber. "What you decide leaves me cold and indifferent." He added that the charges were part of a political vendetta against him by his political nemesis, Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, and warned that the decision to place him on trial would backfire against the socialists. Immediately following Mr Mitsotakis' speech, the 111 conservative New Democracy deputies walked out of the session and did not vote.
