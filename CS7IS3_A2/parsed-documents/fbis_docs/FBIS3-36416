And it cannot be a state body because there may not be two representative bodies in one republic." For its part, "Ukraine," an association of 40 public organizations and political parties, has come out with a statement on the Crimean events which says in particular that the election of a Crimean president is a violation of Ukraine's constitution and a way of "dragging Ukraine into a restored Russian empire." The statement suggests that the Ukrainians and Tatars living on the peninsula are being subjected to tough discrimination. The association called on the Ukrainian president, Supreme Soviet, and law enforcement bodies to "give a proper assessment of the actions by the Crimean separatists and take adequate measures to restore law and order in the whole state."
