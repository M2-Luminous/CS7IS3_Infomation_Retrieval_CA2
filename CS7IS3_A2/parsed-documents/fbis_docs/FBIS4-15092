The agreement provides for the return of Georgian refugees and displaced persons to their homes in Abkhazia. Speaking at the Georgian Embassy in Moscow on Tuesday, Kavsadze said the two sides had agreed on further measures aimed at bringing a negotiated settlement to the conflict. The four party commission (Georgia, Abkhazia, Russia and the U.N.) is to hold its first session to discuss the refugee issue in Sochi on April 8, Kavsadze said. The negotiators are expected to decide on whether to send peacekeepers to the region at the next round in Geneva on April 12. The future of Abkhazia will be the subject of discussion in Geneva on April 19. International lawyers will also attend.
