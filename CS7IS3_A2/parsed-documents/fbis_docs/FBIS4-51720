Seen as a follow-up to the historic visit by Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed last July to the eastern European state, Datuk Sri Najib will formally establish military ties with Albania under a memorandum of understanding, MOU, to be signed the following day. Datuk Sri Najib is flying from Stockholm for the first leg of his visit to Sweden, Albania, and Croatia when he will meet Malaysian troops. He will also establish closer rapport and Islamic cooperation with his majority Muslim states. Albania has 3.3 million people, more than 80 percent of them Muslims. According to the minister's press secretary Zulkifli Ali, Datuk Sri Najib will hold a dialogue session tomorrow with Albanian religious leaders in a Tirana mosque, built in 1793 situated in the heart of the state capital. Like previous official visits by Malaysian leaders, Datuk Sri Najib is also expected to take the opportunity from his stay to explore business opportunities for Malaysians to venture in the redevelopment process of Albania.
