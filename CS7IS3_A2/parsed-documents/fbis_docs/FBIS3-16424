He told INTERFAX that "contacts and even collisions" with U.S. submarines off the Russian coasts had been registered last year. The submarines were most active off the Kola Peninsula and the Russian Far Eastern Maritime Territory. Kasatonov said that "the U.S. subs have not left those areas. On the contrary, they show vigor and enviable tenacity." According to Russian Navy experts, "foreign countries have retained the formations of their surface ships and submarines," Kasatonov emphasized. "This compels the Russian military to act so as to protect Russia's safety," Kasatonov said. He denied that Russian submarines were prowling off Florida.
