At the conclusion of the bilateral meeting between both nations, their foreign ministers pointed out that "as of today, the process to influence the U.S. decision to lift the blockade," in the short term, "could be initiated." At the meeting chaired by Foreign Secretary Manuel Tello and his Canadian colleague, Andre Quellet, the latter expressed his government's interest in the Chiapas incidents -- particularly those that have to do with human rights -- and the process of political and electoral democratization. He also said: "Canada has always been interested in these matters, as a friend, and following the initiation of NAFTA, we are also interested as partners." Quellet had the opportunity to discuss both issues during the meeting as well as at an afternoon meeting with President Carlos Salinas de Gortari at Los Pinos. There he manifested his acknowledgement of the open and peaceful manner in which the Mexican Government has handled such a difficult problem while he "encouraged" the Mexican authorities to "continue on the road of negotiations already started." At the conclusion of the meeting -- which included five members of the Canadian Cabinet, as well as Carlos Hank Gonzalez and Emilio Gamboa Patron, secretaries of agriculture and hydraulic resources and of communications and transportation, respectively -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretian's visit was announced for 23-25 March. This will be the first bilateral visit by that official to a nation in the Western Hemisphere since he took office several months ago. Tello announced at the start of the meeting that the political geography of our region has determined that Mexico and Canada pass from the category of "distant friends" to "strategic partners." Together with the United States, he indicated, we will form the most important economy and trade area in the world. During a news conference both foreign ministers took up the Cuban issue. The Canadian said, we think that the situation on the island is more difficult every day for the people who no longer receive aid from the former Soviet Union or from the former socialist bloc nations. Mexico and Canada, Quellet added, continue their cooperation in the health sector and in food supply to help mitigate the situation as much as possible. In our opinion, however, the trade blockade must be solved by the United States. Quellet emphasized that both nations have maintained their ties with Cuba and "the time has come" for that nation's rapprochement with the United States. He gave as an example that "former enemies" such as Washington and Moscow have overcome their problems and now their relations are on another level. He remarked that the same way the United States "turned around" the Vietnam problem and they normalized their relations with China, it is now also time to lift the economic blockade of Cuba. Tello indicated that only Canada and Mexico have maintained relations with the Caribbean nation after it was ousted from the OAS while both nations have voted at international forums in favor of ending the embargo against Havana. Canada and Mexico, Tello stressed, do not accept that a third nation regulate the manner in which they realize their trade relations. Tello was asked: "Some nations speak out in favor of Cuba but they condition it to its `democratization.' What is your opinion?" "We do not condition our position on anything," Tello replied. Meanwhile, the Canadian minister made official his country and Mexico's support for Colombian President Cesar Gaviria's candidacy as OAS general secretary. During his speech delivered in the morning, Quellet explained that his nation's main foreign policy goals are to consolidate and strengthen democracy and to protect human rights. On these issues, he remarked he was greatly impressed by the Mexican Government's efforts to guarantee credibility and transparency in the August presidential elections. With regard to the human rights issue, Quellet said he had met with the Jorge Madrazo Cuellar, president of the National Human Rights Commission [CNDH], with whom he discussed the Chiapas problem. Madrazo Cuellar handed over the report the Commission recently published on the incidents in Chiapas. Quellet said: It is a very thorough report which we will widely disseminate in Canada. In addition, he announced that the CNDH president had been officially invited to visit his country shortly. Among the agreements reached in this 10th Bilateral Mexico-Canada Meeting, stand out the signing of three memoranda between Mexico's Secretariat of Communications and Transportation and Canada's Transportation Ministry with regard to trailer trucks border access, the mutual acceptance of federal driver's license, and of technical training. The participants reconfirmed the importance of strengthening this mechanism of consultation and analysis that allows -- in an overall fashion -- the taking up of the main issues on the bilateral agenda while they agreed to meet in Canada next year.
