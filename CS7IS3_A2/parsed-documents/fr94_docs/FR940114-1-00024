FR940114-1-00024 FR940114-1-00008 Proposed Guideline # 20: Occupant Protection When the original highway safety program standards were established by NHTSA and FHWA, an occupant protection program was not among them. Although lap and shoulder belts have been required for front outboard positions and lap belts for all other seating positions in all passenger cars sold in the U.S. after January 1, 1968, belt usage remained very low through the 1970's. In 1970, under the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations, FHWA required drivers of commercial motor vehicles in interstate commerce to use a safety belt if it was installed in the vehicle. During the 1980's, States participating in MCSAP adopted this requirement for commercial motor vehicle drivers in intrastate commerce. During the 1970's, a national Highway Safety Needs Study indicated that significant reductions in highway losses could be achieved with increased public use of occupant protection devices. NHTSA began to explore promotional activities to encourage the public to buckle up. In 1982, the agencies issued a final rule which identified six National Priority Program Areas that were considered the most effective in reducing highway deaths and injuries. Occupant Protection was included as one of the six most effective programs. Although the agencies never issued a highway safety program standard or guideline, occupant protection has remained a National Priority Program Area. Recognition of the importance of this program increased substantially during the 1980's with evidence that safety belts are effective in preventing death and serious injury in 40&hyph;50 percent of all crashes; passage or upgrading of child safety seat usage laws in every State; passage of safety belt use laws in a majority of States; major increases in funding at the Federal, State and local levels; and significant increases in occupant protection use rates. The agencies have conducted two subsequent rulemakings to review the effectiveness of the Priority Program Areas. No comments have been received from the public suggesting that the area of occupant protection should be deleted from the list of National Priorities. The life-saving benefits of occupant protection programs are now widely recognized. The proposed Occupant Protection program guideline has been prepared to provide current information on effective program elements for States to use in producing and assessing their programs. The proposed guideline reflects the experience of States in program content and highlights state-of-the-art knowledge in highway safety programs relating to occupant protection. The guideline sets forth recommendations for effective management and evaluation of occupant protection programs, legislative initiatives and employment policies mandating use of occupant protection devices, strategic efforts to enforce use laws and policies, public information efforts to reinforce use laws or policies and to inform the public of enforcement efforts, and education programs to promote occupant protection through various organizations including health and medical groups, schools, and employers throughout the State. Proposed Guideline # 21: Roadway Safety When the original 18 standards were established under the Highway Safety Act of 1966, FHWA was responsible for developing and implementing programs relating to the roadway environment. Thus, Standards 9, 12, 13, and the roadway-related aspects of Standard 14 (Pedestrian Safety) fell under FHWA's purview. In 1981, when FHWA and NHTSA identified six highway safety program areas which were considered the most effective, and thus designated National Priority Program Areas, one of the six was FHWA's Safety Construction and Operational Improvements. In 1987, when the agencies reviewed the effectiveness of the various programs and retained the six priority areas, the Safety Construction and Operational Improvement Priority Program was changed to ``Roadway Safety'' to encompass a wider breadth of safety activities which are related to the driving environment. Roadway Safety involves various highway safety activities which relate to safety aspects of the roadway environment. Currently, many roadway safety-related activities are described in three of the original Highway Safety Program Guidelines: Guideline # 9␣Identification and Surveillance of Accident Locations Guideline # 12␣Highway Design, Construction and Maintenance Guideline # 13␣Traffic Engineering Services Further, there are additional roadway-related activities included in the pedestrian and bicycle safety initiatives which are outlined in the Pedestrian and Bicycle Guideline No. 14.
