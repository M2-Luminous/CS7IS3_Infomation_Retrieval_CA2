The KSS was established in 1992 through the merger of the KSS '91 and the Union of Communists of Slovakia. KSS Chairman Vladimir Dado stressed that the party's membership base has considerably increased of late, with many young people joining the party. According to Dado, 6,123 members are working in the party's more than 200 primary organizations. The congress approved the preservation of the party's orientation toward Marxist-Leninist principles and subscribed to the program of the Lubochna congress [of Marxist-Leninist Social Democrats from Slovakia] of 73 years ago. The KSS regards itself as a party of workers, farmers, and the intelligentsia and relies, in particular, on "the workers' class and the youth." It assesses the post-1989 development as a path of class-motivated revenge and the restoration of capitalism by force. Vladimir Dado regretted the unwillingness of the Party of the Democratic Left, the Social Democrats, and the Association of Workers of Slovakia to set up a left-wing bloc with the KSS. "If we do not succeed in forming a bloc, we will go into the elections independently," he said. During the debate, the media came repeatedly under heavy fire because they supposedly refuse to provide scope to the party. [passage omitted] The delegates to the two-day congress approved the party's program and statutes and reelected Vladimir Dado as KSS chairman. [Bratislava SLOVENSKY DENNIK in Slovak on 16 May on page 2 carries a 300-word TA SR report on the First KSS Congress. The report notes that the newly approved party statutes include "one major change in that the Executive Committee has been replaced by a 15-member Presidium" as the party's steering body. The report also mentions that "Ladislav Jaco was elected KSS central secretary."]
