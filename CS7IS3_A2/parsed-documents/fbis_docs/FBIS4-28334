FBIS4-28334 "dreas111__a94008" FBIS-EAS-94-111-A Daily Report 5 Jun 1994 ANNEX Japan Tokyo Reacts To U.S. Official's Remarks on ODA Tokyo Reacts To U.S. Official's Remarks on ODA OW0706091794 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 5 Jun 94 Morning Edition p 3 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0706091794 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Unattributed article] [Text] In response to U.S. Commerce Undersecretary Garten's remarks calling on Japan to let American companies access its Official Development Assistance (ODA)-related projects, concerned ministries, including the Foreign Ministry, are wondering what the United States really wanted to say. Government officials doubt that the United States sees projects under Japan's ODA -- which reaches approximately $11 billion a year -- as business chances and hopes to win those projects by making business activities or whether it wants to secure a certain share of ODA projects in a manner similar to the one it took in economic framework talks with Japan. Speaking at a 2 June news conference, Undersecretary Garten, who is scheduled to visit Japan starting 5 June, said: "Although Japan says that most of its ODA is untied -- which means that the purchase of material to be used for ODA projects is open to foreign companies -- current business opportunities for foreign companies are limited." An untied percentage of Japan's ODA in fiscal 1993 is 96.9 percent. Of this, the purchase of materials from the United States accounts for about 5 percent. It is apparent that the United States, who maintains there is less chance for American companies to take part in ODA projects, bases its demand on such a low percentage. The Foreign Ministry counterargues, saying: "Since the international open bidding system has been introduced to ODA projects, even the percentage of orders received by Japanese companies has dropped to about 30 percent. This is because ODA- receiving countries' and their neighboring nations' competitive power in bidding has increased, and the United States is not treated unfavorably" (according to the Economic Cooperation Bureau). The Foreign Ministry says that when a contract on yen loans is concluded with certain countries, it sends English-translated documents showing details of the contract to each foreign embassy in Tokyo. The ministry stresses: "A company's receiving an order depends on how much effort it has made." Concerning Commerce Undersecretary Garten's remarks, some within the government show an optimistic view, saying: "He must have made the remarks just in hopes of opening up a new, attractive ODA- related market and encouraging American companies to make further efforts." However, Undersecretary Garten might have made the remarks with an eye to pointing out alleged unfair transactions between an ODA- receiving government and contractors because the United States has strongly called on other industrialized nations to sweep away suspicion that companies from industrialized nations win a contract by sending bribes to an ODA-receiving country. Attention is increasingly focused on how Undersecretary Garten carries his point in meetings with Japanese officials and business leaders. Although the Japanese Government says its ODA-related projects are "fair and transparent," the U.S. may step up the offensive depending on negotiations.
