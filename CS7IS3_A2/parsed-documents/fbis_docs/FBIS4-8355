The difference now is that, on 10 April, the Hungarian Defense Ministry in Budapest acknowledged the fact that there were AWACS aircraft in Hungarian airspace on the day of the attack; as for the attack carried out a few weeks ago, there were only speculation that the reconnaissance planes flying in the Hungarian airspace were the first to notice the appearance of the two Serbian Galeb aircraft downed over Bosnia. In other words, we lost our "innocence" earlier, irrespective of Prime Minister Peter Boross' promise to preserve it, a promise made during his international news conference on 11 February. Let us stop for a moment at this point. We should answer the question of whether the prime minister made a hasty declaration and an impossible promise or not. I can say that Hungary's effort to keep away from the armed conflict in Bosnia is a fully legitimate and correct effort. Hungary's direct national interest requires this, irrespective of whether it is aiming at NATO membership or not. (Regarding the weight of the national interest, let me bring up the example of the NATO-member Greece, which, out of fear for its territory, placed Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] under a boycott, although this is precisely the post-Yugoslav republic that blocks the possible spreading of the flames of the Yugoslav conflict to Greece and, subsequently, to NATO territory). On the other hand, once the Hungarian Government (under Jozsef Antall) allowed the AWACS aircraft into Hungary, it obviously must have been aware of the fact that its patrolling activity will be a constant one. In others words, this mission could lose its goal if it had to constantly report to Budapest about the hostile activity in Bosnia and ask permission for NATO participation in fighting against this development. This is an absurd situation. Budapest is definitely not present in the "chain of command" linking the UN forces in Bosnia, the UN secretary general (or his emissary), and NATO. However, I would like to point out Boross' presumed dilemma, which must have led to his incriminated declaration disapproved of by NATO circles. This is a real dilemma, because the appearance of the AWACS was connected to the UN decision on banning the use of Bosnian airspace. Thus Hungary took, and is taking part, in implementing this decision. This is why the downing of the aforementioned Galeb aircraft did not cause any problem. However, as far as I know, this UN decision did not affect the (civil) war being waged on the land and did not include sanctions in the case of an attack against Muslim enclaves declared as UN-protected areas, like Gorazde. In other words, this must have come up in the Hungarian Government, and Boross also expressed it, namely that the surveillance activity authorized by him only referred to a single UN decision, and it cannot be used for other purposes, without special permission. Could this have been made clear at the time? In principle, yes. But not in practice. Once they are airborne, the reconnaissance aircraft observe what they have been ordered to do: Everything. They report what they see. Budapest cannot order them to carry out a "selective view," namely to ensure the airspace boycott but refrain from directing the attacking planes. Therefore, if there was such a thing at all, the dilemma is real.
