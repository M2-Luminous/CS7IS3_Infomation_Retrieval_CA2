After the meeting of the leading Christian Democratic Union bodies in Bonn on Monday [27 June], Chancellor Helmut Kohl said that now he will start his "efforts" to find a candidate who is acceptable to all 12 member states. At the Corfu summit Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, who was supported by 11 member countries, failed to be elected because of Great Britain's veto. The chancellor must settle the conflict, since Germany will take over the EU Council presidency from Greece on 1 July. The veto of British Prime Minister John Major met largely with approval in London, also among the opposition and in the Conservative Party, which is deeply split concerning European issues. The Dutch Government is annoyed because Kohl and French President Francois Mitterrand supported Dehaene, and thus did not give Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers a chance to become the new Commission president. Kohl is still firmly determined to present Delors' successor at the constituting session of the European Parliament on 19 July. The chancellor did not comment on whether Bonn and Paris will continue to support Dehaene. In Corfu Major had said concerning Dehaene: "We will not agree today, tomorrow, or in four weeks." On Monday, government spokesman Dieter Vogel explained that the Federal Government will try "intensively" to find a candidate who is acceptable to everyone. The chancellor and Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel (Free Democratic Party of Germany) will sound out the situation in many talks with other EU members over the next few weeks. Asked whether Bonn has distanced itself from Dehaene, Vogel said: "Just wait a bit. I cannot see that the candidate of the 11 is not a suitable candidate, except for the government of one country."
