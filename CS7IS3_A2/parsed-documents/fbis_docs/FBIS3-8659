The order states that, by their actions, the officers in question violated the Bulgarian Armed Forces statutes, the Rakovski BOL Statute, and the Basic Premises for Mutual Relations Between the Defense Ministry and the Rakovski BOL. It is pointed out that Captain Second Rank Vasil Denov, acting independently and without the knowledge of his colleagues in the legion's Confederative Council and speaking through the mass media, took it upon himself to compare the appeal by the officers in Khaskovo to "the Bloody Letter" [letter written in blood announcing the 1876 April Uprising against the Turks]. By doing this, quite apart from committing a grave disciplinary offense, he caused additional tension among the public and indirectly issued a provocative call for appropriate action. For committing these disciplinary offenses and with a view to forestalling actions by Bulgarian Army commissioned and noncommissioned officers in the future that contravene the legally based and statutory order established in the Army, Captain Second Rank Vasil Denov is dismissed on disciplinary grounds and various punishments are imposed on the other officers that signed the appeal and the petition.
