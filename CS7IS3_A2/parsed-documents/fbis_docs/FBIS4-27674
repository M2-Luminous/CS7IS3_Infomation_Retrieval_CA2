FBIS4-27674 "dreas107_d_94013" FBIS-EAS-94-107 Daily Report 2 Jun 1994 South Korea Energy Consumption in North, South Compared Energy Consumption in North, South Compared SK0206113794 Seoul YONHAP in English 1048 GMT 2 Jun 94 SK0206113794 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, June 2 (YONHAP) -- South Korea consumes about 2.5 times as much energy as North Korea instead of 5 times more as previously known, according to a leading North Korea watcher in the United States. Dr. Chang Yong-sik, an economics professor of New York State University, said in a recent report that in 1991 South Korea consumed 79,705,000 tons oil equivalent (TOE) of coal, oil, gas, charcoal and electricity while North Korea used 32,114,000 TOE. The report was prepared in a contract awarded by South Korea's semi-official think tank, Korea Development Institute (KDI). It was released by KDI Thursday. The energy South Korea consumed in 1991 included 17,394,000 TOE of coal, 51,263,000 tons of oil, 1,541,000 TOE of gas, 617,000 TOE of charcoal and 8,690,000 TOE of electricity. Those used by North Korea in the same year comprised 23,720,000 TOE of coal, 3,507,000 tons of oil, 951,000 TOE of charcoal and 3,932,000 TOE of electricity. Per-capita energy consumption stood at 2,128 liters oil equivalent in the South and 1,712 liters in the North. Dr. Chang claimed South Korea's National Unification Board earlier erroneously said South Korea used 5 times more energy than North Korea in 1991 due to mistakes in the conversion of the amount of coal production into tons oil equivalent and also in the calculation of electricity output. As of 1991, Chang said, North Korea's energy self-sufficiency was 88 percent while it was mere 8 percent in the South. However, due to the inefficiency of Pyongyang's energy policy of depending primarily on coal and a decline in oil imports caused by the lack of hard currencies, North Korea suffers an energy crisis so acute that they supply power even to Pyongyang on a limited basis, Chang said.
