FR940513-0-00116 FR940513-0-00030 DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE 48 CFR Parts 219 and 252 Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement; Indian Tribal or Alaska Native Corporation AGENCY: Department of Defense (DoD). ACTION: Interim rule with request for public comments. SUMMARY: The Department of Defense has amended the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement so that a qualified Indian Tribal Corporation, including an Alaska Native Corporation, furnishing the product of a responsible small business concern is not denied the opportunity to compete for and be awarded a contract under small disadvantaged business preference programs. DATES: Effective Date: May 3, 1994. Comment Date: Comments on the interim DFARS rule should be submitted in writing to the address shown below on or before July 12, 1994, to be considered in the formulation of a final rule. ADDRESSES: Interested parties should submit written comments to The Defense Acquisition Regulations Council, ATTN: Mrs. Alyce Sullivan, PDUSD (A&T)DP(DAR), IMD 3D139, 3062 Defense Pentagon, Washington, DC 20301&hyph;3062. Telefax number (703) 604&hyph;5971. Please cite DFARS Case 93&hyph;D309 in all correspondence related to this issue. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mrs. Alyce Sullivan, (703) 604&hyph;5929. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background Section 8051 of the Fiscal Year 1994 Defense Appropriations Act, Public Law 103&hyph;139, provides that notwithstanding any other provision of law, a qualified Indian Tribal Corporation or Alaska Native Corporation furnishing the product of a responsible small business concern shall not be denied the opportunity to compete for and be awarded a contract under the Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) preference programs. The Director, Defense Procurement, issued Departmental Letter 94&hyph;009, May 3, 1994, to implement Section 8051 in the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act The interim rule may have significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq ., because the rule makes small disadvantaged businesses owned by Indian tribes, including Alaska Native Corporations, eligible for small disadvantaged business preferences when they furnish the product of a small business concern. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) has been prepared and will be provided to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy for the Small Business Administration. Comments from small entities concerning the affected DFARS subparts will be considered in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 610. Such comments must be submitted separately and cite DFARS Case 94&hyph;610 in correspondence. C. Paperwork Reduction Act The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the revisions in this rulemaking notice do not contain and/or affect information collection requirements which require the approval of OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq . D. Determination To Issue an Interim Rule A determination has been made under the authority of the Secretary of Defense to issue this rule as an interim rule. Urgent and compelling reasons exist to promulgate this rule before affording the public an opportunity to comment. This action is necessary because Section 8051 became effective upon enactment of the Fiscal Year 1994 Defense Appropriations Act (Pub. L. 103&hyph;139), on November 11, 1993. However, pursuant to Public Law 98&hyph;577 and Federal Acquisition Regulation 1.501, public comments received in response to this interim rule will be considered in formulating the final rule.

Therefore, 48 CFR Parts 219 and 252 are amended as follows:
