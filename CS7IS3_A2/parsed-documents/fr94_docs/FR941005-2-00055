FR941005-2-00055 FR941005-2-00038 (2) The applicant should specify the source of its gallonage information. In calculating its purchase volumes, an applicant should use actual records from the settlement period, if available. If these records are not available, the applicant may submit estimates of its gasoline purchases, but the estimation methodology must be reasonable and must be explained. (3) A statement indicating whether the applicant or a related firm has filed, or has been authorized to file on its behalf, any other application in this refund proceeding. If so, an explanation of the circumstances of the other filing or authorization should be submitted; (4) If the applicant is or was in any way affiliated with the Remedial Order firm, in this case any firm named in the Appendix, the applicant should explain this affiliation, including the time period in which it was affiliated. If not, a statement that the applicant was not affiliated with the Remedial Order firm. (5) The statement listed below, provided it has been signed by the applicant or a responsible official of the firm filing the refund application: I swear (or affirm) that the information contained in this application and its attachments is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief. I understand that anyone who is convicted of providing false information to the Federal government may be subject to a fine, a jail sentence, or both, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §1001. I understand that the information contained in this application is subject to public disclosure. I have enclosed a duplicate of this entire application which will be placed in the OHA Public Reference Room. All applications should be either typed or printed and should clearly refer to the appropriate proceeding name (Aptos Shell) and case number (LEF&hyph;0092) as well as specify the name of the firm it purchased gasoline from during the audit period. Each applicant must submit an original and one copy of the application. If the applicant believes that any of the information in its application is confidential and does not wish this information to be publicly disclosed, the applicant must submit an original application, clearly designated ``confidential'', containing the confidential information, and two copies of the application with the confidential information deleted. All refund applications should be postmarked no later than June 1, 1995, and sent to: Aptos Shell LEF&hyph;0092, et al, Office of Hearings and Appeals, Department of Energy, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585. (5) Minimal Amount Requirement Only claims for at least $15 in principal will be processed. This minimum has been adopted in refined product refund proceedings because the cost of processing claims for refunds of less than $15 outweighs the benefits of restitution in those instances. See Mobil Oil Corporation, 13 DOE ¶85,339 (1985). Using the volumetric methodology, an applicant must have purchased at least 173 gallons of motor gasoline from one or more of the firms named in the Appendix accompanying this Decision in order for its claim to be considered in this proceeding. (6) Additional Information OHA reserves the authority to require additional information before granting any refund in these proceedings. Applications lacking the required information may be dismissed or denied. (7) Refund Applications filed by Representatives OHA reiterates its policy to closely scrutinize applications filed by filing services. Applications submitted by a filing service should contain all of the information indicated in this final Decision and Order. Strict compliance with the filing requirement as specified in 10 CFR 205.283, particularly the requirement that applications and the accompanying certification statement be signed by the applicant, will be required. (8) Filing Deadline The deadline for filing an Application for Refund is June 1, 1995.
