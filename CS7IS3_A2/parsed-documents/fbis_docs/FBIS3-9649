The delay in recognizing Macedonia turned this country into a dangerous focus of tension. Bulgaria has no territorial claims vis-a-vis Macedonia. The claim regarding the existence of a "big" Macedonian minority in Bulgaria is absurd. For every normal person, the Macedonian Slavs in our country are Bulgarians. They share our past, language, culture, and blood. One century ago, the great powers coldly and without a drop of compassion cut a piece of living flesh from the body of the motherland. Today Bulgaria's first concern must be turning Macedonia into a state based on international law and separating it from the disintegrating Yugoslav space. By simultaneously recognizing Croatia, Slovenia, Macedonia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina in January 1992, we provided valuable proof of our intention to conduct an independent policy and of our conviction that the countries in the region must have the same status and be equal and sovereign if they abide by the UN laws and norms. The statehood and free choice of a people -- this is the main and leading factor in international relations. When a country like Croatia, for example, is recognized, this is done without any qualifications as to what part of the population is recognized. The statehood of the entire nation is being recognized, regardless of the people's ethnic origin or the manner in which they themselves determine their self-awareness. This is an internal issue of the country and its people and the personal right to choice of every citizen. Refraining from interfering in the internal affairs of any state, Bulgaria decisively opposes every attempt to distort our history and every attempt against our national memory and ancient values on which our value system is based. Unfortunately, the statements of the Macedonian leaders now contain precisely such attempts. To this we could add the existence of certain articles in the Macedonian Constitution to which we object, and the frequent cases of anti-Bulgarian campaign in the Macedonian mass media. Thus, the coincidence of positions with Greece on certain issues is hardly an accident. It is a consequence of common concerns and interests. Nevertheless, Bulgaria does not undertake unilateral actions, such as the sanctions Greece imposed on Macedonia. We are led by the principle of trying to understand a position even when you do not share it. Now we are convinced that the sanctions by no means facilitate abating tension in the region and contradict our principle of good-neighborly relations. Greece's remark that its act does not represent a precedent (tacitly addressed at the United States) is a weak consolation. Bulgaria strictly observes its commitments and will not retreat from the firm position of noninterference in the Yugocrisis. This is a clearly declared intention which today enjoys the support not only of the political forces but also of all Bulgarian people. However, I ask myself -- who could guarantee that, at a negative development of the events in the Balkan, a radically exacerbated situation, and direct threats of Bulgaria's national security and interests, Bulgaria will remain a passive observer? One cannot make attempts against Macedonia, Bulgaria, and the Bulgarian population and demand that we remain passive and indifferent. Bulgarian foreign policy is not a field of infighting, improvising, and behind-the-scene deals. Dispute everything, history always sentenced our politicians justly. At this crucial time, the cost of their decisions and choices is exceptionally high. Perhaps higher than ever before.
