FR940819-0-00092 FR940819-0-00019 Additionally, this final rule regulates the frequency and duration of required rest periods. This final rule does not regulate the quality of rest facilities nor does it require certificate holders to provide on-board rest for flight attendants. Reduced Rest Sections 121.466 (d) and (i) and 135.273 (d) and (i) of the NPRM included provisions for operators to schedule 8-hour and 10-hour reduced rest periods in conjunction with certain scheduled duty period limitations. ALPA stated that a rest period should never be scheduled for less than 10 consecutive hours. However, ALPA believes that it may be permissible for an operator to reduce a rest period to less than 10 hours because of circumstances beyond the control of the certificate holder. APA opposed the concept of reduced rest and stated that an air carrier or commercial operator should not be permitted to schedule a reduced rest period. FAA Response The FAA has adopted the reduced rest provisions as proposed. This final rule permits an air carrier or commercial operator to schedule a flight attendant for reduced rest. However, no flight attendant will receive a rest period of less than 8 hours. This provision enables operators to retain a certain degree of scheduling flexibility. The reduced rest provision is adopted in conjunction with the requirement to schedule a longer rest period subsequent to an 8- or 10-hour reduced rest period. Together, these provisions prevent a flight attendant from being assigned two consecutive reduced minimum rest periods and are designed to protect flight attendants by minimizing the effects of cumulative fatigue. 24-Consecutive-Hour Rest Period During Any 7 Consecutive Calendar Days Sections 121.466(n) and 135.273(n) of the NPRM proposed that a certificate holder be required to relieve a flight attendant engaged in air transportation or air commerce from all further duty for at least 24 consecutive hours during any 7 consecutive calendar days. For convenience, hereafter, this requirement will be referred to as the 24-hour-in-7-day rest requirement. Proposed §§121.466(a) and 135.273(a) of the NPRM defined a calendar day as the period of elapsed time, using Coordinated Universal Time or local time, that begins at midnight and ends 24 hours later. Labor organizations, operators, and an association commented on the proposed 24-hour-in-7-day rest requirement. Several of the comments submitted included discussion of the term ``calendar day.'' ATA stated that the term ``calendar day'' is confusing because it is unclear on which day an assignment begins or ends. APA stated that the term calendar day should specify that the local time used is that of the flight attendant's home base. In the Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions' alternative to the NPRM, the Coalition deleted the definition of the term ``calendar day'' but retained the provision for 24 consecutive hours of rest in 7 consecutive calendar days. ATA and Delta Air Lines recommended that the FAA revise the proposed 24-hour-in-7-day rest requirement by replacing the phrase ``every 7 consecutive calendar days'' with the phrase ``every 168-consecutive-hour period.'' Southwest Airlines and TWU Local 556 requested that the final rule permit a flight attendant to voluntarily waive the 24-hour-in-7-day rest requirement in order to be able to work extra hours. Southwest Airlines states that, if flight attendants cannot waive this provision, Southwest would be required to hire an additional 100 flight attendants at an initial cost of $710,000 and an annual recurring cost of $660,000. TWU Local 556 stated that they applied this provision to a sample of 13 flight attendant schedules for February 1993. According to TWU Local 556, if the 13 flight attendants were not permitted to fly their schedule, which had been altered to include extra flights, each flight attendant would have lost $11,063 in extra annual income. The total lost income for 2,200 flight attendants would be $24 million. ATA and Delta Air Lines recommended that the FAA include a provision in the final rule similar to a statement included in the preamble to the NPRM that indicated that the requirement for a 24-consecutive-hour rest period in any 7 consecutive calendar days could be postponed under certain circumstances. AMR Combs and American Cyanamid Company noted that current §§135.267(f) and 135.269(d) require unscheduled operators to provide flight crewmembers with at least 13 rest periods of at least 24 consecutive hours in each calendar quarter. AMR Combs stated that the 24-hour-in-7-day rest requirement proposed in the NPRM only should apply to scheduled operations. American Cyanamid Company suggested that flight attendants could be required to meet pilot weekly rest requirements as an alternative. Other comments submitted included: (1) A recommendation by TWU Local 556 that the FAA could require four 24-hour breaks in 30 days or require a 12-hour rest preceding the seventh duty day; and (2) a Carnival Airlines flight service schedule indicating that a flight attendant had been scheduled for 11 consecutive days of duty without receiving a 24-consecutive-hour rest period. FAA Response The 24-hour-in-7-day rest requirement is designed to supplement daily rest requirements and to ensure that flight attendants receive the opportunity to obtain adequate rest. The FAA proposed the definition of a calendar day to provide a unit of measure that could be used to determine whether the 24-hour-in-7-day rest requirement is met. In response to ATA's concern that the term ``calendar day'' causes confusion, the FAA refers to the definition of ``calendar day'' in §§121.467(a) and 135.273(a) of the final rule, which indicates that a calendar day begins at midnight and ends 24 hours later at the next midnight. ``Seven consecutive calendar days'' as used in §§121.467 and 135.273 of this final rule means a period of 7 consecutive days beginning at midnight on the first day and ending at midnight 7 days later. In response to APA's recommendation that the definition of calendar day specify that the local time be that of the flight attendant's home base, the FAA has determined that any time zone can be used to determine whether the 24-hour-in-7-day rest requirement is met, as long as the carrier is consistent. In other words, a certificate holder may not manipulate the use of time zones when calculating 7 consecutive calendar days so as to vary the number of hours that comprise any 7 consecutive calendar days. The FAA has considered the commenters' request to replace the proposed 7 consecutive calendar days with a 168-consecutive-hour period. The FAA notes that the NPRM used language consistent with the language contained in the current flight crewmember flight time limitations rule. The FAA has decided that it should not introduce at this final rule stage an inconsistency between the flight crewmember flight time limitations rule language and the flight attendant duty period limitations and rest requirements rule language. The FAA will consider whether rulemaking should be initiated to replace 7 consecutive calendar days with 168-consecutive-hours. The FAA has reviewed requests to permit flight attendants to voluntarily waive the 24-hour-in-7-day rest requirement. The FAA has not included that alternative in this final rule because the purpose of requiring 24 consecutive hours free from duty in any 7 consecutive calendar days is to ensure that flight attendants receive the opportunity to obtain adequate rest. As with rest requirements following reduced rest, the requirement for 24 consecutive hours of rest in any 7 consecutive calendar days is designed to protect flight attendants by minimizing the effects of cumulative fatigue.
