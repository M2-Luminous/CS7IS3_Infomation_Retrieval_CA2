The long "diplomatic" recess in itself shows the tension between the presidential body and the RMDSZ, mainly as a result of the fact that the RMDSZ remained uncompromising even after its Brasov congress, did not discard its goals, and consistently adhered to its program; President Ion Iliescu has repeatedly expressed his resentment because of this. In his view, the national minority issue in Romania has been satisfactorily settled in every respect according to the international norms, the causes of possible differences of views should be sought only among the minorities themselves, primarily the RMDSZ, who are fighting for privileges rather than for rights. Although Iliescu has hardly changed anything in his concept, he nevertheless invited the leadership of the RMDSZ for a dialogue on 1 February, probably in view of the events and unfavorable international reactions, as well as out of certain political considerations. [Gyarmath] We have already cleared up the misunderstanding that it was President Iliescu, and not the RMDSZ, who initiated this meeting. As far as I know, the RMDSZ had prepared for the meeting and was ready for dialogue. Mr Marko, how did you actually prepare for this meeting, and what was its goal? [Marko] It is well known that the RMDSZ had not been in the presidential palace for almost a year, but this does not mean that every contact was severed. Thus, before the start of the end-of- the-year consultations initiated by Ion Iliescu, it was not yet clear whether the parties of the Democratic Convention would appear together or separately, so we prepared for both possibilities. As is well known, a joint delegation met with Ion Iliescu after all, and our representatives, including myself, were also part of this delegation. However, under these circumstances, we could only summarily mention our particular demands and ideas. At the end of the talks, the president came up with a proposal to meet him separately, and we could not reject this offer because our organization favors an open dialogue and also because we had things to say to him. Our goal was finally to hand over the package of documents prepared by our Executive Committee. [Gyarmath] What is in this package? [Marko] Let us begin -- precisely because of its timeliness owing to the approaching Council of Europe deadline on Romania's implementation of its proposals -- with our memorandum to the Council of Europe and its appendix, which we sent to Strasbourg recently. The package also contains the bill on national minorities and autonomous communities formulated by the RMDSZ and registered by Parliament, a bill that we included for purposes of information and study, as well as numerous analyses, memoranda, and documentation regarding education, self-government bodies, the restitution of church properties, the fate of the convicts from Hargita county and Marosvasarhely [Tirgu Mures], and the increasingly tense inter- ethnic relations in the Kovaszna and Cluj counties. When describing the package of documents at the beginning of the meeting, I stressed that it contained all the essential problems facing the Hungarians living in Romania, and it listed not only the unsolved problems but also the solutions. [Gyarmath] Therefore, we can practically call it a package of RMDSZ proposals.... [Marko] Obviously, because we presented solutions to the national minority issue and how the problems of the Hungarian community in Romania should be treated. We also indicated that this meeting was taking place at a time when four months had already passed since Romania's acceptance onto the Council of Europe, and two months before officials would visit Romania to see which Council of Europe proposals this country had implemented. We concluded that, in our opinion, none of these proposals had been implemented! Thus, the RMDSZ has not seen any progress either in the past four years or the past four months! Obviously, a lot of questions could already have been resolved, such as the issue of the convicts of Zetelak, Oroszhegy, and Marosvasarhely, which the president himself and other responsible government officials had promised would be solved by the end of last year. [Gyarmath] How did the president receive all this? [Marko] After a short presentation of the package of documents, we had a long talk and discussion for more than three hours, in the course of which we reviewed the essential issues included in these documents. I must immediately point out that, as I see it, the president has not changed his position expressed during previous meetings. Therefore, we told him that, as long as he thinks that there are no problems in legislation and in shaping legal frameworks in Romania, while we claim that we need totally new legal frameworks here, we cannot imagine how to seek a solution. Therefore, all that happened was that I myself and my colleagues listed and presented our positions on these issues with arguments and documents. The mere presentation of the problems showed that the situation was stagnating and opposite trends were emerging. [Gyarmath] What conclusion did you draw in the end? [Marko] As I see it, the president continues to hold a totally different position from ours; thus, the two positions have not come closer to each other and there has been no breakthrough. We can, however, call it a positive development that the president declared that they would study the documents presented by us and we would be informed about their conclusions in writing. At the same time, the president proposed to make this form of a dialogue a regular feature: a meeting every quarter of a year. In connection with this, we told him that this only made sense if these dialogues took place in the spirit of solutions, that is, if there is progress after these meetings. We refuse to engage in fruitless and empty dialogues. Of course, many things happen and many things are said at a meeting of more than three hours. [Takacs] These negotiations have again proved the opposing viewpoints from which we approach the issues and democracy in Romania. It is well known that the RMDSZ is in favor of a general democratic restructuring, and the national minority issue is one of the components of this restructuring. At the same time, our opinions also differ on whether Romania's interests coincide with the interests of the current government. The positions regarding Romania, the Romanian people, and the processes that accelerate or hinder this democratic restructuring became clear during the meeting. Thus, although Ion Iliescu made a lot of critical remarks about the RMDSZ address during this meeting, we refuted all of them one after the other. For example, he criticized us for sending a memorandum to the international forum and for formulating a reminder after four months. It clearly transpired from his approach to this and other issues that we have different ideas about democracy and progress. After all, strengthening local government bodies, decentralization, and the depolitization of state institutions are not only in the interest of the Hungarian minority but also in the interest of the Romanian people. [Gyarmath] Thus, do you feel that a dialogue of the deaf took place in the Cotroceni Palace? [Takacs] Not exactly, because, in my view, during the talks, the president slowly began to realize not only that the RMDSZ was presenting the issues from its own viewpoint, but that these issues can be either acceptable or disputable from the viewpoint of a political evaluation and approach. We stressed that in these documents, which also include proposals for solutions, we are starting from the facts, and not from presenting our demands, and it is impossible to refute the elements of reality. Nor is it refutable that general democracy and the introduction of European norms is also in the interest of Romania, and not only that of the opposition or of the RMDSZ. Therefore, we think that everything that is good for European democracy and everything that raises the standards of these societies in every respect is also good for Romania. Strangely enough, if we or the opposition say that, they regard it as a hostile manifestation. Therefore, we asked the president to try to build an objective information channel that shows reality, rather than serving power interests. For example, Iliescu had just learned that the judges in the trial of the Zetelak affair were Romanians, not Hungarians. It also transpired that the president had no idea of the discriminatory measures used in appointing people in Kovaszna county and of the ethnic pressures on so-called non-Hungarian families and children. Although it is clear that all this involves a violation of the Constitution, the president said that he had no idea of these things. Even if this is true, it does not mean that he is free from responsibility, because he himself chose his advisers and all those who inform him. Therefore, we can say that his team as a whole works uniformly against the Hungarians. We stressed that we were open to dialogue, and the fact that we handed over our document package for studying is a sign of this and, of course, we expect a response both in words and deeds. Thus, from our viewpoint, I regard this meeting as important because it provided an opportunity to inform the president about the issues and the political goals of the RMDSZ clearly, unequivocally, and without distortions, goals that we will not give up for any opportunistic considerations. As for making the dialogue between the presidency and the RMDSZ a regular one, we must stress that there is only sense in holding such meeting regularly if it has no hidden or show-policy aims, if the RMDSZ achieves results, and if the meeting is not used to show "results" to the international public opinion. In other words, the RMDSZ cannot and will not be a partner with any government that makes use of a policy of delay. We did not commit ourselves to negotiate for decades; we committed ourselves to only negotiate if there is a hope of achieving results. [Gyarmath] How would you evaluate the meeting? [Takacs] Obviously, we have a lot of reservations, and we can hardly say that we have found understanding. However, we cannot say that the meeting was useless. By presenting this document package in the spirit of our congress held in Brasso [Brasov], all we did was to put the ball into our opponent's court. No one will be able to say now that he does not know or understand what we want; we have carried out the necessary clarification. [Gyarmath] Have you felt any political will toward resolving the issues, or even one single issue? [Marko] Neither the opposition nor the RMDSZ should have any illusions or believe that any political change will take place soon. However, given that this issue requires a more lengthy explanation, I think we should let life give an answer and wait and see what happens.
