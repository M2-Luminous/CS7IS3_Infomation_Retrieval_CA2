The State Department Spokeswoman Christine Shelly told a regular new briefing that Christopher and Qian "will discuss a full range of issues, including international questions requiring joint cooperation and bilateral issues that affect our relations." Bilateral issues include "human rights, non-proliferation and trade," she added. In answering questions, she confirmed that the State Department "reviewed earlier in the week about the specific connection of the human rights issue to MFN (most-favored-nation trade status)." The Clinton administration's position on this issue, she said, is that there has been "some progress, but not the kind of progress that we're looking for in terms of conditions that have been set for a renewal of MFN.... There is still a long way to go." The spokeswoman denied the reported divergence between the views of U.S. ambassador in China, Stapleton Roy, and administration's position on the human rights issue. Ambassador Roy said in an interview published in the NEW YORK TIMES two weeks ago that China had made "dramatic" progress in improving the lives of its people and that this record should be taken into account when the U.S. policy toward China is reviewed in the new year. Shelly noted that Roy's policy analysis, his policy recommendations to the administration "do carry particular weight." However, she argued that the ambassador's remarks and total interview "definitely should be taken as a whole." During Christopher's trip to Paris, Shelly said, he will also discuss with French officials president Clinton's meetings in Prague, Kiev, Moscow, Minsk and Geneva and address "a wide range of subjects of mutual concern."
