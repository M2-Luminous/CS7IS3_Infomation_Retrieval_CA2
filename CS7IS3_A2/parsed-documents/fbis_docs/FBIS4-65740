He said: I have accepted this document. Either Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas accepts it too, or we don't play anymore. Kliridhis clarified that he has not been informed that the United Nations has accepted any changes to the UN document, as reported by the Turkish Cypriot press. The president was speaking this afternoon after meeting AKEL [Restorative Party of the Working People] Secretary General Dhimitrios Khristofias, in his series of meetings to brief the political leaders before the National Council convenes. Kliridhis said if measures are taken to make the Turkish side show willingness for a solution, then the substance of the Cyprus issue will be discussed. Khristofias said he and Kliridhis agreed that after the failure of the talks on the confidence-building measures the process must return to the substance of the Cyprus issue, but on the condition that Denktas and Ankara are forced to abandon their intransigent stance. He added that the UN Security Council must make decisions about drastic measures to bend Turkish intransigence, but expressed reservations about this possibility.
