Regent H. Karimujddin Hasjbullah stated that agricultural reform is being considered to deal with a difficult period as collections under the PBB [Tax on Land and Buildings] from the agricultural sector decline when production from the Arun natural gas field comes to an end, about nine years from now. The regent made this statement on 12 January at his first meeting with reporters in 1994. The statement was made in connection with the concern felt by a number of community leaders about how to deal with the situation after the natural gas deposits run out. He emphasized that Aceh Utara will certainly have difficulty obtaining development funds after the natural gas deposits in the Arun field dry up. At present this vital project in Aceh Utara provides about 25 billion rupiahs in PBB taxes annually. Regent Karimuddin Hasjbullah stated that the first priority and central point of emphasis in future development will be agriculture, concentrating on horticultural and agricultural estate production, in addition to continuing to develop the output of paddy and soy beans. The production of these crops has increased since several technical irrigation projects have begun to function. What remains to be done, requiring attention and follow-through, is an effort to deal with the marketing of these crops. Until now this has always been a problem for the farmers. According to the regent, half of the PAD (basic provincial tax income) has come from the payment of PBB taxes by vitally important companies in the Lhokseumawe industrial zone, such as Mobil Oil Indonesia (MOI), Parun Natural Gas Ltd., PT Pupuk Iskandar Muda (PIM), PT [limited company] ASEAN Aceh Fertilizers (several types of fertilizer), and PT Kertas Kraft Aceh (KKA) [Aceh Kraft Paper Company]. He said: "When the natural gas deposits dry up, provincial income will decline. Until now gas production has supported the steady implementation of development activity. However, we should not be too pessimistic." Karimuddin continued that, in view of the natural resource potential of the area, it is only the agricultural sector which could bring in new resources to replace declining PBB tax revenue from the mining sector, which will be forced to halt operations altogether. However, to strengthen the economic basis of the agricultural sector, the regional government must stimulate agricultural development, beginning now. To do that, large amounts of money and hard work will be needed. Most affected by the drying up of the natural gas wells is the Regency of Aceh Utara. Meanwhile, nine other regencies in Aceh and the Aceh provincial government itself will also lose PBB tax revenues from the mining sector. However, the other regencies have become used to shortages and limitations affecting their budgets, and the consequences will not be particularly felt. Dr. M. Djakfar G. Hatta, a staff assistant of the regent for the economic sector who was formerly chairman of the North Aceh Regional Development Board, said that Aceh Utara will be very seriously affected because about half of the budget, which at present ranges between 55 billion and 62 billion rupiahs annually, will be lost. Meanwhile, the Aceh provincial government still has rather large additional sources of revenue, such as city taxes, the motor vehicle tax, and tax receipts from other large industries. In fact, Aceh Utara has a rather large amount of agricultural land. However, since the Arun natural gas field was discovered in 1972, all groups have concentrated on gas and easy money and have not paid attention to what must be done for the good of the regency. No one thought that the natural gas wells would dry up in 20 years or so. Agricultural fields were forgotten, and agricultural development was delayed for 10 years. Djakfar G. Hatta supported the regent's view that Aceh Utara must rebuild the economic strength of the agricultural sector to what it once was. However, he went on to say, this effort will be increasingly difficult because the majority of the farmers have abandoned their agricultural fields, and some of the land has been sold. The farmers now work as laborers. Meanwhile, thousands of hectares of rice land have been used for the industrial zone. Regent Karimuddin Hasjbullah stated that in the large agricultural plantation subsector Cot Girek Plantation IX is carrying on an overall diversification program, converting some of its land planted to sugar cane and rubber to oil palms. At present the estate agricultural company is building a modern factory for processing palm oil which is expected to go into production in 1994. In addition to planting its own oil palm area Cot Girek Plantation also needs oil palm seeds produced by individual farmers and under the PIR [Smallholder Nuclear Plantation] program. According to the regent, the District of Kuta Makmur is now moving quickly to become an oil palm plantation area. Many small and medium-sized businessmen are establishing oil palm plantations. Meanwhile, local people are also beginning to plant oil palm trees. He said: "Efforts like these will support an improvement in community economic welfare."
