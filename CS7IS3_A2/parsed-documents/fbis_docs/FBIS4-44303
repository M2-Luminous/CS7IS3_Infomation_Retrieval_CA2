As Mr Major basked in the praise of Conservative MPs on his return from the Corfu summit, the party's Eurosceptic wing began to reassert its influence. Mr Portillo, the Treasury Chief Secretary, used a speech in Barcelona to increase the pressure on Mr Major to adopt a robust stance in Europe in defence of free market policies and less state interference in economic and social issues. He scorned suggestions that Britain's more sceptial approach meant that it would "miss the bus" in Europe. "This imagery can be misleading," he said. "It suggests that speed is more important than direction." Mr Portillo's speech will increase concern among EC leaders that Mr Major is under growing domestic pressure to return to the more confrontational attitude towards Europe adopted by Lady Thatcher. The Euro-sceptics kept a low profile during the European elections, but are now emboldened by indications of a shift of emphasis in the Government towards a more critical posture. After successfully putting pressure on Mr Major to veto the appointment of Mr Dehaene, the Right is seeking to ensure that he will take further steps to halt the integration of Europe in the run-up to the next Maastricht-style conference in 1996. The Prime Minister won an enthusiastic welcome at Westminster from Tory Euro-sceptics for his decision to block Mr Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister and a federalist in the mould of M Jacques Delors, the outgoing president. Although his action has plunged Europe into crisis, his backbenchers were delighted that a strong stand had been taken in defence of the country's interests. They packed the Commons, waving order papers in a show of solidarity. The biggest cheer came when Mr Major said that "being a good European does not mean signing up to everything which our partners propose." It was the most confident performance he has given since his leadership was questioned last autumn. The one discordant note on the Tory side was sounded by Sir Edward Heath. He said that use of the veto was "a matter for regret, not for rejoicing." Mr Kenneth Baker, the former party chairman, said that Mr Major had taken "a courageous and popular decision." Mrs Margaret Beckett, the Labour leader, said Mr Major was the "prisoner of the Euro-sceptics." Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, said he had attempted to "portray the Punch and Judy farce at Corfu as Henry V at Agincourt, with himself in the title role." Mr Major emphasised that he was sticking to his guns. He said: "I believe that there are a number of well-qualified people who could take on this post on the basis of a genuinely common accord." Downing Street reaffirmed later that Mr Major remained ready to use the veto again if need be. Mr Dehaene hinted yesterday that he might pull out of the race while Germany, which assumes the rotating EC presidency on Friday [1 July], embarked on a search for a compromise candidate. The acrimony surrounding the blackballing of Mr Dehaene was reinforced when Downing Street sought to blame the crisis on the way France and Germany had tried to push him forward without proper consultation. Officials said that Chancellor Kohl had not told Mr Major that he backed Mr Dehaene when the two leaders met in London in April, and claimed that he had not made up his mind, although Mr Major disclosed then that Sir Leon Brittan was his choice. German insistence that they did not have a candidate continued even after reports that Herr Kohl and President Mitterrand had struck a deal at a meeting in Mulhouse last month to support Mr Dehaene.
