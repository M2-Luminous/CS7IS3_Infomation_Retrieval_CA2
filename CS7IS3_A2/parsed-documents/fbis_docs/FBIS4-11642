During the talks, the prime minister reviewed the Jordanian-Israeli negotiations on the Middle East. Here is more: [Begin al-Majali recording] In fact, discussing, rather [than] negotiating because, still, Israel hesitant on getting on the principles of the negotiation. In other words, the principle items, which is the occupied territories, which is water, and refugees. These three. And they want us to negotiate on tourism, on energy, on trade, on, on, on, on, which is what we call the items of normalization rather that to solve the principles. Now, as I said, going back to our thinking or a state of mind that in peace negotiation nobody should be the winner or the loser, all should be gaining. We did innovate an idea where we put all the items on the same level. No priority. All have the same priority. And then we went further and we suggested to them, and they accepted, that we put them into baskets. Now in each basket we put items which we want, items which they want and we discuss them at the same time. Unfortunately, so far, for reasons of their own, they are not coming through for this negotiation. They say: Look here, we cannot discuss or negotiate occupied territories, withdrawal from the land, or shares of water. Let it be this at the very end when we have the peace treaty. In other words, I just want to be very quick. They want to put the agenda upside down. In other words, the last word on the agenda was the peace treaty to be put on the top and now we negotiate peace treaty and then these items will come through. [end recording]
