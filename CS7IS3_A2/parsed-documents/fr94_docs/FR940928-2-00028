FR940928-2-00028 FR940928-2-00024 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY [FRL&hyph;5081&hyph;2] Acid Rain Program: Draft Acid Rain Permits; Public Comment Period AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice of Draft Permits and Public Comment Period. SUMMARY: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is issuing for comment draft, five-year Acid Rain permits to 16 utility plants in accordance with the Acid Rain Program regulations (40 CFR part 72). DATES: Comments on each draft permit must be received on or before October 28, 1994 or the date of publication of a similar notice in a local newspaper, whichever is later. ADDRESSES: Administrative Records. The administrative record for each draft permit, except information protected as confidential, may be viewed during normal operating hours at EPA Region 5, Ralph H. Metcalfe Federal Bldg., 77 West Jackson Blvd., Chicago, IL 60604. Comments. Send comments, requests for public hearings, and requests to receive notice of future actions concerning a draft permit to EPA Region 5 (A&hyph;18J), Air and Radiation Division, Attn: David Kee, Director (address above). Submit all comments in duplicate and identify the permit to which the comments apply, the commenter's name, address, and telephone number, and the commenter's interest in the matter and affiliation, if any, to the owners and operators of all units covered by the permit. All timely comments will be considered, except those pertaining to standard provisions under 40 CFR 72.9 or issues not relevant to the permit. Hearings. To request a public hearing, state the issues proposed to be raised in the hearing. EPA may schedule a hearing if EPA finds that it will contribute to the decision-making process by clarifying significant issues affecting the draft permit. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Contact the following persons for more information about the draft permits for plants: in Illinois, Cecilia Mijares, (312) 886&hyph;0968; in Indiana, Genevieve Nearmyer, (312) 353&hyph;4761; in Minnesota, Allan Batka, (312) 886&hyph;7316; and in Ohio, Franklin Echevarria, (312) 886&hyph;9653. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: EPA proposes to approve a permit for each affected utility plant that specifies sulfur dioxide emission allowances and compliance plans as set forth in the notices of final permits cited below. An allowance is a limited authorization by EPA to emit up to one ton of sulfur dioxide during or after a specified calendar year. As explained in the notice of withdrawal of final permits (published elsewhere in today's Federal Register ), these final permits were issued as direct final actions and are withdrawn because of the submission of significant, adverse comments objecting to the issuance of the final permits. The draft permits set forth in this notice are based on and consistent with the Partial Settlement Agreement in Environmental Defense Fund v. Carol M. Browner, No. 93&hyph;1203 (D.C. Cir. 1993), which the Administrator determined to be a reasonable resolution of certain litigation issues concerning the Acid Rain regulations, and which was signed on behalf of the Administrator on May 4, 1994. Further, the draft permit for Petersburg is consistent with other provisions of the Acid Rain regulations (e.g., 40 CFR 72.42) issued on January 11, 1993, that were challenged in the permit proceeding and in a petition for review. The Administrator finds, under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, that the draft permits are based on a determination of nationwide scope and effect. In the absence of such a finding, appeals of the permits or appeals encompassing issues raised in the instant proceeding would involve petitions for review before more than one Circuit of the U.S. Courts of Appeals. The following permits (See 59 FR 39339&hyph;39341, August 2, 1994 or 59 FR 39767&hyph;39768, August 4, 1994) are issued for public comment: Collins in Illinois. Crawford in Illinois. Fisk in Illinois. Joliet 9 in Illinois. Joliet 29 in Illinois. Powerton in Illinois. State Line in Illinois. Waukegan in Illinois. Will County in Illinois. Petersburg in Indiana. Allen S. King in Minnesota. Black Dog in Minnesota. High Bridge in Minnesota. Riverside in Minnesota. Sherburne County in Minnesota. Poston in Ohio. Dated: September 21, 1994. Brian J. McLean, Director, Acid Rain Division, Office of Atmospheric Programs, Office of Air and Radiation. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;23979 Filed 9&hyph;27&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;P
