FR941121-0-00022 FR941121-0-00001 (f) Bonus 1. General . Bonuses include items of value offered as incentives to members, such as an offer to pay the final installment deposit for a holiday club account if the final installment is over $10. Bonuses do not include the payment of dividends (including extraordinary dividends), the waiver or reduction of a fee, the absorption of expenses, non-dividend membership benefits, or other consideration aggregating $10 or less per year. 2. Examples . The following are examples of bonuses. i. A credit union offers $25 to potential members for becoming a member and opening an account. The $25 could be provided by check, cash, or direct deposit. ii. A credit union offers $25 to a member with only a regular share account to open a share draft account. The $25 could be provided by check, cash, or direct deposit. iii. A credit union offers a portable radio with a value of $20 to members and potential members for opening a share draft account. iv. A credit union pays the final installment deposit for a holiday club account if over $10. 3. Examples not comprising bonuses . The following are examples of items that are not bonuses: i. Discount coupons distributed by credit unions for use at restaurants or stores. ii. A credit union offers $20 to any member if the member is responsible for encouraging a potential member to open an account. The $20 is not a bonus because the $20 is not paid to the individual opening the account. Any item, including cash, given or offered to a third party (that is not a joint member or joint owner in an account being opened) in exchange for a member or potential member opening (or a member renewing or adding to) an account is not a bonus. iii. A credit union offers $25 to a member if the member can locate his name in the body of a newsletter. iv. Life savings benefits. Many credit unions offer life savings benefits to beneficiaries of deceased members. Because the benefit accrues to a third party, such life savings plans offered are not bonuses. v. A credit union offers to pay annual membership dues in a benevolent organization for a class of members. 4. De minimis rule . Items with a de minimis value of $10 or less are not bonuses. Credit unions may rely on the valuation standard used by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to determine if the value of the item is de minimis. Items required to be reported by the credit union under IRS rules are bonuses under this regulation. Examples of items of de minimis values are: i. Disability insurance premiums on a share account valued at an amount of $10 or less per year. ii. Coffee mugs, T-shirts or other merchandise with a market value of $10 or less per year. 5. Aggregation . In determining if an item valued at $10 or less is a bonus, credit unions must aggregate per account per calendar year items that may be given to members. In making this determination, credit unions aggregate per account only the market value of items that may be given for a specific promotion. To illustrate, assume a credit union offers in January to give members an item valued at $7 for each calendar quarter during the year that the average account balance in a share draft account exceeds $10,000. The bonus rules are triggered, since members are eligible under the promotion to receive up to $28 during the year. However, the bonus rules are not triggered if an item valued at $7 is offered to members opening a share draft account during the month of January, even though in November the credit union introduces a new promotion that includes, for example, an offer to existing share draft accountholders for an item valued at $8 for maintaining an average balance of $5,000 for the month. 6. Waiver or reduction of a fee or absorption of expenses . Bonuses do not include value received by members through the waiver or reduction of fees for credit union-related services (even if the fees waived exceed $10), such as the following: i. Waiving a safe deposit box rental fee for one year for members who open a new account. ii. Waiving fees for travelers checks for members, and waiving check and share draft printing fees. iii. Nondiscriminatorily waiving all fees for a particular class of members, such as seniors or minors. iv. Discounts on interest rates charged for loans at the credit union. v. Rebates of loan interest already paid by a member. vi. Discounts on application fees charged for loans at the credit union. vii. Packaged, linked, or tied-account services. 7. Non-dividend membership benefits . Such benefits are not bonuses because they are sporadic in nature, often difficult to value, and providing non-dividend membership benefits is a long-standing unique credit union practice. (See commentary to ยง707.2(r) for examples of such benefits.) (g) Credit Union 1. General . Includes credit unions in the United States, Puerto Rico, Guam, U.S. Virgin Islands, and U.S. territories. Applies to credit unions whether or not the accounts in the credit union are federally, state, privately insured, or uninsured. (h) Daily Balance Method
