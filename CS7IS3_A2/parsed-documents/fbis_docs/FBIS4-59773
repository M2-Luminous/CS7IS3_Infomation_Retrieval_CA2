This remark was made by Professor Itamar Rabinovich, Israel's ambassador to the United States, to our political correspondent Shlomo Raz at the end of Christopher talks in Jerusalem. Ambassador Rabinovich noted that there is no breakthrough in the talks with the Syrians, and described them as a living process. He further said that the clarifications received from the Syrians are not satisfactory, but they do contain some positive and real aspects. Rabinovich noted that Christopher will be leaving for Damascus tomorrow with additional Israeli questions regarding the Syrian replies and, according to him, we will know where the talks are headed in less than two days.
