FR940916-1-00078 FR940916-1-00016 II. Air Flow Method The air flow method (AFM) of train air brake testing monitors the rate of air flow through the automatic brake valve to the brake pipe by the means of a brake pipe flow indicator. The AFM of brake testing is a more comprehensive test than the present leakage test. The leakage method only measures the amount of leakage from the brake and branch pipes, whereas the AFM tests the entire brake system including the reservoirs and control valves. In addition, the leakage method does not test the capability of the pressure-maintaining feature of the 26L brake equipment. The AFM, on the other hand, tests the brake system just as it is operated, with the pressure-maintaining feature cut in. The AFM of qualifying train air brake systems has been allowed in Canada as an alternative to the leakage test since 1984. In addition, several railroads in the United States have been using the AFM since 1989 when the AAR's petition for a waiver of compliance was granted allowing the AFM as an alternative to the leakage test. In order to determine if the AFM of train air brake testing should be included as an alternative to the leakage test, FRA in the ANPRM (57 FR 62552) requested comments from interested parties regarding the operating history of the AFM. The AAR and several railroads commented on the operating experience of using the AFM. These commenters reported that the AFM is an effective and reliable method of qualifying train brakes and that the greatest benefit of the method is the information it provides to the train crew. CP Rail reported that testing on the AFM started in Canada in 1975 and became an alternate method of qualifying train brakes in 1984. CP Rail as well as several other railroads stated that they have experienced no problems with the method. Conrail commented that, although it initially experienced problems with sticking pointers, defective check valves, and protruding screws on the air flow meters, these problems have been eliminated. Conrail also stated that use of the AFM has indicated a slight reduction in undesired emergencies. Several railroads commented that the AFM provides information to the train crew regarding the brake pipe that is not provided by the leakage test. Two railroads responded that in all the years they have used the AFM they have experienced no instance where a train had to stop because the air flow could not be maintained. The AAR maintained that the failure rate of the air flow indicators is less than 1 percent. In fact, Conrail stated that it performed 9,000 air flow indicator calibrations in 1992 and found only 90 defective indicators. Several railroads commented that they currently calibrate the air flow meters on a 60-day to 92-day basis and have no problem with current calibration procedures. Two railroads noted that they initially had problems calibrating the devices due to orifice sizes but have since cured this problem. One railroad mentioned that it had problems calibrating the devices in extremely cold weather until it applied condition eight of FRA's waiver to the calibration of the gauge on the locomotive as well as the test orifices. (``The air flow indicator calibration test orifice shall be calibrated at temperatures of not more than 20 degrees Fahrenheit.'') Railroad representatives unanimously opposed any requirement that would make using the AFM mandatory or the sole method of qualifying brake systems. All railroad commenters supported the adoption of the AFM as an alternative to the leakage test for qualifying braking systems. Most of these commenters suggested that the use of either method is an economical or operational decision that should be made by each individual railroad. One railroad recommended that trains qualified under the AFM should be requalified with the leakage test if the air flow indicator fails enroute. The cost figures presented by the AAR and several railroads for equipping locomotives with air flow meters range from $350 to $1,450 per unit. Amtrak and two other passenger and commuter railroads commented that due to the short length of passenger trains the AFM is not a beneficial means of qualifying the braking systems. They felt that the flow rate of 60 cubic feet per minute (CFM) was inappropriate for passenger trains because it would allow these shorter trains to operate with excessive brake pipe leakage since the AFM measures the ability to maintain pressure, not brake pipe leakage. However, these commenters did support the use of the AFM as an alternative to the leakage test for freight operations. Both the Railway Labor Executives' Association (RLEA) and the BRC as well as several individual carmen opposed the adoption of the AFM as an alternative method of qualifying brake systems. The parties felt that the leakage test is the only reliable method for determining the integrity of the air brake system and for identifying leaks. These commenters stated that the AFM only determines whether the brake pipe is compensating for existing leaks and does not identify the severity of the leak, and thus, trains would be allowed to operate with leaks over 5-psi, which is dangerous especially in cold weather and could result in an emergency application or derailment. Westinghouse Air Brake Company (WABCO) responded stating that both the leakage test and the AFM combined with the 15-psi gradient restriction are effective and acceptable methods of qualifying braking systems. WABCO commented that the 60&hyph;CFM limit required by the AFM and the 5-psi limit required by the leakage test are both conservative figures in view of today's braking system capabilities, and that the 5-psi limit was derived long before today's pressure maintaining feature which is an integral part of all locomotive brake valves. WABCO stated that front-to-rear gradient is the most important element of braking performance and that long trains with a 15-psi gradient can be operated with no problem. This commenter also mentioned that the 60&hyph;CFM limit of the AFM would allow higher leakage on shorter trains but nothing that would cause a problem in brake operations if the 15-psi gradient is maintained.
