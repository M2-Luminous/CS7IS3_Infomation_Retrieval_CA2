Some people could have died. Let us listen to Rocio Vicente: [Vicente] It has been confirmed that two people have died as a result of the terrorist attack near RTP Television. We are here with a lady. What happened? [Unidentified speaker] There had been threats [words indistinct]. That funeral home belongs to the Air Force and the one on the corner is the Navy's. They are constantly receiving threats. We are only residents of this neighborhood. We had been told to be careful, because there had been threats; these threats had been reported, but the funeral home was never protected. We live in Tepun. [Vicente] This woman was one of the victims. She was injured by the explosion at the Air Force Funeral Home, which was the site most damaged by the explosion. The explosion completely destroyed several vehicles. There are broken windows and some walls are about to collapse. Mabel Valenzuela is at another area of the site of the explosion. Go ahead, Mabel: [Valenzuela] We are with some doctors from the Social Security Institute Field Hospital. How many people have you cared for, doctor? [Unidentified speaker] The Field Hospital arrived here two minutes after the explosion. We arrived with two ambulances and tended to six patients, two of whom are Air Force members. These two patients have been taken to the Peruvian Air Force Hospital by request from Intelligence [word indistinct]. [Valenzuela] What about the others? [Doctor] Some have been sent to Revaliate Hospital, and the rest were examined here and released. [Valenzuela] You went inside the building. Could there be people in there? There are reports that two people died. [Unidentified speaker] We are here in case there are more injured people to take away. We are ready for any incident. [Valenzuela] Thank you, doctor. More firemen and Social Security Institute people are arriving to back up those already here. High-ranking Air Force officers have just arrived. They are making no statement and are entering the damaged building. [Vicente] The situation at Giron Torres Paz, in Santa Beatriz Neighborhood, a few meters away from RTP Television, is still tense. Firemen are continuing to give attention to the injured. We do not yet have the name of the person who died, but according to initial police reports, the victim could be a girl. She has already been covered with a sheet. The police and the Air Force are maintaining absolute silence.
