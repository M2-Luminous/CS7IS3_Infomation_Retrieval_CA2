He pointed out that the British unilaterally disrupted the Sino-British Joint Declaration, unilaterally tore up agreements reached between the governments of the two countries, and publicly declared that those agreements were not binding. Such an act was unexpectedly committed in the 1990's, and by a state which claims to be democratic. This has exposed to the world the reputation of the so-called democratic state. How can its sincerity be trusted if it showed no consideration for its own dignity? The authoritative person said: The British chose confrontation. Let them do it for as long as they wish. However, they must be clear that they cannot capitalize on Hong Kong for this purpose without end. We will not allow Britain or any hegemonist to lead us by the nose. The People's Government of China is not a government under the Ching Dynasty, nor like the Kuomintang Government, nor like Argentina, which can be bullied by military means. The British must be aware that if they go on with the confrontation, they will not attain their political motives. Conversely, they will lose the interests they originally had. We will certainly eliminate the influence of colonialism in Hong Kong, otherwise, we will not be able to justify ourselves to the Chinese nation. The era in which China was oppressed and controlled by others ended 45 years ago. If the British are unwilling to cooperate with us, we will no longer stretch out our hands in cooperation. It looks as if the tension and deterioration of the Sino-British relations will go on until the next century. China Keeps a Close Watch Over the Trends in Hong Kong [subhead] The source added: A senior CPC official said recently at a discussion with nonparty personalities that after the foundation of cooperation was disrupted by the British, the CPC would keep a closer watch over British moves in politics, economics, and society in Hong Kong during the transition period, in accordance with Deng Xiaoping's instructions on the Hong Kong issue. He said: We have clearly indicated that since the British chose to have confrontation rather than cooperation with China, all affairs unilaterally arranged by the British side must be terminated on 30 June 1997, and they will be examined and approved again by the sovereign state according to the Basic Law after the sovereignty of Hong Kong is handed over and the colonial rule put to an end. The "three-tier council system" masterminded and formed by the British side will also be terminated on 30 June 1997 as well. Some people spread the rumor that the British-style parliamentary system will remain in force after 1997. This is an idle dream, as well as cheap swindling, of the colonialists. The aforementioned official continued: Moreover, we have clearly and repeatedly said that if drastic political changes, turbulences, disturbances, or a runaway situation emerge during the transition period, and if people plot to turn Hong Kong into an international political city, which will lead to economic chaos in Hong Kong, we will be forced to reconsider the timing and mode of recovering Hong Kong. The official further said: We do not hope that such drastic changes, turbulences, disturbances, or a runaway situation will emerge, because Hong Kong is a territory of China, and Hong Kong compatriots are Chinese. The achievements made by Hong Kong in its construction are chiefly a crystallization of wisdom and diligence of the Hong Kong compatriots. However, as the British are playing their old tricks before pulling out of the colony, we must be prepared for the worst. Otherwise, we will commit a glaring blunder toward the Chinese nation and the Chinese people.
