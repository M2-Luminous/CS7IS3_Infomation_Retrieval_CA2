Rong Yiren said: Since China and Libya established diplomatic relations in 1978, friendly relations and cooperation in various fields between the two countries have developed continuously. The two countries share similar views on some major international issues. They have cooperated well in international organizations, supporting each other and coordinating their efforts in handling some issues. He said: China is ready to make concerted efforts with Libya to further strengthen friendship and cooperation in all fields. He expressed the conviction that al-Muntasir's visit would help further the friendly relations between the two countries. Al-Muntasir conveyed the regards of Libyan leader Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi to the Chinese Government and people. He said: Libyan leaders are devoted to strengthening and developing friendly relations and cooperation with China, hoping that such relations would be furthered. Prior to the meeting, Qian Qichen, vice premier of the State Council and foreign minister, held talks with al-Muntasir. The two sides exchanged views on bilateral relations and issues of common concern. Qian Qichen said: Since they established diplomatic relations, China and Libya have cooperated effectively in all fields. China is satisfied with this development and is willing to continue to develop friendly relations and cooperation with Libya on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence. On the Lockerbie incident, Qian Qichen said: "China has always been concerned about this issue. China opposes terrorism of any description and favors the settlement of international disputes through peaceful means. Consistent with this stand, we favor the settlement of the Lockerbie crisis through consultation and negotiation by the parties concerned. We disapprove of imposing sanctions against Libya, especially of stepping up sanctions against that country." He pointed out: Sanctions against Libya have brought suffering to the Libyan people and caused difficulties for Libya's neighbors and other countries concerned, thus escalating the tension in the region. China fully understands and sympathizes with Libya's plight and does not want to see the situation worsening. He said: China appreciates Libya's stand on settling the Lockerbie incident through peaceful negotiations, as well as the flexibility it exhibits in this regard. China appeals to the parties concerned to take measures to prevent the situation from worsening. The Chinese Government will make due efforts to this end. Al-Muntasir praised China for its important role in establishing a new world order, saying that Libya will strengthen bilateral relations with China and step up coordination and cooperation with China in international affairs. He also briefed Qian Qichen on the latest developments in the Lockerbie incident and Libya's stand on the issue, saying that Libya would resolve the international crisis through negotiation and peaceful means. Al-Muntasir arrived in Beijing on 28 March at the invitation of Qian Qichen.
