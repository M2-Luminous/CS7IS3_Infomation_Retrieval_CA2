This can be concluded from a program presented by German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel in Bonn. He proposed that the nuclear nonproliferation treaty, whose validity ends in 1995, become unlimited and that all nuclear states join it. Klaus Kinkel said that his government was ready to extend various forms of aid, including financial, to the four CIS countries. It should be mentioned that Ukraine has recently made an important step in this direction by ratifying START I and the Lisbon Protocol.
