Mark the outside of the file ``PRIORITY'' and forward it with all documentation (to include computer disk, paper screen and memorandum of opinion) to the next higher claims authority for additional payment. §536.163 Scope. (a) This subpart prescribes the substantive bases and special procedural rules for the administrative settlement of claims against the United States submitted by the Active Army, ARNG, and USAR personnel, and civilian employees of DOD and DA for damage to or loss of personal property incident to their service. This subpart also sets forth procedures for the administrative recovery from responsible third parties for loss, damage, or destruction of such personal property. The underlying Act is a gratuitous payment statute; claims thereunder do not sound in tort even though some tort concepts are used in the adjudication of claims under this subpart. Further, the Act is not designed to make the United States a total insurer of the personal property of proper claimants. (b) The maximum amount that may be paid for any loss or damage arising from a single incident is limited by the Act as amended by Public Law 100&hyph;565, 31 October 1988, to $40,000. The maximum limit of $40,000 is specifically limited to losses of personal property occurring after 31 October 1988, and to losses resulting from evacuations or from hostile acts directed against the United States or its officers and employees. A maximum limit of $25,000 is applicable to losses of personnel property occurring after 28 July 1982 and before 1 November 1988. (c) Any claim within the scope of this subpart, which otherwise would be cognizable under the MCA and subpart C; the FTCA and subpart E; the Act of 9 October 1962 (10 U.S.C. 2737) and subpart E; the NGCA and subpart F; the Maritime Claims Settlement Act and subpart H; or the FCA and subpart J will first be considered under this subpart. (1) If not payable under this subpart, the claim will be considered under the other chapters prior to any disapproval. Particular attention should be given to the nature of the claim; many alleged ``unusual occurrences'' are actually torts, either by employees or by individuals in their private capacities. While some incidents may not seem common to those experiencing them, an ``unusual occurrence'' is defined as an occurrence beyond the normal risk associated with day-to-day living and working. An unusual occurrence does not involve a reasonably foreseeable consequence of normal human activity. For example, having a vehicle hit by a golf ball while driving by a golf course or struck by an unknown vehicle in a parking lot is a reasonably foreseeable consequence of driving a vehicle. (2) If a claim cognizable under this subpart arises from an incident resulting in personal injury, no payment or emergency partial payment will be made under this chapter until an investigation completed in accordance with §§536.19 and 536.20 has been conducted. The Commander, USARCS, Chief, Personnel Claims and Recovery Division, or the chief of a command claims service may waive this requirement. Prior to payment the investigation must establish that the incident was not caused by the negligence of the claimant or an agent of the claimant. An example of such an incident would be a fire in quarters that results in an injury to a soldier's family member and was presumably caused by faulty wiring, but might have been caused by the claimant's negligence. (3) Any claim within the scope of this subpart which is also cognizable under Article 139 will first be considered under subpart I. If settlement of the Article 139 claim will be unduly protracted, the claim may be settled under this chapter and the claimant counseled to repay any overpayment if payment is later received under the provisions of subpart I. (d) Any claim cognizable under this subpart that is primarily the result of fault or negligence of a Government contractor other than a common carrier or warehouse firm will first be referred to the contractor or his or her insurer for settlement in accordance with DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 2&hyph;6. §536.163 Claimants. (a) A claim may be presented under this subpart only by_ (1) A member of the Active Army. (2) A member of the USAR or the ARNG who is engaged in inactive duty for training or in active duty training. (3) A civilian employee of DA; a civilian employee of the ARNG funded under 32 U.S.C. 709; a civilian employee of the DOD who is not an employee of the Department of the Navy or the Department of the Air Force; or a continental wage scale, local wage scale, and other foreign national local civilian employees. (See DODD 5515.10.) However, the claims of a DOD dependent school teachers and Defense Commissary Agency civilian employees will be settled by the Service operating the installation where that school teacher/Commissary Agency employee is employed. (4) The authorized agent or legal representative of paragraphs (a) (1) through (3) of this section. However, any claim presented by a claims preparation service or other hired agent must be signed and ratified by the proper claimant to preclude assignment of claims, regardless of whether the claimant has executed a power of attorney. (5) The survivors of paragraphs (a) (1) through (3) of this section in the following order of precedence: (i) Spouse. (ii) Child or children.
