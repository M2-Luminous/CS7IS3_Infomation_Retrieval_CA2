Speaking on Wednesday, Gaydar said all those people were most likely "to take newly-formed militant units to the streets in the next few months and I am sure there will be renewed violence". The RC leader also said that under the new constitution, the president has no powers to veto the Duma resolution. One other RC leader Gennadiy Burbulis who also voted against the resolution said: "It is very enticing to speak in terms of civic peace or being destined for accord but there is great concern when such noble ideas are being resolved with political impropriety and legal incorrectness". For his part, Communist Party chief Gennadiy Zyuganov said the amnesty for those imprisoned on charges of involvement in last October's events meant that those people "who defended the Constitution will now be able to do so not in Lefortovo Prison but in normal conditions". One other Communist deputy and defendant in the case of the 1991 failed coup Anatoliy Lukyanov told Interfax that the amnesty resolution was "a logical step on the way to internal stability". However, he is perfectly sure that there can be "no genuine reconciliation unless the government changes its policy by dropping shock treatment of the economy". Lukyanov does not believe that the situation will go out of hand just because about 50 prisoners will be released and charges against them dropped. In his view, leader of the right-wing Russian National Unity Aleksandr Barkashov and leader of the Russian Workers' Communist Party Viktor Anpilov "had enough time for a rethink to prevent what happened from being repeated". "I am sure that fascist ideas will not work here", Lukyanov said. LDP [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy has described the Duma resolution as "a historic moment of reconciliation and shedding the burden of historic mistakes". In a speech to the Duma, he called to close "dark pages and express sympathy and forgive all victims". At the same time, Zhirinovskiy called on the president "not to sabotage the Duma resolution" and the government to take measures to enforce it. One other deputy Vasiliy Lipitskiy says that former Vice President Aleksandr Rutskoy will again lead the People's Party of Free Russia when set free. For his part, leader of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord Sergey Shakhray stressed that he and the PRUC were opposed to spreading the amnesty for those "taking up arms and perpetrating criminal offences during the events of last September and October".
