As is the custom in the West, the 65-year-old Gelhan is not a professional military man but a politician. He was one of the founders of the ruling Correct Way Party in Turkey. Prior to being appointed to his present post, he served as minister of state in the Tansu Ciler Cabinet. By a convergence of circumstances the visit by the head of the Turkish military ministry to Russia coincided with a drastic exacerbation of the situation in the former Yugoslavia, as well as with stepped-up activities between Azerbaijan and Armenia. Since Turkey has interests in both areas, it has proposed its own alternatives for resolving the conflict. This set of issues will undoubtedly be the primary subject of discussion during talks with Russia's military leadership. The main purpose of the visit, however, is still one of further developing bilateral technical military cooperation. It is no secret that a significant portion of the armament of Turkey's army does not measure up to contemporary requirements, and Turkey is interested in modernizing them with new purchases abroad. in October 1992 Turkey was the first NATO country to conclude an agreement with Russia on shipments of weapons and combat equipment, including helicopters and armored equipment. In May of last year the heads of the military ministries of the two countries signed a memorandum of mutual understanding calling for bilateral cooperation in the areas of military training and the defense industry. The signing of these agreements, especially the former, evoked a clear-cut reaction in the West. However, from all accounts, it will not pose an obstacle to the development of interaction between Russia and Turkey in the military area.
