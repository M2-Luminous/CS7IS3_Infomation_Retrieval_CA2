Renzoli [not further identified] said, privately, that wild changes are being made here in all the nation's telephones. Good morning, Roche. [Roche] Good morning. Well, with the objective of reorganizing the telephone network in the city of Havana so as to allow the possibility of increased numerical combinations, at the telephone exchange for those numbers that begin with a seven and have five digits, as of Friday 29 April, people will have to add an eight to the number, giving those numbers six digits. For example, the number 7-2020 will, as of Friday, become 78-2020. This measure is being taken by the telephone company to reorganize its boards [pizarras] here in the capital. [Announcer] So, now you know. [Roche] The phone numbers beginning with seven will, as of the 29th, have six digits. People must now add an eight after the initial seven.
