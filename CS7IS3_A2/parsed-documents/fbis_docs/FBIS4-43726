At a meeting in Bonn with several hundred representatives of private civic groups that are rendering practical assistance to East Europe, SPD chairman Rudolf Scharping criticized the government for limiting itself to the organization of transfers of money. "The result of this is that rich advisers are staying in poor countries," he said. Scharping pointed out that to eliminate the vicious circle of escape and deportation, "East Europe must not be wasted away economically, socially, and, above all, philanthropically. My party's aim is to strengthen the involvement of private citizens in the Federal Republic." The representatives of the private aid initiatives complained about the government's bureaucratic obstacles to their work. Some of these obstacles have actually induced a few charitable organizations to discontinue their work, it was said. There are new customs and tax rules all the time, and even applications for a reimbursement of the costs of transporting aid are brushed aside in Bonn. "In the GDR, old vehicles are rusting away that are urgently required in the south of Europe," was another complaint from a participant in the meeting. For six months, some of the charities have been waging a "private war" with ministries in Bonn to acquire a well-worn ambulance to send to Romania. "There is a lot we could do, but we cannot do anything without the proper infrastructure," one woman complained. Scharping mentioned the possibility of deploying the Bundeswehr to deliver aid to East Europe. Apart from that, the Bundeswehr should make out of date equipment available for East European aid. Finally, in every recipient country there should be coordination units to relieve the charitable organizations of the burdens of bureaucracy. SPD Bundestag Deputy Gernot Erler complains that the government was doing next to nothing in the elimination of nuclear and chemical weapons in Russia. "The destruction of these weapons agreed to in the treaty is not possible on account of absent technology. While the United States has offered the Russians 1 billion marks [DM] in aid for the process of disarmament, Bonn has offered them all of DM10 million," says Erler.
