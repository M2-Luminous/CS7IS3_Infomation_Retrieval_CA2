The Muslim leadership does not like the policy pursued by the leadership of the Tuzla municipality, since it affects also the different trends and political divisions in the Muslim leadership in Sarajevo, and blunts the fighting fervor against Serbs. In accordance with the radical policy of Muslim leader Alia Izetbegovic, new orders for mobilization have been issued in the Tuzla region in order to continue the offensive on Serbian positions towards Brcko and east of Tuzla towards Doboj, Trebava and Podrinja, a region under Serbian control in Bosnia. Izetbegovic ordered last week his forces to capture Doboj and its surroundings, whatever the cost. In the last few days, Muslim units have been reinforced to launch an offensive on Serbian sttlements and positions on the Mountain Majevica, east of Tuzla. The brigade was reinforced by the so-called Sarajevo Muslim Army Corps, whose forces have been transferred from central Bosnia following the signing of the accord with Croats and the placing of heavy weaponry around Sarajevo under U.N. control.
