After Karadzic's fascists literally razed to the ground all the villages on the outskirts of town and massacred and burnt hundreds of people in the villages around Gorazde, this morning they launched a fierce onslaught from the direction of Foca on (Osana) and Ilovaca. Thousands of fascists are moving from the direction of the Praca River valley toward Orahovice and Zorovici. Over 50 new tanks are on the move as are thousands of artillery pieces. A fierce Chetnik offensive has been launched from the direction of (?Deseva) toward (?Ranje) and Ostro. Dozens of the most destructive shells are landing in the town's center every minute. There are dozens of massacred, heavily wounded lying in the streets. No one can help them as the entire town is under heavy artillery and sniper fire. About 700 wounded in the war hospital have been left to die since there is a lack of even the most basic of medicines. There are also no bandages. At the moment of filing this report, we received the information that the aggressor has fired chemical agents at the war hospital. The town of Gorazde is dying despite all the appeals and warnings of these people sent to domestic, European, and international institutions. According to the latest information, dozens of thousands of new refugees are heading for the town center. The aggressor is firing at them with mortars and tanks. Your correspondent from this town has no words to describe the horror in this area. The members of our army are still courageously resisting the onslaught of the fascists, but the question is how long they will be able to endure. It is a question of hours before Gorazde becomes the next Vukovar.
