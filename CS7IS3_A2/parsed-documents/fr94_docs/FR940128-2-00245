FR940128-2-00245 FR940128-2-00159 II. Implementation of Subpart I as Applied to NRC-Licensed Facilities Other Than Nuclear Power Reactors Subpart I became effective on November 16, 1992 for all categories of facilities licensed by NRC or Agreement States except for commercial nuclear power reactors. Subpart I was already in effect prior to that time for federal facilities not operated by DOE. At this time, EPA has not taken final administrative action concerning the rule to rescind subpart I for NRC and Agreement State licensees other than commercial nuclear power reactors which it proposed on December 1, 1992. EPA is recommending that NRC make certain changes in its regulatory program in order to fully support the substantive finding which is required by CAA Section 112(d)(9) before EPA may rescind subpart I for NRC licensees other than commercial nuclear power reactors. EPA and NRC are presently engaged in consultations concerning specific actions which would strengthen the basis for rescission of subpart I for this category, but it is unlikely that any agreement between EPA and NRC concerning additional measures could be implemented quickly. While the rulemaking concerning rescission is still pending, EPA advises all facilities not to presume that EPA will take any particular action in that rulemaking and to proceed in the meantime with all legally required compliance activities. Because subpart I first took effect for NRC and Agreement State licensees other than nuclear power reactors near the end of 1992, EPA has determined that affected facilities were not required to demonstrate compliance with subpart I for calendar year 1992. However, each NRC or Agreement State licensee, as well as each federal facility not operated by DOE, is now subject to all provisions of subpart I. Each affected facility must demonstrate compliance for calendar year 1993 with the annual emission standard set forth in 40 CFR 61.102, utilizing the procedures specified in 40 CFR 61.103. Those facilities which are not exempt from reporting requirements under 40 CFR 61.104(b) must submit the annual report concerning emissions for calendar year 1993 required by 40 CFR 61.104(a) to EPA by March 31, 1994. Facilities that are unable to gather the necessary information and report to EPA by March 31, 1994 should request an extension from the appropriate EPA regional office listed below. EPA will consider extensions of up to 60 days. As required by 40 CFR 61.04, all requests, reports, applications, submittals, and other communications to EPA pursuant to the standards in subpart I should be submitted in duplicate to the appropriate Regional Office of the EPA to the attention of the Director of the Division indicated in the following list of EPA Regional Offices: Region I (Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont), Director, Air, Pesticides, and Toxics Management Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, John F.
