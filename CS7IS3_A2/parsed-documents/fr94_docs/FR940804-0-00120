FR940804-0-00120 FR940804-0-00024 The definition of ``controlling individual'' is intended to encompass those individuals who typically are part of the organization's control group. A controlling individual under this definition must: (1) be a current employee or member of the organization; (2) hold a high-level position with the organization; (3) participate ``as a decision maker in the determination of the organization's legal position in the proceeding or investigation of the subject matter;'' and (4) be known by the government to be engaged in such activities. This definition attempts to identify those limited number of individuals affiliated with the organization who actually are involved in determining the organization's position with regard to the legal proceeding or investigation. One individual and one organization questioned limiting the class of employees who should be considered ``controlling individuals'' for purposes of this subsection to those who participate in framing the organization's legal position in the matter. They argued that the proposed ``controlling individual'' test authorizes contacts with employees who, while not directing the organization's counsel, nonetheless have extensive authority to act on behalf of the organization. The underlying concern of these comments appears to be that this paragraph, as proposed, authorizes contacts with many employees who are likely to possess information relevant to claims asserted against the corporation and who have the capacity to make statements that a court will deem admissible at trial as evidentiary admissions against the corporation. This is certainly true. However, the Department believes that its anti-contact rule should not be designed with the goal of protecting corporations from disclosure of prejudicial facts. See, e.g., Action Air Freight v. Pilot Air Freight, 769 F. Supp. 899, 903 (E.D. Pa. 1991) (anti-contact rule ``should not necessarily chill the flow of harmful information''); Hanntz v. Shiley, Inc., 766 F. Supp. 258, 267 (D.N.J. 1991) (``the policies of Rule 4.2 do not justify a wholesale restriction on discovery of factual information, damaging or not''). Anti-contact rules such as DR 7&hyph;104 and Model Rule 4.2 are intended to protect the attorney-client relationship from unnecessary interference and to protect represented parties from overreaching by opposing counsel. Damage to the attorney-client relationship inheres particularly in communications with high-level corporate employees who have contact with the corporation's attorneys in the course of making ultimate decisions regarding choice of counsel, implementing counsel's advice, and determining settlement and other litigation strategies. Therefore, communications with those high-level individuals affiliated with or employed by an organization who are responsible for employing and directing the organization's counsel and for determining legal positions taken by the organization are the type of communications prohibited by DR 7&hyph;104. Accordingly, this paragraph defines ``controlling individual'' consistently with the principles underlying the disciplinary rules on ex parte contacts. The Department also believes that the alternative approaches urged by commenters would impose unacceptable constraints on federal law enforcement. Therefore, this paragraph has not been changed. Paragraph (b): Communications with former employees; organizational representation. This paragraph authorizes communications with former employees of represented organizations. Because former employees do not direct the affairs of the organization and therefore cannot be considered members of the ``control group'' or any other controlling entity of an organization, communications with them are not considered communications with the organization for purposes of the rule. This reasoning is consistent with the conclusion of the majority of federal courts that have held that DR 7&hyph;104(A)(1) does not bar communications with former employees of a represented corporate party. See, e.g., Hanntz v. Shiley, Inc., 766 F. Supp. 258, 267 & n.8 (D.N.J. 1991); Action Air Freight, Inc. v. Pilot Air Freight Corp., 769 F. Supp. 899, 904 (E.D. Pa. 1991); Shearson Lehman Bros., Inc. v. Wasatch Bank, 139 F.R.D. 412, 417&hyph;18 (D. Utah 1991); Sherrod v. Furniture Center, 769 F. Supp. 1021, 1022 (W.D. Tenn. 1991); Dubois v. Gradco Systems, Inc., 136 F.R.D. 341, 345 n.4 (D. Conn. 1991); Polycast Technology Corp. v. Uniroyal, Inc., 129 F.R.D. 621, 628 (S.D.N.Y. 1990). See also ABA Comm. on Ethics and Professional Responsibility, Formal Op. 359 (1991) (``Accordingly, it is the opinion of the Committee that a lawyer representing a client in a matter adverse to a corporate party that is represented by another lawyer may, without violating Model Rule 4.2, communicate about the subject of the representation with an unrepresented former employee of the corporate party without the consent of the corporation's lawyer.''). But see PPG Industries, Inc. v. BASF Corp., 134 F.R.D. 118, 121 (W.D. Pa. 1990); Public Serv. Elec. & Gas v. Associated Elec. & Gas, 745 F. Supp. 1037, 1042 (D.N.J. 1990).
