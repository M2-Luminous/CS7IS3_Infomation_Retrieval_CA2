And the primary goal, of course, is to preserve the accomplishments attained over these years. However, abroad, in Florida specifically, there are those who have plans that differ from these changes. What is the alternative they advocate? [Sexto] I could answer with a cliche, a standard phrase, or slogan and say that Cuba has no other alternative but socialism; but it seems to me that this is not the time for jaded phrases, slogans, or cliches. I believe it is time for arguments, for thinking, for meditation. Evidently, speaking clearly, Cuba has no other alternative, but then something curious happens. The changes taking place today in Cuba, changes aimed at reversing the crisis we are experiencing today, aimed at perfecting the economic means of our society, are seem by some as a form of frustration. In other words, some people, including honest Cubans, believe that everything being done in Cuba -- tourism, investments by foreign companies, hard currency decriminalization -- are measures that forcibly lead to capitalism. This is, of course, an opinion that in certain cases I understand, because it is shaped by a very agonizing or desperate view of the situation. Others, of course, believe that these changes, this path, frees them from any commitments, and they are very opportunistically moving to the opposite path to take free shots at the Revolution which yesterday gave them everything, including an opportunity to develop their talents, potential, and raise and educate a family without major problems. Both opinions, however, are wrong. Cuba is not headed toward capitalism. That would be silly because it would mean opposing ourselves. Cuba is engaged in a hard, burdensome struggle to overcome this objective period. This is an objective period of economic crisis designed to preserve this whole project which for 35 years has shaped the lives of Cubans. [Roque] All this is being done to reinsert Cuba in the world of today, from which it cannot remain apart. [Sexto] Exactly. I believe that at the beginning of the special period Carlos Lage said in an interview that Cuba is making a socialist opening to a capitalist world. I believe that everything should be seem from this perspective, which is a very broad vision, a vision that has to be flexible because it is subjected one way or another to the demands of a reality that changes very frequently and is at present very hostile. Cuba, of course, has to have the flexibility required to adapt to the emergencies of the times. [Roque] These are paths we cannot relinquish. We are discussing the alternatives advocated by the enemies of the Revolution. [Sexto] Something curious happens: While certain highly concerned Cubans fear that Cuba might be moving toward capitalism, fear that the Communist Party of Cuba, the Revolution, the Cuban social project might end up being a capitalist society, others, at home and abroad, are thinking about pushing Cuba toward capitalism. [Roque] What are the alternatives they advocate? [Sexto] We cannot speak of alternatives, we have to speak of an alternative. For example, what would be the program of a counterrevolutionary government in Cuba? [Roque] I can imagine it. [Sexto] I believe that any intelligent Cuban knows what the alternative is. I took the time to research the information, read magazines, read cables, and I made a synopsis of the alternative that a counterrevolutionary government might offer the Cuban people, who they claim are greatly burdened. [Roque] For example, there is the Cuban American National Foundation [CANF]. [Sexto] The CANF is the most powerful lobby in the United States. It is the most powerful for the simple reason that it has the most money and because until recently it enjoyed absolute support from U.S. administrations. It is a counterrevolutionary association created by businessmen. That is enough to make one apprehensive, for one to begin to worry. It is a group made up of businessmen that advocates an alternative for Cuba. [Roque] These businessmen, of course, make monthly contributions to the foundation. [Sexto] That group had up to a few years ago approximately 50,000 contributors, of course, businessmen. A few years back it had a membership of 276,000 people. All these figures should be taken with a grain of salt. There is no doubt that these figures may have been altered, there is no doubt that the CANF leaders might be saying that they have more supporters than what they have in reality. You know that Miami politics are a little extreme. [Roque] Coming back to the issue: the alternative of the Miami-based CNAF. [Sexto] What does the chairman of this organization, millionaire Jorge Mas Canosa, advocate? Mas Canosa believes that poverty ends with private ownership. We would have to ask him if he became rich sharing his money with the poor. That is the first question I would ask Mas Canosa. Mas Canosa believes that economic progress is only attained with a free market. We would have to ask Mas Canosa if the good life for 30 or 40 percent of the population in exchange for the poverty, pain, and misery of the other 60 or 70 percent could be called economic progress. Is it economic progress maintaining balanced budgets at the expense of the pain of the hungry, working majorities. I believe that all this is highly debatable. For the CANF and its president, the economic progress of Cuba can only be attained by becoming dependent on the United States. Of course, for a smart Cuban, all this is highly suspicious. I believe that we would have to say: Hey buddy, don't bother to defend me. What kind of an option is that? You are giving me the rock and the hard place option. [Roque] We are discussing the alternatives advocated by the enemies of the Revolution. When I said alternatives, it is because we are going to refer not only to the one advocated by the CNAF but also to that of other groups which are not that far from that idea. [Sexto] A few Sundays ago, the JUVENTUD REBELDE newspaper published an interview by journalist Luis Baez with a counterrevolutionary pundit named Tony Cuesta, whose crimes I believe everyone is familiar with. I believe that he recently passed away due to a heart attack. The interview was conducted when Cuesta was released from prison. He was jailed following an infiltration. A grenade had exploded in his hand; the Revolution's doctors saved his life. He served a few years in jail, was later released, and returned to Miami. In that interview, which was published many years after it took place, Tony Cuesta said that the great problem of the counterrevolution had been that it did not have an ideology, that the lack of an ideology had disunited them and that that had been their disadvantage in confronting the Cuban Revolution, which is a tightly knitt group of ideas, a highly cohesive political body. I, of course, do not share this opinion. I believe that the Cuban counterrevolution does have an ideology. Its failure against the Cuban social project, the Revolution, is due to the fact that that ideology suffers much in a comparison with ours. It is not the lack of an ideology. Therefore, those groups have an ideology -- in this case a bourgeoisie ideology, a capitalist ideology. Anyhow, all these groups hostile to the Cuban Revolution hope for a return of capitalism in Cuba, of capitalism with its entire structures and laws. [Roque] And therefore their platforms. [Sexto] And therefore their platforms with some minor differences. For example, a few months ago I read an article by Carlos Alberto Montaner, the leader of the so-called Cuban Liberal Union, the heir of the liberals whot fled in disarray. He said in the articles published in the Miami NUEVO EL HERALD that Cuba, under a different regime, under different circumstances should never hope for economic development, that that was an idealistic chimera. He goes on to say that Cuba should forget its hope to develop the sugar industry because, in the end, sugar is worth nine cents, that it was better for Cuba to grow flowers, that Cuba would become wealthy selling flowers to Florida, of course, if the United States were to allow Cuba to export its flowers to Florida. More or less, you can see the ideas advocated by these men. [Roque] That is his alternative. [Sexto] That is his alternative. It seem laughable coming from a man with pretensions of being an intellectual. [Roque] There also are platforms or alternatives advocated by dissidents at home. [Sexto] I believe that the so-called dissidents at home.... [changes thought] I find it hard to use the term dissident. I fully agree with Silvio Rodriguez [Cuban singer], when he says that we have let them steal that word from us. A dissident is he who disagrees. A revolutionary can disagree with something he thinks is not right. That is a revolutionary attitude. We have lost the word dissident, and I find it hard to refer to dissidents within Cuba. I do not believe they are dissidents at home. [Roque] They are counterrevolutionaries. [Sexto] They are counterrevolutionaries. What alternative do they advocate for Cuba? The same as Mas Canosa: dependency on the United States; a return to capitalism. And in the political arena: freedom and democracy. This is even the motto of the CANF. We could think that the Cuban who today lives in Miami, mostly controlled by the influence of the powerful CANF, lacks the liberty to even express himself. We have spoken in this program about the Americas Watch investigation that concluded that freedom of speech in Miami is fully suppressed by the prevailing counterrevolutionary thinking. What freedom can we speak of? What democracy? We would have to ask Mas Canosa if in the future parliament he wants to organize in Cuba, the communist will be represented. [Roque] Summarizing: There is a congruence among all these platforms, those abroad and those at home. [Sexto] The alternative advocated by the counterrevolution is capitalism. The alternative advocated by the Cuban Revolution is socialism. There is no other alternative. All Cubans have to agree. All Cubans should think with national awareness. Cuba is only saved through the Revolution's options. There is no other way. [Roque] Start thinking.
