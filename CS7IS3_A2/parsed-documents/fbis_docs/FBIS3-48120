Japanese officials who attended the day's two separate sessions later told reporters that they had decided to leave the contentious issue of objective criteria for negotiations at a plenary subcabinet session beginning Monday. Senior officials from Japan's foreign and trade ministries met behind closed doors for five and half hours Sunday with a U.S. counterpart -- deputy U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshevsky -- to address two areas in the wide-ranging framework trade talks. One area concerns ways to increase foreign access and sales in Japan's government procurements, and the other seeks to address U.S. concern on the implementation of existing bilateral trade agreements. Japanese officials said talks on how to monitor the implementation of existing trade accords on such market sectors as semiconductor, paper and glass drew little dissent from both sides. After a two-hour meeting that was described as "friendly and lively" between Japan's Vice Minister for International Trade and Industry Sozaburo Okamatsu and Barshevsky, the two sides struck an agreement on how to monitor past trade accords, Japanese officials said. The two sides agreed on three principles -- "objective description of the situation," stating "different positions in a balanced manner," and mutual efforts "to resolving any factual misunderstanding" -- as the basis for keeping track of existing trade pacts, the officials said. Japanese officials, however, conceded that there was little attempt in a separate set of talks Sunday between Deputy Foreign Minister Koichiro Matsuura and Barshevsky to bridge the gap on ways to set up "objective criteria" for measuring foreign access to Japan's government procurement market. "We will talk about it at the plenary session tomorrow," a Japanese official said, noting that the issue of objective criteria is also linked to separate negotiations on foreign access to Japan's automobile and insurance markets. Senior U.S. officials have said the framework trade talks must produce "tangible progress" in foreign access to Japanese markets, and have suggested using import levels in other industrial countries as yardsticks for gauging the openness of the Japanese markets. Tokyo has balked at the idea, arguing that market shares, or any measurements that "smack" of market-share arrangements, run counter to free trade. Japanese officials Sunday sought to draw the line on what type of "objective criteria" is acceptable to Tokyo, saying that the Japanese Government would not mind using past economic data -- such as the value of imports in specific market sectors -- as indicators of progress in foreign access to Japanese markets. "Anything that suggests a future target is out of the question," said a senior Japanese official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The Japanese and U.S. principals involved in negotiations on the government procurement, auto, and insurance market sectors are supposed to complete a progress report on their talks by the time Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton meet in Washington on February 11. U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen has warned Tokyo that the U.S. Government would rather junk the framework talks rather than accept "any cosmetic agreement." "If we do not have credible agreements by the time of the (February 11) summit, we would have to reexamine the basis of the framework," Bentsen told reporters on Sunday after a short visit to Tokyo.
