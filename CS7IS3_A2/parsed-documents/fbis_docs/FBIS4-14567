Russia Leases Space Launch Facility for 20 Years"] [Text] After the collapse of the USSR, Baykonur suddenly became a "bone of contention," a "disputed issue" between Russia and Kazakhstan. This immense and extremely complicated complex, which occupies tens of thousands of hectares and has 12 launch pads, as before, embodies the cutting edge of scientific and technical progress. Who would have thought, 40 years ago, when they were selecting the site of the "harbor of the Universe," that in time the space launch facility would end up on the territory of another state? Baykonur was built entirely by the Soviet Union, which invested immense material funds in it (and the lion's share came from Russia). Many of our present difficulties could have been avoided if the separation of the USSR into individual states had proceeded, as it were, more smoothly, taking into account the complex problems and mutual interests, and if issues of fundamental significance for Russia (including Baykonur) had been resolved in a calm situation, enlisting experts, on the basis of in-depth preliminary development. But history had its own ideas. After the collapse of the USSR difficult times befell the space launch facility. The ambiguity of its status, the general confusion, the rupture of economic ties, the sharp reduction of financing under conditions of the severe crisis being experienced by Russia--all this placed Baykonur on the verge of ruin. Buildings and roads are being destroyed, the spacious installation and testing facilities are in need of repair... Not so long ago there were 100,000 people living in Leninsk--the capital of the space launch facility--and today there are no more than 60. It is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain the discipline so necessary in the space center. Recently a fire was reported in the assembly-testing facility, which previously would have been quite impossible to imagine. But, still, more than 20 planned launches were carried out from Baykonur last year. But this required immense efforts... At the same time Kazakhstan, which had received the space gift, had to decide what to do with the space launch facility after that. Negotiations with Russia began. And then from somewhere came the figure of $7 billion--as much as was initially demanded by representatives of Kazakhstan for "damage caused to the earth in Kazakhstan" during all the time of Baykonur's existence. This is evidence not only of an unrealistic approach to the problem but also of a desire (in general, understandable) to "squeeze" as much as possible out of the situation that had developed. Russia began to think seriously about building a new space launch facility near the missile compound Svobodnyy-18 in Amur Oblast and expanding the Plesetsk space launch facility in Arkhangelsk Oblast. In turn, Kazakhstan and Ukraine tried to interest the United States in Baykonur, but that turned out to be not so easy... It became clear that deciding the fate of Baykonur could not be put off any longer. Recently negotiations have been proceeding on a more even-handed, realistic basis. Representatives of Kazakhstan were asking hundreds of millions of dollars as payment for rent. Before the meeting of Presidents B. Yeltsin and N. Nazarbayev, things became especially heated in the negotiations among the experts; it was, as musicians say, a "crescendo." The specialists met daily including last Friday, and Saturday, and Sunday, and sometimes the discussion became very bitter. Clarification of disputed issues sometimes dragged out until after midnight. Ultimately their positions came closer together, although a number of disagreements still remained. The Russians agreed to pay $82 million a year for rent. But Kazakhstan was insisting on 150 million. The presidents would have to find a compromise. And they found it; they settled on the sum of $115 million. Of course, this is a considerable sum. Let us recall that, by participating in the creation of the international orbital station, Russia will receive $100 million from NASA (United States) each year. This, as we can see, is less than the rent for Baykonur for a year. Moreover, Russia is bearing the immense costs of maintaining the space facility. Last year it amounted to R39.6 billion (in last year's prices) and this year, according to estimates from specialists, it will take more than 250 billion. But still, adding up the pluses and minuses, one can say with confidence that the agreement signed by the presidents of the two countries concerning Baykonur is a very important and mutually advantageous step which can only be welcomed. Russia has neither the forces nor the money to build a new space facility today. And linked to Baykonur is the implementation of large-scale, long-term international programs (in particular, it is planned to have repeated flights of American astronauts to Mir within the framework of the project for creating a Russian-American orbital station). These programs produce considerable currency revenues, without which it would be hard for domestic space science to survive. On the other hand, Kazakhstan too will receive a great advantage from leasing the space facility to Russia. It is especially important to emphasize that, in keeping with the conditions of the agreement, the rights to ownership of movable and immovable property which has appeared since 31 August 1991 in Baykonur will belong to Russia. That is, now Moscow can invest money in Baykonur without fear of losing if there is an unfavorable development of events. The agreement specifies that the term of the lease will be 20 years with an option to extend it another 10 years. The space facility will be serviced by Russian citizens. The agreement signed by the presidents is a "framework" agreement. On its basis will be developed a leasing agreement, which is to be signed in the near future. And so, after two years of uncertainty, negotiations that would become lively and then die down, mutual suspicions and reproaches, Russia and Kazakhstan have finally taken a serious step toward one another, resolving in a civilized manner one of the most difficult and painful issues in relations between our countries. A good sign!
