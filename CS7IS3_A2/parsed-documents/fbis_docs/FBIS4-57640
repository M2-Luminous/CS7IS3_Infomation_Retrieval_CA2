What dangers and opportunities is Colombia currently facing, and how will you handle these issues? [Samper] My government's economic policies will attempt to consolidate economic opening and to channel benefits from economic development to all of Colombia and its people through a program designed to step up economic growth, create 1.5 million new useful jobs, and implement ambitious and modern social policies. Colombia's greatest opportunity is to invest intelligently and carefully in tapping new oil fields, such as Cusiana, to vigorously promote the socio-economic development of the country and all of its regions. As for the greatest danger facing Colombia, it is undoubtedly the revaluation of the peso, which could harm exports, agriculture, the industrial sector, and other production activities. We need to implement the following plans: a macroeconomic policy geared toward preventing peso revaluations and keeping low interest rates to reduce inflation; a Strategic Exporting Plan to double secondary exports within four years; a Countryside Recovery Plan to enable peasants to regain their jobs and income; an Industrial Modernization Plan to spark growth of more than 7.5 percent annually and to make industries more competitive; an ambitious program to support mini- and mid-sized enterprises to take advantage of their job-creating potential; priority programs to invest in people, education, health, housing, infrastructure, and technological development; and a special training and job-placement program for those groups that encounter more difficulties when hunting for jobs (youths, female heads of household, unemployed elderly people, and handicapped people). [Pastrana] The economic policies I will implement during my administration will focus on broadening, improving, and streamlining the structural reforms that make the economy more efficient and more competitive internationally. They also will set standards for the economy to grow at a sustainable 8-percent annual rate, will create well-paying jobs for a highly skilled labor, will promote adequate protection of the environment, and will advocate an increased standard of living for the poorest people. The nation's best opportunity stems from the exchange of products, services, and ideas that the world community has to offer and that will allow Colombia to make a great leap forward in its socioeconomic development process. Moreover, oil resources must let us reinforce this process by implementing an investment program in the areas of infrastructure, education, health, science, and technology. The greatest danger facing the nation revolves around yielding to the temptation of closing the economy by establishing barriers that will encourage inefficiency and hold the country back. The best way to take advantage of these opportunities and to avoid these dangers is to reward the efforts of companies and workers in order to improve their production by aligning their efforts by way of educational programs, which are the only mechanisms that will make these efforts viable, and to offer assistance to those who cannot take full advantage of the nation's new opportunities because of structural or institutional hurdles. [passage omitted] The tools I will use are: A. A strategic commercial policy that will combine economic opening with an export policy that supports technology, marketing, the financing of successful projects, and negotiations with foreign governments; legal and economic support in international conflicts; and finally, strict and firm action in matters such as unfair competition and barriers to competition. B. A reform of the educational system and science and technology to convert education and knowledge into a factor of production. C. A public investment program with fiscal discipline and the modernization of the public sector. D. The promotion of private savings and investment through reforms to the financial system and the stock market, as well as support for new forms of institutional savings. E. Legal reforms to eliminate obstacles for the participation of the private sector in the financing, implementation, and administration of public works and services. F. The presentation of bills that will prevent and correct the already mentioned barriers to competition. G. The reorganization of the regional decentralization process to guarantee autonomy accompanied by responsibility. [EL TIEMPO] What can Colombians expect in terms of those areas the next government will highlight in its budget? [Samper] In my government, public investment will be devoted to human capital (in areas such as health, education, and low-income housing), infrastructure (roads, energy supply, telecommunications, and land improvement), and technological development. [Pastrana] Education, potable water, infrastructure (roads, energy, communications, irrigation districts), health, research, and training and technical assistance in rural areas will be my priorities in terms of public investment. [passage omitted] [EL TIEMPO] What will happen to economic opening? Will you modify it? How will you handle the concentration of wealth caused by it? [Samper] 1. Our intention is to consolidate opening with the aim to increase exports and to create jobs so that the people will benefit from it. We will implement the second phase of the opening--the social phase. I will establish the principle of "reciprocity" in international trade negotiations. 2. We must confuse "integration" with "concentration." The country is interested in having strong, integrated enterprises, but only as long as they do not use their strength to form monopolies. To fight such practices, I will first use international competition that results from the opening. Second, I will resort to legal and administrative measures, such as the ones I created when I was in the Development Ministry. When public assets are privatized, the proceeds must go to the general public in order not to concentrate them in a few hands. [Pastrana] 1. I will maintain economic opening by placing more emphasis on the microeconomic aspects of the reforms, strengthening mechanisms against unfair competition, improving customs, helping enterprises to run smoothly, and helping producers who are facing structural impediments to enable them to respond to increased competition. 2. The opening only leads to the concentration of wealth when it is not accompanied by measures that will engender real opportunities in all regions, enterprises, and workers. For this reason, we must immediately strengthen economic opening with investments in infrastructure, education, technical assistance for producers, adequate information systems, and stabilization funds for the rural sector. In addition, all of this must be done within the law, under a true regional decentralization, and in a responsible way in an effort to discourage any anticompetitive behavior. [passage omitted] [EL TIEMPO] Will the minimum wage prove to be adequate? Your decision will affect the lives of the Colombian people; how will the wage increase be calculated? [Samper] I will urge businessmen and workers to sign a Social Pact that will allow us to generate more and better jobs, increase productivity, and heighten purchasing power. The pact will seek to make all salaries rise in real terms in proportion with the increases in productivity while keeping inflationary pressures and the peso revaluation under control. [Pastrana] A decision on a minimum wage will have to take the following into consideration: A. The independence of all other price structures in the economy. B. Labor market conditions. C. Better measures to constantly improve the income of less qualified workers. D. On-the-job productivity. E. An agreement among workers, employers, and the government. In this agreement, each party will assume its share of responsibility to reduce inflation, maintain macroeconomic stability, and promote greater competition of national products. [passage omitted] [EL TIEMPO] Services, gasoline, and transportation. The state is in charge of setting price and fare adjustments. How will you do this in the next administration? [Samper] The prices and fares controlled by the state permit the expansion and improvement of the financial underpinnings of public service enterprises, but only as long as these enterprises are run efficiently. If they are run efficiently, then the government can adjust fares in accordance with price and salary adjustments, thereby allowing the state to stop giving a "bad example" in the social adjustment of the economy. [passage omitted] [Pastrana] The country is increasingly closer to giving up its control over charges for public services and markedly reducing the gasoline subsidy. This does not necessarily mean that there will be a sustained increase in the prices of either. I intend to move quickly in this direction. In terms of public services, a strict state regulation of enterprises, when combined as much possible with greater competition, will guarantee that these enterprises will not transfer the cost of their inefficiency or their financial mismanagement to the public. In the case of gasoline, the outlook for national and international petroleum allows us to think of the feasibility of a four-year plan to free the oil market. ECOPETROL [Colombian Petroleum Enterprises] can use its refining capacity to stabilize internal oil prices. This process will be accompanied by the liberation of transportation fares within a strict framework of state regulation to guarantee quality, coverage, and safety to passengers. [EL TIEMPO] How will the Cusiana oil fields affect us? We are at the beginning of an oil bonanza. How will we manage these resources and distribute the benefits? [Samper] We will create a Fund for Oil Stabilization that will keep part of these resources overseas during the years of maximum production to allow us to maintain high investment levels a few years later when production in these oil fields has begun to decline. We will draft mid-term investment plans that include both the national government and the regions to ensure that the resources are invested in the country's top priorities: education, health, low-income housing, improvement of infrastructure, and technological development. We will back institutional and technical development in departments and municipalities to efficiently invest the large revenues they are entitled to--revenues that will come from royalties, allocations from the National Royalty Fund, and their share of the nation's current earnings. [passage omitted] [Pastrana] The Cusiana oil fields provide a great opportunity for the country and its regions to consolidate a process of high, sustainable, and equitable growth in favor of the poorest sectors of the population. For this purpose, I agree with the experts who have proposed the creation of an overseas savings fund. I will channel the country's revenues to improving the quality and coverage of education, bringing potable water to all Colombians, and overcoming the existing inefficiencies in the infrastructure and technological development. I will reorganize decentralization to guarantee that the regions will have fiscal autonomy with political responsibility and economic efficiency. I will guarantee that the government will contribute to macroeconomic stability with greater efficiency in spending and in tax collection. I will create conditions that enable the private sector to contribute to stable growth by increasing its rate of savings. [EL TIEMPO] The agricultural crisis in Colombia. This has been the most overlooked sector in the current administration; how will it be treated by your administration? [Samper] My administration will work to implement increased land improvement; the creation and strengthening of Stabilization Funds; insurance for crops to decrease price fluctuations and other risks; technology; subsidies for capitalization; support for those affected by unfair competition; the strengthening of the Agrarian Fund, the DRI [Integrated Rural Development Program], and the PNR [National Rehabilitation Plan]; and a policy to recover tranquility in the rural areas. This policy will include the modernization of the Armed Forces, social investment, and the creation of jobs. [passage omitted] [Pastrana] I will reinforce measures to reactivate the sector. I will guarantee a sustainable and efficient agricultural system that will be integrated with industrial processes that will offer stable and well-paying jobs. It will be an agricultural system supported by modern services from a business standpoint. It will be a system with investment in infrastructure, development, transfer of technology, capitalization, price and market information, marketing, institutional strength, and a strong rural economy. It will overcome the negative effects of problems such as drug trafficking, illegal crops, and violence. [passage omitted] [EL TIEMPO] The future of coffee growers. Will you subsidize domestic coffee prices or will you go with international prices? [Pastrana] As a matter of fact, the international price must be the primary long-term reference point for the domestic coffee price. In unfavorable conditions and for short periods, the National Coffee Fund could receive government support in the form of credits to prevent fluctuations or abrupt drops in the income of coffee producers. As a general rule, any subsidy must be studied in terms of its social cost and the most effective and honest way to manage the subsidy. However, I believe better results are obtained if producers are directly supported with technology, marketing, access to credit, and so on, instead of with subsidies. [Samper] I have vowed to free coffee production from macroeconomic control. I will channel budgetary resources to finance infrastructure and social investment projects. These were projects that used to be financed with resources from coffee growers. I will support the efforts that the Coffee Federation is making. I will promote a more aggressive and deregulated marketing policy. The National Coffee Fund will be used only to stabilize prices and coffee growers' income. [passage omitted] [EL TIEMPO] Low-income housing. How will your administration treat purchasing power? What will be the role of the Savings and Mortgage Associations? [Samper] The Savings and Mortgage Associations [Corporaciones de Ahorro y Vivienda, CAV's] will play a key role in financing the construction sector. We will implement an aggressive housing policy with an investment of $1 billion over four years to deliver 500,000 low-income houses to resolve this grave problem for 500,000 Colombian families. This policy will support the organizations that work in the area of low-income housing. The CAV's will have the same rights and obligations that other financial intermediaries have. [passage omitted] [Pastrana] The UPAC [Constant Value Savings Certificate] system has proven to be the best mechanism to convert cash savings into long-term loans for construction, and its importance to the country's development has been truly invaluable. The consolidation of the system, the changes in the construction sector, and most of all, the new framework for the financial system in Colombia have resulted, on the one hand, in a diversification in employing CAV resources and, on the other hand, in new savings alternatives for investors. Therefore, they offer possibilities that are different from those offered by savings accounts in other institutions. To handle this situation, changes become necessary within the following parameters: 1. They must respond to permanent, not circumstantial, transformations in the economy. 2. They must be made to preserve the strength of the system--a system based on stability, on the recovery of its portfolio, and on its profitability. 3. They must maintain the basic identity of the system as a source of long-term resources to finance housing for medium- and low-income sectors of the population. [passage omitted]
