After adding that there will be no extremist parties at the meeting with representatives of the Cuban community abroad, Robaina stressed that the goal of the meeting is not to discuss Cuba's political future but mainly to discuss emigration policies to improve the emigres' ties with their homeland. Robaina added that the meeting will probably devote many hours to the emigration issues and Cuban democracy as well as intellectual, artistic, and academic exchanges. Robaina went on to say that Cuba's economic situation is beginning to improve and that the worst is over. He added that after bottoming out, Cuba's economy has begun a process of recovery, and that, in comparison with those of 1993, this year's results are different and somewhat encouraging.
