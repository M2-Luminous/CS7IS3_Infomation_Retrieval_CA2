The main force behind the Pressler Amendment will have met the prime minister and the foreign minister by the time this editorial is published. Meanwhile, the U.S. ambassador also called on Prime Minister Bhutto yesterday and expressed the hope that the U.S. aid to Pakistan would be resumed. During the meeting, the prime minister made it clear that Pakistan has the right to defend itself and it will definitely not roll back its nuclear program. The U.S. senator's delegation has arrived in Pakistan at a time when the country is in the midst of debates and discussions on the nuclear issue. The visit assumes great significance in view of the fact that the United States not only suspended aid to Pakistan on the pretext of the nuclear program, but also resorted to the practice of harassing it. The visit is also significant in view of the impression being created by governmental circles that the present government will be able to restore U.S. aid without any ``compromise'' on the nuclear program; while the opposition is saying that the government has bowed to the U.S. conditions and that is why the aid is going to be restored. Unaware of the reality, the people are wondering whether to believe in what the present prime minister is saying or to accept as true the allegation by the former prime minister. Confusion prevails even about Pakistan's nuclear program itself. India and the United States insist that we have crossed the red light. But our responsible figures are terming it as ``[word indistinct].'' A statement by former foreign minister Agha Shahi was published in today's newspapers in which he claimed that Pakistan's nuclear program has been frozen. However, General Mirza Aslam Beg, the former chief of the army staff, while acknowledging the freezing of the program, has simultaneously claimed that Pakistan had acquired the weapon-manufacturing capability in 1987. When people in responsible positions are not consistent in their statements, it naturally creates confusion. However, the main thing is the national interest. It has become evident from the debates held so far on the nuclear issue that our nuclear program is an inevitable necessity so far as the national security is concerned. And if we have so far been able to protect ourselves from Indian aggression, it is due mainly to the nuclear deterrent. It is a ``peaceful'' program in the sense that it provides a guarantee for peace and against war in this subcontinent. We should clearly tell the United States and its delegated envoys that we have acquired the nuclear capability for peaceful purposes. And since we have acquired it through our own resources, it is therefore not possible for us to accept any conditions on it. How can the countries which went to extremes to restrain us from having a peaceful program--and tried to punish us by stopping economic and military aid--have the right to dictate to us on our nuclear program? As our program is aimed at securing peace and ending aggression, we will be ready to accept any reasonable proposal. Hoever, that will be only when India signs the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, accepts the world body's resolutions on all disputes, including the Kashmir issue, and implements them. It is India which is the root cause of the disturbances in this region. No neighboring country can remain complacent about its defense unless India shuns its oppressive designs. The present government will do a service to the nation if it succeeds in convincing Pressler and his companions of Pakistan's nuclear stand. We hope that Pressler is not visiting Pakistan to force this country to accept his conditions, but to end the present coldness in Pakistan-U.S. relations and to attain a realistic perception of the problems and difficulties being faced by Pakistan. We also hope that he will return to Washington satisfied.
