The ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] field commander, Major General John Inienger, disclosed this today in Lagos while briefing airport correspondents on the latest developments in Liberia. Pius Egbohon has a report: [Begin Egbohon recording] Gen. Inienger said a number of weapons and over 6,000 rounds of assorted ammunition had also been recovered. He was, however, not happy with the slow pace at which the factions were turning in their men for disarmament and encampment. The ECOMOG field commander attributed this situation to the lack of faith among the factions. He stated that there was a high degree of distrust among the factions culminating in a situation whereby each faction suspects the other of having a hidden agenda. [passage indistinct] Gen. Inienger said that apart from the low level of trust prevalent among the factions, the internal rift within ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] and the fighting between the Liberian Peace Council and the NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] of Charles Taylor had not worked in favor of the peace process. He gave an assurance that the problem would be resolved soon to ensure that the general elections scheduled for 7 December this year became a reality. [end recording]
