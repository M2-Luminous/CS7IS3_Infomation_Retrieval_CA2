At least, this is what is indicated by the initial data on industrial production, which rose 6 percent last December compared to the same month in 1992. This is the first positive result since June 1992, apart from last August's result, which was highly influenced by seasonal data. This good news is, nevertheless, accompanied by the less tempting news on the public deficit: There is talk of a 8 trillion lire hole in the this year's public accounts. Yesterday, Treasury Undersecretary Sergio Coloni explained that a minibudget would be "inevitable," even if Filippo Cavazzuti (of the Democratic Party of the Left, [PDS]) poured oil on his own troubled waters, recalling the positive effect that might result from the recovery. So the driving forces behind industry are firing up again, and this time it looks like they mean business. The data was disseminated yesterday by ISTAT [Central Statistics Institute], the national statistics office: Industrial production last December, i.e., less than two months ago, rose 6 percent in one year. This is a spectacular reversal of the trend if one simply recalls that the production figures have been continually negative since June 1992 -- more than a year and a half ago. Not even the fact that in December 1993 there was one more day of work than in December 1992 was enough to put this into perspective: At ISTAT they explained that the data, which have been adjusted to account for the extra day of work, remain positive and point to a nice rise of 2.2 percent. It is hard to figure out whether this is a weak or temporary recovery, or a definitive revival. The pessimists are not lowering their guard: They point out that these data are comparable to those from late 1992, a disastrous period for our economy. They add that businesses have not been overrun by renewed and urgent demand, but are merely restoring their inventories, that it is still exports which bring in the orders, and that domestic demand -- even if it is peeping out here and there -- is still in a deep and troubled sleep. Yet something is moving. Judging by the data from Confindustria [General Confederation of Italian Industry], which arrived in late February of this year and which mentioned a growth in production of 2 percent during the first two months of 1993, Italy should be on the point of chalking up a third consecutive quarter of growth. That would suffice to say that the worst is over and that the recovery is under way. In its official statement, ISTAT mentioned "signs of a slowdown in the negative trend" up until last August. The institute's director, Paolo Garonna, spoke yesterday of an "important sign." Meanwhile, Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi recently told EC Commission President Jacques Delors that reportedly there were "some signs of a turnaround in the trend" and that "the Italian economy is in a position to be among the first to benefit from the recovery." The figures bear him out: in its semiannual report, ISCO [National Institute for the Study of the Economic Situation], a research institute at the Budget Ministry, spoke bluntly of recovery and growth in the gross domestic product of 1.3 percent for this year. However, apart from the export drive, another decisive factor will be the progress of domestic consumption, which is the driving force in economic recovery. Last year, internal consumption collapsed in Italy for the first time since the war. So will Italians once again start dipping into their wallets? The sectors which ISTAT places in the front ranks when assessing the December data are almost all export-oriented, but signs of an internal recovery are also emerging in places: packaging, small tools, shoes and purses, bottles and plastic packages, office machines, and knitwear have shown signs of a strong recovery. In major productive sectors, there is less anxiety. At Federtessili [Italian Federation of Textile Workers Unions], there is a certain amount of optimism. "There has been a turnaround since late last year," they say, "but for the time being we can only talk of stabilizing production activity." Unionplast, an association of producers of plastic articles, has just calculated the data for its sales in 1993: They rose 3 percent. "We are also feeling a bit of recovery in domestic demand," Director Amilcare Bozzini noted, "but it is primarily exports to the United States and Germany that are going strong. At Federmeccanica [Metal Workers and Mechanics Union Federation] they are keen to point out that the metal and mechanical industry is doing badly, but the metal products sector has been recovering since late November. There is also caution in the paper, printing, and publishing sector: Newspapers and books are not taking off and only packing boxes used for export goods are pulling the sector along." Will that suffice for the recovery? Working against it, however, are the employment figure and the crisis in the major industrial sectors, such as automobiles, where growth is negative.
