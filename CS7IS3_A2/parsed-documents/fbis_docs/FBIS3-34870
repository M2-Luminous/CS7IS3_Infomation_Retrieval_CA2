PANORAMA interviewed him. [PANORAMA] Your movement is mostly Nuer. Garang is a Dinka. Was this the reason for your dispute? [Mashar] No. The reasons are political. Garang is a despotic and autocratic dictator who recruits kids from the refugee camps and violates human rights. In addition, he wants a federal state while I think that there is no alternative to a completely independent south: The unification imposed by the English in 1946 has no historical basis. The Khartoum regime has massacred and starved the population there for years, and now it wants to impose the laws of Islam and the Arabic language on the south. But it will not succeed. The Muslims are entitled to claim membership of the Arab nation, but we claim our right to assert our Christian and African roots. We will fight until we win independence. [PANORAMA] Your divisions favor Khartoum's strategy. Is it impossible for you to reach an agreement with Col. Garang? [Mashar] On 6 January we met and identified some common aims. A global accord is still a long way off, but we cannot lose more time. The Sudanese Army has launched a new offensive and the civilian population is at the end of its strength. We have to stop the genocide of our people.
