New Adjustments Brewing in Japan's Foreign Affairs With the world quickening its pace toward multipolarity, disputes in Japan over its strategy for national development will become fiercer than ever before. Right now, Japan's basic line for its foreign affairs is to continue its readjustments and seek changes while holding its ground so as to keep pace with the changes of its external environment which have taken place after the Seattle meeting. Due to the fact that readjustments in its diplomacy are often affected by its domestic affairs, it is possible Japan may delay or hesitate in taking action. 1. Create an internal and external environment, pave the way to becoming a powerful nation in political affairs. Since Hosokawa took his office, Japan adopted the tactics of making concessions to gain advantages on the issue of becoming a permanent member of the UN Security Council. Japan attached importance to "being recommended by other nations" rather than fighting for this membership and taking the initiative by itself. As for the international environment, Japan believes that the conditions for Japan to become a permanent member of the UN Security Council have become ripe in each passing day. Its next move will be to win popular support at home, while trying to skirt around the barrier of "amending its Constitution." In foreign affairs, it will launch another round of offense with emphasis on becoming the fifth permanent member of the UN Security Council and try to win more votes from developing nations. 2. Exert greater efforts in promoting "Asian Diplomacy," and expand Japan's economic interests and political influence in Asia. In view of its increasing economic dependence on Asia, Japan will further try to raise its diplomatic status in Asia in coordination with its domestic economic structural readjustment; turn the Asia-Pacific region into its economic backyard and diplomatic prop; and strive to gradually play a leading role in managing Asia-Pacific affairs. In dealing with Southeast Asia, Japan will "make use of economic means to expand its political influence," pave its way with the outputs of its capital and merchandise, and develop multilateral economic cooperation, while strengthening bilateral relations. It will seize the forthcoming opportunity in the normalization of U.S.-Vietnamese relations to strengthen its infiltration into the Vietnamese market, advocate unified actions to help Cambodia develop post-war reconstruction projects, and expand its influence in Indochina. In dealing with Northeast Asia, it will advocate peaceful dialogue; help the United States and North Korea solve the nuclear issue with peaceful means; try to officialize the dialogue on security issues among Japan, the United States and Russia; and set up a "regional system for the control of exports of technologies which can be used for both military and civilian purposes." 3. Readjust its relations with the United States, and gradually extricate itself from the situation wherein it excessively relies on the United States for its economy and it is politically contained by the United States. Within this year, Japan and the United States will have their final showdown in their "overall economic negotiations." In view of the fact that agreements were already reached at the Uruguay Round of Talks, the emphasis of U.S. strategy on its economic and security matters will be shifted from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. It is making preparations to start a "Pacific Round of Talks for Trading" aimed at opening up the markets in Asia. Japan's market will be the first to be affected. The return of the United States to Asia will inevitably intensify the U.S.-Japanese contention for the leading role in economic cooperation in the region. In addition to showing Japan's unique status as a link between the United States and the ASEAN nations within the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), it will try to play an even more active role in the East Asian Economic Council (EAEC) proposed by Malaysia so as to balance U.S. efforts in making use of the APEC Seattle meeting to increase its influence in Asia. 4. Improve political relations between Japan and Europe, and increase the radius in diplomacy. Hosokawa will visit Europe in May. He plans to make use of his trip as a turning point to strengthen the weaker link of the triangular relations among Japan, the United States and Europe, and achieve a balanced development. He will try to rely on the Japanese-European mutual support to have more say in foreign affairs when he deals with the United States. Japan will try to add new contents in the "Japan-EC Joint Statement" and raise the bilateral political and diplomatic relations between Japan and the European nations in the past to the level of Japanese-European cooperation. It will try to become a "quasi NATO member nation," and make use of the European Union and the European Security Council to "push the Japanese-European political cooperation into a new stage" and turn this type of cooperation into another strategic pillar in Japan's diplomatic structure. 5. Strengthen political dialogue between Japan and Russia, and create a "soft environment" for the normalization of Japanese-Russian relations. In view of the fact that the improvement of Japanese-Russian relations will help Japan reverse its unfavorable position in the quadrilateral relations among Japan, the United States, China and Russia, and improve the strategic environment in Northeast Asia, Japan's Foreign Minister Hata and Prime Minister Hosokawa plan to visit Russia on different occasions in March and May. Japan will reaffirm its stand to continuously support Russia's line of reform within the framework set up by the group of seven Western nations; implement its plan to aid Russia which it had announced before; promote bilateral political dialogue; and encourage the exchange of visits by leaders of both countries. Meanwhile, Japan will continue to carry out negotiations on the issue of Japan's Northern Islands and try to pave the way to finally solve the problem in the "post-Yeltsin" period. IV. Japan-China Relations To Enter a New Historic Stage At a time when Japan is changing its political and economic system and readjusting its foreign and domestic policies, it will duly adjust its strategy toward China. Japan will seek to establish a "new-type post-war relation" with China and to ensure that the development of the Japan-China relation will not be controlled by the United States. It will seek to establish a Japan-China relations "in the world" and "in the Asia-Pacific region" and maintain an "ordinary relation between one state and other" which is not "restrained by history." 1. Proceeding from Japan's strategic interests, Japan will not change its main foreign policy in maintaining the Japan-China relations of friendship and cooperation. Recently Hosokawa once again emphatically pointed out that Japan regarded the establishment of a "better Japan-China relations toward the 21st Century" as the basic principle for its China policy. He placed the Japan-China relationship on a par with the Japan-U.S. relationship, and stressed that both of them are important pillars of Japan's diplomacy. In the development of its relations with China, Japan takes into consideration the following new factors: A) It takes Japan-China relations as the key for Japan to attain the status of a "major nation in political affairs." After the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the Japan-China relationship is strategically becoming more and more important in Japan's foreign policy. Japan needs China's cooperation to hold sway in the new order in the world and in the Asia-pacific region. China holds a key vote if Japan is to become a permanent member of the UN Security Council. The Japan-China relationship is a trump card if Japan wants to raise its strategic diplomatic status in dealing with the United States and to seek independence in handling foreign affairs. B) Japan regards the Japan-China relationship as an "anchor" in stabilizing the situation in Asia. This relationship is a necessary condition for the promotion of economic development in the Asia-Pacific region. Japan believes that peace, stability and security in the Asian-Pacific region are still being threatened by various factors even after the cold war ended. Without a stable Japan-China relationship, there will be no peace in this region. Whether the rapid economic development in this region can be maintained or not depends on the economic development and cooperation between Japan and China. Japan will encounter endless difficulties in promoting its "new Asian diplomacy" without China's support. C) Japan seeks to develop the Japan-China relation so as to check China's excessive growth which may harm Japan's interests. In face of the increasing changes in China and the improved relations between China and the United States after the Seattle meeting, Japan is worried about the possibility of China and the United States joining their efforts to contain Japan. It is for this reason that strategically Japan needs to develop its relations with China while containing each other. 2. Based on the developing situation, Japan is adjusting its strategy in dealing with China. First, Japan's strategic ideology has changed from one of "allying with China to resist the Soviet Union" in the past to one of relying on China's support to stabilize Northeast Asia and the Western Pacific Region, and help Japan have more say on international affairs and become a major nation in political affairs. It is for this purpose that it must attach greater importance to the Japan-China relationship in its foreign policy, and improve the situation whereas the development of the Japan-China relationship is constrained by the United States. Second, the core of Japan's foreign policy has changed from economic cooperation to paying equal attention to politic, economic and security matters and from bilateral relations to cooperative relations of a regional or even world nature. Third, its China policy is to change from a "special relationship" to an "ordinary relationship." That means to shake off the yoke of historical issues and establish the Japan-China relationship on the basis of reciprocity. Meanwhile, in its China policy, Japan will stress the need to maintain a balance in the triangular relationship among Japan, the United States and China, and ensure that the situation is always to Japan's advantage. In short, the Japan-China relationship will witness new developments in the new year. The two nations will rely on each other even more, and they would cooperate with each other in more fields. Politically there will be more contacts at the high level between the two countries, and a new situation will emerge in economic cooperation. There will be more dialogue on security matters in the Asia-Pacific Region and bilateral security issues. However, with the continuous growth of China's overall national strength, there will emerge competitions between the two countries. While Japan enlists the support of the United States and joins the ASEAN nations to strategically contain China and "psychologically hold back China," some of its movements merits our attention. A) It stressed the need to achieve an "overall balance" between economic cooperation and political security, and played economic cards on the issue of politics and security. It shortened the credit period of its loans to China so as to maintain its influence over China. It imposed many restrictions on the use of loans from Japan, the credit period and other terms. It linked financial and economic cooperation between the two nations with China's national defense modernization program, the so-called military sales and the bilateral dialogue on security matters. B) Some of the members of Japan's ruling group who advocate the establishment of a "quasi-government relation" between Japan and Taiwan are gaining ground. Their aim is to safeguard Japan's commercial interests in Taiwan and make Japanese products economically more competitive. At the same time, they try to make use of this to strengthen Japan's containment over China. It is reported that Japan is negotiating with Taiwan on how Minister of International Trade and Industry Hiroshi Kumatani may visit Taiwan, and that it plans to invite Li Denghui to visit Japan during the APEC summit meeting in Tokyo in 1995. Nevertheless that does not conform with Japan's "one China" policy.
