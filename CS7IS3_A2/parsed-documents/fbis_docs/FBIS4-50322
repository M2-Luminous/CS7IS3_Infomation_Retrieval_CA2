The passport muddle, for example, cries out for cooperation, rather than sticking dogmatically to entrenched attitudes. This is a problem that must be dealt with expeditiously. Unfortunately, however, it has become another casualty of the Sino-British impasse. Local holders of British National Overseas (BNO) passports now have the same rights as British citizens when it comes to such matters as visa-free entry to certain third countries. Britain is pushing for the same system to continue after 1997 for BNO passport- holders. Hence the need for cooperation between Beijing and London. Noting that this is a matter for the post-1997 Special Administrative Region (SAR) of Hong Kong, China says: "This is a question of our sovereignty, we don't have to talk to Britain about it." So what we are probably going to see is two separate campaigns for Hong Kong passports. China will launch its own promotion for the SAR passport and Britain will try to push the BNO passport. Commonsense indicates that it would be a lot simpler and a lot more effective if the two sides just joined forces to get the best possible deal from third countries as far as visas are concerned. But this is shaping up as another case where Hong Kong residents may suffer because both countries appear to be more concerned about their own national pride than with the welfare of the people of this territory. No one disputes that this problem must be sorted out as quickly as possible. Failure to do so will result in a bureaucratic nightmare after 1997. The SAR will have to issue millions of passports in a very short period of time. The earlier the relevant authorities get started on this process the better. This, we submit, is where the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) has a vital role to play. The PWC was set up by China last year to advise on transitional issues. This is a classic transitional issue. The mandate of reason and emergency is that PWC members should intercede. They must use their influence with China in an effort to persuade Beijing to talk to London. They would probably be effective because China should listen to its own advisory body. It would also be a test of whether the PWC is just a rubber stamp for Chinese decisions or whether it really does have some clout in advising Beijing.
