The United States made the proposal in bilateral "framework" trade talks held earlier this month in Washington, but Japan rejected it. The source said the proposed targets would lead to managed trade, at a time when the world is moving toward free trade. It is "now up to the U.S. to make concessions" in the stalled talks, the source said. The source also said Japan cannot accept a U.S. proposal to hold a quadrilateral ministerial meeting on market ccess in advance of the Japan-U.S. summit in Washington between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton on February 11. The proposal "is out of the question," the source said. Washington had proposed the talks among the United States, the European Union, Canada and Japan under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
