Subpart P_Section 5(h) Homeownership Program §905.1001 Purpose. This part codifies the provisions of the Section 5(h) Homeownership Program for Indian housing, as authorized by sections 5(h) and 6(c)(4)(D) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (Act) and administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). §905.1002 Applicability. (a) General applicability. This subpart applies to low-income housing owned by Indian Housing Authorities (IHAs), subject to Annual Contributions Contracts (ACCs) under the Act. The terms ``housing'' or ``low-income housing'', as used in this subpart, refer to the types of properties described in the preceding sentence, except as indicated by the particular context. In reference to housing properties, ``development'' means the same as ``project'' (as defined in the Act). Except where otherwise indicated by the context, ``resident'' means the same as ``tenant'', as the latter term is used in the Act, including Mutual Help and Turnkey III homebuyers, as well as rental tenants of low-income housing and Section 8 residents, and references to sale, purchase, conveyance and ownership include the types of interests and transactions that are incident to cooperative ownership. (b) Nonretroactivity. In the case of a Section 5(h) homeownership plan that was approved by HUD before the effective date of the interim rule under this subpart (October 21, 1991) no modifications or additional requirements will be imposed under the provisions of the interim or final rule, except for reasonable administrative procedures prescribed by HUD. Similarly, in the case of a plan that was approved under the interim rule, but before the effective date of the final rule (December 12, 1994), no modifications or additional requirements will be imposed under the provisions of the final rule, except for such reasonable administrative procedures. §905.1003 General authority for sale. An IHA may sell all or a portion of a development to eligible residents, as defined under §905.1008, for purposes of homeownership, according to a homeownership plan approved by HUD under this subpart. Upon sale in accordance with the HUD-approved homeownership plan, HUD will execute a release of the title restrictions prescribed by the ACC. Because the property will no longer be subject to the ACC after sale, it will cease to be eligible for further HUD funding for operating subsidies or modernization under the Act upon conveyance of title by the IHA. (That does not preclude any other types of post-sale subsidies that may be available, under other Federal, Tribal, State, or local programs, such as the possibility of available assistance under Section 8 of the Act, in connection with a plan for cooperative homeownership, if authorized by the Section 8 regulations.) §905.1004 Fundamental criteria for HUD approval. HUD will approve an IHA's homeownership plan if it meets all three of the following criteria:
