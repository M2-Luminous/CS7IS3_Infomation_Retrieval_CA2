Merchants Josef Rimmele and Klaus Eichler, who were probably killed when a chartered Cessna plane mysteriously crashed into Lake Constance the week before last, reportedly also dealt in this substance. Dealers in radioactive material offer the substance under many names: Red Mercury, Mercury P2-P5, Mercury Rouge, Red Wine, Red Quicksilver, RM20/20, or Red Cherry. According to findings by the Federal Intelligence Office (BND) itinerant dealers have been offering the stuff since 1980. One can "only speculate" about the origin of the Mercury legend, a confidential report from January says. What is certain are the prices demanded on the black market: "$200,000 to $400,000 per kilo," the BND in Pullach has found out. Last year, the material was presented to an audience of millions. The ARD [First German Television Channel] "Tagesthemen" newscast reported that the dangerous substance is produced in a research institute of the Russian military and then offered all over the world for the construction of detonators in nuclear warheads. Experts laughed heartily. "Red Mercury is nonsense, balderdash," Paul Wamers, vice president of the Cologne Customs Office of Criminal Investigations, says, succinctly summarizing the opinion of the experts. The BND investigators in their expert report are also sure: "A material with such qualities does not exist. The mercury-antimony compound, which is again and again mentioned in the media and is a brownish material, does not show any of the spectacular qualities and would not justify the extremely high price that is demanded. In the cases that were examined more closely, the seized material was, for example, simple mercury or mercury oxide. However, one case has become known in which mercury was mixed with the dangerous radioactive material cobalt 60 -- probably to simulate the alleged radioactivity of Red Mercury." Theophil M. Lutz, scientist and owner of a company for chemical analyses in Morges at the Lake of Geneva, sees connections. He assumes that officers of the former Soviet intelligence service KGB are behind the mercury boom. The intelligence agents are operating with a fictitious material, which is not rare in this scene. Dutch merchant Adriana Gilhar, 42, has come to the same conclusion. The born Romanian participated in the game, which involved millions of dollars, for two years without ever being able to conclude a real deal. She experienced "scenes as in a movie": Somewhere in the heart of Russia "policemen, who were armed to their teeth" guarded a box with 2 kg of "this damned substance." Adriana Gilhar calls this succinctly and vulgarly "bullshit." Obviously, the local governors of the former KGB had staged the martial performance of the policemen in order to impress supposedly rich buyers from the West. The experiences of the Dutch woman coincide with findings by German authorities. The BND has "intelligence service information" that Russian politicians and high-ranking government officials might also be involved in the black-market deals. Thus, in 1992, Russian dealers presented their German partners with a license that, according to the stamp and signature, came from the office of the prime minister of the Republic of Moldova: A domestic company was permitted to export "1,000 kg" of the imaginary chemical Red Mercury. Cornelius Vermulen, who for a long time was Adriana Gilhar's Dutch business partner, also received this offer. Nervously, he pushes two samples of Red Mercury across the table to show them to his visitors: "Take a look, rubbish." Such frankness is dangerous. A hotel owner from the Ruhr area and his family had to flee abroad to escape the dealers' revenge. After months of negations, a deal involving 18 kg of Red Mercury had not come about. Nevertheless, the Russian negotiating partners demanded $300,000 for their efforts. When the hotel owner refused, they called him on the phone and threatened to set fire to his house and to kidnap his children. Rimmele and Eichler also gained experience with the East European Mafia. After failed negotiations on rare metals and Red Mercury, they were kidnapped and brought to the Latvian capital of Riga. Eichler managed to free himself, he alerted the German Embassy and the police. Later, Rimmele was also released. The two dealers did not speak about the real background of the kidnapping. But they had broken the law of silence, the omerta, which is now also valid in East Europe. Rimmele and Eichler betrayed the kidnappers to the Latvian police. Since then they had lived in fear.
