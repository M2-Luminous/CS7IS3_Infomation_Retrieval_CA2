We have to show honesty and political determination, which, as I said before, will lead to closer relations between both countries. President Reina and I held a brief working meeting at the airport. I also held working meetings with the president and the rest of the Central American presidents. There is complete agreement on the principles of austerity, honesty, and the fight against corruption. We need to give a human and social image to our economic growth, which should have a distribution with social equality. I believe there is a complete identification with the new Honduran president.
