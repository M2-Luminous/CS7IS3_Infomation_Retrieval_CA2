FR940203-1-00041 FR940203-1-00008 Under the NHA and this proposed rule, the term ``assisted living facility'' means a public facility, proprietary facility, or facility of a private nonprofit corporation that: (1) Is licensed and regulated by the State or if there is no State law providing for such licensing and regulation by the State, by the municipality or other political subdivision in which the facility is located; (2) Makes available to residents supportive services to assist the residents in carrying out activities of daily living such as bathing, dressing, eating, getting in and out of bed or chairs, walking, going outdoors, using the toilet, laundry, home management, preparing meals, shopping for personal items, obtaining and taking medications, managing money, using the telephone, or performing light or heavy housework, and which may make available to residents home health care services, such as nursing, and therapy; and (3) Provides separate dwelling units for residents, each of which may contain a full kitchen or bathroom, and includes common rooms and other facilities appropriate for the provision of supportive services to residents of the facility. Under the NHA and this proposed rule, the term ``frail elderly'' has the same meaning as the term in section 802(k) of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act (NAHA). Section 802(k)(8) defines ``frail elderly'' as meaning an elderly person who is unable to perform at least three activities of daily living adopted by the Secretary. (The term ``activity for daily living'' means an activity regularly necessary for personal care and includes bathing, dressing, eating, getting in and out of bed and chairs, walking, going outdoors, and using the toilet.) An assisted living facility may be free-standing, or part of a complex that includes a nursing home, an intermediate care facility, a board and care facility or any combination of the above. However, in compliance with section 511 of the 1992 HCD Act, this proposed rule would not authorize mortgage insurance for an assisted living facility unless the Secretary determines that the level of financing acquired by the mortgagor and any other resources available for the facility are sufficient to ensure that the facility contains dwelling units and facilities for the provision of supportive services; the mortgagor provides satisfactory assurances that no dwelling unit in the facility will be occupied by more than one person without the consent of all such occupants; and the appropriate state licensing agency for the state, municipality or other political subdivision in which the facility is or is to be located provides adequate assurances that the facility will comply with any applicable standards and requirements for such facilities. Section 511 of the 1992 HCD Act also amends section 223(f) of the NHA. In accordance with section 511, this proposed rule would authorize the refinancing of an existing assisted living facility. This proposed rule would also expand the section 232 program to include the refinancing of conventional projects under section 223(f) of the National Housing Act. Section 409 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 amended section 223(f) of the NHA to cover the refinancing of existing debt of an existing nursing home, existing intermediate care facility, existing board and care facility (collectively referred to as ``residential care facility), or any combination of the above. However, after section 409 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 was enacted, the Department only implemented section 409 for existing FHA-insured residential care facilities. (On August 31, 1988 (53 FR 33735), the Department added insurance for existing residential care facilities that are currently FHA-insured.) HUD's decision not to implement section 409 in its entirety was based on the fact that HUD had no experience in underwriting existing residential care facilities. By limiting the insurance for refinanced transactions to currently FHA-insured projects with a known track record (annual inspections, availability of audited financial statements, etc.), the Department could more adequately protect the General Insurance Fund. However, the House Conference Report for the NAHA (H.R. 101&hyph;943, 101st Cong. 2d Sess, at 524) emphasizes Congress's intent that the Department fully implement section 409 to include conventional (non-FHA insured) projects. Accordingly, the Department is now expanding the program to include mortgages for the purchase and refinancing of existing residential care facilities with non-FHA insured mortgages under section 232 pursuant to section 223(f). To implement further statutory changes, this proposed rule would make projects consisting of an addition to an existing (non-FHA insured) nursing home, board and care facility, intermediate care facility, or assisted living facility eligible for mortgage insurance under section 232 of the NHA. Moreover, this proposed rule would increase the loan-to-value ratio for private nonprofit mortgagors from 90 percent to 95 percent, and would make conforming changes for fire safety equipment for assisted living facilities. In addition to statutory changes, this proposed rule would make minor technical amendments to part 232. Specifically, this proposed rule would move the definition of substantial rehabilitation from ยง232.902(b) to the definitional section of the regulations (section 232.1), and revise the definition of substantial rehabilitation to reflect the requirement that rehabilitation must involve two or more major building components. The current wording ``more than one building component'' could be erroneously interpreted.
