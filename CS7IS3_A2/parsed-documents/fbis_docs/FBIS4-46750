But, fortunately, as has happened more than once in history, everything occurred exactly the wrong way round: The ministers who came out on the stage of the conference hall of the Hotel Intercontinental after six hours of intensive negotiations informed the world of the birth of a new political sensation. The results of the Geneva meeting are analyzed by Sergey Tsekhmistrenko, KOMMERSANT-DAILY columnist, who has just returned from Geneva. 51:49 in Favor of Russian Diplomacy Although the idea for a meeting of the ministers of foreign affairs was formally proposed by Moscow and Paris, Russia deserves the main credit for the fact that it did occur. Perhaps the negotiations between Andrey Kozyrev and United States Secretary of State Warren Christopher at the beginning of May in Cairo were the turning point--at that time the Russian minister succeeded in convincing the American, who had assessed the potential of a "Geneva meeting" skeptically. However, almost up until late night on 13 May it seemed to all of those who arrived on the shores of Lake Geneva that reality would confirm Christopher's correctness. But the communique distributed before the final news conference indicated the opposite: The desired compromise was found. And precisely thanks to Russia. Essentially, the communique proposes an integral settlement concept whose central element was principally a new approach to the future arrangement of the Bosnian state. Henceforth it will be viewed in its way as a union consisting of two parts--Bosnian-Serb and Bosnian-Croat (what is meant in the latter case is the Muslim-Croat federation that is being established). Moreover, from the standpoint of international law, both sides are given equal status. As for the key problem--territorial demarcation--the ministers proposed to resolve it after dividing the Bosnian territory between the federation and the Serbs in a ratio of 51 to 49. But peace was necessary to implement all of this, and therefore it was decided to call on the sides to conclude an agreement on a cessation of military operations for four months, which could be prolonged afterwards. Direct negotiations of the parties to the conflict were also supposed to be renewed--this was to be achieved by a contact group of the world community, which in the course of the next two weeks was to convince the Serbs and the Muslims with the Croats to continue the dialogue that had been broken off. As for the question of sanctions (against both the FRY ((Federal Republic of Yugoslavia)) and with respect to the embargo on the supply of arms to the Muslims), Russia and the West agreed for the first time in Geneva that they should be observed rigorously, and that they could be gradually canceled only after the implementation of the aforementioned points. The removal of sanctions as a preliminary condition of a settlement was rejected. Russian diplomats in Geneva really felt cheered in Geneva. And not by chance: The main points of the adopted plan were set forth in a message from Boris Yeltsin to Clinton, Mitterrand, Major, and Kohl. As was reported to the KOMMERSANT-DAILY columnist by a highly placed official at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, a majority of the provisions of the letter were included in the communique practically without any changes. Never before have Moscow's proposals been implemented so completely at such meetings. In this connection, in the opinion of a Russian diplomat, it can be considered that Russia today is really playing a leading role in the settlement, although it was not very long ago that the palm leaf of victory belonged to the European Union. Incidentally, Kozyrev also observed: In the heat of polemics in the negotiations, the Western colleagues appealed more than once to Yeltsin's letter as a primary source. But there were also two other circumstances that determined the outcome of the negotiations. I refer to the adoption on 12 and 13 May respectively of resolutions of the United States Senate and the State Duma of Russia on the question of sanctions. News about these decisions suddenly rallied the main players--Kozyrev and Christopher. Our Main Thought--That There Will Be No Pol Pot The head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia commented in an interview with journalists on the lively interest of the members of the Duma--to the detriment of domestic problems--in the words of a well-known Soviet ditty. Nevertheless, there was an unexpected effect when they learned of the Duma resolution in Geneva, where there was talk of a unilateral departure by Moscow from the sanctions regime against the FRY in the event the United States removed the embargo on the supply of weapons to the Muslims. Both Kozyrev and Christopher, in order not to permit a war of parliaments, decided to avoid extremes. Judging by the communique, Moscow rejected a former position--the gradual removal of sanctions right now (in the form of its own kind of overture that recently displayed a yielding to Belgrade), but Washington did not insist on the opposite, that is, on a toughening of sanctions. Both ministers disavowed the decisions of their parliaments. But while this has become a usual thing for Kozyrev (it is enough to mention his battles with the Supreme Soviet), Christopher's step was perhaps unprecedented. In general, Christopher was placed in a very awkward position in Geneva. Just the day before, Washington assured the partners that the Muslims with the Croats have agreed to 51 percent of the territory of Bosnia. Therefore, when it became known that the wards had misled the patron, demanding 58 percent, confusion resulted, although Charles Redman, the special representative of the United States, attempted to present all of this as "a joke." But, in addition, the map of the division proposed by the Muslims and the Croats said little about their peaceful disposition. In the words of one of the officials of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, this was a "war map," inasmuch as an attempt was made in it to transform the Serbian enclaves into territories that were not connected. However, it will not be easy to put the Geneva agreements into effect. For the Serbs today control almost 73 percent of the territory of Bosnia, and few believe that it will be possible to convince them to "squeeze" into 49 percent. Indeed, President of Bosnia Alija Izetbegovic has also already expressed the first doubts regarding the initiatives by Russia and the West. However, Kozyrev, after flying into Moscow, was in an optimistic mood--nobody from the Bosnian side has yet expressed complete rejection. But "who is who" will become evident within two weeks: If by that time no movement occurs, then, in the apt expression of one Russian diplomat, the world community will put the "carrot and stick" in motion. But it is already clear today that a new page has been written in the history of the settlement of the Yugoslav conflict.
