However, HINA [Croatian news agency] has learned from the command of the HVO [Croat Defense Council] Vitez operational zone that certain events in the field warn about resistance to the peace agreement and the establishment of the Bosniak-Croat federation. An official government delegation of the Croat republic of Herzeg-Bosna, headed by Vice Prime Minister Perica Jukic, was last night harassed and threatened at gunpoint between Gornji Vakuf and Novi Travnik, an area under the control of the armed forces of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Another official HVO delegation was stopped and mistreated in the same area yesterday.
