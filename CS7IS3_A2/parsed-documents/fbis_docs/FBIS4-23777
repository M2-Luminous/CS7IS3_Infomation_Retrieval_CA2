The enterprises are said to be substantial earners of vital foreign exchange. Zinhle Fithane reports. [Begin recording] [Fithane] Addressing a media conference at the Union Buildings in Pretoria today, Public Enterprise Minister Princess Stella Sicgau said Eskom's primary role was to provide electricity in the rural areas. Eskom has already incorporated all the electricity facilities previously run by the TBVC [Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda, Ciskei] states and are confident that they will have the ball rolling by the end of the year. [Eskom spokesman Bongani Khumalo] We are rolling. We are rolling now, and by the end of this year we will be fully in motion. We are talking to people in the past TBVC countries with a view to eventually taking over the supply of electricity. We are looking at the best options possible and we would like to see people in those areas electrified. You will be mindful of the fact that those people are mostly in the areas that could be classified as rural areas and this is a priority, as it is the priority of the new government -- that we should electrify those people. [Fithane] Meanwhile, Public Works Minister Mr. Jeff Radebe has given a progress report on the implementation of a public works program. [Radebe] The responsibility now rests on the government to ensure that the broad parameters and the contents of this important piece of work by the National Economic Forum is actually adopted by the government with the specific purpose of implementing it so that we start the process of solving the unemployment problem in our country. [Fithane] In a lengthy report, the minister outlined the National Economic Forum's three-phase plan for a public works program. The three phases indicate how the program will be set up, but it will be at least another year before the program actually begins to create jobs. [end recording]
