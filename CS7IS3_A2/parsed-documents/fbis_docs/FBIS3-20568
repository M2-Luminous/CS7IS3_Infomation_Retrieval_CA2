After the 14th CPC National Congress established their legitimate position, private enterprises achieved unprecedented development. While the public-owned enterprises made every endeavor to adopt the strong points of the private enterprises, energetically transformed their operational mechanism, and set up modern enterprise systems, the operational mechanism of a considerable portion of the private enterprises became in certain respects imperceptibly influenced by the old mechanism of the public enterprises, came to show some of the shortcomings of these public enterprises, and also came to show tendencies of alienation. It must be realized that the reason why these enterprises had become privately operated enterprises, and why they can go on to prosper and develop, is that they have certain strong points which the public-owned enterprises do not have. If private enterprises would want to have an even better future and experience further healthy development, it is now most important for them to put a stop to the process of emulating the old mechanism of the public-owned enterprises and to get out as quickly as possible from their "zones of errors." Having No [Domineering] "Mother-in-Law" and Wanting One, Discarding the "Grey Hat" for a "Red Hat" Private enterprises have gradually evolved under the system of planned economy; they have grown out of public-owned enterprises, and then again grown up and developed among public-owned enterprises. It was, therefore, only natural that the old managerial patterns of the public-owned enterprises were filtering into the private enterprises. Under the influence of such infiltration, a peculiar phenomenon has appeared: On the one hand, state-run and collective enterprises, furiously angry with their [domineering] "mothers-in-law," had thrown off their [domineering] "mothers-in-law," while, on the other hand, private enterprises are looking for "mothers-in-law" and seeking someone to act as "patron." Some private enterprise executives, including some industrialists of certain stature, are actually clamoring for and demanding that governments of every rank establish organs for the administrative control of private enterprises, and that they deputize one senior administrative official to be particularly in charge of private enterprises, thereby changing the present situation where no such forceful administrative control exists. At the same time, some private enterprises are one after another discarding their "grey hats" in exchange for "red hats," or are linking up with collectives, or set up spurious collectives, or outwardly proclaim themselves to be enterprises on the shareholding and cooperative systems, or are hanging up the shop signs of partnership businesses. It must be admitted though, that these private enterprises acting in this way thereby indicate, first of all, that their environment is not yet sufficiently unrestrained to allow for their free existence and development, so that they are in many respects worse off than the state-run and collective enterprises, and that they are therefore compelled to take countermeasures. It also indicates that the private enterprises themselves lack the spirit of self-assertion and self-reliance, the spirit of breaking new ground and forging ahead, and that they are therefore inclined to seek succor under a "red label" or "red hat" to benefit their own advancement. This is a zone of much erroneous understanding. Judging by the spirit of the Third Plenum of the 14th CPC Central Committee, the things that the private enterprises are now hoping to get are precisely what was to be gotten rid of in the reform. Many "mothers-in-law" can, of course, be helpful, but practice has proven that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages, and that they will in the end hamper progress. The "red hat" may for a time still make one's head impervious to wind and rain, but following the suppression of the "theory of the economic ingredients" [i.e. residual ingredients of other systems being maintained in the dominating economic system] this attitude may lose its effectiveness in the not too far away future. One has to get out from this "zone or error." Continuing the Unreasonable Distribution System, Being Free of Them and Yet Seeking the Restraints of Conventions A considerable number of private enterprise executives will either not dare to do anything unconventional and unorthodox because of their narrow mode of thinking; or will, on the other hand, under the residual influence of the old distribution pattern of the public-owned enterprises--some of these persons having only recently changed over from a public-owned enterprise "feeding trough"--continue, consciously or unconsciously, the lump sum gross payroll distribution method that has been used all along by the state-run and collective enterprises. They will not dare take even half a step beyond what they assume as safe territory. Although these private enterprises are not at all unaware of the fact that they are now closely emulating the distribution system of the public-owned enterprises, they will still, wrongheadedly and erroneously, claim that they are giving a brilliant show of a law-abiding, rule-obeying attitude in their business operations, and that they are the modern type of private enterprises. In actual fact it is precisely this distribution system, now continued in docile conformity with conventions, that obliterates the flexibility in distribution in the private enterprises and weakens the most significant advantage of private enterprises. At present, all public enterprises strenuously endeavor in their reform efforts to break out from the constraints of their former conventions, widen the grading in distributions, gain the ability to raise or lower, in order to stimulate the enthusiasm of all cadre, staff, and workers. The private enterprises, on the other hand, move in the opposite direction, is that not sad. For all these reasons, the private enterprises are urged to stop assimilating with the public enterprises in these respects and are urged to go their own way, which they really ought to go. With Loud Booms and Bangs, a Craving for Hollow Reputation Recently, some private enterprises of quite some proportions underwent a change in that they abandoned their former spirit of frugality and turned away from their arduous and thrifty ways of trading and marketing. Now, their invitations to symposia went out to all over the world, just as the large public-run and collective enterprises used to do. On the occasion of its fifth anniversary, one private enterprise did not shrink from spending a million yuan to hire a plane for highly placed personalities to come from Beijing and other places for the celebration, arranged an order-placing meeting, and was seeking to gain a hollow reputation rather than achievements of substance. These acts result to a large extent from the old mode of business operations and marketing practiced by the public enterprises. At present all state-run and collective enterprises are eager to adopt the strong points of the private enterprises; they are continuously improving themselves. If the private enterprises are so very much bent on emulating the old ways of the public enterprises of doing business and marketing, what "strong points" will there be left in them? Only by getting out of that "zone or errors" will they be able to regain their vitality.
