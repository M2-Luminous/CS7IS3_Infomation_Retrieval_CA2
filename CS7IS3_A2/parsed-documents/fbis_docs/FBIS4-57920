Santamaria granted an interview to PRENSA LATINA, during which he noted that important events had taken place in the past few hours regarding relations between the two Latin American countries. Camilo Penaloza, Colombian deputy economic development minister, ended a visit to Cuba yesterday. He was leading a delegation of businessmen interested in investing in the island. The Colombian Navy training vessel Arc Gloria docked in Havana Port, bringing a message of friendship to the Cuban people. Moreover, the civil aeronautics directors of Colombia and Cuba signed an agreement that will soon lead to the establishment of regular flights by their airlines to link the capitals and other cities of both countries. As for the visit paid by the businessmen, Santamaria explained it represents a specific step forward in the area of possible joint business ventures by means of direct meetings with the people who are able to invest in Cuba. He also said the business delegation identified specific points of cooperation and a new meeting was scheduled with high-ranking Colombian and Cuban officials with the goal of signing specific agreements. The meeting will soon be held in Santa Fe de Bogota as bilateral talks move into their next round. The visitors, he said, held meetings in which they were informed of the Cuban economic outlook and the country's future, as well as being informed of new types of foreign investments approved by the Cuban state. The diplomat said there is going to be continuity in these types of visits, which are aimed at providing Colombian companies with direct knowledge of existing opportunities in Cuba for the establishment of enterprises that benefit both sides. Santamaria talked with great enthusiasm about the aeronautics agreement that has just been signed. He described the agreement as the primary goal of the diplomatic mission in view of its economic importance. The agreement was based on the existence of actual market needs because clear possibilities already exist for having several weekly flights between the capitals and cities of Cuba and Colombia, as is shown by the increase in the number of tourist flights during the current year, he said. The ambassador said the increase in the number of flights between the two countries, not only for tourists but also for businessmen and government officials, contributes to the dynamics of bilateral relations. It is an important agreement that was signed thanks to the constructive position of Cuba, which can expect from us all the loyalty one can expect from a brother country, he said. In addition, Santamaria talked about the status of the negotiations for expanding the partial agreement, which will also allow, in the area of trade, a significant increase in bilateral relations. To this effect, the Colombian Government is currently conducting consultations with the private sector regarding tariffs that will affect more than 800 products included in the expansion, which were the object of previous agreements in the last meeting held in Havana. We hope that in June or July of this year, the Colombian and Cuban foreign trade ministers will sign the corresponding document based on the work already done and the technical meetings that have already been held, the ambassador said.
