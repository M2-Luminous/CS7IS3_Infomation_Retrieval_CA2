PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan reportedly ordered the PKK's so-called regional "states" to be divided up into "field commands." Previously, the PKK's command structure was based on a system of regional states. These were Botan, Amed, Mardin, Garzan, Serhat, Dersim, Devrimci GAP, Behdinan, and the southeastern states. Now, as a result of Ocalan's decision, the states are to be divided up into three areas, identified as the north, central, and south field commands. According to Ocalan, coordination in the region has to be improved since regional development is being hindered. Ocalan is quoted as saying: "We have to know how to organize the field commands to increase the power of the organization. We feel this new system will be very effective and useful." Furthermore, the PKK leader also reportedly ordered an increase in the number of attacks on rural areas and cities. "We will apply all the rules of militarization, and attacks will be conducted by our guerrilla forces," he said. According to the Kurdish-German News Agency "Kurd-A," Ocalan said: "We cannot continue to be satisfied with the present level of fighting and the number of guerrilla forces. The number of guerrillas has to be increased to 50,000, otherwise we cannot achieve a strategic result." Referring to the importance of the new strategy, the PKK leader added: "The field command posts are necessary in order to bring about a full political solution. There are targets that will be hit by our guerrillas either by infiltration or through assassination." Ocalan commented on the PKK's methods: "Secrecy is the weapon of the guerrilla to the end, unlike in the story of Don Quixote. We will chop them up and eat them bit by bit. The militia will be in action. For example we can prepare two militia units which can assassinate and carry out sabotage activities." By giving these instructions, the separatist terrorist leader has given his approval for assassinations to be carried out. Sources known to be close to Ocalan say that these assassinations will focus on informers and, later, anybody in a "target position." The first example of this strategy was seen Sunday with the killing of the former Faysal Kut. A former PKK commander of the Mardin region, Kut had been accused of stealing 1 billion Turkish Lira from the organization. Meanwhile, there have been clashes between government security forces and the PKK in the mountains close to the district of Saimbeyli in the Adana region. It is reported that the PKK is organizing in the region in order to move quickly to the Taurus mountains. The process of organization is reportedly being carried out by militants of the Turkish Revolutionist People's Party (TDHP), founded under the supervision of the PKK.
