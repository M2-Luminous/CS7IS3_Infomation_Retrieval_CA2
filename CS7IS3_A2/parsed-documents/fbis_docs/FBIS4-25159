Zou Jiahua pointed out: China has made tremendous progress in radio administration over the decades, especially in the dozen or so years since we began implementing the policy of reform and opening up to the outside world. However, development has also brought to light the existing system's problems and inadequacies, the prominent ones being overlapping government organs, sluggish management, lack of coordination in the organizational and command structure, and a monitoring system that needs strengthening. These problems may stand in the way of the development of China's radio services if we do not face up to and resolve them with persistent efforts. He pointed out: The "PRC Regulations on Radio Administration" promulgated last September provide the fundamental legal basis for China's radio administration. The "regulations'" basic guidelines are their emphasis on centralized and unified leadership and their call for stepping up centralized and unified administration and for stepping up legislation, planning, and construction of technical facilities. He stressed that the "regulations" are a set of administrative rules. Radio administrative departments at all levels must implement them earnestly in the light of their actual conditions and in accordance with the principles of administering according to law and strictly enforcing the law and punishing lawbreakers. Penalty for typical violations such as defying supervision or ignoring administrative rules and regulations should be publicly announced. He said: After the regulations were promulgated, it became necessary to sort out relevant regulations and formulate supplementary ones. The rules that are to be formulated by the localities and departments, including the specific regulations which the "regulations" referred to as necessary, must not deviate from the principles set in the "regulations." Earnest efforts should be made to sort out the regulations that were formulated by the localities and departments before the "regulations" were promulgated. Speaking of structural readjustment, he pointed out: One important aspect of the ongoing structural readjustment is stepping up centralized and unified administration, with the emphasis on the central and provincial levels. The responsibility and powers of these two levels should be enhanced. Instead of radio regulatory committees, an provincial radio regulatory committee agency will be set up at prefectural and city levels. All royalties for use of radio frequencies should be sent to treasuries at the central and local levels. The treasuries will appropriate radio administrative departments' operating expenses. He concluded: Emphasizing unified management does not mean that the SRRC will take charge of everything. Matters such as general principles, legislation, law enforcement, frequency distribution, geographical distribution of transmitters, frequency planning, and organization of overall airwaves monitoring must be handled by the state under unified leadership. The purpose of readjusting radio administration is to step up administration and to advance the development of radio services. Whenever the phrase "stepping up administration" is mentioned, we must refrain from exercising rigid control and excessive interference to the extent of stifling and restricting the development of radio services. Administration and development should be closely interrelated and mutually complementary. On behalf of the SRRC, Wu Jichuan, vice chairman of the SRRC and minister of posts and telecommunications, delivered a report on the significance, methods, and requirements of the readjustment of the radio administration structure and departments. Kui Fulin, vice chairman of the SRRC and assistant to chief of general staff; Zhang Kezhi, vice chairman of the SRRC and deputy secretary general of the State Council; and other SRRC members were present at the meeting.
