FR941117-0-00206 FR941117-0-00013 2. Exemption from the Annual Financial Information Requirement for Short-term Securities A new exemption has been added to exempt from the requirement for an undertaking calling for annual financial information, Offerings of securities with an 18 month or shorter maturity. 202 The new exemption is in response to comments suggesting that the rule not require annual financial information in situations where the securities would mature shortly after, or possibly even before, the annual financial information would be due. 203 The provisions of the amended rule relating to notices of material events, however, would apply to these Offerings absent some other Rule 15c2&hyph;12 exemption. 202 Rule 15c2&hyph;12(d)(3). 203 See, e.g. , Letter of ABA Urban Law Section; Letter of Chemical Securities; Letter of Day, Berry & Howard; Letter of Kutak Rock; Letter of Maryland Department of Economic and Employment Development. 3. Exemptions from the Recommendation Prohibition The Proposed Amendments also included a new exemption, 204 which would have permitted the recommendation in the secondary market of securities that were not subject to the underwriting prohibition, either because they were sold in a primary offering 205 of municipal securities with an aggregate principal amount of less than $1,000,000, or came within the existing exemptions for limited placements, short-term securities, and securities with demand features, 206 or within the new exemption for small, infrequent issuers. 207 This exemption has been adopted as proposed, 208 with the exception that securities sold in an exempt Offering that is subject to the limited undertaking condition, 209 are not exempt from the application of the recommendation prohibition. Pursuant to this element of the small issuer exemption, dealers must have in place procedures to receive notices of material events. 210 204 See paragraph (d)(3) of the Proposed Amendments. 205 This exemption has been modified to clarify that the recommendation prohibition will not apply to primary or secondary market trading where municipal securities are exempt at the time of their original issuance. Several commenters noted that the inclusion of the term ``a primary offering of'' created confusion, based on the stated purpose of the exemption in the Proposing Release. See, e.g. , Letter of Kutak Rock; Letter of ABA Urban Law Section; Letter of Colorado Municipal Bond Supervision Advisory Board; Letter of Day, Berry & Howard. The exemption has been modified to delete that term, thus giving the exemption its intended meaning. 206 See paragraph (d)(1) of the Proposed Amendments. 207 See paragraph (d)(2) of the Proposed Amendments. 208 Rule 15c2&hyph;12(d)(4). 209 See Rule 15c2&hyph;12(d)(2). 210 See Rule 15c2&hyph;12(b)(5)(i)(C). 4. Transactional Exemption The existing Rule 15c2&hyph;12 transactional exemption 211 permits the Commission to exempt any Participating Underwriter from any requirement of the rule. Because Rule 15c2&hyph;12, as amended, places requirements on brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers in the secondary market, the transactional exemption has been amended to clarify that the Commission has exemptive authority with respect to both Participating Underwriters, in connection with Offerings, and with respect to brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers recommending transactions in the secondary market. 212 211 Former paragraph (d) of Rule 15c2&hyph;12. 212 The transactional exemption also has been redesignated as paragraph (e) of Rule 15c2&hyph;12. E. Transitional Provision The rule as amended contains a transitional provision for the amendments to Rule 15c2&hyph;12. 213 The underwriting prohibition applies to a Participating Underwriter that has contractually committed to act as an underwriter in an Offering on or after the effective date of the rule, July 3, 1995; provided that issuers need not undertake to provide annual financial information for fiscal years ending prior to January 1, 1996. The recommendation prohibition will become effective on January 1, 1996. The Commission is of the view that this delay of six months beyond the effective date of the amendment relating to the underwriting of municipal securities is sufficient to permit participants in the municipal securities market to design procedures for compliance with the provisions of Rule 15c2&hyph;12. Brokers, dealers and municipal securities dealers must, therefore, have procedures in place to comply with the recommendation prohibition on or before January 1, 1996. Finally, the limited undertaking condition to the small issuer exemption need not be satisfied for offerings commencing prior to January 1, 1996. 213 See Rule 15c2&hyph;12(g). III. Effects on Competition and Regulatory Flexibility Act Considerations Section 23(a)(2) of the Exchange Act 214 requires the Commission, in adopting rules under the Act, to consider the anticompetitive effects of those rules, if any, and to balance that impact against the regulatory benefits gained in terms of furthering the purposes of the Exchange Act. The Commission has considered the amendments to Rule 15c2&hyph;12 in light of the standard cited in Section 23(a)(2) and believes the adoption of the amendments will not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the Exchange Act. 214 15 U.S.C. 78w(a)(2).
