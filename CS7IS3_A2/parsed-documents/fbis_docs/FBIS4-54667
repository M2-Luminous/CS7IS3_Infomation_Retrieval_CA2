According to Hogg, the talks focussed on the negotating process between the Croatian Government and the local Serb authorities from the UN protected areas and the Washington agreement. Hogg emphasized that he and the Croatian president had not discussed the possibility of using external influence to resolve the issue of the UN protected areas. In Hogg's view, the London conference remained the most effective mechanism for reaching a solution.
