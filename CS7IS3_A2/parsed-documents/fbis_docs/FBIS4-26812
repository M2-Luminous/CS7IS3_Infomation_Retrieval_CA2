"We all felt the symptoms of an economic Cold War, but this threat is being abolished with this agreement," said Yeltsin. "Today, Russia becomes a significant partner of the Europeans, and we will do everything possible to support European integration." He added that Moscow would back efforts aimed at enlarging the 12-nation bloc, which will extend formal membership to four countries later today.
