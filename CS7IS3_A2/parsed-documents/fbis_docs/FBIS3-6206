Speaking on Monday [14 March] at the Korean Police Academy's commencement ceremony in Yongin, about 40 kilometers East of Seoul, the chief executive said the more advanced a country, the more powerful its police. "Rule by law can be realized with a strong police force... We can't maintain law and order with a weak police force," he stressed. Unlawful, violent demonstrations cannot be justifed under any circumstances, nor can any violations of law and order be forgiven, he added. "The people want the police to be a strong sentry of law and order... The police must have a sense of mission to protect the people and the nation," he said. Kim said the government would not spare any efforts to modernize the country's police force and to improve their treatment and working conditions.
