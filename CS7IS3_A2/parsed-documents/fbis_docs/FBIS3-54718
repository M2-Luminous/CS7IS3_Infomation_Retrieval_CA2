Here are New Year greetings from Ukraine President Leonid Kravchuk. [Begin Kravchuk recording] It gives me great pleasure to address all people living in the CIS countries and beyond. I am convinced that if we had done this earlier, if each year we heads of state had had the opportunity to address people directly, there might have been greater mutual understanding, because everything -- life and day-to-day living -- has hampered us. We should remember and guard like the apple of our eye everything good that was started by everyone and the great capital that we all possess -- namely, mutual understanding, cooperation, and the friendship between peoples which was forged in most difficult conditions and at most difficult times. I would like to greet everyone on the occasion of the New Year and to wish them happiness and good health. I would like to emphasize that Ukraine will do everything it can to help resolve the acute problems that now divide us to some extent and give rise to certain misunderstandings between us. The first of these is the nuclear problem, and we will definitely resolve it and find a way to mutual understanding. I can already see the beginning of such a wish on the part of the Russian leadership and on the part of the United States. We will definitely solve the problem of the Black Sea. I am convinced that we will resolve other problems too. We are gradually gaining experience in improving the CIS to a position where the structure will work for all of us. In this regard, Ukraine will do everything it can to see that here too there is mutual understanding, cooperation, and mutual support. Ukraine is a state that has embarked on the path of peace, friendship, mutual understanding, and democracy, and we will continue to travel this path, strengthening ties and relations of good-neighborliness and mutual understanding with all states, and first and foremost with our neighbors. I wish you well and wish you happiness by saying: [remainder of Kravchuk's address in Ukrainian] Let everything be well with you and with us! All the best to you all and good health and happiness! Happy New Year in 1994! May this year bring all of us happiness and peace and may our hopes be fulfilled! [end recording]
