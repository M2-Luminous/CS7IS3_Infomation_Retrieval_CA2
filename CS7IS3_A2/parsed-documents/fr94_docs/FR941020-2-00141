FR941020-2-00141 FR941020-2-00082 On June 30, 1994, the consolidated capitalization ratios of GPU were approximately 43.9% for Long-Term Debt, 5.4% for Preferred Stock, 43.8% for Common Stock, and 6.9% for Short-Term Debt. The reported closing price of GPU common stock on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Tape on August 15, 1994 was $26.125 per share. If all of the Additional Common Stock were sold at that price, at June 30, 1994, the consolidated capitalization ratios of GPU would be approximately 43.0% for Long-Term Debt; 5.2% for Preferred Stock; 45.0% for Common Stock; and 6.8% for Short-Term Debt. GPU has targeted a common equity ratio of between 45.0% and 48.0%. In the quarter that ended June 30, 1994, GPU wrote off (after tax) $191.6 million, or $1.66 per share, as a result of a decision by the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court that disallowed the recovery from customers by Metropolitan Edison Company of certain future costs associated with Three Mile Island Unit No. 2 and restructuring charges associated with a GPU retirement program, and as a result of another Commonwealth Court decision that disallowed deferral of certain post-retirement benefit costs. The effect of these write-offs will severely restrict the ability of Metropolitan Edison Company and Pennsylvania Electric Company to issue senior securities during the next twelve months. GPU believes that restoration of its equity capitalization, particularly in light of the emerging competitive business environment in the electric utility industry, is necessary in order to maintain the current credit ratings of the Subsidiaries.
