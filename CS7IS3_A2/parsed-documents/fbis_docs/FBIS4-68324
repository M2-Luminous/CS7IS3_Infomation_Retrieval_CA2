In this way a long-term flight in an orbital complex will be simulated. When I dropped by one of the hospitals in the Moscow area where the experiment is being carried out (its doctors asked not to be named), in my mind's eye I already had visualized a very smart picture -- a group portrait on the first page of the newspaper, the smiling charming faces of young women. But it was not to be so. They point-blank refused to pose for us. And this was understandable. We had dropped by without warning, like a bolt out of the blue, and moreover, at what for them was the end of a very hard work day. The fact is that the experiment itself for the time being is still ahead and at the present time the subjects are undergoing so-called background (like prelaunch) medical examinations -- one had been spun around on a centrifuge today, one had been on a bicycle ergometer, another had been on the orthopedic table. Plus prophylactic examinations, analyses and consultations with specialists. "When all these analyses, and consultations with specialists are over we'll lie down and then you can come and there will be time to talk and take pictures, the girls assured us. Indeed, this is training for an experiment and it is being organized by specialists of the Institute of Biomedical Problems and is proceeding as for a real space launch. And there is no less excitement. For one her teeth were bad and treatment was necessary." Another problem: to preclude contact with outsiders (God forbid that an infection be brought in, then the entire 1 1/2 years of work would be lost). The scientific director of the work, Boris Morukov, candidate of medical sciences, only recently was one of the standbys for the space physician Valeriy Polyakov. These investigations were nothing new for Boris. Something like this was done, but with males. "The experiment is necessary for the future flight of Yelena Kondakova, who in the autumn is being sent to the Mir for a half-year," comments Morukov. "A woman in space is nothing new. There have been 20 in the United States alone. But our flight will be long term. It is necessary to take into account all the intricacies of the female body, female physiology." The candidates for the tests were selected carefully, from all of Russia. The call was already sent out early last year. The competition was announced by television, by radio and in the press. The requirements were quite rigorous, with respect to medical requirements the same as for cosmonauts. Here are the names of the subjects: Olga Semenova, Sveta Retsina, Tatyana Turboyevskaya, Zhenya Chelnokova, Elena Berdyyeva, Zoya Zhiyentayeva, Galina Kirillova, Natasha Chidikova. Among them there are specialists of the Biomedical Problems Institute and athlete trainers and a construction technician and an economist. The experimental conditions are not easy. All 120 days (!) in a row they are to lie there without getting up in a position with the head lower than the legs (it is necessary to ensure an intensified blood flow to the head, as in a state of weightlessness). The prophylactic tools used against hypokinesia are the same as on a space station: treadmill and bicycle ergometer. It will be necessary to employ these trainers in the same horizontal position. I listen to what the physicians on duty are saying and look at the very complex equipment which will be used in the experiment and I am involuntarily filled with respect for the volunteer space recluses. Good luck to you, courageous subjects with great patience!
