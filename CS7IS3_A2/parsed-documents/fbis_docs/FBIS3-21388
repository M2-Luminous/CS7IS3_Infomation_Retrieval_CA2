As much as two to three per cent of Singapore's reserves are sought to be invested initially in developing infrastructure in the newly industrialised economies (NIEs) of the future, such as India. The amount could be raised to 35 per cent over the next decade. This was stated here today by the Singapore Prime Minister, Mr. Goh Chok Tong, who called for the creation of a "Yin-Yang" or complementary relationship between the two countries. "Yin" and "Yang" are the two opposing and yet balancing elements in Chinese philosophy. Addressing a meeting of Indian businessmen, organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry, he felt that the contrasting strengths of the two economies created an opportunity for a long-term strategic business alliance between the private sectors of the two countries. Agreement signed: A strategic framework agreement was signed on the occasion between the Singapore Manufacturers' Association and the CII (Confederation of Indian Industry) to promote trade, investment and economic cooperation between the industries of the two countries. Mr. Tong told Indian businessmen at the meeting that the countries expected to become NIEs, such as Hong Kong and Taiwan, over the next two decades are China, India and Vietnam. In case India's economic reforms quickened, it could become a mega-economy such as China and Japan. While urging further opening up of the economy, especially in the banking sector, he felt that concessions extended to non-resident Indians should be available to other Singapore businessmen. "Singapore should be treated as an NRI (Nonresident Indian) country," he commented amidst laughter. On reducing customs tariff, he said it would be welcome, but recognised the revenue implications involved for the Government of India. Similarly, the need for taking into account trade unions' views on the unemployment likely to be caused by the economic restructuring in India was also a knotty political issue, he conceded. `India must go international': Replying to questions from Indian businessmen, Mr. Goh suggested that India's growth rate should be in the region of about six per cent per annum to take the two per cent population growth into account. This was the right time for India to "go international," he observed, as it had certain basic strengths in terms of an industrial base and pool of technically qualified manpower. Mr. Goh highlighted the prospects of joint ventures between the two countries, especially in the ASEAN countries as well as China, Myanmar and Vietnam. Singapore could offer capital, management, access to technology and the market. "We can be your link to the Asia-Pacific," he said. In this context, he mentioned the first major collaboration scheme, the $150 million Bangalore information technology park. This is an integrated project to develop offices, factories, houses and recreational facilities to be set up over a five-year period. It is a joint development programme involving a consortium of Singapore companies, Tatas and the Karnataka Government. Mr. Goh said, "we are building an external wing to our economy, we are encouraging our businessmen to invest in the region." He pointed out that till now Singapore's reserves have been invested mainly in bonds, stocks and real estate in the developed countries. But it had now been decided to invest a portion of the country's reserves in stable, high growth developing countries of Asia. The investment would be directly in infrastructure projects, industries, hotels and tourist facilities as well as commercial properties. `Open sky policy': Asked about the need for an "open sky policy" in India, he said the Indian Prime Minister had indicated interest in allowing the entry of Singapore International Airlines (SIA) to more destinations in this country. But the Civil Aviation Minister was more cautious in this regard, he said. Mr. Goh maintained that SIA could bring tourists into the country in order to achieve India's target of increasing tourist arrivals from the present level of one million per annum to three to five million per annum over the next few years. He said it was Singapore's open sky policy which had improved tourism growth and also made SIA one of the best airlines in the world. Regarding India's alignment with regional trading blocs, he felt that India should move eastwards while seeking to enter into any regional trade blocs. Conceding the problems faced by India in trying to align with the various regional blocs of the East as well as West, he expressed the view that European countries had a greater preoccupation with Eastern Europe at this stage.
