FR940622-2-00011 FR940622-2-00005 Analysis of Comments Received We gave interested parties an opportunity to comment on the preliminary results. We received no comments. Final Results of the Review We determine the following dumping margin for the periods August 1, 1991 through July 31, 1992 and August 1, 1992 through July 31, 1993: ‚ê£ 1Manufacturer/Exporter 1Margin (Percent) Haifa Chemicals Ltd 6.82 The Department will instruct the Customs Service to assess antidumping duties on all appropriate entries. Individual differences between United States price and foreign market value may vary from the percentages stated above. The Department will issue appraisement instructions directly to the Customs Service. Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective upon publication of these final results of administrative reviews for all shipments of the subject merchandise, entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption as provided by section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act: (1) The cash deposit rate for the reviewed company will be the rate as listed; (2) for previously reviewed or investigated companies not listed above, the cash deposit rate will continue to be the company-specific rate published for the most recent period; (3) if the exporter is not a firm covered in these reviews, a prior review, or the original less-than-fair-value investigation, but the manufacturer is, the cash deposit rate will be the rate established for the most recent period for the manufacturer of the merchandise; and (4) cash deposits for all other manufacturers or exporters will be the ``all other'' rate of 1.77 percent. This is the rate established during the LTFV investigation. These deposit requirements shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next administrative review. This notice also serves as a final reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during these review periods. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement of antidumping duties occurred and subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties. This notice also serves as the only reminder to parties subject to administrative protective order (APO) of their responsibilities concerning the return or destruction of proprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance with 19 CFR 353.34(d). Failure to comply is a violation of the APO. These administrative reviews and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1)) and 19 CFR 353.22. Dated: June 15, 1994. Susan G. Esserman, Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;15181 Filed 6&hyph;21&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DS-P
