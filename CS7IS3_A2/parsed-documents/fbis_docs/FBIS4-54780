"The anchor is yet to be cast well but the present cabinet has already marked out a place for it," Jeszenszky continued, using this metaphor to summarize the results of the Hungarian Government's foreign policy over the past four years. The minister said this policy has been successful, also according to foreign opinions. The government has carried through most of what it promised in this field at the time of taking office, he said. The cabinet's accomplishment is based on ideas and values professed by the bulk of the population. This has contributed to establishing the external preconditions of internal political and economic development, Jeszenszky said.
