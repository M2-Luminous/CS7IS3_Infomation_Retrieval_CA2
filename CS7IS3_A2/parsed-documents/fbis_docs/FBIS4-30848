As a result of the protest, which began in February, "S" has become considerably weaker. In OPZZ Ewa Spychalska is the top dog, and it has become clear that the union will neither leave the Democratic Left Alliance nor organize any protests against the present government. The demonstration of "S" was attended by... Fewer Unionists ...than had been announced by the union's leaders. "All of Poland will go there," they said; during the demonstration they stated that there certainly are as many of them as there were in the February rally. At that time 27,000 persons participated in the demonstration; on 27 May there were fewer persons. It seemed that after the strikes, which were not so great, not "nationwide," not so "general," after the lost battles with the government, "S" would like to attract as many persons as possible to the demonstration heading for the premises of the Office of the Council of Ministers; it seemed that it would want to do that to show its strength and to shake its fist at the government -- for the last time before the second stage of the protest action. This is not what actually happened, though. One can claim, of course, that it is not "S" itself that is to blame for what went wrong -- because for example, the General Directorate of the Polish State Railroads made the consequences of the strike of the railroads workers easier to endure for the people. It is also possible that, as Krzaklewski says, "if there had been a strike fund in every enterprise, every second company would have stopped work"; it is possible that to blame are "the people with portfolios, travelling all over the country and putting out strikes with pay raises"; it is also possible that work forces and the trade union itself are simply responsible and know which enterprises can go on strike, for how long, and when. One thing that is certain is that the leaders... Were Saying More Than Was Actually Happening. They discredited themselves and their actions by referring to short breaks in work, rallies, and collections of money for the strike fund as "nationwide and general" actions. "They should not have come here all the way from Gdansk and have said at rallies: We will force the authorities to pay for the strike," said one mining activist. Lignite mines extracted this pay "from the throats of the authorities," and so did zinc and lead mines, probably resorting to threats, because they suspected that the "S" leadership is too weak and the authorities of the Republic of Poland are too strong. Hard coal miners agreed to join the strike, but supported only the demands of their own branch -- they did not back the slogan "a million for the bottom, a half million for the top." It seemed that when they get what they want and achieve political success, they will resign themselves to the lack of pay for the strike. On the other hand, the government has always paid and this was promised by the "top" of "S." There was no fund, no support; the promises turned out to be empty. Therefore, miners, just as many other enterprises in Poland, felt deceived by their own people. They were not numerously represented at the demonstration -- only the representatives of several mines participated in it. There were fewer people because... Since January They Had Already Become Tired ...of the action, which was constantly being discussed. Those who did come, however, were more determined and more than ever had their gaze fixed on the chairman, who "folded up the umbrella," cut the union off from parties, politicians, and the president. In the meantime, there are rumors that Silesia -- the main force of the union -- is getting ready to have certain things explained. Less than fifty percent of all mines took part in the strike. The present heads of the regions and of the mining secretariat at first implemented the decisions of the National Committee; however, toward the end of the action they showed impatience. All the other mines are said to sympathize with the former authorities; therefore, in the present strikes strength in bargaining about the region's stand was shown. The second stage of the "S" protest action consisted of "legal interventions" in all establishments; the union started this stage weaker than it was before the strikes; it found itself helplessly asking the question: What should be done next? Let us now analyze... What Happened at Third OPZZ Congress. It is worth recalling that last year Ewa Spychalska gave the government from three to six months to begin implementing the election program. OPZZ stressed the necessity for full valorization of disability and retirement pensions, as well as the annulment of the enterprise tax on above-normative pays [popiwek]. Next the union voted for the budget on condition that it was amended. After the Third Congress practically nothing changed within OPZZ. Ewa Spychalska easily maintained and consolidated her leading position. Generally, OPZZ does not want to leave the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] or protest government activities -- it wants to negotiate. This is the most important issue. For those who carefully followed the course of the congress sessions, the rest of the decisions remains in the sphere of rhetoric (at the congress unequivocal declarations were made that "OPZZ will not be an umbrella for any government," and that unionists would demand full valorization of retirement and disability pensions, and oppose the new enterprise tax on above-normative pays and insufficient expenditure on the budget sphere). Both before and after the congress... The Government Was Not Overly Concerned ...about the demands and declarations. There is no valorization; the government wants the new enterprise tax on above-normative pays to stay (even though Prime Minister Pawlak once again did not make a clear statement on that). Deputy Prime Minister Kolodko told the unionists that the amendment of the budget is now neither possible nor necessary. If there is such a possibility, the changes will be only minimal. In addition, Grzegorz Kolodko, deputy prime minister and finance minister, (in his speech, which was very good) provocatively asked the unionists for advice: Should the taxes, raised in 1994, be decreased, with all the consequences for the budget sphere? Should they be maintained at the present level? Or should they be further increased? This statement caused consternation in the conference hall: It was clear that the unionists of the industry and the unionists of the "budget sphere" are aware of two different answers. Taking advantage of the situation, the deputy prime minister asked whether it would be a good idea to limit the time of work and the salaries in regions that are particularly threatened by unemployment, and to employ more people there. "Because this is what solidarity is about." There was no answer. Kolodko promised that, if the budget is amended, he would ask unionists who should be given the additional several billions of zlotys (he knew that the line of the people whose interests the congress participants represented would be long and that the interests would be conflicting). There was no discussion with the deputy prime minister, nor were there any statements of dissatisfaction. Following the Old Custom... ...the participants started to clap their hands. The same was done after the speeches of other officials, even though they mostly complimented OPZZ. After the guests left, the participants of the congress, again following the old custom, adopted several resolutions demanding many things from the government. Assurances were given that OPZZ would also be able to stage a strike and that it would not serve as an umbrella. The decision was made to form an union circle within SLD (incidentally, all the time during the conflict with Stanislaw Wisniewski, who was forming his own faction, Chairwoman Spychalska claimed that such a circle had existed for a long time). Thus, the course of the congress does not suggest that OPZZ will make any changes in the policy that it has been carrying out thus far.
