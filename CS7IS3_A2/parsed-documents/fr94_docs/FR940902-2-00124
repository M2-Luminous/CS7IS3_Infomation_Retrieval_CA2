FR940902-2-00124 FR940902-2-00053 Trust Assets 2. The Applicants seek exemptive relief to permit plans to invest in pass-through certificates representing undivided interests in the following categories of trusts: (1) single and multi-family residential or commercial mortgage investment trusts; 7 (2) motor vehicle receivable investment trusts; (3) consumer or commercial receivables investment trusts; and (4) guaranteed governmental mortgage pool certificate investment trusts. 8 7 The Department notes that PTE 83&hyph;1 [48 FR 895, January 7, 1983], a class exemption for mortgage pool investment trusts, would generally apply to trusts containing single-family residential mortgages, provided that the applicable conditions of PTE 83&hyph;1 are met. The Applicants request relief for single-family residential mortgages in this exemption because it would prefer one exemption for all trusts of similar structure. However, the Applicants have stated that they may still avail themselves of the exemptive relief provided by PTE 83&hyph;1. 8 Guaranteed governmental mortgage pool certificates are mortgage-backed securities with respect to which interest and principal payable is guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC), or the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA). The Department's regulation relating to the definition of plan assets (29 CFR 2510.3&hyph;101(i)) provides that where a plan acquires a guaranteed governmental mortgage pool certificate, the plan's assets include the certificate and all of its rights with respect to such certificate under applicable law, but do not, solely by reason of the plan's holding of such certificate, include any of the mortgages underlying such certificate. The Applicants are requesting exemptive relief for trusts containing guaranteed governmental mortgage pool certificates because the certificates in the trusts may be plan assets. 3. Commercial mortgage investment trusts may include mortgages on ground leases of real property. Commercial mortgages are frequently secured by ground leases on the underlying property, rather than by fee simple interests. The separation of the fee simple interest and the ground lease interest is generally done for tax reasons. Properly structured, the pledge of the ground lease to secure a mortgage provides a lender with the same level of security as would be provided by a pledge of the related fee simple interest. The terms of the ground leases pledged to secure leasehold mortgages will in all cases be at least ten years longer than the term of such mortgages. 9 9 Trust assets may also include obligations that are secured by leasehold interests on residential real property. See PTE 90&hyph;32 involving Prudential-Bache Securities, Inc. (55 FR 23147, June 6, 1990 at 23150). Trust Structure 4. Each trust is established under a pooling and servicing agreement between a sponsor, a servicer and a trustee. The sponsor or servicer of a trust selects assets to be included in the trust. These assets are receivables which may have been originated by a sponsor or servicer of the trust, an affiliate of the sponsor or servicer, or by an unrelated lender and subsequently acquired by the trust sponsor or servicer. On or prior to the closing date, the sponsor acquires legal title to all assets selected for the trust, establishes the trust and designates an independent entity as trustee. On the closing date, the sponsor conveys to the trust legal title to the assets, and the trustee issues certificates representing fractional undivided interests in the trust assets. The certificates are either publicly or privately offered. Certificateholders are entitled to receive monthly or quarterly installments of principal and/or interest, or lease payments due on the receivables, adjusted, in the case of payments of interest, to a specified rate_the pass-through rate_which may be fixed or variable. A segregated account is established in the name of the trustee or the servicer (in either case, on behalf of certificateholders) to hold funds received between distribution dates. The account is under the sole control of the trustee or the servicer, as applicable, who invests the account's assets in short-term securities which have received a rating comparable to the rating assigned to the certificates. In some cases, the servicer may be permitted to make a single deposit into the account once a month. When the servicer makes such monthly deposits, payments received from obligors by the servicer may be commingled with the servicer's assets during the month prior to deposit. In no event will the period of time between receipt of funds by the servicer and deposit of these funds in a segregated account exceed 45 days.
