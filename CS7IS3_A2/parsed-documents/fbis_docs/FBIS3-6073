"We are getting close to an agreement," U.S. Commerce Secretary Ron Brown said. Brown told KYODO NEWS SERVICE the two sides have made "significant progress" in resolving their differences and indicated a final deal could come at any time. "We are pleased with that progress but you never announce agreements before they are finally reached," Brown said. White House press secretary Dee Dee Myers earlier Friday characterized the bilateral negotiations as "going very well." Reports from Tokyo indicated Motorola Inc. and its Japanese partner, Nippon Idou Tsushin Corp. (IDO), the two firms embroiled in the dispute, have worked out a tentative accord and are now working on the specifics. In a statement released Friday, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor cautioned against undue expectations over an imminent deal, saying the two countries have yet to work out "all the terms" necessary for an agreement. "At this time progress has been made but the United States and Japan have yet to reach agreement on all the terms," Kantor said in a brief statement issued while on a visit to Chile. The dispute stems from charges Kantor made a month ago that the Japanese Government has breached a 1989 trade accord that provides for "comparable market access" in the cellular phone service in Japan. Kantor has threatened to impose trade sanctions on Japan unless there is a negotiated settlement and the U.S. Government is scheduled to unveil a list by March 17 of Japanese products that will be subject to punitive tariffs. Brown sounded a note of optimism in his interview with KYODO when asked about the impact of a cellular phone accord on the overall bilateral relationship. "Every success is a good sign in improving the trade relationship," he said. Laura Tyson, head of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, echoed Brown's assessment. A cellular phone agreement would be "a step forward in terms of the trade tensions and trade relations between the two countries," Tyson told KYODO. Saddled by a vast Japanese trade surplus, trade ties between Japan and the U.S. have taken a sharp plunge with the collapse of top-level trade talks February 11 between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton. Kantor has seized the cellular phone dispute as an example of Japan's unwillingness to open its markets, particularly in high-technology sectors, to foreign competition. The prospect of a settlement in the cellular phone dispute under the threat of U.S. sanctions has convinced some officials in the U.S. Government that a "get-tough" trade policy with Japan works. "We have taken a very firm position" with regard to Japan, Brown told a news conference Friday. "I happen to believe that the results of that policy are now looming to fruition," he said.
