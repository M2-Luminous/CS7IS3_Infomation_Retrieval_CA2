Introduction Lakes, swamps and suburban rivers of cities have been growingly polluted recently in accordance with various kinds of waste water drainage. From the viewpoint of resources both for domestic and industrial waters, much call has been made on the advanced water treatment technique in addition with the conventional one. In this advanced water treatment, more adsorption operation is employed by granular and powdered activated carbon for the purpose of removal of organic substances, color, odor, etc. We already succeeded in a promising result from two experiments at Kashiwai Water-works of Chiba Prefecture and Murano of Osaka Prefecture using a pitch-based activated carbon fiber (ACF). This paper deals with the further development that the pitch-based ACF has been reformed and the development of higher performance ACF ventured on. 2. Reforming ACF Necessity has been confirmed by experiments for commercialization so far conducted on the conventional pitch-based ACF to improve the removal performance of dissolved organic substances and Tri-Holomethane Formation Potential compounds. Thus, improvement of the above-mentioned removal performance was experimented by enlarging micropore size based on this ACF. 2-1 Micropore Distribution of Reformed Carbon Fiber The reformed carbon fiber used at this experiment is one reactivated after the conventional pitch-based ACF was applied with a special treatment. The microporous distribution was measured by the low-temperature nitrogen adsorption method. An example of the results is shown on Table 1 and Figure 1. <graphic> </graphic> <graphic> <capt> Figure 1. Pore Distribution</graphic> It is known from these data that, while keeping micropore, mesopore has increased on selective basis. Especially, in the reformed carbon fiber of C-Series, it is seen that pore nearly 19 Angstroms is exceedingly growing. According with this phenomenon, the adsorption performance on high-molecular substance is expected to be growing. 2-2 Surface Observation by Scanning-Type Electron Microscope Electron microscopic photos taken at pre- and post-reforming are shown in Figure 2 [not reproduced] and Figure 3 [not reproduced], respectively. Compared with a very smooth surface before reforming, mesopore is observed to have occurred after reforming. However, its generation was not much and no change was made on the radius of fiber, so it is regarded that there is no problem for the utilization of water treatment. 2-3 Adsorption Test by Model Materials The adsorption performance was confirmed using such model materials as Vitamin B[.sub]12[/], DBS (Dodecyl Benzene Sulfonic Acid Natrium), PTS (Pala-Toluene Sulfonic Acid Natrium), BS (Benzene Sulfonic Acid Natrium). Figure 4 [not reproduced] shows the result of adsorption performance of large-molecular Vitamin B[.sub]12[/]. Improved adsorption performance was confirmed compared with conventional ACF (A-10: 1000 m[.sup]2[/]/g). Especially, it shows a performance surpassing granular activated carbon in the most-advanced, reformed sample (E-1). DBS, PTS and BS are different in the alkyl group combined to the benzene ring, and the order of adsorption performance to respective activated carbon was so much varied that it was impossible to explain merely by mesopore like Vitamin B[.sub]12[/]. However, the adsorption performance of the reformed carbon fiber was equal or more for each of materials. In other words, it is known that the adsorption performance will never be degraded by reforming and that of larger molecular material has been improved. The remarkable improvement of reformed carbon fiber in its adsorption performance has been confirmed also with TOC and TOXP. 3. Water Treatment Test by Reformed Carbon A model test of water treatment was conducted using reformed carbon fiber. Industrial water was filtered by Watman paper and the adsorption treatment effect was confirmed by amount of Tri-Halomethane [as published] Formation Potential after adsorption and dissolved organic substance. The typical condition of water flow is shown on Table 2 and the removal effect on Table 3. Table 2.

Conclusion The following conclusion was derived as a result of the execution of advanced water treatment test using reformed activated carbon fiber. (1) Required activation degree of reformed carbon fiber The activation nearly equal to that of reformed carbon fiber shown on Table 1 is required in order to attain the target level of removal, THM Potential > 80 percent and TOC > 50 percent, and, it is judged that advanced treatment performance, either equal to or more than granular activated carbon will be attained, if reformed carbon fiber around this level is used. (2) Water flow condition Subject to the activation degree of reformed carbon fiber, the condition will be required somewhere around: SV = 8 Hr[.sup]-1[/], water flow ratio = 50 m[.sup]3[/]/ACF-kg. (3) Regeneration Regeneration by alkali is possible with any of reformed carbons fiber, same as raw material carbon fiber.
