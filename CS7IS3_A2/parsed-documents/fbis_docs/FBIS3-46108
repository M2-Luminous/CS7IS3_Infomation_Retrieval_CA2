Xu Bonian, vice chairman of the regional committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, attended the forum. Wang Qun gave important views. Wang Qun said: The theory of Comrade Deng Xiaoping on building socialism with Chinese characteristics is a complete system and a strong ideological weapon for guiding the Chinese people to realize the great ideal of invigorating China. At present the most important task is to use this theory to further arm the minds of the whole party, in particular, the leading cadres at all levels. on the basis of studying well the original work in line with the reality of the current reform and development, we should realistically unify our ideology with the spirit of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the 14th party congress, and the third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. Wang Qun pointed out: Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, great achievements have been made in the whole country, in the regional economic construction, reform, opening up and in all fields of work. These achievements can be seen by all. We should extensively popularize these achievements in an effort to strengthen the confidence of the masses of people of various nationalities, including the broad masses of teachers and students of colleges and universities, in advancing triumphantly along the socialist road with Chinese characteristics. We should educate the broad masses of cadres to correctly recognize the current situation, seize the opportunity, and spare no efforts to comprehensively advance reform and opening up. It is necessary to properly handle the relations of reform, development and stability, and the relationship between the part and the whole, and between immediate interests and long-term ones in an effort to stimulate the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of cadres and the people and to give better play to reform and development. Wang Qun pointed out: While fully affirming the achievements, and the current situation in the main aspect, we should analyze the existing difficulties and problems on our road of advance in a fact- seeking manner. Reform and construction is the cause of 100 million people. As long as we unswervingly rely on the broad masses of workers, peasants, intellectuals, and cadres at all levels, mobilize all positive factors, and unite with all the forces that can be united, we can overcome all difficulties. We should continue to promote the spirit of arduous struggle and dedication, work with one heart and one mind, help one another, and work in a down-to-earth manner. Only thus, can we be able to overcome all difficulties, create new achievements, and win new victories. In referring to the issue of anticorruption, Wang Qun said: We should historically and dialectically analyze unhealthy trends and corrupt phenomena, fully understand the long-term nature, arduousness and complexity of anticorruption struggle, and realistically regard this struggle as one of the strategic tasks and uphold it with unremitting efforts. At present, our region has achieved certain achievements in anticorruption struggle, and the self-inspection and correction of leading cadres, the investigation and handling of major and appalling cases, and the checking of unhealthy trends in various trades are being deeply carried out. He said: In anticorruption work, we must first be resolute and second be fact-seeking, and manage things in line with law. We should combine reform and anticorruption with stability and development in an effort to guarantee the smooth progress of reform, opening up, and economic construction. In his speech, Wang Qun fully affirmed the work of Inner Mongolia University and its special educational program on the current situation which will be carried out soon.
