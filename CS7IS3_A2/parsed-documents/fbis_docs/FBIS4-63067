As many as nine pits are affected and depending on the shift, 500 to 700 miners stay away from work. In an interview with INTERFAX on Thursday [19 May], local prosecutors qualified the action as legitimate. Union spokeswoman Olga Krivodanova said the management of the Karagandaugol company had offered the unions to set up a conciliatory commission to try to settle differences. The union leaders are ready to enter negotiations but do not want to suspend the strike while the management is studying the miners' demands. Krivodanova stressed that the administration had had enough time to examine the package, which it received six months ago. She said the strike would not be called off until an appropriate agreement was signed. Management officials and union leaders are scheduled to meet on Friday to discuss the dispute. The spokeswoman also said that large sums of money were brought to the pits to clear the management's debt in back wages for April. "The administration is trying to defuse tension," Krivodanova said. The company employs more than 100,000 workers, but only 6,000 of them belong to the independent unions.
