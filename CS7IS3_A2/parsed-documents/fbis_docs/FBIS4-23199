Several government soldiers and civilians who have been imprisoned in the camp were set free. RPF forces have received cooperation of the residents in the area, who are handing over arms and ammunitions that were supplied by government functionaries. As RPF forces advanced toward the town of Gitarama, the self-imposed government is on the run to unknown destinations. Some sources say that the government may now be in the town of Kibuye near the Zairian border while others say that the government may now be in Gisenyi, also near the Zairian border. Some cabinet ministers have been sighted in the town of Gisenyi and others have already taken refuge in other countries, pretending to be on diplomatic missions. [passage omitted].
