FR941216-1-00060 FR941216-1-00010 (g) Taxation of integrated transactions _(1) General rule. An integrated transaction is generally treated as a single transaction by the taxpayer during the period that the transaction qualifies as an integrated transaction. Except as provided in paragraph (g)(12) of this section, while a qualifying debt instrument and a §1.1275&hyph;6 hedge are part of an integrated transaction, neither the qualifying debt instrument nor the §1.1275&hyph;6 hedge is subject to the rules that would apply on a separate basis to the debt instrument and the §1.1275&hyph;6 hedge, including sections 263(g), 475, 1092, 1256, or 1258, or §§1.446- 3, 1.446&hyph;4, or 1.1221&hyph;2. The rules that would govern the treatment of the synthetic debt instrument generally govern the treatment of the integrated transaction. For example, the integrated transaction may be subject to section 263(g) or, if the synthetic debt instrument would be part of a straddle, section 1092. Generally, the synthetic debt instrument is subject to sections 163(e), 1271 through 1275, and 1286 with terms as follows. (2) Issue date. The issue date of the synthetic debt instrument is the date the §1.1275&hyph;6 hedge is entered into by the taxpayer. (3) Term. The term of the synthetic debt instrument is the period beginning on the issue date of the synthetic debt instrument and ending on the maturity date of the qualifying debt instrument. (4) Issue price. The issue price of the synthetic debt instrument is the adjusted issue price of the qualifying debt instrument on the issue date of the synthetic debt instrument. (5) Adjusted issue price. In general, the adjusted issue price of the synthetic debt instrument is determined under the principles of §1.1275&hyph;1(c). (6) Qualified stated interest. Qualified stated interest payments on the synthetic debt instrument are payments that would be treated as qualified stated interest under the principles of §1.1273&hyph;1(c) if the payments were stated as interest. (7) Stated redemption price at maturity_ (i) Synthetic debt instruments that are borrowings. If the synthetic debt instrument is a borrowing, the instrument's stated redemption price at maturity is the sum of all amounts paid or to be paid on the qualifying debt instrument and the §1.1275&hyph;6 hedge, reduced by any amounts received or to be received on the §1.1275&hyph;6 hedge and any amounts treated as qualified stated interest on the synthetic debt instrument under paragraph (g)(6) of this section. (ii) Synthetic debt instruments that are loans. If the synthetic debt instrument is a loan, the instrument's stated redemption price at maturity is the sum of all amounts received or to be received on the qualifying debt instrument and the §1.1275&hyph;6 hedge, reduced by any amounts paid or to be paid on the §1.1275&hyph;6 hedge and any amounts treated as qualified stated interest on the synthetic debt instrument under paragraph (g)(6) of this section. (8) Source of interest income and allocation of expense. The source of interest income from the synthetic debt instrument is determined by reference to the source of income of the qualifying debt instrument under sections 861(a)(1) and 862(a)(1). For purposes of section 904, the character of interest from the synthetic debt instrument is determined by reference to the character of the interest income from the qualifying debt instrument. Interest expense is allocated and apportioned under regulations under section 861 or under §1.882&hyph;5. (9) Effectively connected income. Interest income of a foreign person resulting from a synthetic debt instrument entered into by the foreign person that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section is treated as effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business. Interest expense of a foreign person resulting from an integrated transaction entered into by the foreign person that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section is allocated and apportioned under §1.882&hyph;5. (10) Not a short-term obligation. If the synthetic debt instrument has a term of one year or less, the synthetic debt instrument is not treated as a short-term obligation for purposes of section 1272(a)(2)(C). (11) Special rules for integration by the Commissioner. If the Commissioner requires integration, appropriate adjustments are made to the treatment of the synthetic debt instrument, and, if necessary, the qualifying debt instrument and financial instrument. For example, the Commissioner may treat a financial instrument that is not a §1.1275&hyph;6 hedge as a §1.1275&hyph;6 hedge when applying the rules of this section. The issue date of the synthetic debt instrument is the date determined appropriate by the Commissioner to require integration. (12) Retention of separate transaction rules for certain purposes. This paragraph (g)(12) provides for the retention of separate transaction rules for certain purposes. In addition, the Commissioner may require use of separate transaction rules for any aspect of an integrated transaction by publication in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see §601.601(d)(2)(ii) of this chapter). (i) Foreign persons that enter into integrated transactions giving rise to U.S. source income not effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business. If a foreign person enters into an integrated transaction that gives rise to U.S. source interest income (determined under the source rules for the synthetic debt instrument) not effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business of the foreign person, paragraph (g) of this section does not apply for purposes of sections 871(a), 881, 1441, 1442, and 6049. These sections of the Internal Revenue Code are applied to the qualifying debt instrument and the §1.1275&hyph;6 hedge on a separate basis. For example, if a U.S. corporation issues a qualifying debt instrument and enters into a notional principal contract that is a §1.1275&hyph;6 hedge, the source of interest on the qualifying debt instrument is determined under section 861. In general, the interest constitutes U.S. source interest that is subject to withholding tax to the extent provided in sections 871, 881, 1441, and 1442. The source of payments on the notional principal contract is determined under §1.863&hyph;7 and, to the extent paid to a non-U.S. person who is not engaged in a U.S. trade or business, constitutes non-U.S. source income that is not subject to U.S. withholding tax. (ii) Relationship between issuer and holder. Because the rules of this section affect only the taxpayer holding or issuing the qualifying debt instrument (i.e., either the issuer or a particular holder), any provisions of the Internal Revenue Code or regulations that govern the relationship between the issuer and holder of the qualifying debt instrument are applied on a separate basis. For example, taxpayers must comply with any reporting or disclosure requirements on any qualifying debt instrument as if it were not part of an integrated transaction. Thus, if required under §1.1275&hyph;4(b)(4), an issuer of a contingent payment debt instrument subject to integrated treatment must provide the projected payment schedule to holders.
