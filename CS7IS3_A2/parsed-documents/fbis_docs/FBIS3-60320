But only four of them (Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, and Sweden) were represented by both their ministers of environment and agriculture. Pleading the GATT negotiations, Germany and France sent higher civil servants, just like Finland and Switzerland. According to Greenpeace and the World Fund for Nature, this shows that "there is no real European political will to protect the North Sea." However, the report drawn up by a working group is crushing: 1.7 million tons of nitrogenous substances (ammonia, nitrates) are dumped into the sea every year, 900,000 tons of which come from agricultural activities. This leads to a rarefaction of oxygen in the marine environment. The efforts made since the conference held in The Hague in 1990 have not improved the situation and the states that border the sea almost unanimously admit that it will not be possible to reduce by half the dumping of nitrogen and phosphates by 1995, as expected. All the more, as Danish Environment Minister Svend Auken pointed out, since "industrialized countries like France, Great Britain, and Norway continue to dump nontreated sewage water from the cities into the sea." "Those countries," he added, "lack the courage to impose sacrifices on their citizens in order to pay the costs of filtering stations." Mr. Auken emphasized that "Denmark has spent ECU1 billion in taxpayer money to clean waters carrying sewage." Taking place before the major 1995 conference that also is to be held in Copenhagen, this intervening meeting discussed various types of pollution, whose scope was not known, including the smoke from ship stacks or the dumping of oil during illegal degasification of ships, not to mention the leaks and other incidents in the 4,000 [oil] wells and the 140 offshore oil and gas rigs in the North Sea. "Even more outrageous and more dangerous is the release of radioactive waste from the Sellafield nuclear recycling plant" (northwest England), reported Greenpeace during the meeting. The British delegation, which included the agriculture minister, has not reacted to the protest, which was supported by Denmark, which has requested that an end be put to the release of such waste. Great Britain is the only country that has not published data on the reduction of pollutants in the North Sea.
