FR940916-1-00104 FR940916-1-00016 Section 232.201. This section contains general requirements regarding the development of formal training programs. FRA proposes to require each railroad to develop a formal program to train and to qualify personnel, including contract personnel, responsible for the inspection, testing, and maintenance of train brake systems. The contemplated program is similar to programs being instituted voluntarily by several of the major railroads. The vast majority of the comments and the experience of FRA inspectors support the contention that many of the people inspecting and testing train brake systems do not have the training and background to understand what they are doing and why they are doing it. As part of these programs, railroads will be required to notify employees and contractors of their current qualification status and to require periodic requalification. Railroads will be expected to update their training programs as they introduce new train brake system technology. In order for a railroad to institute a training program without prior FRA approval, a railroad will be required to certify to FRA that its training program incorporates the training and experience guidelines established by FRA for train brake system supervisors, mechanical inspectors, electronic inspectors, and train crew members. The specific training and experience guidelines, contained in the preambles for §§232.205&hyph;232.211 were developed by FRA based upon its expertise and experience in the railroad industry. They represent FRA's best judgement as to what is currently necessary in order to meet the broad qualification standards contained in the aforementioned sections of the rule. If, based on the comments received and after further consideration, FRA elects to adopt the approach proposed in this notice, the specific training and experience guidelines will be contained in a separate appendix to this part in the final rule. FRA recognizes that more stringent guidelines may be required or that the guidelines may need to be specifically contained in the text of the rule. FRA also recognizes that there may be alternative methods of providing training and experience, not yet known to FRA, that might achieve the same level of skill and knowledge. Consequently, in order to further develop and evaluate this proposal, FRA seeks comments from all interested parties regarding the following issues: (1) Are the guidelines proposed by FRA, in the preamble to this subpart, an accurate assessment of the minimum training and experience required for individuals to adequately perform the duties required of them? If not, what should the minimum guidelines include? (2) Should the proposed minimum training and/or minimum experience guidelines be raised or lowered? Explain. (3) Should the training and experience requirements proposed to be in guidelines be included in the text of the final rule instead? (4) Are there alternative criteria or approaches for ensuring that qualified individuals are performing brake tests, inspections, and maintenance? This section also requires that if a railroad develops a training program inconsistent with the training and experience guidelines established by FRA, the railroad must submit the program to FRA for FRA approval prior to implementing the program. A program will be considered inconsistent with the training and experience guidelines if it permits the qualification of any individual with less than the training or experience provided for in the guidelines. Railroads are encouraged and permitted to develop training programs with more extensive training and experience requirements without seeking FRA's approval. FRA recognizes that future technological developments and innovations, not yet apparent to FRA, might result in a reduced necessity for certain training or experience requirements. Thus, a railroad submitting an inconsistent program for FRA approval must provide detailed information regarding their rationale for deviating from the proposed training and experience guidelines ( e.g. , technological improvements, equipment reliability, innovative or intensive training techniques) and explain how their programs ensure that qualified individuals will be performing tests, inspections, and maintenance of brake systems as required by this part. While a program is being reviewed by FRA, the railroad submitting the program will be unable to take advantage of the incentives offered to railroads for using qualified employees to perform various tests, inspections, and maintenance of train brake systems, unless the railroad has a training program in effect which incorporates the specific training and experience guidelines. Section 232.202. This section outlines the general qualification requirements for train brake system maintenance personnel. FRA believes a higher level of knowledge and skill is required to perform brake system maintenance than is required to perform brake system inspections and tests. Therefore, the general requirements for brake system maintenance personnel should be more stringent than the requirements for personnel performing only brake system inspections and tests. FRA considers train brake system maintenance an essential element of overall railroad safety. The knowledge and skill of the personnel responsible for train brake system maintenance are the keys to an effective maintenance program. Therefore, FRA proposes a set of general minimum qualification requirements for all personnel, including contract personnel, responsible for train brake system maintenance.
