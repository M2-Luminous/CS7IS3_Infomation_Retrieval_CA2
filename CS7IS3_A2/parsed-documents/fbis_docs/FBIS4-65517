Kicking off the debate today was Gianfranco Miglio, speaking from the mixed group benches in his first address since breaking away from the Northern League recently. Miglio said he would be voting in favour of the new government, but went on to criticise the government programme presented yesterday by Premier Silvio Berlusconi, and the stance of the Northern League. Describing himself as "disappointed and amazed" by that part of the programme statement dealing with local autonomy, Miglio said that the government was aiming not at "federalism which guarantees liberty", but at "autonomy which covers centralism". Miglio, until yesterday the Northern League's ideologue, is in favour of dividing Italy up into three macro-regions in a federative state. The former Leaguer's defection from the governing Freedom Front alliance enhanced fears of a confidence debate defeat in an upper house where the ruling coalition controls only 155 votes, against the 164 needed. A no-confidence vote by Miglio would have brought this down still further, to 154.
