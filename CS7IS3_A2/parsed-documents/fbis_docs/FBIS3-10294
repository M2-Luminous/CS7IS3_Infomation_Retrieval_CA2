With these words, Defense Minister Rafael Montero Revette made it clear the country's pacification policy will not only guarantee the strengthening of the FAN [National Armed Forces], but national peace as well. During the interpellation or "invitation," Montero Revette reiterated that as long as military members are under arrest, problems in the FAN will continue, because the expectations of the public "will be voiced with greater intensity." He told deputies of the Defense Commission that the solution to the problem of the "coupist military" is a matter of time and that only the investigation of each and every case will permit deciding "whether or not they should remain in the Armed Forces." He recalled that the military institution "is an honorable institution, which does not have preferences for anyone, is apolitical, and adheres to the principles of discipline." In that sense, he said that those military members who were acquitted but were found to have been linked to the movement led by Commander Chavez should not be reintegrated to the FAN, because their statements are political." He said, however that "nobody has obliged the arrested military members to request discharge and it cannot be said either that the 270 military members who were reintegrated have been victims of internal pressure." He said all reintegrated officials are obliged to do their duty and that the High Command is aware that it must avoid "politics in the garrisons." Regarding the legal situation of Commander Chavez, he said that "he is an officer as any other waiting for the outcome of a decision. He has said he wants to leave last, and he is respected for that." "The FAN and the government do not fear a coup d'etat. What we are doing is studying each case, because each officer is a different case. What happens is that some persons believe since it was a military topic involving officers that we are speaking of a coup," Montero Revette explained. Asked if former Minister Radames Munoz Leon had tried to stage a military coup weeks before the December elections, Montero Revette said the FAN could not stage a military coup "because there is no man capable of communicating with all the officers and troops deployed throughout the national territory." As for rumors that Munoz Leon had traveled to the United States to conspire against democracy, Montero Revette said the former minister was granted a leave of absence with the president's authorization in response to an invitation by a U.S. university. "I can also guarantee that the cost of the former minister's trip was not financed. Rather, it was financed and paid by the Defense Ministry. I don't know if there was support from another party, but that is not my problem," he stated.
