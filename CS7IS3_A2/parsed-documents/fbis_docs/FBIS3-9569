Klaus said this before reporters in response to a RUDE PRAVO question on Wednesday. He added that the original promises that this matter "will be settled in October, December, February, and March are being constantly postponed." Klaus considers the transfer of the RFE from "a clearly government, state institution to another" an additional problem. Businessman Soros would "participate as a co-owner" in dealing with the latter problem. If this happened, the entire problem would move, according to the prime minister, to an entirely different level.
