The propaganda and ideological front must regard these as four key tasks to be fulfilled properly. The "one fundamental guiding principle and four key tasks" put forward here are the general layout and strategic ideology for doing a good job in propaganda and ideological work in the course of speeding up the establishment of the new socialist market economy structure. This guiding principle is the soul that sets the orientation for all work, and the four key tasks are the concrete manifestation and end-result of the fundamental guiding principle. With the fundamental guiding principle, the four key tasks have a general program; are linked with, coordinated with, and promoted by each other; and provide strength for propaganda and ideological work as whole. On the other hand, with the four key tasks, the implementation of the fundamental guiding principle is a prop and can form a spiritual support for solidifying and invigorating the aspirations of the party and people. All comrades of the party, and especially comrades on the propaganda and ideological front, must firmly grasp "one fundamental guiding principle," strive to fulfill properly the "four key tasks," live up to high expectations, set sails in the direction of the current, and raise propaganda and ideological work to a higher level. To fulfill the four key tasks properly, it is necessary, first of all, to grasp well the work of arming the people with scientific theory. Without arming the people with scientific theory, there can be no correct guidance for public opinion nor a clear orientation for ideological education and for developing the main theme. In this sense, "arming the people" runs through "guiding the people," "molding the people," and "encouraging the people." This year, we should proceed from study, research, and propaganda, and should deepen the work of arming the whole party with Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics in an even more extensive and firm manner. It is necessary to further seriously study the original works, familiarizing ourselves with them and mastering them through comprehensive study. It is necessary to further develop and deepen the study of this theory and to mobilize the theoretical workers in various branches of science and the practical workers in various departments in all localities to open up a new situation of extensive, lively, and vigorous study of the theory. It is necessary to use the people's experience and various methods to further publicize and popularize this theory in light of reality, and especially in light of the reality since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee and since Comrade Deng Xiaoping made his remarks in the south. As some propaganda cadres have put it, properly grasping the study of leading cadres at and above the county and regiment level is the "key project" in arming the people with theory, properly grasping the study of party members and cadres in urban and rural grass-roots units is the "basic project" in arming the people with theory, and properly grasping the study and education of young people is the "project of hope" in arming the people with theory. Only by properly grasping the "three major projects" can the task of "arming the people with scientific theory" truly be fulfilled. Fundamentally speaking, persisting in educating the cadres and people with Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is to help people clarify the significance of grasping the overall situation and to increase their ability to grasp the overall situation. Comrade Deng Xiaoping is especially good at grasping and controlling the overall situation, and he is our brilliant example in making clear the orientation, dispersing the fog, opening up a path for advancement, and fulfilling tasks with flying colors. His scientific works and all his theories have proceeded from the overall situation. The CPC Central Committee set out that the overall situation of the work of the whole party in 1994 is: Grasping opportunity, deepening reform, opening wider, promoting development, and maintaining stability [zhuazhu jiyu, shenhua gaige, kuoda kaifeng, cujin fazhan, baochi wending 2119 0145 2623 6657 3234 0553 2395 7245 2368 1129 7030 2397 0191 6651 4099 1455 0202 2170 4489 1353]. All work must be subordinated to this overall situation and must serve this overall situation. In our further study of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, in the new year, we also must focus our attention on clarifying and serving this overall situation. We must firmly grasp and treasure the present rare historical opportunity, unify our understanding, act in unison, achieve unity from top to bottom, make concerted efforts, and resolutely push forward reform, which we deliberated on for many years, wished to carry out, but for which we did not have the conditions to carry it out. "Reform is a move that determines China's destiny" and China's development is determined by reform. Lacking enthusiasm about deepening reform, and being enthusiastic only about the construction of more new projects and the expansion of existing ones cannot make the national economy develop in a sustained, rapid, and healthy manner [chixu, kuaisu, jiankang 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660]. Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is the great spiritual support of the whole party and nation, and is a brilliant banner guiding the new revolution of reform, opening up, and socialist modernization. In the new year, we must make greater accomplishments in arming the people with theory and in seeking unity of thinking. Under the guidance of this banner, we must persist in the emancipation of our minds, seeking truth from facts, promoting and deepening reform, opening wider, and making great efforts to maintain stability so that we can have a clearer orientation and more lively thinking in all aspects of propaganda and ideological work, and can open up a new situation in this respect.
