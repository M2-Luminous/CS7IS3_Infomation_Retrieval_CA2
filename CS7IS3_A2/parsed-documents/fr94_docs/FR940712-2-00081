FR940712-2-00081 FR940712-2-00059 [Release No. 43&hyph; 34306; File No. SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;94&hyph;05] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change and Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Amendment No. 1 to Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. Relating to the Listing and Trading of Options and Regular and Reduced-Value Long-Term Options on the CBOE Real Estate Investment Trust Index July 5, 1994. I. Introduction On March 8, 1994, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 a proposed rule change to provide for the listing and trading of options and long-term options (``LEAPS'') 3 on the CBOE's Real Estate Investment Trust (``REIT'') Index (``REIT Index'' or ``Index''), and LEAPS on a reduced-value REIT Index. On June 14, 1994, the CBOE filed Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change. 4 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1993). 3 ``LEAPS'' is an acronym for Long-Term Equity Anticipation Securities. LEAPS are long-term index option series that expire from 12 to 36 months from their date of issuance. See CBOE Rule 24.9(b)(1). 4 In Amendment No. 1, the CBOE: (1) advised that surveillance procedures currently used to monitor trading in each of the Exchange's other index options also will be used to monitor trading in regular Index options and in full-value and reduced-value LEAPS on the Index; and (2) advised that the REIT Index will be calculated and disseminated to the Options Price Reporting Authority (``OPRA'') every 15 seconds by the CBOE, based on the last-sale prices of the component stocks, and that OPRA in turn will disseminate the Index value to other financial vendors such as Reuters, Telerate, and Quotron. See Letter from Scott Lyden, Senior Research Analyst, CBOE, to Thomas McManus, Division of Market Regulation Commission, dated June 13, 1994. Notice of the Exchange's proposed rule change appeared in the Federal Register on April 19, 1994. 5 No comment letters were received on the proposal. This order approves the proposal and Amendment No. 1 thereto. 5 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33872 (April 7, 1994), 59 FR 17804 (April 14, 1994). II. Description of the Proposal A. General The CBOE proposes to list and trade options on the REIT Index, a new securities index developed by the CBOE and based on REITs that are traded on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'') and American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex''). The CBOE also proposes to list LEAPS on the full-value Index and LEAPS on a reduced-value Index that will be computed at one-tenth of the value of the REIT Index. REIT Index LEAPS will trade independent of and in addition to regular REIT Index options traded on the Exchange; 6 however, as discussed below, position and exercise limits of Index LEAPS and regular Index options will be aggregated. 6 According to the CBOE, the REIT Index represents a segment of the U.S. equity market that is not currently represented in the derivative markets and, as such, the CBOE concludes, should offer investors a low-cost means of achieving diversification or to tilt their portfolios toward, or away from, real estate investments. The CBOE believes that the Index will provide retail and institutional investors with a means of benefitting from their forecasts about the financial performance of REITS and their underlying real estate assets. Options on the Index also may be utilized by portfolio managers and investors to provide a performance measure and evaluation guide for passively and actively managed REITS, as well as a means of hedging the risks of investing in real estate generally, the REIT stocks in particular.
