She fined the man, Eric Moo Young, 30, nicknamed "Mr. Big," of 13 Merrivale Close, Kingston 8, the maximum of $115,000 and sentenced him to a year's imprisonment but suspended the sentence for 18 months. The prosecution's case, as outlined by Mr. Martin Gayle, Crown Counsel, was that on Sunday, October 31, a raiding party from the Special Anti-Crime Task Force, led by Detective Inspector Granville Gause, went to 25 Bronx Avenue, Barbican, Kingston 8, where they saw Michelle Cassanova, 31, saleswoman, and found 19 large cartons with 2,068 lbs (938.25 kilos) of compressed ready-for-export ganja. Cassanova was charged with possession of the ganja, dealing in ganja and taking steps preparatory to exporting the weed. Further investigations by Det. Insp. Gause led, the same day, to the arrest of Moo Young, who said the ganja was his and he had given it to Cassanova to store for him. He was charged jointly with her and they were ordered remanded in custody. Ten days later, they appeared before the St. Andrew Resident Magistrate's Court at Half-Way-Tree before Her Hon. Mrs. Lewis and Cassanova pleaded guilty to possession of the ganja. Mrs. Lewis fined her $15,000 or six months' imprisonment. The Magistrate said the ganja business was too prevalent, with the rich and poor alike being involved. It was time for a Drug Court to be established, she said, to deal exclusively with offences of that nature. Also, the Magistrate said fines for drug offences were too minimal and anybody could pay them. Moo Young pleaded guilty to all three charges and was remanded in custody on December 17, for sentencing on December 22. Mr. Howard Hamilton, Q.C., who with Miss Norma Linton, attorney-at-law, represented Moo Young, urged the court to show mercy to him because he had not tried to absolve himself, but had admitted it was his ganja, had not wasted the court's time, and had faced harsh reality and pleaded guilty. Miss Linton said Moo Young had been man enough to own up and pointed out that it was his first offence. She asked the Magistrate not to incarcerate him. The Resident Magistrate imposed on Moo Young, maximum sentences of a fine of $15,000 or six months for possession of the ganja, $50,000 or 12 months for dealing in ganja, and $50,000 or 12 months for taking steps preparatory to exporting the ganja. In addition, on the charge of taking steps preparatory to exporting the ganja, she sentenced Moo Young to 12 months' imprisonment but suspended the sentence for 18 months and ordered that he undergo supervision by a probation officer.
