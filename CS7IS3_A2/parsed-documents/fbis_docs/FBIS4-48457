The minister was accompanied by the deputy minister of arts, culture, science and technology, Mrs. Winnie Mandela. Dr. Ngubane invited all agencies in the field of science and technology to provide him with their views on how their work may best be directed at urgent socio-economic challenges. He added that appropriate research and development (R & D) will have to become one of our weapons in the fight against poverty and inequality. Dr. Ngubane gave a few pointers on how he saw issues of policy: South Africa as a developing society, should ideally spend more than the current roughly one per cent of GDP on research and development The state should shoulder a substantial part of this expenditure, but also encourage the private sector to become increasingly involved. South Africa's base of scientists will have to be broadened, especially at the historically black universities and technikons Affirmative action in the research field should not take the form of symbolic appointments. It must be based on empowerment through training and human resource development. Dr. Ngubane acknowledged that there are no easy answers. Therefore he could be expected to move cautiously after having studied each issue in all its ramifications.
