The statement said the appointment of Ukraine's presidential representative is regarded as an attempt to sow seeds of discord in Crimea. The press service called on all enterprise and organization managers to obey the decisions of the president, Supreme Council, and government of Crimea "without entering into contact with the illegally appointed Ukraine's presidential representative in Crimea." The citizens of Crimea are invited to express their attitude to this power institution. In Yuriy Meshkov's opinion, Ukraine's moves are aimed at preventing him from pursuing economic reforms and fully restoring the Crimean Constitution. A rally was held on the same day in support of Crimean President Meshkov, and in the evening tents were set up by the building of the Crimean Supreme Council at the initiative of Russian Society leader Anatoliy Los and Oleksandr Kanafyev. Crimea's political leaders said they were ready to take up arms to defend Yuriy Meshkov and Crimea's state independence and called on the people of Simferopol to bring warm clothes and join the vigil at the tents. Some of the speakers said two planes were due to arrive in Simferopol from Kiev carrying the special task force, and no one knew what would happen; therefore it was necessary to keep calm and resist the Ukrainian leadership's provocations. The night by the building of the Crimean Supreme Council went by uneventfully. Organizers did not say when the tents would be taken down but promised they would be there as long as necessary.
