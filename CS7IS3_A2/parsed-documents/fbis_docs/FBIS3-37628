Nazarbayev did not conceal his doubts as to the "sincerity of Russia's kind feelings" for its CIS partners. The claims by some Moscow officials that Russia has special interests in these states and their bid to set up military bases there, the Kazakhstani leader stressed, do not inspire trust. He therefore proposed first looking into Moscow's real intentions in such countries as Georgia, Tajikistan, or Azerbaijan. In President Nazarbayev's opinion, after the breakup of the USSR everything on Kazakhstan's territory is its property, so Russia has no say in the use of the scientific laboratories at the Semipalatinsk test range or the space installations. In Washington, Nazarbayev kept himself emphatically independent of Moscow's policy, surprising even Bill Clinton. The U.S. President made an unsuccessful attempt to win his interlocutor over to the plan to pump Kazakhstani oil not through Iran and Turkey but via the Black Sea port of Novorossiysk. Another $85 million in backing was promised for this project. However, the guest stuck to his guns. Fearing domestic instability in Russia, he said that he prefers to have more reliable outlets to warm seas -- the Persian Gulf or the Mediterranean. This involves a major contract with the U.S. Chevron company equivalent, according to Nazarbayev, to the "Alaskan field," and also a newly-created Caspian Shelf consortium to explore for and extract oil and gas, which includes the U.S. firm Mobil Oil. The Russian Foreign Ministry has already sent a protest note regarding the illegality of the decision to start drilling work on the Caspian seabed, since the other littoral countries had not given their assent. However, there is every indication that Almaty ignored this, and in New York Nazarbayev once again confirmed that the highly promising project will be implemented. En route home Nursultan Nazarbayev made a stopover in Paris, where he briefed Francois Mitterrand on the results of his successful visit to Washington. There are no plans for a stopover in Moscow.
