FR940727-0-00014 FR940727-0-00005 7 CFR Part 967 [Docket No. FV&hyph;94&hyph;967&hyph;2IFR] Handling Regulation for Celery Grown in Florida AGENCY: Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. ACTION: Interim final rule with request for comments. SUMMARY: This action establishes the quantity of Florida celery which handlers may ship to fresh markets during the 1994&hyph;95 marketing season at 6,712,910 crates or 100 percent of producers' base quantities. The 1994&hyph;95 marketing season covers the period August 1, 1994, through July 31, 1995. This interim final rule is intended to lend stability to the industry, and, thus, help provide consumers with an adequate supply of the product. As in past marketing seasons, the limitation on the quantity of Florida celery handled for fresh shipment is not expected to restrict the quantity of Florida celery actually produced or shipped to fresh markets, because production and shipments are anticipated to be less than the marketable quantity. This action was unanimously recommended by the Florida Celery Committee (Committee), the agency responsible for local administration of the order. DATES: Effective July 27, 1994. Comments which are received by August 26, 1994 will be considered prior to issuance of any final rule. ADDRESSES: Interested persons are invited to submit written comments concerning this interim final rule. Comments must be sent in triplicate to the Docket Clerk, Marketing Order Administration Branch, F&V, AMS, USDA, room 2523&hyph;S, P.O.
