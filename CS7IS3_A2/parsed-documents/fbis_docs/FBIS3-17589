The Author of the Scandalous Document Thinks That Political Hysterics at the Top Might Have Been Provoked by Anyone but Him"] [Text] Yesterday OBSHCHAYA GAZETA named the author of the ill-famed "Version No. 1." It turned out to be Gleb Pavlovskiy, a well-known journalist. Today, NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA publishes the full text of his article that the author appears to have offered to his colleagues from OBSHCHAYA GAZETA. Mr. Pavlovskiy brought it to the NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA editorial board on the evening of 24 March. All last week I listened to the news with half an ear, did not follow the press, and did not realize that the buzz of familiar words about a "coup" had any bearing on a rough copy marked "Version No. 1" that flew away from me. This is why the latest issue of the ARGUMENTY I FAKTY weekly, with an interview by Yuriy Baturin, presidential national security adviser, under the icy heading/notification "A Search for an Anonymous Person Is Under Way" first elicited astonishment, then made me laugh, and finally worried me. Who is it that they are searching for? I state with absolute clarity that "Version No. 1" is a working text of which I am the sole owner as the person who ordered it, a routine working fact-sheet, a compilation of open data -- reports of news agencies, primarily TASS, POSTFACTUM, and RIA, and also press, radio reports, and so forth, of course, including city rumors. The text is least of all a proclamation by a hidden troublemaker. It is technical in nature, that is to say, it cannot have any author in principle. It is an analytical semi-finished information product prepared by various people using a production-line method, not meant for publication at all, a fact that can be deduced at least from the inscription "Confidential" in the left-hand corner. Who of them is the "anonymous person?" The man who reads the current press with a pencil, tracking the crossings of names and dates? The man who phoned information sources to find out whether so and so really met with N. at 1700? A school girl who puts the texts produced in the data base? Or I -- a customer who puts the following question to that same data base: "What would a coherent coup hypothesis look like if rumors about one (with which Moscow is abuzz) are added to mass media reports?" I did not order only one theory -- there are further numbers, too. Having ordered a string of data on key words "Yeltsin, B.N./Conspiracy against/Removal/Duma/March/Contacts of officials... (followed by names)/Pro Theory," I obtained a summary of data confirming this suggestion. If I had ordered a summary of counterarguments -- a contra theory -- I would have received precisely that. Both require 15 minutes of work by the data base operator, a number of clarifying phone calls from the editorial board, and another half an hour (maximum!) to compile all that into a coherent text. But an editorial board is a communicating courtyard, and editors' tables are not a place where anything should be left. I do not know why someone took "Version No. 1" pages from my table and why he or she did not take, say, "Version No. 3?" But if someone is going to tell me that unconfirmed theories should not be written on paper, I would laugh in his face -- how else can they be checked, I wonder? What is important is not who wrote what, but who distributed something that was not written for him, where, and for what purpose. Strangely enough, this frivolous question has not been raised, but everyone is going out of one's way to peer over each other's shoulder. As far as I understand it, the government is going to find me and the data base operator to try us for libel on... what? On an authorized list of key words? What seems to me as another interesting idea is the limitation of the right to consider theories (let me remind you that none of those involved in the production of this paper ever intended to publish it. And even if he did? An intention cannot be punished by law). For the information of Mr. National Security Adviser, there are dozens and dozens of places in the country -- apart from coup plotters, madmen, spies, and financiers -- where people are checking every single day yet again whether a military coup is being prepared. Whether the president is in good health. With whom the defense minister is meeting and what the hell the troops are doing in the capital, and so on and so forth. This is not column writing, this is the mulling over of theories, this is what analysts and journalists are paid for, a work that sometimes results in an article, sometimes in a memo that will be thrown into a wastepaper basket upon being read. A version is advanced, checked, rejected -- and forgotten. A new one emerges. The fact that citizens advance and discuss theories is beyond the security services' competence. Those who do not want to learn something unpleasant about themselves should not rummage through other people's papers. Under President Dwight Eisenhower, the U.S. Congress officially banned analysts from considering military conflict scenarios that envisioned the United States' capitulation. The ban, booed by the analytic community, had an important reservation, however: "in research financed from the government budget." He who pays the piper calls the tune! No, our money is not from the budget, so we can look into what we think fit. The 1991 Belovezhskaya Forest coup, unfortunately, was not preceded by the advancing and consideration of theories envisioning such a possibility: The first and the last theory was advanced unopposed to be immediately implemented. The editorial paper stolen from me (I did not consider it secret at all) was indeed distributed with lightning speed, as it was repackaged into a semiofficial one. Naturally, I did not give this memo to OBSHCHAYA GAZETA -- what for? Even though the newspaper has the right to publish a document that has been put in circulation by someone and has turned out to be the centerpiece of a provocative game. The immediate dispatch of a trivial text to dozens of addresses accompanied by giving it an air of instruction and raising a bureaucratic tide that met it exposes, in my view, the work of the Kremlin and the ears of mass organizers specializing in "Da-Da-Net-Da" ["Yes-Yes-No-Yes" -- reference to April 1993 referendum presidential slogan]. At any rate, it is the bureaucrats who commented on the rough copy as "a conspiracy," "an action of dark forces," and even "arson" whom I consider to be the actual publishers and instigators of the document in a shape that was arbitrarily imposed on it! The mass media have done in this situation what they are supposed to be doing -- they have done their best to exploit the sensation that has suddenly come their way. They cannot and should not do anything else. As for the fact that we were used once again -- well, eternal fools are to be taught till the end of time. The "anonymous person" is the one who distributed the paper in government corridors and has been maintaining -- or affecting -- political hysteria at the top. I would recommend that government investigators look for an "anonymous person" in their own offices. That is my theory. Finally, I offer my apologies to those people to whom this incident has brought trouble, including official trouble. Still, it is not I who is the source of the trouble, but their official colleagues who were stupid enough or thought it advantageous to present a private memo as a document "concerning all." But by issuing "Version No. 1400," B.N. Yeltsin has caused the country much greater trepidations. How about an investigation?
