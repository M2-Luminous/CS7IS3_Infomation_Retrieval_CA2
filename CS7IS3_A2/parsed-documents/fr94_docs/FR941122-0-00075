FR941122-0-00075 FR941122-0-00013 The central Idaho reintroduction plan requires transferring 45 to 75 wolves from southwestern Canada, representing various sex and age classes, over a 3- to 5-year period. Under the plan, about 15 wild wolves from several different packs using standard capture techniques will be captured annually over a period of 3 to 5 years. Captured wolves will be transported to central Idaho. The wolves will receive any necessary veterinary care, including examinations and vaccinations. They will be fitted with radio collars so that they can be monitored by radiotelemetry. The wolves will be immediately released into the wild. This method is known as ``quick release,'' (i.e., the wolves will be released upon or shortly after transport and arrival at the release site). ``Quick release'' wolves will not be held for acclimation nor will food or care be provided after release. It is anticipated that released wolves will move widely but eventually will find mates and form packs. In general, attempts to locate and/or move lone wolves dispersing throughout central Idaho will not be done. However, wolves may be moved on a case-by-case basis, if necessary to enhance wolf recovery in the experimental area. Reintroduced wolves will remain in the wild, as long as they are capable of sustaining themselves on carrion or wild prey. Conflicts between wolves and humans may result in the recapture and/or removal of a wolf in accordance with procedures successfully used with other problem wolves. An overall assessment of the success of the reintroduction will be made after the first year and for every year thereafter. Procedures for subsequent releases could be modified, if information from the previous reintroduction warrants such changes. The physical reintroduction phase should be completed within 3&hyph;5 years. Once the reintroduced wolves form two packs with each pack raising two pups, for 2 consecutive years, management practices would allow the wolves to grow naturally toward recovery levels. Wolves would only be monitored, and no further reintroduction would take place unless fewer than two litters were produced in a single year. This reintroduction effort is consistent with the recovery goals identified in the 1987 recovery plan for the northern Rocky Mountain Wolf. It is estimated that the central Idaho reintroduction effort, together with a similar effort in the Park and the natural recovery occurring in northwestern Montana, could result in a viable recovered wolf population (10 breeding pairs in each of 3 recovery areas for 3 consecutive years) by the year 2002. The Service will continue to ask private landowners and agency personnel in or around central Idaho to immediately report any wolf observations to the Service or other authorized agencies. An extensive information and education program will discourage the taking of gray wolves by the public. Initially, all wolves will be monitored by radio telemetry and, therefore, easy to locate if necessary. Public cooperation with the Service will be encouraged to ensure close monitoring of the wolves and quick resolution of any conflicts that might arise.
