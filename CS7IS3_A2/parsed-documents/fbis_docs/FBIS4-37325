He said that during his meeting with Egyptian officials he felt that they were anxious for a cease-fire in Yemen to safeguard the country's future. He remarked that the war has created new, undeniable facts influencing Yemeni unity and tragic conditions that do not serve the country's interests. The south Yemeni official added: Nevertheless, we are still taking the Yemeni people's united interests into account. We are advocating a different form of unity and will leave its discussion to the negotiators. Yahya continued: At any rate, we are seeking to prevent further destruction in Yemen. He affirmed that the problems that will surface after the war ends will be bigger than the war itself. Noting the adverse effects that the war has had on the south Yemenis' normally calm disposition, he said it is necessary to restore that disposition.
