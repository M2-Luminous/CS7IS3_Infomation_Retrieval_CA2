The government will not send election monitors under the UN umbrella because local circumstances portend danger such as terrorist attacks, the sources said. Instead, the government will dispatch a dozen or so people to monitor the multiracial polls set for April at the request of the South African Government, they said. The decision will be made by the end of this month, they said. In January, the UN General Assembly unanimously endorsed a resolution calling for the sending of an 1,800-member mission to South Africa to monitor the elections. The United Nations has asked if it could join the mission, Foreign Ministry sources said. Prior to the UN decision, Japan's parliamentary Vice Foreign Minister Syozo Azuma traveled to the country in early January and proposed to Pretoria that Japan dispatch election monitors to the region. Foreign Minister Pik Botha pledged to Azuma that the South African Government will guarantee the security of Japanese election monitors during the election period, officials said.
