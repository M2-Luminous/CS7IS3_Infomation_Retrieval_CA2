The war has destroyed achievements and costly projects set up by the fraternal Yemeni people with their efforts and sacrifices. Therefore, a decision to stop the war, return to legitimacy, and to protect the unity of the Yemeni homeland and people is the solution for this dangerous crisis, which, if it continues, will be very costly to both sides. There are reports of Arab mediation, including Saudi efforts, after the failure of the Arab league's mediation. We hope that any and all mediation efforts will target the preservation of unity for the Yemeni homeland and people, the curbing of secessionist tendencies, and the return of legitimacy. Otherwise, mediation will be a sort of outside interference that encourages the southern leaders to secede, and this conflicts with the aspirations and hopes of the Yemeni people and the whole Arab nation. The continuation of the civil war will not realize a victory for any party, and the victim will be the Yemeni people and their infrastructure. The failure of Yemeni unity will undermine the unionist spirit within the Arab nation and drive it to frustration and despair about the possibility of forging unity between any two Arab states. We urge the Yemeni leadership in the north and the south to expedite an end to this war, to return to legitimacy, and to adhere to the unity for which the Yemeni people have offered great sacrifices.
