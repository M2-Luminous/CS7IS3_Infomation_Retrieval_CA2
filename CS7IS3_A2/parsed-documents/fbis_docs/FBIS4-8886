He is not isolated in his opinion as far as Western diplomats are concerned. So what chances do we have? [Dziemidowicz] Poland's admission into the European Union [EU] will not take place tomorrow or even the day after. Our full integration is a question of at least 10 years. First the Union must "digest" our offer, as it were. This could take two or three years. Only then would the real negotiation begin, in respect of the terms of our accession and its precise date. It could be that the option they adopt will be that of granting Poland membership of the Union's political structures first and economic structures later. However, all that will be the subject of the eventual negotiation process. [Janowska] Precisely. Western politicians claim that Poland will find it easier to join the Western European Union, which is the political suprastructure for the Communities rather than their economic structures. [Dziemidowicz] It is hard to tell now whether that is really what will happen. [Janowska] Politicians of the European Twelve stress very strongly Poland's economic backwardness in relation to the Union's member states. [Dziemidowicz] I believe that backwardness is too strong a term here. [Janowska] But it is true that such disproportion exists. [Dziemidowicz] Indeed, in respect of such countries as France, Germany, and Britain. On the other hand, we can compare Poland with Greece or Portugal at the time when those two were applying for membership in the EEC. The disproportion between the condition of their economies then and that of our economy now is not as drastic as that. During their years in the EEC, those countries made enormous progress. I believe that in our case, too, these economic disparities will disappear very quickly. In the end, it will be the political will of the European Twelve that will decide our membership. [Janowska] But can we really compare ourselves with Greece or Portugal at a time when our national per capita income in Poland does not exceed $2,000 a year? [Dziemidowicz] We are not only looking at present-day comparisons here. During the past few years, very rapid economic progress, especially involving privatization, occurred in Poland. Changes are now taking place much more quickly than any of the past prognoses could have predicted. [Janowska] In an interview he gave to RZECZPOSPOLITA, Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus criticized the proposal for Poland and Hungary to join the Union. He stated that the Czech Republic would not be submitting its application to join the Union but that it would nevertheless find itself among the European Twelve earlier than we. What is the Polish Foreign Ministry's reaction to this? [Dziemidowicz] I would not say that Prime Minister Klaus criticized us. The Czech Republic is simply choosing a different way. Apart from that, Poland and Hungary are already associated with the EU, while the Czech Republic still is not. This situation changes the perspective slightly. Each country chooses its own preferred and most convenient way to the Union. It is neither the Olympic Games nor a race. The objective of all four countries in the Visegrad Group is to join the EU eventually, and we should wish each other the speediest fulfillment of that objective.
