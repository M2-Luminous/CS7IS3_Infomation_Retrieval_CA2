W. de Klerk said on Wednesday [2 March]. He also revealed that he had had discussions on Tuesday night with Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front -- AVF] leader General Constand Viljoen. Answering a question during state president's question time from Mr Dave Dalling (ANC [African National Congress]-Sandton), he said the government called on other parties to negotiate in good faith and with a will to reach solutions. Although he was very pleased that Tuesday's talks between ANC president Mr Nelson Mandela and Inkatha Freedom Party leader Dr Mangosuthu Buthelezi had taken place, it should be remembered they would not have been possible without hours of discussions between he and other senior government members like Home Affairs Minister Mr Danie Schutte, and Dr Buthelezi. It had therefore been possible to put specific proposals before Tuesday's meeting. On his talks on Tuesday night with Gen Viljoen, Mr de Klerk said: "We don't make a public display like the ANC (of such talks). With us results count." President de Klerk said April 27 remained the election date -- "I am a leader of a party which keeps its word." On proposed international mediation to address the constitutional impasse with the Freedom Alliance [FA], he said time was of the essence, and this could provide problems regarding such mediation. He would, however, examine any proposal. "My government's attitude is that negotiation doesn't end today." Multi-party accords could be reached in the next 10 days, two weeks, or whatever, on outstanding issues. Mr de Klerk said he found the concept of provisional registration of parties "interesting". Other FA parties should also look at it.
