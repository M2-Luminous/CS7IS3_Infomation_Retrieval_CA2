How do you feel as a German defense industry manager? [Piller] I feel better than a year ago, when I was elected president of the Federal Association of German Aerospace and Defense Industries. I feel better, because public opinion has increasingly come to believe that the serious problems that people face, such as security, information, communications, mobility, and, last, but not least, environmental protection cannot be solved without the skills of the aerospace and defense industries. I would feel even better if Bonn believed that an economy that has maintained one of the highest standards of living in the world does not want want to disregard an area of such valuable net output. [FOCUS] So, what are the greatest problems that the defense industry faces? [Piller] We see ourselves increasingly confronted with reductions in the Bundeswehr procurement budget for which provision cannot be made. The quota for investment has fallen from 30 percent to 20 percent. Now we have got 15 percent, if I leave aside socks, underwear, and boots, which have nothing to do with high-tech products. There is no industry in the world that can survive that without being damaged. [FOCUS] You have called for a relaxation of the rules governing German weapons exports. Do you consider that to be a general panacea that will save the German aerospace and defense industries? [Piller] No, not at all. We do not advocate the unrestricted export of defense goods to all corners of the world. We are not concerned about a relaxation, but more about cross-border opportunities for cooperation on the part of the aerospace industry through the introduction of uniform regulations for all the countries in Europe. The aerospace industry is dependent on international cooperation for its survival. That is why there must now be some uniformity in the rules governing exports of weapons. [FOCUS] Would you place the entire blame for the collapse of the German defense industry on Bonn? [Piller] No. At the moment, our markets have declined for various reasons. The end of the East-West confrontation has had a significant impact on defense technology. However, a significant part of the negative consequences of this development in the industry are attributable to the fact that the necessary political decisions -- for example, those regarding the way in which the Bundeswehr has been equipped -- were made too slowly or not at all. [FOCUS] Do you lack certainty with regard to planning? [Piller] Absolutely. Aerospace projects must involve long-term planning. For that, one needs guidelines for the future stemming from a security policy that has been clearly defined. Germany has still not sufficiently defined its role in Europe and the rest of the world clearly enough.
