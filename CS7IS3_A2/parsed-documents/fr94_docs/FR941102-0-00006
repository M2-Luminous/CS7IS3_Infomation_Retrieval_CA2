FR941102-0-00006 FR941102-0-00004 DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Office of the Comptroller of the Currency 12 CFR Parts 5 and 16 [Docket No. 94&hyph;17] RIN 1557&hyph;AA65 Securities Offering Disclosure Rules AGENCY: Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Treasury. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is amending its regulations governing the disclosure requirements for offers and sales of national bank securities. This final rule replaces regulations detailing the contents of offering documents covering national bank securities and requires that offering documents conform to the information requirements set forth in the appropriate Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) registration form. The final rule also cross-references certain provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and SEC rules. The purpose of the final rule is to reduce unnecessary regulatory burdens on national banks and enhance their ability to raise capital, while maintaining the quality of disclosures provided to investors. The final rule generally treats national bank securities comparably to those of other corporations and eliminates a duplicative and potentially confusing system of regulations and forms. EFFECTIVE DATE: April 3, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Elizabeth Malone, Senior Attorney, Securities, Investments, and Fiduciary Practices Division, (202) 874&hyph;5210, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, 250 E Street SW., Washington, DC 20219. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The OCC's securities offering regulations protect the purchasers of national bank securities by ensuring that investors receive full disclosure of all material facts when purchasing such securities, and also protect the integrity of national bank capital. The OCC determined, however, that revisions to these regulations were needed to reduce unnecessary burdens that the requirements imposed on national banks.
