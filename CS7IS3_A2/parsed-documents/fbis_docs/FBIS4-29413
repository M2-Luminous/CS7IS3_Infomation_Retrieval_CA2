Scientists widely believe that cultural evolution brought about material comfort and prosperity while also posing dangers to human existence, Han said in a speech at the international media conference on the environment and development. "As we try to connect this view of natural science to that of social science, we will find that they match perfectly at this juncture, a juncture where the world is struggling to cope with the end of the Cold War and the conclusion of the Uruguay Round," said Han. "The former has pushed forward the nuclear question, whereas the latter has catapulted the environmental question to the center stage," the foreign minister said. "...The dual questions, nuclear weapons and the environment, have become critical issues for the world and especially for Korea, which also is arguably the most densely populated country in the world," said Han. The foreign minister emphasized the need for regional cooperation in Northeast Asia, which is "characterized by a high population concentration and dynamic economic activity."
