The failure to pay this money is creating problems for the Moscow Government in paying wages to workers in budget-funded organizations and financing subway construction. A few days ago Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov noted that Moscow is honoring its commitments to the federal budget impeccably, adding that it would be more correct if the city were allowed to retain part of the taxes for itself "instead of transferring them to the federal budget and then waiting for money to come back." Luzhkov asked the tax services to examine this option for collaborating with the federal authorities in the budget sphere.
