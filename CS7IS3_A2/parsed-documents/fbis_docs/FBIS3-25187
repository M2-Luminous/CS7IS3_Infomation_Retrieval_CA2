The meeting seems to have found the need to quickly and definitely resolve the dispute existing between the government and the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] regarding the Salamanga area in southern Mozambique. The CSC decided that the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo], which occupied Salamanga after signing the General Peace Accord, should withdraw 30 km away from the area. Renamo has not yet withdrawn from the area. What is more, Renamo men and war materiel have begun arriving in the area, apparently to use it as an assembly area. In a statement to the press at the end of yesterday's meeting, Minister Armando Guebuza, head of the government delegation to the CSC, gave the impression that the government is losing its patience. The dispute still continues, and Renamo seems to be usingng out one delaying tactic after another in order not to withdraw from the area. [Begin Guebuza recording] The CSC decided that Renamo should withdraw 10 to 30 km away from Salamanga. Renamo appealed, but the CSC upheld its decision. It appealed again, and we continue to have meeting after meeting to examine an issue that has already been decided upon by the bodies established by the government and Renamo. The decision was made in the presence of the government and Renamo. The government and Renamo have the power to vote against a CSC decision, but Renamo did not do so. Now it is questioning the decision. [passage omitted] [end recording] Asked to comment on the issue, Renamo's Jose de Castro tried to minimize the problem. [Begin de Castro recording] Well, I think this issue has already been well explained [words indistinct] we withdrew first to avoid dispute. In view of logistical conditions in the area, Renamo wrote to the CSC, requesting to confine its forces there. This is well known. However, the government does not want us to be where we are. They want us 10 km away. We see the government coming up with a problem that does not exist. Assembly areas are provisional areas. After a while, some soldiers will join the future army and others will be demobilized. Accordingly, I do not see any reason for the government to object. [end recording] Meanwhile, Aldo Ajello, representative of the UN secretary general in Mozambique, promised to take an initiative on 12 February to once and for all resolve the problem. Yesterday's CSC meeting examined many other issues, including the confinement of government and Renamo forces, the training of the new Mozambique Defense Armed Forces, the demobilization of troops from both sides, and the need to begin to transport to regional depots all weapons handed at assembly areas.
