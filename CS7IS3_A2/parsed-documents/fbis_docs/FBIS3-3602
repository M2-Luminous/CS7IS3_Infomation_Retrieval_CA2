Statistics from the autonomous regional government show that this upper one-fourth of the total number of herdsmen in the region are living more comfortably than in the past. Most of the herdsmen who have become well off have cultivated their own pastures and grasslands with good irrigation facilities, silages and permanent livestock shelters. These facilities have made them better able to resist natural disasters. Statistics show that the number of new and hybrid livestock totalled 27.58 million, or 54.65 percent, of all livestock in the region. The improvement of new species of domestic animals has highly raised the returns of animal husbandry. In the past, large animals were few and most livestock consisted of small animals of lower species, local officials said. In addition, they said that the introduction of a contract system greatly improved herdsmen's enthusiasm in grooming fields and grassland. Science and technology service stations were also established in almost every township (sumu) to provide training in new techniques to local herdsmen. As a result, the total number of livestock reached 55.78 million head last year, up 197,800 over the previous year. The general output value of animal husbandry topped 6.48 billion yuan, an increase of 41,900 yuan over 1992. Officials said the net income of all the herdsmen in the autonomous region increased by an average of over 100 yuan last year.
