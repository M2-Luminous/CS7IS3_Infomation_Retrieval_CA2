Three communiques signed by Subcommander Marcos announced to the media that in the consultation process with the communities, 97.33 percent voted against signing the government proposal, while 96.47 percent favored not resuming hostilities. For this reason, the rebels' General Command reported that the EZLN has officially declared the San Cristobal negotiations closed, and it has called on the people to enter a new dialogue "with all of the progressive forces in the country." Nevertheless, with the purpose of not interfering with the upcoming August elections, the guerrillas have ordered their regular and irregular forces to unilaterally extend the cease-fire. The rebels also ruled out any EZLN actions against the Federal Government. In addition, the rebels will permit the installation of voting sites in the territory under their control. These voting sites will be supervised by nongovernmental organizations and the International Red Cross. The EZLN has warned that it "absolutely will not accept any federal, state, or municipal aid and will resist the situation with its own means and with the assistance of the Mexican people." It also warned, "We will continue to fight as long as the national flag does not fly in democracy, freedom, and justice over Mexican territory." The rebels also proposed holding "a national democratic convention" to create a provisional or transitional government.
