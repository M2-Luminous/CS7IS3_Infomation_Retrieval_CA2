The Control and Audit Administration under the Central Electoral Commission will conduct a complete audit of the reports in the first half of January. On their part, the blocs practically completed the compilation and analysis of expenditures. The second installment of money provided by the Central Electoral Commission to electoral coalitions (R50 million) reached the addressees only on 6 December; therefore, many simply did not have enough time to put it to use. In keeping with Yeltsin's edict, the remainder of the money will be transferred to the Central Electoral Commission's operational account. Of the blocs that made it to the parliament, the least amount of money was spent on the election campaign by Women of Russia--R67 million. This coalition had not received money from any source other than the Central Electoral Commission, and the money from the latter was mainly used for advertising in the mass media. The Communist Party of Russia, in addition to the money allocated by the state, also spent about R2 million from party dues. As Gennadiy Zyuganov told a KOMMERSANT correspondent, the propaganda work was conducted by communists on a "person to person" basis and therefore turned out very cheap and highly effective. The Democratic Party of Russia spent approximately R400-R500 million. In the opinion of Yevgeniy Malkin, the chief of the Democratic party's election headquarters, this money had been used to a maximum effect: The party's rating increased proportionally to increases in expenditures for expansion of political advertising and pre-election propaganda. According to Russia's Choice finance officers, the bloc has spent almost R2 billion. The Liberal Democratic Party did not submit information on its election campaign expenditures. However, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy said earlier that they had spent about R1 billion on propaganda. The Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin bloc spent R380 million. As Igor Yakovenko, a State Duma deputy and a cochairman of the Republican Party of Russia, told a KOMMERSANT correspondent, the money probably could have been used more effectively had it not been for the bloc's organizational weakness: It had been set up close to elections and its participants did not have enough time to "get used to each other," and therefore the potential of each was only utilized to a small extent. The Agrarian Party of Russia did not go for outside financing sources, and only managed to spend one-half of the R100 million allocated by the Central Electoral Commission. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Return on Investment in Election Campaign Among Blocs Elected to the State D-| |uma | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Bloc or party |Money expended per 1 percent of votes | | |(in R million) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |LDPR |43.10 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Russia's Choice |127.06 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Communist Party of the Russian Federa-|8.58 | |tion | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Women of Russia |8.18 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Agrarian Party of Russia |11.38 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin bloc |48.97 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Party of Russian Unity and Accord |117.00 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Democratic Party of Russia |80.94 | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
