Japan resumed yen loan programs to Iran starting in May 1993. The UK has made the request for reasons such as Iran's support for terrorist activities conducted by radical groups that advocate Islamic Fundamentalism. The UK is the second nation, following the United States, to ask Japan to stop extending yen loans to Iran. The Japanese Government has judged that it has become increasingly likely that the Iranian issue will be a key topic at the July Naples summit. It has therefore made firm its plan to stop extending yen loans to Iran for this year, tentatively until the conclusion of the Naples summit. However, depending on the outcome of the Naples summit, it can be expected that the government may face further difficulty regarding the second phase of yen loans to Iran. The government is likely to be pressed to make a difficult political decision on whether or not to continue extending yen loans to Iran.
