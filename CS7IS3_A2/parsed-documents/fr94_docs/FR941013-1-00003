FR941013-1-00003 FR941013-1-00001 The FAA estimates that 141 airplanes in the U.S. registry would be affected by the proposed AD, that it would take approximately 23 workhours per airplane to accomplish the proposed modification, and that the average labor rate is approximately $55 an hour. The manufacturer will provide parts at no cost to the owner/operator. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $194,580. This figure is based on the assumption that no affected owner/operator has incorporated the proposed modification. Jetstream Aircraft Limited has informed the FAA that 122 modification kits have been delivered to affected airplane owners/operators. Since each of these airplane operators have incorporated revised flight manual supplements, the FAA assumes that each of these kits is installed on one of the affected airplanes. With this in mind, the proposed cost impact upon U.S. operators would be reduced $168,300 from $194,580 to $26,220. In addition, Jetstream Aircraft Limited informed the FAA that the other 19 affected airplanes are in the storage inventory of their sister company JSX. The policy of JSX is to incorporate this modification before distributing one of the affected airplanes to an operator. Taking these factors into consideration, the proposed AD would provide no economic cost impact upon U.S. operators. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action has been placed in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES . List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. The Proposed Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. §39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by removing AD 91&hyph;08&hyph;01, Amendment 39&hyph;7007 (56 FR 24333, May 30, 1991), and adding a new AD to read as follows: Jetstream Aircraft Limited: Docket No. 92&hyph;CE&hyph;22&hyph;AD. Supersedes AD 91&hyph;08&hyph;01, Amendment 39&hyph;7007. Applicability: Jetstream Model 3101 airplanes (all serial numbers), certificated in any category, that do not have the flap system modified in accordance with the ACCOMPLISHMENT INSTRUCTIONS section of Jetstream Aircraft Limited Service Bulletin (SB) 27&hyph;JA 910541, which consists of the following pages and revision levels: ␣ 1Page Nos. 1Revision level 1Date 2, 5 through 30 and 33 through 45 Revision 1 November 11, 1991. 31 Revision 2 February 4, 1992. 1, 3, 4, and 32 Revision 3 November 16, 1992. Note 1: Compliance with a different revision level of the above-referenced service bulletin fulfills the applicable requirements of this AD. Compliance: Required as indicated after the effective date of this AD, unless already accomplished. To prevent sudden pitch down of the airplane during icing conditions, which could lead to loss of control of the airplane, accomplish the following: (a) Within the next 10 hours time-in-service (TIS) after June 10, 1991 (the effective date of superseded AD 91&hyph;08&hyph;01), accomplish the following: (1) Modify the operating limitations placards located on the flight deck in accordance with Jetstream Alert SB No. 27&hyph;A&hyph;JA 910340, dated March 25, 1991. This modification will limit the maximum flap extension speed at the 50-degree position to 130 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS). (2) Insert a copy of this AD into the limitations section of the airplane flight manual. (b) Within the next 25 hours TIS after June 10, 1991 (the effective date of superseded AD 91&hyph;08&hyph;01), accomplish the following: (1) Fabricate a placard with the words ``Do not extend the flaps beyond the 20-degree position if ice is visible on the airplane and ensure that the landing gear selector is down prior to landing.'' Install this placard on the airplane's instrument panel within the pilot's clear view. Parts of the airplane where ice could specifically be visible include the windshield wipers, center windshield, propeller spinners, or inboard wing leading edges. (2) Operate the airplane in accordance with BAe CAA-Mandatory Alert Service Bulletin 27&hyph;A&hyph;JA 910340, dated March 25, 1991, Section 2.B.&hyph;Instruction for Aircraft Operations, paragraphs (1)(a) and (1)(c) until Amendments P/32, P/49, and P/52 have been received. Upon receipt, incorporate these amendments into Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) HP.4.10. Ensure that Amendment ␣ G/10 is incorporated into AFM HP.4.10. (c) Within the next 100 hours TIS after the effective date of this AD, incorporate the 35-degree flap modification (Amendment JA 910541) in accordance with the ACCOMPLISHMENT INSTRUCTIONS section of Jetstream Aircraft Limited SB 27&hyph;JA 910541.
