FR940620-0-00129 FR940620-0-00029 13.3.2(2)␣Maneuvering Space This provision requires both wheelchair turning space complying with ADAAG 4.2.3 and ground and floor spaces complying with ADAAG 4.5 in accessible spaces. Few comments were received on this provision and no changes have been made. 13.3.2(3)␣Accessible Route This provision requires an accessible route complying with ADAAG 4.3 to connect all accessible spaces and elements within accessible dwelling units. The provision emphasizes that an elevator is not required within multi-level dwelling units as long as required accessible elements are provided on an accessible level. Few comments were received on this provision and no changes have been made. 13.3.2(4)␣Parking This provision provides the minimum requirements for accessible parking spaces regardless of whether they are connected to dwelling units or provided in a lot or other facility. The provision requires one accessible parking space complying with ADAAG 4.6, or the universal parking space design, for each accessible dwelling unit if resident parking is provided. If more than one parking space is provided for each dwelling unit, accessible parking spaces must be distributed among all types of parking spaces. An exception provides that where parking spaces are assigned to specific dwelling units, the parking sign identifying the accessible space is not required to be provided until the dwelling unit is occupied by a resident with a disability. The provision further provides that two percent of the total parking provided on a site in excess of one parking space per dwelling unit shall be accessible. Comment. The NPRM asked whether the guidelines should include a requirement for accessible van parking and a requirement that every accessible parking space in tenant lots be van accessible. Most commenters supported a requirement for tenant parking spaces to be one hundred percent accessible to tenants driving vans. A few suggested a lower percentage. The Minnesota Council on Disability recommended providing van parking for every dwelling unit having a roll-in shower. Others, including the National Parking Association, suggested that an adjacent parking space might be used as an access aisle for a van if needed by a tenant. The National Conference of States on Building Codes and Standards and a few other commenters supported the existing scoping for van parking at ADAAG 4.1.2(5)(b). Response. Although the need for tenant van parking could be greater than the need for van parking for other occupancies covered by ADAAG 4.1.2(5)(b), commenters did not provide a rationale for a scoping provision exceeding that already in ADAAG. Although some commenters felt the costs were minimal, little cost information was provided. For this reason, the scoping for van spaces in ADAAG 4.1.2(5)(b) has been included for residential facilities. Comment. The NPRM asked whether it should specify the universal parking space design or the van accessible type for tenant parking. Responses were divided among the two options. Very little cost data or other information was provided for the choices selected. The Illinois Department of Rehabilitation Services reported that accessible parking spaces in Illinois are required to be sixteen feet wide and that access aisles are not shared. Response. ADAAG permits a designer to elect to provide a combination of accessible car and van spaces or universal design parking spaces. As commenters were so divided regarding design choices, and because some States and localities have established code requirements consistent with existing ADAAG, the guidelines do not limit the options, but have retained the flexibility of choosing which design option is preferred. Comment. One commenter was concerned that signs identifying accessible parking spaces would expose tenants to greater risk of crime. The commenter noted that signs which identify spaces by apartment or other identification number would serve the same purpose as those which identify accessible reserved spaces since they both restrict parking by unauthorized people. Response. It is possible that signs designating spaces as reserved for particular units are as effective as those signs which indicate that spaces are reserved for accessible parking only. However, many States and localities strictly enforce violations of properly designated accessible spaces and law enforcement personnel may find it more difficult to control misuse of spaces merely reserved for tenants. Regarding concerns that parking signs will increase the potential for crime, accessible spaces are configured differently from inaccessible spaces and there already is an indication that the space serves an accessible dwelling unit. For these reasons, signs are required.
