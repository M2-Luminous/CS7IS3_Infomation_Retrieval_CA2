The outcome of their talks was a communique signed by Moldavian President Mircea Snegur and the leader of the Dniester region Igor Smirnov. The document emphasizes that a new socio-political situation has been created in Moldavia. This situation is a "serious prerequisite for a successful resolution of the Dniester region crisis by negotiations and in accordance with the interests of the entire people." The sides pledged to take into consideration at the talks the recommendations on a settlement to the conflict that were prepared by the CSCE mission and the proposals of the Russian Federation. Yesterday, the Russian president's representative Vladlen Vasev, who took part in the talks, told an ITAR-TASS correspondent that the proposals of Russia, which is acting as mediator in the talks between Kishinev and Tiraspol, are very close to the CSCE's recommendations. They propose to grant the Dniester region a special legal status, broad self-administration and economic independence within the framework of a unified Moldavia, as well as rights to self-determination in the event of Moldavia's loss of statehood. Today the sides agreed without delay and without any preconditions to begin talks, remove barriers in the way of the normal implementation of economic and socio-cultural ties and to ensure their restoration and development. They agreed on the need to determine the Dniester region's status under state law, the stage-by-stage establishment and implementation of state-law relations, the delegation and demarcation of the powers of the sides and the creation of a system of mutual guarantees. Taking part in the meeting were Petr Luchinskiy, the Moldavian parliamentary chairman; Prime Minister Andrei Sangheli; Grigoriy Marakutsa, chairman of the Dniester region Supreme Soviet, and Richard Samuel, the head of the CSCE mission in Kishinev.
