This is characteristic of Russia's fresh state institutions. "But real facts exist apart from emotions. "It is a reality that Aleksey I. Kazannik tendered his resignation of his own free will. "It is a reality that the president accepted his resignation and named a new candidate for the post. "These realities cannot be ignored. "Hence, it is necessary to look for a way out of the situation. "A situation of vacuum or double power cannot be allowed to emerge in the sphere of prosecutorship. This blocks the entire system of prosecuting activity at a time when the country is engulfed by a wave of crime. It will be difficult to make clear to the people why an impasse appeared in which the Federation Council has found itself. The prestige of this body can suffer as a result. "The Federation Council cannot be permitted to become the initiator of political braking at a moment when Russia has begun its movement toward concord. "One would like to believe that the Federation Council will act proceeding primarily from the supreme interests of the state. The possibilities for this are far from exhaustion."
