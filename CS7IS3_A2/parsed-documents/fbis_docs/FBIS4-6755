Why did the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, of which the United States is a leading member, agree to use air power against the Serb advance on Gorazde when it had no intention to do more than engage sparingly in pinprick strikes? The military buildup by the Serb forces last month showed that a major offensive was in the offing. True, air strikes can not be expected to prevent the Serbs from seizing Gorazde or any of the other Muslim enclaves. But this misses the point, which is that no serious attempt was made to deter the Serbs or punish them if deterrence failed. When the Serb forces moved into Gorazde on Saturday, all that was done was to order two fighters to attack tanks aiming their guns at that town. It should have been clear when the first air strikes were carried out 10 days ago that such limited attacks would not stop the Serbs. That action should have been spelled out to the Serbs as a warning of fiercer strikes to come if they did not halt their aggression. It is possible that fear of retaliation would have deterred them if a credible threat had been made. In any case, the Serb forces should not have escaped punishment. They lost only a couple of tanks and a few armoured personnel carriers when the objective should have been to target their ammunition and fuel storage sites as well as other facilities that would erode their fighting capacity. NATO also failed to retaliate when one of its aircraft was shot down by a Serb missile. It caved in by calling off any further air strikes. The fall of Gorazde will embolden the Serbs to proceed according to their plan of consolidating their territorial conquests with the declared aim of carving out a Greater Serbia. Having secured a major road link and a swathe of territory connecting their possessions in eastern and southern Bosnia, their next likely target is the large Muslim enclave of Tuzla, which is one of the six safe havens designated by the United Nations. Like Gorazde, it is inhabited mainly by refugees. Already under siege, its capture would enable the Serbs to tighten their grip over the northeastern region. They can also be expected now to reactivate their pressure on Sarajevo. With the Serb forces moving closer to achieving their goal of Greater Serbia, there can hardly be any prospect of a peace settlement since that would require them to make territorial concessions. Economic sanctions imposed on Serbia have hurt that country, but with its ambition of becoming the centre of an expanded Serbia, it will be able to cope with the hardships, as seen over the past two years. Reportedly, under the recent accord for a loose union between the Muslims and Croats, the Serbs would have to concede at least 21 percent of the land they control. That much is regarded by the Muslims and Croats to be the bare minimum. Otherwise, they would not have enough territory to accommodate each other's ethnic interests in a new union. The Western fiasco over Gorazde must have made it clear to the Muslims and Croats that they would have to make a concerted military effort to wrest those areas from the Serbs. Moves towards a merger of their forces are underway. The West can help that process by acting to lift the arms embargo that has greatly disadvantaged them. The embargo was imposed on the former Yugoslavia in 1991 before the conflict in Bosnia erupted. Once the Muslims acquire heavy equipment, the Serb forces will begin to lose the military superiority they enjoy. Unless the ground situation begins to change, the Serbs will not engage in any serious peace process nor will NATO air strikes make much difference if they are resumed at all. The right of self-defence, at any rate, is one of the fundamental principles enshrined in the UN Charter. The West cannot continue to deny it to the Bosnian Muslims.
