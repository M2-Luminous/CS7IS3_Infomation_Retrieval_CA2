When Bonn speaks of an end to the "imbalance toward the south" and understands itself as a "hinge" in the center, this needs some urgent explanation, circles of French diplomacy have said. At the movement there is no real dialogue between Bonn and Paris. If this does not change, the specters of the past that one is encountering again everywhere cannot be banished. The reemergence of distrust is, however, not so much a problem between Paris and Bonn as between the Germans and the smaller states in Europe, it was noted. French diplomats in Bonn accuse the Germans of having forced the EU expansion in Brussels by brute force. In particular, there are complaints that Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel occasionally uses the wrong kind of language. Kinkel threatened the Spanish in Brussels that he would "break their backs" if they did not agree to a compromise with Norway. No German would have talked like that before reunification. This rude language led to a temporary hardening of the Spanish attitude in Brussels, it was said. In the Foreign Ministry it was stressed that none of the German diplomats heard Kinkel say anything like that at the conference table. If he did say it in a different context, a misunderstanding is conceivable. When the minister speaks in his Swabian dialect in the heat of discussion, this might sound different in translation than what was meant. France may be expressing concern that Germany wants to give up its previous restraint. The new role in which Germany sees itself is irritating, above all, the smaller states in the EU and not so much Paris, the French side said. Minor differences because of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's nonattendance at the memorial celebrations on the 50th anniversary of the Allied invasion in Normandy on 6 June and because of the festivities for the withdrawal of the troops of the Western Allies from Berlin on 8 September must be seen against the background of this general distrust in Europe. For the first time French diplomatic circles stated that one is wondering what the shifting of the capital from Bonn to Berlin will mean. German politics must explain this to France above all. It still holds true that Europe cannot be shaped without renewed cooperation between France and Germany. Bonn and Paris together must form the "hinge" between the north and the south. France must know whether the Germans want to maintain the old ties with the West from before reunification or whether one has to prepare for a Germany that is oriented differently. German-French friendship is not self-evident, it was stressed. Friendship is not a natural condition between the two countries. It must be consolidated again and again. It is high time for Bonn and Paris to talk to each other honestly and to frankly broach the many problems that exist between them. A change in government in Bonn will not irritate Paris, it was said. In personal talks Social Democratic Party Chairman Rudolf Scharping promised complete continuity in foreign and security policy. He stated that what he said in his speech at the Munich security conference will apply to his chancellorship, it was noted.
