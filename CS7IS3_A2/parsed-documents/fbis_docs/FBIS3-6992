In a dawn assault, about 150 members of the notorious ultra- nationalist faction attacked government positions in the Bavel district of Battambang Province, northeast of the former Khmer Rouge stronghold of Pailin, local police said. The guerrillas attacked around 5:30 a.m., injuring two police officers, two local militia and six soldiers, one of them seriously, an officer said. The Khmer Rouge also targeted a weapons warehouse and burned it down, he said, adding that two guerrillas were killed before government forces repelled the assault four hours. "Because we destroyed their nest in Pailin, they have lost their temper and they just go everywhere in the area to try and disturb us, rob the villagers and burn peoples' homes," the police officer said. In Thmar Kol, about halfway between Battambang and Sisophon, soldiers opened fire with heavy machine guns and artillery at what they said was an advancing force of Khmer Rouge. More guerrilla attacks were expected late Tuesday night, and aid agencies were put on a security alert and warned not go to Bavel district. Cambodian government forces say they seized Pailin, once a bustling gem-mining and logging centre, this weekend. Trucks, heavy guns and multiple-rocket launchers were rushed to reinforce the town on Tuesday, but got bogged down in thick mud and heavy rain on Highway 10, a strategic route that has also yet to be cleared of suspected landmines, an AFP reporter saw. Tuesday's attack came only a day after a senior government general said that the Khmer Rouge's estimated 1,500 fighters in the area had probably broken up into small groups. Around 25,000 Cambodians have fled into eastern Thailand to escape the fighting, an armed forces spokesman in Bangkok said Monday.
