Speakers at today's meeting of the territorial administration noted that the Kubans have managed to organize the protection of borders and public safety in the territorial border areas bearing in mind the on-going clashes in the Transcaucasian and North Caucasian republics. They have formed check points and mobile groups. Cossack organizations have made 130 units to participate in operations together with the local police. Russian Interior Minister Viktor Yerin told the meeting that the escalation of violence in the Krasnodar Territory has become stable and criminal terror has turned regular. Last year alone the Kuban police revealed 400 criminal groups with an overall strength of 1,000 people.
