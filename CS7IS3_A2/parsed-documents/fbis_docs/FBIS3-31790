In a talk with reporters, General Mladic commented on the latest events in Sarajevo following NATO's ultimatum to the Serbs to withdraw their heavy artillery from around the city. A report by our correspondent Dragan Stekic:. [Stekic] General Mladic visited the fighters and officers of the 1st Krajina Corps in the course of his regular tour. Accompanied by the commander of this corps, Lieutenant Colonel General Momir Talic, the commander in chief inspected a number of units on Mount Ozren and the Doboj and Teslic fronts, and expressed satisfaction at the morale of the fighters and their resolve to defend the borders of the Srpska republic and counter any threats to Serb territories. In a brief meeting with reporters, General Mladic commented on the latest developments on the fronts around Sarajevo and the placing of Serb heavy artillery under the supervision of the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR]: [begin recording] [Mladic] We have displayed the maximum understanding this time to peacefully resolve the war drama on the territory of the former Yugoslavia and the former Bosnia-Herzegovina. It has never even crossed our minds to leave the people in the lurch and at the mercy of our enemy's whims. What they and their sponsors had in store for us became evident in the past stages of this war. Therefore, our weapons will be supervised by UN forces, which does not mean that we will not defend ourselves if attacked. We will defend ourselves with all available means. The guarantee for our survival is our might and our unity, not anybody's will. [Stekic] UNPROFOR's Russian troops are now deployed along the separation lines. Are they enough of a guarantee for the maintenance of the truce in this area? [Mladic] If I were to judge, I would describe this as a major international development. I believe that a great world power has every right to be in the focus of events in this region in these difficult times. I think that the presence of Russian troops in the role of peacekeepers will significantly contribute to the equal treatment of all sides in the conflict in future, in contrast to the international community's present one-sided approach to our enemies -- the Muslims and the Croats and their armies -- and the maximum logistical support and media coverage they are receiving. [Stekic] In your view, is there a possibility NATO might strike against Muslim and Croat positions? [Mladic] [Chuckles] Hardly. They would never strike against their satellites. They [Muslims and Croats] belong to them. They have been preparing for war in their countries, they are toeing their line, obeying their orders. They are their extended hand in the Balkans. Why would they pound them? True, they have been at each other's throats, but they [NATO] know how to keep them in line. They have ways of dealing with them if things get out of hand. [end recording]
