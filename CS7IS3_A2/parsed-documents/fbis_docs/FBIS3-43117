The first one meets a request by the Government of Moldova regarding 245 million lei from the funds at the disposal of the government for relations with Moldova, which was initially intended to equip 65 trucks. The government decided that this sum of money should be spent to ensure deliveries of veterinary medicines, sanitary equipment, and electric utensils. The second decision regards a 20-billion-lei credit made available for the Republic of Moldova to finance Romanian deliveries of fuels, mineral oils, and other goods urgently needed for 1993.

In 1993 the turnover of this five-member company -- international, holding, trading, electronics, and shipping -- totaled some 60 billion lei (about $55 million). About 80 percent of the turnover is represented by investments in metallurgy and raw materials and the remainding 20 percent by investments in electronics and household electrical appliances. The board of directors includes two Romanians and two Turks. Freedom Star International was founded in the fall of 1990. First, its trade consisted of small import-export operations. "We have been cooperating with two Turkish partners for three years now. We have made joint investments in the manufacture of television sets and in a milk-processing unit. The Turks could have cashed their profit, that is 2 1/2 billion lei, but instead our Turkish partners reinvested their profit along with us," Ion Serban, president of the Board of Directors said. "We will start new investments in 1994. We believe in Romania's future and we want to continue to invest here," Turkish Director Erhan Iarhun said. Freedom Star is a group with a special economic potential and with strong economic relations.

Mr. Berinde also pointed out that the bilateral talks referred to an increased share of commercial exchanges by growing imports as well as exports. He also added that "an appeal was made on Austrian firms holding collaboration ties with Romanian companies to act more firmly for the investment process in Romania, for the manufacturing of products that will be subsequently exported on third markets and even on the Austrian market." Presently, Romanian imports from Austria cover exports by only 64 percent, which is the main reason why stress was laid on the achievement of a greater equilibrium of the trade balance between the two countries. During the proceedings of the joint commission, the Austrian side showed interest in the completion of several concrete projects for collaboration. "It is in fact the building of the Grand Hotel in Bucharest, mostly financed by the Austrian side and Austrian support in the building of a bridge across the Danube that would ensure a smooth path for commercial exchanges within the current context of the embargo imposed on Yugoslavia," said Mr. Berinde. (Bucharest ROMPRES in English 0507 GMT 7 Dec 93 AU) ECONOMIC RELATIONS WITH FINLAND: "Romanian-Finnish commercial ties accounted for some $10 million last year, which is rather little compared with the real possibilities," the ambassador of Finland in Bucharest, Timo Koponen, told the daily JURNAL NATIONAL. Some $8 million has been registered until present, according to the Finnish diplomat, which forecasts a certain growth for the current year compared to 1992. Ten Finnish companies are currently operating in Romania, said the ambassador of Finland, the newest one, Metaneff. In his opinion, these projects started after the signing of several agreements last year, following the visits paid to Finland by Romania's President Ion Iliescu and the speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Adrian Nastase, and during the meetings in Bucharest of the Romanian Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu with Finnish officials, agreements in the field of industry and agriculture, as well as the understanding signed among eight countries including Romania and Finland. The ambassador also considered as extremely important the Romanian-Finnish understanding in the field of investment protection, which sets the legal framework necessary for all investors.

The joint company will produce ion-exchanging resins for water purification. The overseas private investments corporation (OPIC), which is an agency of the American Administration, will provide up to $20 million for the virolite functional polymers plant. This is the first OPIC project in Romania. The project will lead to the technological improvement in water purification for the domestic market and will generate exports for hard currency. This joint venture will encourage other American businessmen to invest in Romania, said OPIC president Ruth R. Harkin. Representatives of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) announced at the signing ceremony in Bucharest that the EBRD would invest an additional $3.5 million in this project and that it would make an $11 million loan to the joint venture. About 60 percent of the production is estimated to be exported, thus bringing over $17 million from the exports to the American market alone.

In June 1991, Mania set up -- together with the Electrotimis company of Timisoara -- Stimel, an Italian-Romanian joint venture manufacturing electrical equipment, with $4 four million worth of capital. Stimel's turnover had reached $1 million by the end of 1991. Mania and the Infratirea enterprise of Oradea later set up Stimin. The Stima group of Italy intends to open some more Italian-Romanian joint ventures in Romanian towns. Together with the Dacia Felix Bank, Ioan Mania drafted a financial project aimed at facilitating exports by the Italian industrial group and finance Romanian industry. Although important, tradition and human resources are not enough for Romania's development, as equipment and productivity have to be considered, Mania said. "The existing handicaps can be overcome," added the Romanian industrialist. He said his love for his country had acted as an incentive in his cooperation with Romania.
