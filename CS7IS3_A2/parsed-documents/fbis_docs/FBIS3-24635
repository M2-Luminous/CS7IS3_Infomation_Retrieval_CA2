Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-02FEB94-JAPAN-U.S. Tokyo Signals Modest Concessions on Framework Issues SUMMARY Japanese media reporting suggests that the Japanese Government is prepared to make some modest concessions on selected U.S.-Japan trade framework issues, most notably those involving the automobile and auto parts sector and government procurement. The pressure to make such concessions appears to be coming from parts of the government, mainly within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA), that are reportedly increasingly concerned about the consequences of the hard line Tokyo has been taking in the framework talks. At the same time, however, Tokyo appears to remain united in its opposition to any concessions on the issue of setting objective criteria to measure Japan's trade performance, suggesting concessions are unlikely in this area. END SUMMARY The Japanese Government appears to be searching for ways to resolve the impasse in the Japan-U.S. framework negotiations and avert the failure of the 11 February summit between President Clinton and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa by making some modest concessions in key areas, judging from Japanese press reporting. In the automobile and auto parts sectors, for example, the government has begun to signal that it is prepared to work with the Japanese auto industry to devise a plan to increase Japanese purchases of U.S.-made autos and auto parts. -- According to a 28 January Kyodo report, Sozaburo Okamatsu, Vice Minister of International Trade and Industry for International Affairs, told a press conference on 28 January that his ministry was urging the Japanese auto industry to take a "cooperative approach" to increasing imports of U.S.-made cars and auto parts. Okamatsu reportedly stated that this approach, designed to dispel "mutual distrust" between Tokyo and Washington, would involve each automaker setting criteria, such as specifying the number of Japanese dealerships selling U.S.- made cars and the number of firms cooperating with U.S. auto parts makers to design parts for use in Japanese-made cars. Okamatsu reportedly added that these criteria would then be used to evaluate Japanese firms' import performance twice a year and to decide whether additional steps to increase imports were necessary. -- In addition, the 24 January Mainichi Shimbun reported that the Japanese Government was broaching such a voluntary import plan with the Japanese auto industry, focusing particularly on the development of joint U.S.-Japan ventures to help U.S. firms design auto parts for use in Japanese-made cars. The details of the Japanese Government's plans appear to still be under consideration. While Okamatsu reportedly stated that the criteria he mentioned might be used to evaluate the performance of Japanese companies twice a year, the 2 February Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) is broaching with Japanese automakers a plan under which each automaker would issue a yearly projection of the volume of specific U.S.-made items it would purchase. This plan also reportedly involves reciprocal actions on the part of U.S. auto makers, including the submission of yearly projections of exports to Japan. Another proposal under consideration appears to be the establishment of a third-party organ to assess the degree of foreign participation in the Japanese auto market. According to the 2 February Nihon Keizai Shimbun, this proposal will be presented to U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor during his current visit to Tokyo. The paper stated that MITI envisions that the panel will be composed of scholars and the representatives of private companies and will assess both Japanese import performance and U.S. export efforts based on such criteria as the volume of Japanese automobile and auto parts imports and the number of sales outlets selling imported cars. According to Nihon Keizai Shimbun, MITI wants the criteria used by the panel to include the number of cars made by U.S. automakers--such as right-hand drive vehicles--tailored to the demands of the Japanese market. Government Procurement A second area where the government appears to be prepared to make concessions is government procurement. According to the 28 January Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Tokyo is drafting a new action program designed to make government procurement more open not only for public works projects but also for such areas as communications and medical equipment. The paper reported that the draft program will expand the principle of open competitive bidding to all projects of more that 500,000 Special Drawing Rights (SDR) (down from the current 1 million SDRs). The program will also introduce a comprehensive evaluation system that will take into consideration not only the price of items to be procured, but also such factors as performance, particularly for supercomputers; and will establish a neutral review board to arbitrate complaints related to government procurement. Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported, however, that the review board will not have jurisdiction over some areas, most notably supercomputers. In a further effort to signal its readiness to make government procurement more open, Tokyo reportedly plans to inaugurate a new government publication to announce upcoming projects. According to the 1 February Nihon Keizai Shimbun, this publication has been tentatively named the Government Procurement Gazette and will be included in the action program for opening the government procurement market. The gazette will reportedly consolidate information currently published in a number of different government publications and will be issued in both Japanese and English editions. Pressure from MOFA Some of these concessions may be the result of pressure from elements within the Foreign Ministry. Japanese press reporting has suggested that key officials in MOFA are increasingly concerned about the impact that the impasse in the talks may have on the upcoming summit between President Clinton and Prime Minister Hosokawa, and more broadly, on relations between Japan and the United States in general. According to the 26 January Sankei Shimbun, some MOFA officials increasingly believe that Japanese negotiators have become so involved in rebutting specific U.S. arguments that they have lost sight of the broad issues involved in the talks. Sankei Shimbun reported that these officials believe that the broad U.S. argument--that the Japanese government procurement, automobile, auto parts and insurance markets are less open than U.S. and European markets and that intra-industry trade in underdeveloped--is "essentially correct." They reportedly are arguing that it is counterproductive for Japanese negotiators to keep insisting that the United States take steps to increase U.S. exports to Japan because this stance runs the risk of making Washington think that "Japan is trying to avoid the real issues." According to Sankei Shimbun, some of the MOFA officials who support this line of argument have been pushing for Japan to make concessions in the automobile and auto parts sectors, suggesting that the Japanese auto industry could take steps to increase imports. Recent statements by, or attributed to, MOFA officials tend to support the conclusion that some MOFA officials are pushing for a more flexible Japanese approach to the framework talks. The 26 January Nihon Keizai Shimbun quoted Japanese Ambassador to the United States Takakazu Kuriyama as stating during a 25 January news conference in Washington that "Tokyo and Washington earlier agreed during construction talks to set criteria to assess the openness of the Japanese construction market. This will serve as a precedent and will be good for reference." The 2 February edition of the same paper reported that Kuriyama told Prime Minister Hosokawa on 1 February that the United States was taking "a tough approach to the framework talks" and that he hoped that Hosokawa would "exercise leadership to conclude the talks." The 1 February Asahi Shimbun cited an unnamed senior MOFA official as expressing concern that the framework negotiations might fail if the impasse is not resolved. United Front Against Objective Criteria Despite the signs of modest concessions and the divisions within the government over Tokyo's hardline stance in the framework talks, Tokyo appears to remain united in its opposition to setting objective criteria to measure Japan's trade performance. -- During his news conference after the passage of the political reform bills on 29 January, Prime Minister Hosokawa said that although he had instructed Japanese officials to search for compromises in the framework talks, he believed that Japan should "clearly insist on our stance" (NHK Television, 29 January). -- According to the 1 February Asahi Shimbun, Hosokawa and MITI head Hiroshi Kumagai during a 29 January meeting reconfirmed Japan's stance on the issue of objective criteria, stating that "matters to be discussed at the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks should be confined to what the government can do using its authority, and Japan will not set any numerical targets." -- During a 1 February news conference, Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata reportedly stated that Japan would never accept the setting of numerical targets, asserting that "such criteria run counter to Japanese Government efforts to promote deregulation" (Kyodo, 1 February). -- During a 27 January news conference, MITI Administrative Vice Minister Hideaki Kumano reportedly rejected a U.S. call for setting targets for the import of U.S. cars into Japan, calling it "out of the question" and "inconceivable" and arguing that "the Japanese Government cannot commit itself to goods that Japanese consumers buy" (Mainichi Shimbun, 28 January). -- According to the 26 January Yomiuri Shimbun, Ambassador Kuriyama stated during a 25 January news conference that the United States "has been overly hasty in seeking trade results from the [framework] talks." The Japanese Government appears to remain under considerable political pressure to maintain this stance. Business leaders, who will provide critical financial support in future elections even under the new political reform legislation, have continued to press the government to oppose objective criteria. According to the 31 January Mainichi Shimbun, a group of Japanese business leaders, including Takeshi Nagano, the President of the Japan Federation of Employers Associations and Shoichiro Toyoda, the Chairman of Toyota Motor Corporation, met with Prime Minister Hosokawa on 30 January to urge him to continue to oppose the setting of objective criteria to measure Japan's import performance. The Japanese media, possibly with the encouragement of the Japanese Government, also appears to have fostered a climate of public opinion highly critical of the concept of objective criteria. In addition to reporting the numerous statements of Japanese officials arguing against the concept of targets, the media has featured a variety of reports discrediting that concept. For example, on 28 January, Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading economic newspaper, reported that a group called the "Scholars Against Managed Trade," consisting of 154 Japanese and foreign economists and political scientists and headed by Kazuo Ueda, an economics professor at Tokyo University--which has close ties with the government--issued a "policy proposal" criticizing objective criteria as "something that promotes government-led managed trade." According to Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the policy paper argued that if the Japanese Government accepted objective criteria, Japan would "face unreasonable trade demands from the United States" and be hit with U.S. sanctions if it failed to meet the criteria. In addition, Japanese editorial opinion has continued to oppose numerical targets. An editorial in the 31 January Asahi Shimbun, for example, described Japan's rejection of objective criteria as "reasonable" and warned that "setting target figures in individual trade fields is undesirable since it is what we call managed trade." Outlook As the 11 February summit approaches, Tokyo will probably make further modest, selected concessions on framework issues to avert failure of the summit and to avoid increased friction with the United States. In order to maintain its argument that the Japanese Government cannot interfere with the private sector, Tokyo is likely to attempt to cloak these concessions as agreements between the private sectors in the United States and Japan. However, the unanimity of opposition to the setting of objective criteria to measure Japan's trade performance--cutting across all the main political forces in Japan, including leading politicians, the bureaucracy, the business sector, and the media- -suggests that the Japanese Government will be reluctant, if not unable, to make any concessions in this area.
