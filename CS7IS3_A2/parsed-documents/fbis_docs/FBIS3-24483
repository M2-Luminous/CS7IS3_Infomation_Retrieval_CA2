One approach to the study of these processes may be based on the utilization of a model polymer containing paramagnetic dopants. In the present work a study was made of the possibility of preparing and the properties of polypyrrole doped with tetracyanoethylene anion-radicals. A broadening in the EPR spectral line after introduction of the anion-radical was observed. This could have been caused by a slow spin-spin exchange between the radical and the polar polymer chain.
