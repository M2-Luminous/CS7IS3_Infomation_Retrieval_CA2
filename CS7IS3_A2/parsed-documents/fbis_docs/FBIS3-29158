The amount represents an increase of some 15.15 million yen over fiscal 1993, the officials said. At a cabinet meeting Tuesday, the government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is scheduled to adopt the 73.08 trillion yen budget for fiscal 1994 which starts April 1 and lasts through March 31, 1995. The increase results mainly from 20.52 million yen earmarked for surveys about the number of Sakhalin Koreans willing to return to South Korea and prospective places of resettlement. The amount provided for "survey costs" is four times higher than in fiscal 1993. In contrast, funds for temporary visits to South Korea will remain at 120 million yen as in fiscal 1993. An estimated 30,000 to 40,000 Koreans were left on Sakhalin island, the southern half of which was Japanese territory until the end of World War II. In a joint survey with South Korea several thousand Sakhalin Koreans, mainly from the first generation, expressed hopes to return to South Korea. Construction Minister Kozo Igarashi, who is also secretary general of a legislators' group for Sakhalin Koreans, welcomed the government decision. "The Hosokawa cabinet has been active in revising views on (unresolved) postwar issues but has not come much further than offering apologies. Such concrete results are rare," he said. The Diet is expected to begin debate on the fiscal 1994 budget in early March. Japan, which ruled the whole Korean peninsula between 1910 and 1945, took the Koreans to Sakhalin before the war as hard labor workers, mostly in mines, but left them behind when the island came under Soviet rule. Repatriation talks have gained speed recently as Seoul, Tokyo and Moscow agreed to deal with the issue in trilateral negotiations. During most of the Soviet era, the Sakhalin Koreans were not allowed to contact relatives in South Korea because Moscow only recognized North Korea.
