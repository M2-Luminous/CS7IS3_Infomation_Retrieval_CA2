FR940404-0-00100 FR940404-0-00023 The amended regulations do not contemplate the Bureau's use of visiting lists as the source of names or numbers for use on inmate telephone lists. The final rule states, instead, that inmates are to provide information for the creation and maintenance of their telephone lists. See 28 CFR 540.101(a)(1). These nonincarcerated individuals also objected to the Bureau's obtaining information about them from the telephone lists submitted by the inmates. The Privacy Act provides in relevant part that, ``to the extent practicable,'' an agency shall collect information directly from an individual about whom the agency may make ``adverse determinations.'' 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(2). It is far more practicable to collect up to 30 names and telephone numbers from a single inmate than it is to collect them from each recipient of that inmate's calls. Commenters also expressed concern about the form addressed to potential recipients of an inmate's calls on the ground that the form seeks information about those individuals which they allege to be private information. As discussed above in the section entitled ``3. CONSTITUTIONAL CONCERNS␣*␣*␣* b. Fourth Amendment rights to privacy.'', the Bureau has revised the final rule to eliminate this form, and replaced it with a notice letter to potential recipients who are not immediate family or persons already approved for the inmate's visiting list. This change should substantially accommodate comments on this issue. 9. Miscellaneous In addition to the previous issues, comments received by the Bureau raised several other issues, and are addressed below: a. One commenter, a telephone service company, perceived a potential for conflict between the proposed rule and potential orders and rules that may be issued by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) arising out of the currently pending Billed Party Preference docket (BPP). The Bureau believes that it is not necessary to respond to comments based upon ``potential problems''. Accordingly, if the FCC or any other agency issues regulations in the future which conflict with these telephone regulations, the Bureau will take appropriate action at that time. b. Commenters objected to the ITS stating that it was arbitrary and that its current use violates 28 CFR parts 540 and 545. For the reasons discussed above, there are valid correctional management reasons for amending the regulations to provide for the operation of the ITS. We do not consider these regulations to be arbitrary, as the ITS is being implemented following a pilot program and an assessment that it better addresses the Bureau's correctional goals and institution security needs. With respect to the IFRP provision, the Bureau believes that the discussion above sufficiently addresses this comment. c. A commenter wanted assurance that there would be no harrassment or punitive actions based on inmate objection to the ITS implementation. Bureau staff are professionals and are provided training on their role and responsibilities. Staff retaliation against inmates is not tolerated. The Bureau's Office of Internal Affairs and the Inspector General of the Department of Justice will thoroughly investigate any allegations of misconduct. The Bureau's Chief Executive Officers will take appropriate action where indicated. The Administrative Remedy Program is another vehicle available to inmates to raise allegations of staff misconduct. d. Commenters stated that it would be an additional financial hardship to have people send money. The basis for this complaint is not entirely clear in one comment; in a second comment, the commenter refers to the family sending money for hygiene items and that to require money for telephone use would pose an additional financial burden. As noted earlier, the Bureau does provide for basic hygiene items. Some commenters were concerned that it may be necessary to exchange foreign currency prior to residents of a foreign country forwarding any funds, with some stating that their country does not allow its currency to leave the country. As noted above, the lower ITS rates should provide some relief for such incidental costs as exchange fees, etc. e. A commenter mistakenly believes that loss of commissary privileges as a result of disciplinary action will also result in the loss of telephone privileges. This is not the case. As with postage stamp purchases, telephone access is independent of the regular commissary. For an inmate to lose telephone privileges as a result of disciplinary action, that sanction must be specifically stated.
