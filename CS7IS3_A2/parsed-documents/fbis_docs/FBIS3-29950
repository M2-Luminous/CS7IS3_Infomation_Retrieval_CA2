A political essay of the paper headlined "We Have Great Theses" reads in part: Socialist Korea is a great country, the first country in history to successfully solve the difficult and outstanding socialist rural question on the basis of the great rural theses. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il said: "`Theses on the socialist rural question in our country' authored by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song is our party's programme of building the countryside and a bright blueprint for a final solution of the rural question." The great rural theses is the only programme for a solution to the rural question, the first of its kind in history which was authored by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and has been successfully implemented by our party. This great theses clearly indicates the way of finally solving the rural question by vigorously carrying on the three revolutions, ideological, technical and cultural, in the countryside, realising the leadership of the working class to the peasants, assistance of industry to agriculture and support of towns to the countryside, strengthening the guidance and management of the rural economy and the [words indistinct] between property of the whole people and cooperative property and eliminating the class distinction between the working class the peasantry. It is a great programme of rural construction which could be provided only by Comrade Kim Il-song, who founded the idea greatest ever in history and looks behind the curtain of time with a strong sense of responsibility for the destiny of our peasants and other people. The changes which have taken place in the socialist countryside of our country thanks to the rural theses are a brilliant fruition of the iron will and the revolutionary practice of the great leader and the illustrious leader, who have [words indistinct] the idea and principles of the great theses in any circumstances and have guided our people along the road indicated by it. Though there are many roads in the world, the way indicated by our rural theses is the most correct and shortest one. We have our own way. Our respected leader and dear leader are great and our rural theses is entirely just. We will follow the road of chuche, the way of the rural theses, no matter which way the wind may blow and no matter what others may say. We will move up the day of the complete victory of socialism and realise the idea of communism without fail from rice along the road indicated by the great rural theses, which was authored by Comrade Kim Il-song and has been implemented by Comrade Kim Chong-il. We have great rural theses.
