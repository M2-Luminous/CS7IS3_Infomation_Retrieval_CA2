The meeting was prompted by the banks' concern that Kenneth Dart, a U.S. entrepreneur who bought 3.5 percent ($1.4 billion) of the Brazilian debt and who refuses to accept the agreement's terms, may take action to prevent the conclusion of the agreement. Washington's Arnold & Porter lawyers, a firm advising the Central Bank in the negotiations with the bankers, warned Brazilian authorities about the possibility of Dart's trying to obtain a preliminary court decision suspending the exchange of financial certificates through which the agreement will take effect. "We have several lawyers at work in New York," Michael Degraderied said on 8 April. A Citicorp executive, Degraderied chairs the bank committee. Citibank Vice President William Rhodes said Dart will not be able to prevent the agreement. Brazilian authorities do not believe Dart will attempt to impede the deal's implementation. But the government has taken several precautions because it has not ruled out the possibility of Dart taking legal action after the agreement's conclusion. On 12 April, while issuing the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) an order to transfer approximately $2.8 billion in U.S. Treasury certificates -- which will serve as initial collateral for the agreement, the Central Bank took care to prevent the certificates from being seized by an eventual legal embargo. In New York, Dart spokesperson Melissa Krantz said the entrepreneur maintains his opposition to the agreement's terms. In order to avoid problems, Brazilian Ambassador Paulo Tarso Flecha de Lima consulted in Washington with the White House and the State Department about the possibility of the Clinton administration invoking the International Economic Emergency Powers Act [preceding five words in English] if Dart attempts to impede the agreement. Dart -- In Brasilia, the Central Bank said that if Dart refuses to participate in the exchange of bonds, it will issue a regulation allowing the use of the old certificates being held by Dart for the purchase of state-run companies.
