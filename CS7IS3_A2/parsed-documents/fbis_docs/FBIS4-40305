"We must not create `standard republics'. They are never going to be the same, they all have their own features," the president believes. "When implementing economic policy we have to take account of the regional particularities of each component of the Russian Federation. We will be working out a specific line for relations with every republic, oblast, and kray," Boris Yeltsin noted. Life in the Republic of Tuva depends on its relations with the outside world. Many difficulties could have been avoided if ties with the regions of the Russian Federation had not broken down. Tuva, the president noted, borders on Mongolia and has contacts with China -- these ties must be developed. The republic can only be brought out of its grave economic situation through pushing ahead with the development of contacts with other regions, in part through taking part in the "Siberian Accord" interregional association. President Yeltsin stressed that strengthening the Russian Federation is the president's most important task. "The state must have a single economic space and a single body of legislation," he said. "This means opening up unique opportunities for every part of Russia on this basis." Moving on to the economic state of the republic, Boris Yeltsin noted that basic indicators in Tuva are considerably worse than the average in Russia. This means the Republic of Tuva is unable to live by its own means. Touching on his working visit to Amur Oblast, which ended 15 May, Boris Yeltsin said that this oblast should not, by virtue of its economic structure, be subsidized. It can get out of that situation. But the president is not setting Tuva the same task: "The difference is too great between specific indices and the people's standard of living. It would be unfair to tell them to live by their own means. The people and the leadership there cannot do that and nobody is blaming them for that. That is how the structure of Tuva's economy has developed. Therefore, we must help the republic do enough to bring the standard of living of its people up to the standard of living of people throughout Russia." Moreover, the president noted, he does not intend to confine himself to promises alone, but has given a guarantee to the leaders of Tuva that there will be solid assistance from the Russian budget. The president called on the people of Tuva to work more actively on assimilating market relations and moving the reforms forward. He noted the rich natural resources of Tuva. In the president's opinion, the republic could supply itself with timber and electricity and develop resort tourism. The most acute problem for the region in all this is developing the infrastructure and transportation links. Boris Yeltsin expressed hope that the population in the republic will get their "second wind" following this meeting with the president of Russia. In conclusion, the president said that two decrees which he signed in Tuva for the development of the economy and the social sphere in the republic must be implemented. The president noted that the former lack of trust between the center and the Tuva leadership has now been overcome and that the strained atmosphere among nationalities of two years ago no longer exists in the republic. The main thing now is therefore to act together to bring the republic's economy out of crisis in order to establish normal social conditions for the population of Tuva.
