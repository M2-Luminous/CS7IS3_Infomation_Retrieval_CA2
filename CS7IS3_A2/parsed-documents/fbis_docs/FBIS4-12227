Good morning. [Al-Franji] Good morning. [Szoelloesi] Mr. Al-Franji, have Israel and the PLO overcome the greatest obstacle to the Gaza-Jericho agreement? Can you tell us when Rabin and 'Arafat will sign it? [Al-Franji] I think that there is no other possibility than to sign it soon because this state of affairs, that is, the present state of affairs, will result in major tensions and certain actions here and there that might stop this peace process. Therefore, it is time for both sides, that is, us, the PLO, and Israel, to sign it soon. That is to say, I expect that we will be through with everything before 13 April. [Szoelloesi] That is to say, even before 13 April? [Al-Franji] This is my hope and my estimate. I hope that I will be right. [Szoelloesi] Yesterday it was said -- the number of Palestinian policemen who might be deployed was controversial -- that 9,000 policemen for Gaza and Jericho were agreed upon. Can you confirm this figure? [Al-Franji] I think this figure is correct. I think that the number of policemen that the Israelis have accepted is about 8,500 to 9,000. We need so many policemen now in the Gaza Strip and Jericho because we can only have this situation under control with a strong police troop and because security will only be guaranteed for all people living there if we see to it. There is a vacuum and certain problems that have developed in these days. One can only have this under control if one is prepared for it. [Szoelloesi] You are saying that a strong police would be needed in these days, which indicates that the PLO is aware that there are also many radical forces on the Palestinians' side and the whole of the society has also got used to something like violence. What will happen if a Palestinian police take action against Palestinians? [Al-Franji] We are planning to refrain from violence against our people. This would be the most stupid thing that we could do. We simply have to lead the Palestinian society into a democratic process, so that the Palestinians can somehow cope with a dialogue between themselves alone. If we use force against each other, this will mean that we have peace with the Israelis, while, on the other hand, we have a situation of violence with the Palestinians. This is not the objective of the Palestinians and the PLO. We would like to develop a democratic society, but, on the other hand, order also has to be established in these days. It is not easy to establish order in a people who have lived under an occupation regime for, let us say, 27 years. [Szoelloesi] But is your answer not also wishful thinking? I mean that this is a long-term objective. All agree on it. However, in the beginning the society will be as it is and the people will be as they are. The police will be confronted with the question of how to establish order. [Al-Franji] Well, I think -- first of all, this is not wishful thinking -- that the Palestinians among themselves have been very tolerant so far. The Palestinians outside have practiced democracy for many years, for 30 years. The Palestinians in the occupied territories will not regard the PLO and the Palestinian policemen there as occupation forces. Therefore, there is a great difference between Palestinian policemen and the Israeli Army units. The Palestinians who live there are waiting for their freedom. Therefore, only minorities will carry out violent actions. This is the reason we have to see to it that such violent acts cannot be repeated and that they are not so frequent. However, the Palestinian people will welcome it and you will see that the Palestinians will be very enthusiastic when the Israeli Army leaves and, second, when the PLO comes. [Szoelloesi] For a similar reason, that is, in order to prevent a split of the Palestinian people, the PLO also insists that Israel should not only release PLO adherents who are in Israeli prisons, but also Hamas adherents. How far have the negotiations progressed in this respect? [Al-Franji] First of all, this is a very clever attitude of the PLO, so that the Palestinian society is not divided. Second, I think that the Israelis will also have to understand that they cannot achieve peace with the Palestinians if they distinguish between them -- that is, these Palestinians are good, those Palestinians are not good. Hamas has lived in a state of war with Israel for 5 or 6 years, since the establishment of this organization. The PLO has also lived in a state of war with the Israelis for 30 years. If they strive for peace now, they have to win all Palestinians for this peace. Therefore, it is very clever if the Israelis accept the Palestinians' position and also release the imprisoned Hamas members. [Szoelloesi] What will happen if Israel does not do this? [Al-Franji] I hope that they will do it. What will happen? This will, of course, be negative. It will also have a negative influence on the future development. We would simply like to have a certain harmony between all Palestinian groups when we come. When we say that we are striving for a democratic Palestinian society, we mean it and we also do not want to interfere in the Israelis' affairs. The Israelis also have to learn that, according to the treaty that we signed, the Palestinians are a partner with equal rights. That is to say, we, not the Israelis, are responsible for us and for our society. [Szoelloesi] Why has the PLO not yet dispatched a vanguard of Palestinian policemen to the Gaza Strip and Jericho? After all, the Israelis have prepared their withdrawal and are now really beginning to withdraw. Would it not be time now to send someone there as early as now and not to wait any longer? The dispatch was again postponed to Thursday, as I believe. [Al-Franji] Well, I think that one point is also that the Israelis accepted 100 people. This number is not sufficient because here and there, on the Palestinians' side, but also on the Israelis' side, the people who want to disturb this process might take action against these 100 people, who are not armed. If they simply go there without protection -- a pistol is not a weapon -- another action might take place. This would expose the Palestinian authority to ridicule. We do not want this. When we get there, we want this troop to be able to defend itself at least against anybody who plans to disturb this peace process. Therefore, we are trying to convince the Israelis that they should not insist on these small matters. I hope that they will accept it. Some Israelis, above all the Israeli Army, are not yet used to treating the Palestinians as partners with equal rights. [Szoelloesi] Thank you very much, Mr. 'Abdallah al-Franji, PLO representative in Germany.
