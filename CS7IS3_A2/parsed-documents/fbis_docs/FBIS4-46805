Turning to the business of the current, eighth, session of parliament, he noted that in the upcoming six weeks of business the Supreme Council intended to discuss two most important matters: the Constitution of Armenia and the law on elections to the Supreme Council of the Republic of Armenia. He expressed the hope here that parliament would comprehensively consider and discuss all the drafts of the future basic law that had been presented. The speaker observed in this connection that such discussions afforded the opportunity for compromise and that, were difficulties to arise, a conciliation commission, which would study the versions of the draft constitution, would, most likely, be formed. Even if these discussions produce no results, they will at least have been of the nature of a useful debate. Then, having noted a number of serious tasks geared to implementation of economic reforms in the republic that are to be accomplished in the course of the current session, Babken Ararktsyan familiarized the journalists in greater detail with the Supreme Council's upcoming work on the development of interparliamentary relations, detailing the planned visits and meetings. Specifically, a session of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly Council will be held on 8 June in St. Petersburg. The 12 items on the forum's agenda include also the question of a peaceful settlement of the Karabakh conflict, which will be presented by M. Shirimkulov, leader of the assembly's peacekeeping group and chairman of the parliament of Kyrgyzstan. As Mr. Ararktsyan announced, there has been a positive solution of the question of the participation of members of parliament of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic in the discussion of this question, which is in keeping with the letter and spirit of the Bishkek Protocol. He noted also that it is thanks to such forums that the question of a settlement of the Karabakh conflict has acquired a qualitatively new path of solution. At the end of the assembly session the chairman of the Supreme Council of Armenia will at the invitation of Ivan Rybkin, chairman of the State Duma of Russia, leave for an official visit to Moscow. In the course of the visit it is planned to sign an agreement on interparliamentary cooperation and also a number of other important documents. The next plenary session of the parliamentary assembly of the participants in Black Sea Economic Cooperation will take place 20-22 June in Bucharest, and at the start of July a parliamentary delegation of the Republic of Armenia will participate in a session of the CSCE Interparliamentary Assembly in Vienna.
