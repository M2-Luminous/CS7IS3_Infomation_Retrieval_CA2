It is a verdict that conflicts with Albanian public opinion, with the opinion of the European Parliament and of the Interparliamentary Union, and the motion for a resolution proposed by deputies of the Parliamentary Assembly. It is thus a verdict issued by the Democratic Party [PD] in a tight fix, in an attempt to recoup what it has gradually been losing since 22 March [1992 elections]. This is a disaster not only for the PD, but for all Albania and for the solution of Albania's problems, which cannot be settled by political trials but only by wise government for the people, genuine democracy, tolerance, and cooperation and understanding among the political forces. The PD normally makes comparisons with the past when such things are mentioned. Indeed, when one compares society today with totalitarian society, one cannot fail to notice many improvements, but one cannot make such comparisons. Comparisons should be made with the kind of society we want to create, with the principles of democracy, and the experience of European democracies today. In this sense, there are extraordinary violations of human rights, press freedom, and the independence of the judiciary. Fatos Nano's sentence precisely symbolizes these violations. To sentence Fatos Nano means to sentence the free press; to sentence Fatos Nano means to sentence political pluralism; to sentence Fatos Nano means to sentence democracy; sentencing Fatos Nano means that the unemployed will remain out of work for a longer time. People on welfare will remain on welfare, and will then lose it. What do I mean here? I mean that the PD and its government, instead of tackling the extraordinary economic problems, are politicizing the economy and, being unable to solve its problems, are involving themselves in trials such as that of Fatos Nano. Of course, the length of the sentence is quite unimportant to the PS. What is important for us is how long the 900 days until the new elections that Mr. Berisha has announced will last. We think that Albania must hold early elections as soon as possible in order to realize the aspirations of those students who first shouted, "Let us lead Albania to Europe" and "Let us lead Albania to democracy." When Albania sets out on this path, it will not have political prisoners such as Fatos Nano or any other politician. [Brace] What political action will you take? [Dokle] Of course, we do not work in spurts, but have concentrated political activities in every field. As I said before, the sentencing of Fatos Nano means the sentencing of the democratic path in Albania, the violation of human rights, and the violation of the independence of the judiciary. Our future work will therefore consist of a struggle for the respect of human rights and basic freedom, because Aleksander Frangaj and Martin Leka have been sentenced alongside Fatos Nano, and also a struggle to restore the lost independence of the organs of the judiciary. It is not simply the problem of one Fatos Nano, but that Fatos Nano symbolizes something. He symbolizes the scope for democracy in Albania, and the PS's struggle to defend Fatos Nano symbolizes this party's struggle in the defense of fragile Albanian democracy. [Brace] Since you spoke about symbols, you mentioned that Shefqet Beja was the first deputy to oppose the totalitarian methods of the old regime, and that Fatos Nano was the first deputy to oppose the totalitarian methods of Berisha's regime. Shefqet Beja and Fatos Nano are brothers in a single democracy. How would you comment further? [Dokle] It is true that this trial, which lasted one month and produced its verdict today, reminds you precisely of the conviction of the earlier deputy in the years immediately after World War II, because he was the first deputy to oppose the totalitarian tendencies of the new Albanian state. Fatos Nano was the first Albanian deputy to oppose the totalitarian tendencies of Berisha's regime. These tendencies were highlighted in the resolution of the European Parliament, which explicitly states: "While the totalitarianism of the past regime has been dealt a heavy blow, there is a temptation toward authoritarianism that seriously imperils pluralism and the development of democratic processes in Albania." This trial resembled those of the past, and to my mind only the portrait on the wall was missing, because in other respects this trial was the spitting image of those that went before. What were the similarities? For example, Mr. Bendo was the legal master of ceremonies, and his entire verdict was rescued by the testimony of Adil Carcani. He purposely forgot that Adil Carcani was the man who, when the students asked him to remove the name of Enver Hoxha from the university, steadfastly refused, and was apparently obliged to sign the instruction by an order. Agim Bendo takes this man as a witness, a man who amazingly seems to have known nothing about the aid coming to Albania at that time. However, the problem lies deeper, and is not simply that of an individual. In Albania, the 1976 Constitution has been abrogated, but, in the absence of a new constitution, the Civil Code, Penal Code, and Penal Procedure Code all stem from the Stalinist 1976 Constitution, and everything that takes place is conducted in a totalitarian way. This is the greatest evil, because political instructions and orders from above take priority, rather than legal evidence, the evidence of a witness, and the confrontation or arguments. [Brace] Since you mentioned orders from above, do you think that Berish kept his promise of an open and transparent trial, with an independent verdict? [Dokle] This promise, i.e. that Fatos Nano's trial would be open and transparent, was broken when there was a telephone call to Mr. Berisha about a delicate matter connected with the Nano trial, and when the lawyer Sanxhaku, who was to travel to Paris, was held by the police under an order from above. I think that the trial was open but not transparent. It was open because it was held in open court, but this trial lacked transparency. It suffices to mention the fact that, in Fatos Nano's defense session, the prosecutor's case was broadcast is full, and Judge Bendo's verdict was also filmed in full today, while not even 1 percent of Fatos Nano's defense was carried by the radio and television, even when one knows that Fatos Nano remained a deputy enjoying full rights until the day of the verdict. However, the organs of justice and finally the court systematically denied him this right and others that the law guarantees.
