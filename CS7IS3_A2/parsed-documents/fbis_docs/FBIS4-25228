Jiang told the head of the multinational delegation, Philippine parliamentary speaker Jose de Venecia, that the time had come for intensified creative and patient diplomacy to avoid further deterioration of the situation and to ease tensions on the Korean peninsula. China will play "a positive role, not a negative role" in dealing with the crisis, a Philippine embassy press release quoted Jiang as saying. His remarks came as the United Nations started informally debating possible sanctions against North Korea which, amid suspicions that it is developing a nuclear bomb, has refused to allow international inspectors examine crucial parts of its nuclear facitilies. China, one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, has so far rejected the idea of sanctions against Pyongyang which it says would only increase tensions on the Korean peninsula. Jiang's comments were made in response to a proposal by de Valencia for active mediation in the nuclear crisis by China and ASEAN. Meanwhile, Jiang also attempted to allay regional concerns over China's growing military might. China "will not be a threat to its neighbours," Jiang told de Valencia, adding that the 20-percent hike China's national defence budget this year to 52.04 billion yuan (six billion dollars) was the result of inflationary adjustments.
