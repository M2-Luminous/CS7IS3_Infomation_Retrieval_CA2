Kazmin explained that in accordance with the interstate agreement concluded last November, the Central Bank of Russia has granted a cash credit to Tajikistan totalling 120 Bn rubles due to the difficult political and economic situation in the country. "This does not mean that the republic has actually entered "the ruble zone," underlined Kazmin. In his words, the interstate credit has been granted for half a year under the pledge of gold-currency reserves and real estate. The first part of this credit, 30 Bn rubles, was already delivered to Tajikistan in early January, 1994. Kazmin reported that the issue on Tajikistan's entering "the ruble zone" is in the stage of development and it is premature to speak about unification of monetary systems. Tajikistan has already declared its readiness to accept Russia's conditions providing for gradual entering into "the ruble zone of a new type" and intends to use this credit to exchange "old" Russian rubles for "new" ones.
