The visiting governor said that he and his delegation are bringing the friendship of the 38 million people of Yunnan Province to the king and the queen as well as the Cambodian people. Sihanouk said that there has been a very close and deep friendship between the two nations in the past decades, "from the late Chairman Mao, the late Premier Zhou Enlai, to his excellency Deng Xiaoping, President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng." He added that he is proud that even Chinese children "know me and Cambodia." A six-member delegation from the Yunnan Provincial Government led by He Zhiqiang arrived here on Friday [6 May] for a five-day goodwill visit to the country. This has been the second provincial delegation, following Guangdong Province, to visit Cambodia since the royal government was founded last October. He Zhiqiang and the delegation called on Co-Prime Ministers Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen on the day of their arrival and visited the port city of Sihanouk on Saturday. On the rebuilding of Cambodia, Sihanouk said that the Cambodian economy in the 1950s and 1960s was better than that at present. After the 20-year-long war, Cambodia is poor and needs economic and technical assistance from foreign countries, he said. "I am so happy that Cambodia and Yunnan Province will develop economic cooperation, particularly cooperation in agricultural technology," the king said. He called on all parties in Cambodia to do their best to maintain peace and stability in Cambodia, without which foreign investors will hesitate to invest in the country. He Zhiqiang, who is accompanied by 15 businessmen, agreed with what the king said and appreciated his efforts to rebuild Cambodia. He said his province will do its best to help Cambodia in its reconstruction. Cambodia is the first leg of the delegation's three-nation-tour in Southeast Asia. The Chinese guests are scheduled to leave here on Wednesday for Thailand and Burma.
