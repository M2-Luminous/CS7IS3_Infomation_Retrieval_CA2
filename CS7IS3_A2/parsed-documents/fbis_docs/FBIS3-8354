On the contrary. A British paper, THE ECONOMIST, quotes the annual report of the Stockholm International Peace Institute (SIPRI), according to which only light weapons were used in the approximately 30 wars last year. Sophisticated arms systems (such as those used by the Western allies in the Persian Gulf war) are in the arsenal of the armies to divert inimical neighbors from possible intentions to launch an attack. The combat in Bosnia, Azerbaijan, and Angola, as we can see on our television screens, is conducted with light arms, not the most modern ones. Rifles, machine guns, and minesweepers used today may have been used in World War II. Illicit dealers find potential partners in countries of Central and East Europe. These countries are traditional arms producers, and their newly established market economies do not abound with foreign currency. How does the Czech Republic control the export of these goods? Industrial Circles Can Deal With Whomever They Want At present, the government interferes in the negotiation process at a stage where the deal is about to be concluded and not before. In fact, Czech enterprises can negotiate contracts as they want, with the risk that the export license for a specific case may be refused. The state administration is invited in only when the deal is about to be concluded. The affair surrounding the RDP Consortium Group shows where these practices may lead. As of 1 April, a new law on foreign trade in military material, approved by parliament recently, will come into force. According to this law, an enterprise will only be allowed to enter the arms market with a license issued by the Ministry of Industry, which will be issued after consultations with the Foreign Ministry, the Interior Ministry, and the Defense Ministry. The RDP Consortium Group is one of the best known entities on the arms market in the Czech Republic. The weekly RESPEKT no. 8/94 carried information on the intention of the consortium to export, in cooperation with the Skoda factory, military technology, including surface-to-surface missiles and spare parts for T-72 tanks, to Iran--that is, into a politically and militarily very unreliable country. By being reluctant to state their clear opinion on the case, official places have shown that the RDP Group intentions are not something that should be discussed publicly. Vladimir Dlouhy, minister of industry and trade, announced to CTK on 22 February that no one had negotiated the deal, and he refused to comment on it. All of this activity was initiated by Czech industrialists. "The Ministry of Defense will not approve of exports to any country that is politically inappropriate," Defense Minister Antonin Baudys told LIDOVE NOVINY on 4 February on the subject of the possible export of Czech arms to fundamentalist Iran. At the same time, he admitted that industrial circles may negotiate with whomever they want. Lubomir Soudek, director general of the Skoda factory and a member of the RDP Group Presidium, criticized the publicity the case had received and indicated that, if the intentions of the Skoda factory do not materialize, it could cause higher unemployment. Does that mean that the RDP will export the arms to Iran? Dr. Bretislav Gregr is the responsible official from the Ministry of Industry and Trade who decides on granting the final license (in the form of an administrative decision), after preliminary discussion with appropriate ministries. "The problem of the export of heavy arms to Iran is quite hypothetical because the Czech Republic is not a manufacturer of these products. I personally believe that, as long as the situation in Iran remains unchanged, our country will not step out of the line of countries that are carefully considering the possible international impact and will not export military technology to that region," he told LIDOVE NOVINY on 22 February, and he added that he did not expect that he would have to decide the RDP Group proposition in the near future. Nevertheless, should such a situation arise, Dr. Gregr believes that it is "difficult to imagine" that he would give his consent. Wandering Kalashnikovs In Europe, the parties engaged in the Yugoslav conflict feel the shortage of arms of all kinds. Irrespective of the embargo, arms are flowing into the former Yugoslavia from all directions. Estimates for 1993 speak about military material worth some $2 billion. Arms of various origin are being smuggled into former Yugoslavia. They are coming from at least as many countries as there are countries forming the United Nations Protection Force [UNPROFOR]. "It is useless to even ask from where this or that Kalashnikov has come," Canadian Colonel Oehring, commander of the South Sector in Croatia, told LIDOVE NOVINY last week. During the real or faked transactions, the most remote countries can play the role of the country of destination. The Czech Republic could quite easily become a source of arms for the battlefields in Bosnia. A strong enough lobby promoting arms exports could manage it. Can such a pressure group appear in the Czech Republic? "The trade in arms is linked to important financial profits, and this is why it is possible to imagine a situation where the most important arms companies could acquire an increased influence on the state administration (as the signals from the RDP Group have indicated). However, the newly adopted law will be able to sufficiently resist the pressure from possible lobbies," Dr. Gregr says.
