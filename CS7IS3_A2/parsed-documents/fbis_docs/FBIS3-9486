In a statement for the public released on Thursday, Drnovsek accused the defence minister of overstepping his authority and violating the republican constitution and elementary human rights. Political circles in Ljubljana have indicated that Minister Jansa might resort to repressive protection of his office, in which, as assessed, he would have the support of part of the military leadership. The Slovenian police raised the degree of alert of its force on Thursday evening. Jansa is the idol of the Slovenian extreme nationalist right and, as his followers often point out, most deserving for Slovenia's independence which followed a clash with the former Yugoslav People's Army. Several parties, associations, groups of citizens and individuals have demanded the defence minister's resignation over the past few days.
