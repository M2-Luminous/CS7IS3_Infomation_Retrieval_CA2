Along with this attack, Islamic Resistance Movement--Hamas--stated that if the Zionist regime promises to completely halt the massacre of Palestinian civilians, the movement will review its attacks on the Zionist regime's civilian targets. Political observers believe that until recently, the Zionist regime acted unilaterally in massacring the oppressed Palestinians. However, since the time the Islamic Resistance Movement acquired more strength in organizing retaliatory attacks and proved this strength, the heads of the Zionist regime realized that vulnerability is mutual and that the intensification of state terrorism in the occupied territories will engulf the usurping Zionist regime as well. Under such conditions, the proposal by Hamas to completely halt attacks on civilians is opportune and conveys a significant message. Until now the Zionist regime has been able to render several million Palestinians homeless in the land of their forefathers by resorting to direct military and terrorist methods and indirect political-economic pressures; and if the Zionist regime abandons this behavior under the pressure of the crushing blows by the Palestinian martyr-seekers, the Islamic movement in Palestine will have achieved something that Israel has never surrendered to since the outset of its usurping presence. But if the Zionist regime opposes this proposal--and it is more probable that it will--then the aggressive nature of this terrorist regime will be further revealed to those whose hearts are bent on making peace with it.
