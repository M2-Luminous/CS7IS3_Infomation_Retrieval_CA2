The al-Hamra' position came under attack from machine-gun and rocket fire at dawn today. There were no casualties among the personnel manning the position, who returned fire. All this happened in the western sector of the security strip. In the eastern sector, a South Lebanese Army [SLA] patrol in Zummarayya was the target of gunfire and rocket fire from the Hirbaya Hill north of the Zummarayya crossing. The Zummarayya-Hasbayya-'Ayn Qinya axis was bombarded with 120-mm guns from the saboteurs' position in Libbaya. There were no casualties. SLA and Israeli artillery returned the fire. In the Jazzin area, the Taw'amat Niha position came under artillery fire from hostile positions in Mashgharah. Again there were no casualties. Yesterday our correspondent was informed by official military sources that the Israeli army and the SLA forces in the border area have been placed on a higher level of alert during the past few days. This follows expectations that the Nayif Hawatimah-led Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP] will escalate its activities and attempt acts of sabotage in the border area on 28 February, the anniversary of its founding. The sources added that the DFLP has in the past few years tried to intensify its activities on this occasion.
