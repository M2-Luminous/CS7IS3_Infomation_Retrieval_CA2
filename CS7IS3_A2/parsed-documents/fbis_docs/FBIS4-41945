All Estonian citizens should by now hold Estonian passports and older people who have not obtained a new passport should have no difficulties in receiving their benefits as post stations would accept old passports as ID's, Laar said. Laar also said that by September a booklet would be issued for foreigners in Estonia where they can find information on applying for a foreigners' passport, Estonian citizenship, etc.
