They were the first group to enter Gaza under the Israel-PLO agreement signed in Cairo last week. Thousands of Palestinians gathered in Rafah to greet the policemen, who drove across the border in buses and U.S. donated military vehicles. They are headed for Dayr al-Balah, where they will be stationed in the present Civil Administration building. They were wearing olive-green uniforms and berets, and waved Palestinian flags. Qol Yisra'el's correspondent on the spot reports that there is much excitement among the local population seeing the first sign of the transfer of power. Before their arrival, the new Palestinian police commander in Gaza, Nasr Yusuf, held a joint news conference with the IDF's [Israel Defense Forces] Brigadier General Yom-Tov Sami'. Yusuf called it a historic day for the Palestinian people; the first day on the road to their independence. And, he added, we hope to have good relations with all our neighbors. Earlier today, Israeli officials began handing over offices and supplies to Palestinian officials in Jericho. It was the start of a two-day handover. The actual transfer of power is to take place on Thursday [12 May]. The entry of Palestinian police into Jericho is expected tomorrow.
