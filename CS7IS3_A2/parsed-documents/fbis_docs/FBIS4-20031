The horrible apartheid system will finally be buried this April 1994. Germany helped to prepare the elections. In these days, 100 German election observers are at the Cape. For years, we have supported antiapartheid organizations -- with almost 500 million German marks since 1975. At the same time, we always held a critical dialogue with the South African Government. This farsighted policy of the Federal Government is now bearing fruit. In early September I will extend invitations to a conference in Berlin for promotion of the economy in southern Africa. Together with our partners in the European Union, we must and will support South Africa now with a comprehensive relief program in the difficult transition period.
