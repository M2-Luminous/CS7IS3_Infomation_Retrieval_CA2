Russia has not abandoned its gendarme methods. It is setting a deadline for the Chechen state to wind itself up by 13 March 1994, the statement by the Central Electoral Commission of the Chechen Republic says. All this, notes Groznyy's Chechenpress agency, complicates relations between Chechnya and Russia.
