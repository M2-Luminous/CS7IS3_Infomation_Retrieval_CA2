The cable says: The General Council of the General Federation of Workers Union meeting in its fourth session renews to you the pledge of loyalty, affection, and commitment which our working class has believed in and considered a firm course for its struggle, which depends on your generous offers and directives and adheres to the national and pan-Arab constants which you have affirmed and which have been entrenched in our national march and productive process so that Syria under your leadership will be the pioneer of struggle for liberating the occupied Arab territory, restoring usurped rights, and preserving Arab solidarity as the course for mobilizing Arab potentials in face of the challenges threatening the present and future of the Arab nation. Our General Council held deep discussions on the recent Arab and international developments and their repercussions on our people and working class and was in close touch with the successive events. It affirmed its adherence to rights under all circumstances and its readiness for all the proposed possibilities for achieving a just and comprehensive solution without abandoning or conceding any inch of the occupied territory. We recall your words that there is not a single house in Syria which has not lost a martyr in defense of the homeland, the nation, and Arab rights. For the sake of these martyrs and their sons and families we want the peace of the brave; a real, viable peace which will last and guarantee everyone's interests and give everyone his rights. We pledge to interpret your words into action and creative initiative in the field production and services and to improve the standard of our trade union performance in the work sites and in all fields in order to overcome existing hardships. Our working class and its trade unionist organizations are loyal and committed to the course which has been chosen by our party and National Progressive Front under your wise leadership in order to protect national gains and achievements, develop national production in all fields, and safeguard the great generous offer [wage increase] which you granted the sons and daughters of the working class on their world labor day. Our workers will remain loyal soldiers committed to the national and pan-Arab march under your wise and courageous leadership until the achievement of our nation's objectives of unity, freedom, and socialism.
