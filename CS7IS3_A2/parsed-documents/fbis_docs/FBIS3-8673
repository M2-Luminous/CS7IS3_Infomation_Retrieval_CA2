Let me tell you that courage should be shown in the fight against the enemy and the Slovak parliament has not been, is not, and will never be an enemy for me. [long applause] There has been an agreement on technical matters according to which a break is to follow the prime minister's speech. Then the discussion will be about something else. I was therefore, deliberately trying to give time to the members of the government and others to enable them to voice their opinions. [passage omitted] The debate about confidence or no-confidence in the prime minister is a debate about confidence or no-confidence in the government as a whole. It is a problem that is worth discussing at length because it is not about Meciar. This is about the issue of the further strategy of Slovak politics, the further path that Slovakia is to follow--because this strategy is different. And this is a substantial change that will take place. To think disparagingly that this is all about one person is not good enough. The president gave an impulse and started this discussion. This was a purposeful action, not an accidental one. The Slovaks understand the office of president as a symbol of the state--which it really is--as an office for which they have a sacred respect. It must, however, be also understood that the president is an ordinary man, that the Presidential Office is only one among institutions within the system, of the other constitutional institutions of the state, and it is not the most important one. The most important institution is you, the deputies. You elect the president, you have the right to check on him, you have the right to decide whether he will or will not be president. It is your right. You cannot give up this right, whatever the sanctity or deification of the president, at a time when he is against the government and when he acts against the movement in which he used to be its deputy chairman. If you allow me I will not talk about this, but I would like to reminisce. [passage omitted] There are no personal disputes between me and Slovak Republic President Michal Kovac. He is not having an affair with my wife and I do not wish to become a president. What personal disputes can there be between us? [applause and whistling] At the same time, allow me to express my view on his speech [in Slovak Parliament on 9 March, criticizing Meciar]. First of all, assessing the structure of the speech, I would like to say that no one from the Slovak Republic Government took part in its drafting. The president did not ask any one of us to give him information to base his speech on or to help him with it. He did not consult any one of us--it surprised us just as it surprised you--despite our offer, which was repeated several times, to give the president anything that he might need for writing such a speech. The speech was written from the point of view of a presidential system. The letters that the office of the republic [as heard] receives and the statement that 99 percent of the population is dissatisfied with the overall situation [in the country] is not, forgive me for saying so, an objective analysis. The president told you off, told us off, reproached us for passing too many laws, the quality of which is not very good as a result. He positively assessed the work of the prosecutor's offices, he did not have any objections against the government, with the exception of the prime minister, whom he criticized for his working methods, and for his attitude to himself, the person of Michal Kovac. He also criticized the political parties and very mildly also the opposition. [passage omitted] As far as the part of the speech concerning the personal relations between the president and the prime minister is concerned, and not the state of affairs of the Slovak Republic, he [Kovac] bases it on statements allegedly made in one-on-one conversations. What can one do when someone uses such arguments? The only thing to do is not to have any more one-on-one conversations. I refute the statement by the president, according to which I said that we needed State Secretary Ivan Lexa to be appointed minister of privatization so that we could engage in corrupt practices. I refute this. We have never talked about this. Roman Zelenay was present throughout our conversation. But it is not ethical to base one's claim on the testimony of those who are dead. But before Zelenay left the castle, he met several members of the government and told them about the meeting. They are sitting here, you can ask them. The president must be wrong about this. As far as the content of the president's speech is concerned, allow me to say that the president does not have the right to check up on the actions of the Slovak Republic Government, does not have the right to initiate, in any way, a motion of no-confidence in the government or its members, does not have the constitutional initiative, cannot demand the resignation of the prime minister. The president does not have the right to assess the actions of the National Council of the Slovak Republic. He was elected by it and answers to it. The National Council should assess his actions. It is the other way round. You failed to notice this, just because it [the criticism] was aimed against us. [passage omitted] The president calls for political calm and consensus, but, forgive me, if he indirectly appeals to the parliament to pass a vote of no-confidence in the government, then, it seems to me, he does not honestly want the political situation to be calm. Most of you in the opposition understood that he called on you to do that. The president has significantly contributed to the immediate polarization of our society. He does not accept the democratic process and the phenomenon of pluralistic elections, according to which it is not important whether the government has a majority, but what matters is whether the majority allows the government to rule. Norway has a minority government for the third term now and the country is among the most prosperous in Europe. Today, the mechanism of 86 votes is here, according to which you can formally express a vote of no-confidence in the government. This is the reality. As for the issues raised by his speech, it is not only the president who is a constitutional body. You yourselves are a constitutional body and we, the government, are a constitutional body, too. Tell me, where else in the world, in which state are relations between constitutional bodies being solved in this way? Show me another silly place, apart from Slovakia, where things are done like this! Things must not be done like this, for nowhere else are they approached in this way! From time to time there can be clashes between parliaments and government. That is quite normal. There were clashes in Hungary, for example, between the government and the president. But altogether, different ways and means were used to resolve this situation. Things must not be done in this way! As far as another issue is concerned, it was not us who attacked the president in parliament. It was he who has attacked both the prime minister and the chairman of the parliament [Ivan Gasparovic]. My view is that the Constitution does not give the president the political right to express his views on the activities of the cabinet, let alone express his views on the methods of constitutional officials' activities. This assessment is for the electorate to make and early elections would provide an opportunity to make such an assessment. Despite the fact that he declares he is above the parties, in reality he took sides by delivering his speech. I have stated that I have no personal conflicts or misunderstandings with Michal Kovac, I have no personal conflicts with anybody. I have working ones, yes. This happens often in the course of work. As for issues discussed and not discussed, my views on a number of issues differed from those of the president. In the foreign policy sphere there was a lack of coordination between the work of the National Council and the government. In effect, we have spent the whole year asking for this coordination. To this day it has not materialized. We proposed to exchange reports on our [foreign] trips. I suggested that the president provide the government with a report on his trips, so that we could use it as a basis for working toward [concluding] agreements. We did not intend to check things. [passage omitted] We did not receive any reports from his trips at all. I cannot say to what extent these trips were successful, because I was not there, but I do know what happened during my trips. Anyway, this cooperation in our work has been lacking. As to Slovakia's foreign political activity, our views differed on a number of subjects. Former Foreign Affairs Minister Milan Knazko remarked here in the National Council on Lexa's doings in Yugoslavia. Lexa did not go to Yugoslavia, he went to Croatia. I asked him to go there and to cancel the promise of the president, who was then Federal Assembly speaker, that we and Croatia would pursue and coordinate the manufacturing and sale of arms. After taking his up post [as president], the president once again returned to this matter, saying that Austria was to be involved, too. The Austrian press wrote about some of these matters, which were then suspended. Should any doubts arise, then there is a witness whom I instructed to be there. The foreign affairs minister who was then also deputy prime minister [Knazko] knew what [Lexa] would do there. (?He will remember it later). I handed written reports on the subject to the then state secretary [in the Privatization Ministry]. We had different views on the recognition of Taiwan when the president requested in writing that the matter be resolved either by a political or commercial recognition, the upshot being that we would receive $5 million. It happened that a Baltic country took such a step and received in return nothing, but such a thing means immediately a political and international conflict with the Chinese People's Republic. I was fundamentally against taking such a step, although I was not against the president. I wanted the state to acquire dollars, but I did not want the state to be involved in an international conflict and find itself in international isolation. Is this a personal dispute? We equally parted ways in the assessment of our visits to the Czech Republic. After his talks with President Havel, the president returned and asked that we make a settlement amounting to 18.2 billion korunas [Sk] regarding the National Property Fund and Sk24 billion in settling the deficit in the Czech budget. I did not agree. I was not alone when we explained the matter to him at the airport. There were a number of us there. In the end Sk18.2 billion worth of shares came into Slovakia free of charge. The government was right. Regarding the visit to Poland, which you assessed here, only after the president's visit did ministers meet and prepare the draft of an agenda which both sides would then discuss and prepare by the end of March. When you proceed from the premise that such treaties were prepared before that visit, then the answer is that they were not. We did not infringe on anything and behaved correctly towards the president. On the question of the assessment of the visit by President Clinton, I personally assess it as a wasted opportunity. We had 40 minutes for talks. Extensive preparations were made. Before the team President Clinton delegated for the visit to the Slovak Republic arrived, the president issued a statement to the press that Slovakia wanted to be in NATO's political structures. The commission which visited our country understood this to be a counteralternative, a different proposal, and this is why I dissociated myself from it on behalf of the Slovak Republic, because that matter had not been consulted with us. It was a unilateral statement, and after all, we are jointly responsible for foreign policy. An agreement was approved on a joint course of action of the delegation in talks with President Clinton. This was an historic opportunity which would not be repeated; an opportunity to tackle security and economic interests of the Slovak Republic, to tackle issues of cooperation and bilateral relations between the United States and Slovakia. We worked out very many matters, but out of only 40 minutes, 34 were reserved for a one-sided speech which the president, acting as the chairman of the delegation, delivered. How much time then did I get? I asked the foreign minister how much time do I have? He told me five minutes and no more. There were reactions from the American side which were negative in this regard. Twice there was an interruption by a sound signal [as heard]. There was the stance of the foreign minister, the stance of Mrs. Albright, the stance of President Clinton. I was ashamed and I was not alone; we all felt the same in the delegation. This was a wasted opportunity. But why not discuss this matter frankly? I do not wish to cast a doubt.... [pauses] Why were agreements not implemented? We drew up important documents that were key for the Slovak Republic. When will a delegation of the Slovak Republic be received again in such a favorable atmosphere and in such a composition? Regarding matters of protocol, in reality these discussions did not take place on several occasions with the president, but he always was represented by a deputy prime minister. It was either a prime minister or a deputy prime minister. This is not against protocol. The same applies to the chairman of the National Council. It was either he personally, or a deputy chairman of the National Council, who represented the president. We have never permitted ourselves to not show respect to the president and not meet him. But when a visit takes place, for instance, in the course of government's meeting, then a deputy prime minister leaves and the prime minister continues in the government meeting. If by a chance an announcement about the president's departure comes several hours before fundamental questions are to be discussed, during which the prime minister's personal attendance is essential, then a deputy prime minister goes. Is this the reason for parliament to discuss the matter? [passage omitted] Concerning ethnic minorities, the president asked the government for any material relating to ethnic minorities. We were never invited to take part as partners in the roundtable. Only political parties were invited, although the government had a plan ready. We could not accept the situation which had arisen, for example, in connection with the law on place names and surnames which we jointly referred back to the National Council. After a long debate in parliament, I successfully defended the law at the Vienna meeting of Council of Europe representatives, who accepted it. It was very frustrating to learn that the president referred the law back to the National Council for a second time, which he was not constitutionally authorized to do. [passage omitted] The Government of the Slovak Republic is not to be blamed. The same applies to the law on place names and surnames. One concept came up.... [pauses] The Movement for a Democratic Slovakia cannot create alternatives to government policy. It must support it as long as it is in the government and you will do the same when you are in the government. It was not necessary to promise at the round table that an executive body would be set up on a governmental level, because it already exists. The Council for Minorities exists. It is not necessary to talk about the existence or nonexistence of government policy; it is necessary to get to know it. Concerning questions of the relationship with the government, we shall part the veil slightly although we never intended to do so. There were (?talks) with all government members, their loyalty to the prime minister was investigated. For example, at the Ministry of Culture, a discussion took place in March 1993 about the possibility of changing the prime minister in autumn 1993. These talks were also held with other government members. They sit here, they can confirm it if you want to know. It is not the usual way in which the president of the state should go about his business. Only you can decide if I am going to be the prime minister or not and you must not permit anybody to take this right away from you. Concerning personnel issues, I also think that president cannot take over the role of the prime minister by negotiating with ministers about who will leave what ministry for which different ministry. Only I am entitled to make similar proposals. Somebody did not want to respect this right of mine. [passage omitted] Regarding the discussions concerning Lexa, Prokes, and the like. I do not wish to comment on the matter. It is a very poor show. The president has made use of Ivan Lexa's remark that was made in private--and I do not know where and in front of whom it was made. He said that when the president was elected, Slovakia was in shit. Nonetheless, to bring this into the relation with the prime minister and start politicking in parliament because of that private remark, this does not seem to me either tactful or appropriate. As regard the matters concerning relations between Lexa and the president, there were certain problems within the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia. Lexa was right. [laughter] You do not know the details of it and yet you are laughing. This is good. As regards the proposal about Mr Prokes, excuse me but we do have to accept the basic existing institution, which is pluralistic democracy. If there is a government coalition in power, the prime minister can submit only a candidate endorsed by the coalition. And if you form that super-coalition government, then you will not be able to submit any proposal to the president unless a mutual agreement has been reached on it. It is difficult to accept when somebody is approved to the office of deputy prime minister for European integration and at the same time is not approved as a minister of foreign affairs. Why not? After all, he is already member of the government. He is not a new person. Naturally, we did expect some support, rather than conflict regarding this matter. The same applies to Ivan Lexa. If the president did not give me his word and if he did not tell me in front Mr. Gasparovic that he would accept Lexa in the coalition bloc, I would not be have put him forward. He, naturally, said in public that he did not want Prokes. But if, after this public statement, he did not say at the close of our private conversation, that he would take some time to consider the matter and that he would consider his attitude then we (?would have not proposed him). Half an hour after the conversation, his attitude was different. Now he is using that incident for politicking. Excuse me but this was not aimed against the president. If the government is to be formed by the president as he thinks it fit, instead of the coalition in accordance with an agreement mutually arrived at, a functional government cannot be formed. As regards the issues connected with the government, one can have a respect for the office or the person, but the president cannot say in any state that he needs a new government that would be trusted abroad, since this government enjoys confidence abroad. Equally, the president cannot say about the government that it does not strive to be the government of all citizens. The government does not have to be accepted by all citizens, but its conclusions and proposals are binding for all citizens. It is the government of the state. Equally, the president cannot ever say without any evidence that corruption affects the highest quarters. If it is true, why did he not report to the prosecutor general anyone suspected of corruption? If it is not true, then he should apologize to us. We are not thieves. You may have doubts whether we discharge our office in line with your ideas, but we do not steal. When there was any doubt and evidence or suspicion about any member of the government, I always had it investigated. [words indistinct] Equally, the president cannot say the government has lost moral credibility. What immoral things have we done? I want nothing else but evidence. You can judge us if you wish but only in accordance with evidence. Look for evidence. If you do not have it, judge us in accordance with an impression we have made. As regard the accusations that everyone who works for me is somewhat obliged to me regardless of his or her talent, excuse me, this is a gross insult to all those who work with me. I have never obliged anyone but by the promise of hard work. I have never in my life given any advantages above those that are due. I demand from everyone only service to the state, service to the public, not to spare oneself, and to give all. Not everyone has been able to cope with these demands either psychologically, physically, or politically. I got goose pimples when I received, with a great deal of dilemma, the message the president conveyed to me several weeks ago by the speaker of the parliament saying that the president enjoyed the support of the Armed Forces and the police. What for? As regard to the HZDS [Movement for a Democratic Slovakia], you do not like the way deputies have been speaking, that many of them have been reacting with emotions, that they have been reacting to the president's speech differently to how you in the opposition understand it, into whose hands it has inevitably played. This is a political motive. But our attitude is different. After all, he is the man who came from our ranks. He is the man to whom we gave 74 of our votes. He is the man who enjoyed our confidence. He is the man who always declared himself as being my friend and who declared this publicly everywhere he went. As regard the questions of the HZDS attitudes, I ask you chairmen of parliamentary parties, who of you would tolerate a situation in which the president would invite your deputies and say to them that he had his own people in your clubs who report to him, and therefore; he did not need information from you. Who of you would tolerate a situation in which, within your movement, he would hold discussions with your deputies or your party officials asking them to seek another chairman or another prime minister? Among the people who were most frequently in cahoots with him for more than three quarters of the year were Roman Kovac, Jozef Moravcik, and Ivan Laluha too, who was among them for a certain period of time, about three weeks. The president simply cooperated with them within our movement for three quarters of the year. This is simply not a normal state of affairs. Yet this happened. Regarding, attitude to parties, the Constitution says that parties are independent from the state. The president is a representative of the state. The president of the republic cannot interfere in the internal life of a party. Likewise, the state does not have the right to interfere in the internal life parties. Parties are autonomous in this regard. We did not want anything and at the meetings of our leadership, we discussed nothing else but how to curb or prevent such an influence within the movement. As regard the criticism made at the rally in the Park of Culture and Rest, we drew the president's attention to the fact that he was not getting good information about what was going on. We drew his attention to the fact that those who were giving him such information were misleading him. But rallies in the Park of Culture and Rest and other meetings held by the HZDS took place under Havel's and Carnogursky's rule and will take place also under Kovac's. Regarding the crisis we have, it is a crisis of personalities in the parliament. It is not a crisis of the movement. The movement is healthy, ready, and capable of fighting any other party in an honest and democratic fight, in the interest of future cooperation. On questions concerning the concept of the government's activities, there cannot arise a situation, and such a thing does not arise from the Constitution, in which the president would propose his concept of privatization to be incorporated within the government's concept of privatization. This cannot happen. There cannot be a situation under which the government acts in one way in the Fund of National Property while the president acts differently. These are situations which do not stem from him his constitutional duties. The constitution sets boundaries for competences and cooperation among all institutions. If these boundaries are violated, conflicts follow and both violation and conflicts have occurred before you in the parliament. Regarding the state of our society, I permit myself to claim that there does not exist a crisis within the state. There is neither a social nor economic crisis in our society and there has not been a governmental crisis to date either. You have been accusing us of not cooperating enough. But how did we pass laws, if not in cooperation with you? You say that we have been concentrating power in our hands. How can a government, that has had since the very days of assuming office a minority in the parliament, concentrate power in its hands. We have been able to make progress only in cooperation with other parties. The government has never intented to control the judiciary and has not interfered in the powers of the judiciary. We form the government, but only because people elected us in democratic elections. We have not formed the government by cheating. We have not recruited deputies from other parties asking them to vote for us to enable us to form a government. We went honestly into the elections and won the fight and we know that we shall also win every future one. [applause] You say that broad-based cooperation should have been established. This was not possible, not because we did not want it. It is the interests of individual parties that decide such cooperation. What choice did we have? In the run up to the establishment of our new state, the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] did not want to go with us if the Slovak National Party [SNS] was to be our partner, too, and after the establishment of the state, the SDL defined clearly its interest. It aimed at what I regard to be the correct thing and that is it followed its own of political interest, which it is also doing at present. [passage omitted] The Christian Democratic Movement [KDH], too, formed its attitude to the HZDS autonomously and independently. These were not questions relating to the period ending 1 January 93 which have prevented cooperation between our two parties. They were also questions concerning your attitude after 1 January 1993: confrontation with the government, confrontation in localities, inability to cooperate with anyone at the district level, threats to members of the HZDS. You can claim what you want, but that is the picture. If such willingness to cooperate is absent in the party structure as a whole and when your party structure acts in conflict with the government, how can you come to an agreement with it? [passage omitted] I was not imposing confrontation on you. I was asking for cooperation. That is why we are saying as late as today that the limits of cooperation are hard to come by. The situation is similar with regard to the Hungarian parties. The part of their policy which is turning into nationalism, intolerance and which contains hints of irredentism, is unacceptable to us. Regarding the main parts of the policy, it is possible to cooperate with you, but you are clearly not going to give up this part of your policy just because of us. [passage omitted] As regards the relationship which has developed between the president and the government, I am willing to respect the Constitution of the Slovak Republic and I am capable of respecting it. Providing the president acts within the framework of the Constitution, it is possible to forget what has taken place here. If he is not prepared to do so, I propose the following. Taking into account the fact that a conflict has emerged between the leading personalities and that this conflict is damaging to our state, it is to detrimental to our state, [I propose] that the president of the Republic resign and one minute after that I will resign, too. I give you my word on this. I propose that both of us face our citizens openly in elections, and attempt to gain trust and influence. As for the solution to the situation which has emerged today, this situation can never be so clear-cut that it prevents it from being dealt with in various ways. The first fact that exist is that the referendum is underway. The mechanism of the referendum has been set in motion. It has been initiated by citizens and none of us should be indifferent to the fact that 15 percent of the voters were in favor of it. If citizens matter to us and if we hold them in esteem, we should respect their will. Their will says: Let's hold immediate elections. Their will says: Put an end to deputies leaving the parties for which we voted for other parties, because those of you who left will not stay neutral for long. You will end up in Carnogursky's camp. [laughter, applause] You have no other chance! And if your reason for leaving us was to get Duray [chairman of the Hungarian Coexistence movement] and Carnogursky into the government, it is up to you to settle the score with your leadership and with those who put their trust in you. As regards the matter of a referendum, the possible outcome is as follows: Unless elections are held by the end of June a referendum will take place. In the case that the referendum's outcome is positive in favor of changes, its validity excludes the validity of the Constitution, a situation can arise when the current government coalition may have 90 votes at its disposal by the end of June. [sentence as heard] You do not want this but it could happen. You argue that Western Europe is against it. Allow me to inform you that certain circles in Western Europe permit this as a temporary solution. A temporary situation can last for a period of three years, and after three years have elapsed the parliament may change the outcome of the referendum by passing a constitutional law. As regard to further questions put in the referendum--elections and the proof of property--this all is capable of being resolved. To seek a mechanism of how to prevent direct democracy means to choose a new conflict between a representative body and direct democracy, between a representative democracy and direct democracy. This, for God's sake, we cannot permit. The HZDS will therefore not do anything that would question a referendum and the right of citizens to hold such a referendum. Please do not ask this from us. We have come of the people and will return to them even if we are no longer in the government. We will never go against the people. The second possibility that exists is early elections. There were three alternatives of elections. An alternative that elections take place a year hence, although I said that they would not then take place. Then there is the alternative for them to take place in November. This is not acceptable. This would mean that the political crisis would affect all those structures about which I was talking, and that serious damage would be done to the economic, social, international, and political interests of the state. This is why I ask all of you to be in favor of early elections, but in June. It is the state that needs such elections. The Meciar government does not need them. Our readiness to hold elections is the same as yours. [passage omitted] As regards early elections, we regard them as a key democratic process of how to resolve the crisis. In the case that early elections are held by the end of June, then the mechanism of the referendum could not be set in motion. It could not be. As regards the questions connected with what to do next is the question of what to do in the period between today's parliament session and elections. There are several possible alternatives. There is the alternative to which 50 of you subscribed--to pass a motion of no confidence in the government. In that case there will be a new government, and the HZDS as a whole will go into the opposition. Do not expect that any of us will become members of the new government, or that you will manage to persuade any of us to join the new government. Our political bodies have laid down that anyone who would want to attempt this [join the new government] that vote of no confidence be passed against such person and no member of the HZDS can be a member of such a government. There exists an agreement of honor among members of the government that in the event of a motion of no confidence in the government being passed, no one would join the new government. Thus, the vote of no confidence presents a danger that the continuity of the current government's work will be completely lost. There is also a danger that if the referendum at the end of June reinstates our previous numbers in the parliament, we will bring this government back. Do not even think, do not even consider that we would not do this. As regards the options of staying in government, there are three options we consider to be realistic. The first option is to preserve the cabinet in its current form until democratic elections take place. We give our word to the National Council of the Slovak Republic and citizens of the Slovak Republic that we will do everything possible in order to have democratic, free elections and that the cabinet will cope with organizational and technical elements of the campaign in a way that will not be detrimental to anyone's interests. We also assume the obligation to accept a cross-party agreement on what the cabinet will do or not do in the period before the elections, in order not to damage your interests. We are also prepared to accept the third [as heard] option. According to the third option, it is possible to form a three-member coalition--consisting of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS], the Slovak National Party [SNS], and the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL]--providing the offer I am now publicly making to the SDL to participate in the cabinet is accepted. [applause] The following option is not easy because of our relationship with our coalition partner, the SNS, but it is the result of their free decision and their own, free considerations that they do not want to become an obstacle to a wider political agreement. I am unhappy doing this, but I am doing it because I am aware of the political realities: I am also offering the option according to which it would be possible to form a coalition between the HZDS and the SDL, which could be formed immediately on the basis of a reorganization of the cabinet, and does not need to lead to the dismissal of the current cabinet. Such a cabinet would also be considered a temporary cabinet and its main task would be to prepare free and democratic elections for all as soon as possible. I have stated the reasons for our not offering a coalition to other political entities. In Slovakia there is a crisis of democracy, excuse me, a climate of democracy, I should say. [laughter and applause] The government has not acted against anyone for views that were voiced. The only one against whom criminal proceedings were launched in the republic is Ivan Lexa, the state secretary in the Privatization Ministry, for his opinion, which he stated before the election of the president and which he reiterated after the presidential elections. Nobody else is being, or will be prosecuted on the territory of our state by the government. As far as administrative interference is concerned, there was not a single case of interference. While the polemics we pursue are unpleasant, we do not carry out any administrative interference, we do not issue orders or go in for red tape. The arts have been developing freely. Those harboring another approach to the government and those who sometimes overdo things (are still finding the courage) to criticize the government. But that is a matter of taste and for us it is absolutely natural to respect this. Freedom of the press and the freedom of action by political entities is respected. There were no actions against other political entities. In this connection, I would like to point out to the Hungarian political parties that they have signed the draft motion seeking a vote of no confidence in the government along with the very same people who only a few weeks ago called for a strong action in Komarno [where Hungarians called for autonomy] saying that there was a need to use force. If this does not serve as a reminder it does not matter. But do not regret it afterwards. As regard to matters connected with the further development of our political system, at issue is not merely the purity of our society but a climate must inevitably be created, or rather the current climate must be changed in regard to the attitude parties take toward the state and the citizen. The fact that so many people have at present turned indifferently to politics, this my esteemed fellow deputies, represents a common failure of ours, both yours and mine, even if we come out of this best in this respect. Nonetheless, this is a failure. A citizen who is indifferent to public affairs poses the biggest threat to the state. You also have such people among your own voters. This is not merely our own disease. This poses a risk to the state and it cannot go on. To build on the collapse of our society's subconsciousness, the collapse of the interest in politics is not a policy for the future. This is a defeat for the state. Whoever builds on such a premise is himself a loser. Such a person will no longer be able to govern in any other way but with the help of the police. Up to now we did not need to do anything of this kind for we have been enjoying enough of the people's trust. When making up your minds today, think well of what will happen after the elections. Do not create a state of affairs that would make cooperation difficult or even impossible after the elections have taken place. Those of you who are even a bit realistic know that we will win the elections. It does not matter when they take place. Do not draw a conclusion that would create a situation in which today's success paves way to a subsequent failure. I warn you and beg you to heed this advice. Allow me now to express my own personal attitude. Along with my friends and colleagues--whether they are in the government or in our movement--I have achieved what no Slovak has succeeded in achieving in several decades or even centuries. I know none of the Slovak representatives who wanted to achieve a great deal who did not have an easy fate and did not end well. Nonetheless, to think that an office or who is in charge are not important, then when the interest of the nation and the state is at stake, one has to guarantee it also by one's own life and not merely by one's word and one's own position. This is the duty of the person who wants to be at the head of such a great movement. A person who is not prepared for this should not get involved. One cannot distribute rewards in this instance in the form of privatized projects. In such an instance foundations must be laid to prepare the whole of society for the 21st century. A person who does not have such great goals will achieve nothing great. A person who only sees personal interests will be rejected as a person. A person who does not have a program for the development as a whole will perish. Since many of you aspire to get involved and then look at what is ahead, I tell you that apart from the trapdoor of history, there is nothing beyond. One can either sink or swim. All of you who think that there is something beyond--there is nonetheless one great holy thing: To serve all and to give everything that is good as well as bad in us. [sentence as heard] I am a normal person and I have made my own mistakes and have imperfections. I possess some advantages and some shortcomings. Everyone is better as well as worse at something. I have never resisted a factual criticism of what was not good and I have always endeavored to accept proposals that I have heard from you. If there were not many of them that could have been applied, do not blame me. For the past four years I have been the subject of a continual political struggle. It was at one time [then Czechoslovak President] Havel who caused me a headache and now our own president is the instigator. During the past few weeks in this parliament you have been engaged in seeking our dismissal and now you will perhaps once again debate this matter and dismiss us. It is not pleasant to be a continual target of the most dirtiest and the most primitive attacks. It is not pleasant to be the subject of invectives and attacks as well as malicious remarks, some of which lack substance. You are against something that you feel instinctively but which you do not seem to be able to develop. It is not easy to live such a life and to bear such a burden. When I am doing it I am not doing it because I feel the need to be in power; I am not doing because I aspire to power; I am doing it because people have asked me to discharge such a service. I will go to them once more to ask them if they still want me. If they say "yes" to me I will continue to serve. If you believe and stand on the idea of some kind of all embracing human understanding that all parties will be in the government and that calm will prevail everywhere, you will only succeed in bringing the discord that is among you in parliament into the government and into the state structures. You will thus destroy them. This is not such a simple mechanism that could be implemented in such a way. If I fear a coalition that would be confrontational within itself then this is not because I want to hold onto the prime minister's chair. I am merely doing so because we do not want government departments and the state administration to start fighting among themselves. I do not want our society to become Balkanized. I do not want a misunderstanding among people, which has already been sown and which would lead to ethnic, social, or any other conflicts. When I was the prime minister nothing of this kind has happened. Regarding matters concerning the understanding of what constitutes either a democratic or undemocratic management and discharge of state functions, you can have thousands of views on the matter, you can have thousands of standpoints, but results have nonetheless been achieved. Judge me for what I have done. Do not judge me for what you have, what I could have possibly done and what was not possible in a given situation. The situation as it existed in the government lead to us having one single common goal--the burning question of the aspiration of the state. [sentence as heard] With me in the government were people who joined at my invitation and each of whom had to win the trust of our people, and I beg you to treat these people with respect. They have done you no harm and they have given to you and to the state everything they were capable of giving. They have given their health, their own personal interests, their own families. They now have only their own life. They have given all. There are not many such politicians who have willingly given all. Whatever decision you make I am proud that I have been able to work with them. They are honorable people. If I were to form a future government the overwhelming majority of them would be included. Regarding matters connected with present developments and attitudes, one can lose many battles. There is however, in history a time that I call the time of justice, a time that measures each of us. It contains within itself a great truth. In our life we all have been given an equal measure and time itself will judge us. Do not therefore do today anything that would damage the state. Do not be hasty in taking steps in which you would write the government off, only because its members do not come from your ranks. I am so pleased and so proud that you are the parliament of the Slovak Republic as a state. You are its first parliament. I am just as pleased and proud of the fact that this was the first government of this state. If it is at all possible, let us make sure that (departments) of constitutional bodies are coordinated rather than clashing with one another. If it is at all possible, let us impart to people the art of carrying out a civilized dialogue, let us give peace to the country and let us respect its citizens. If possible, let us get united in political diversity where each of us will be able to help revive the socioeconomic system. [passage omitted] If possible, let us look for a path leading to an agreement on the use of the huge potential that the Slovak Republic has. Wasting this opportunity we have would be irresponsible, because it might be thousands of years before another chance come's about. It might never come about. My interest has never been other than the interest of this state. You do not have to agree with me. In fact, it would not be a good idea if you did. I was tough in discussions. You know that I was a winner in the majority of discussion duels. But this should not give you grounds to say I was (nasty) to you. As far as the issues of Slovakia's future are concerned, I will consider myself an optimist if the basic democratic substance of its existence--the free will of citizens--is manifested and maintained. Should this element be suppressed I would consider myself a really big pessimist. I know this state inside out. I know each element in its mechanism, everything we fixed, failed to fix, or resolve. I know where it is heading, I know its potential. I believe in people. It is for them and in the face of them that you should demonstrate your belief. There is never just one solution, but a second, and subsequent solutions, especially on radical matters. Thank you. [applause]
