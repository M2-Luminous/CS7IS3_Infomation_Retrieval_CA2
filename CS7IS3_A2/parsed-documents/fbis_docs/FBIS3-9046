The declaration followed a CSCE request for the installation of CSCE missions in Kosova, Sandjak and Vojvodina. It added that "Yugoslavia cannot allow to be a subject to carry out decisions which it has not approved. It doesn't mean that special missions are not allowed to come, but on the condition that it must be stressed that they are coming to Yugoslavia and not to Kosova, Vojvodina or Sandjak." Ms. Savovic said that they also do not accept the proposal of an independent Swedish foundation that a civil UN administration be installed in Kosova due to human rights violations in the territory. She considered this act as "an attempt to internationalize the Kosova question and to impose a UN protectorate on Yugoslavia".
