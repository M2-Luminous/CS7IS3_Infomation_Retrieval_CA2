The meeting was attended by Deputy Prime Minister Zurab Kervalishvili. The bank's seven representatives and 11 consultants have spent three weeks working in Georgia. Mr (Jonathan Roberts) said their task was to gather full information on the situation in Georgia and report to the bank's board, which is to meet in the first week of July. The conversation outlined the main aspects of the assistance program for Georgia. These include restoring Georgia's energy potential, developing the transport industry and telecommunications. Georgia will receive vital credits if it takes into account World Bank, IMF, and EBRD recommendations which envisage raising tariffs to world levels. It was noted that a number of necessary laws still did not exist. The prime minister thanked guests for their fruitful work and expressed the hope that it would be followed by tangible assistance. Reviving the country's industry depends on the development of power engineering and therefore it should be given special attention. As for the transition to the market economy, it is an irreversible process.
