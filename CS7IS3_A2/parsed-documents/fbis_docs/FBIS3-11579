Producer Mario Aragon predicted March exports will total 60,000 pounds. According to Aragon, producers began exporting cheese when processing plants reduced purchases of milk. As a result, dairy farmers have had fewer losses from surplus milk, production costs have dropped, and profits have risen. Producers say that El Salvador is the best Central American market for cheese. The article also reports that the Hermoso Vijil company has begun exporting typewriter ribbons to Spain, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Near-term exports are expected to total $6 million. The company plans to expand operations to include the manufacture of photocopier material, laser printers, and diskettes.
