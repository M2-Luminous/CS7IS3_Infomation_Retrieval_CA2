The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] can no longer view the world -- unfair though it is -- through the sights on a gun; it is time for it to intelligently and wisely realize its strategic interests -- sovereignty, territorial integrity, and citizens' liberties. Neither the people nor the FRY political leadership will accept any supporters of the war option. This was a chance to ask the deputy federal prime minister just how close we are to peace, what the agreement on the cessation of hostilities recently signed in Geneva means, and what are the things that on one hand bring us closer to, and on the other hand take us farther away from the so desired peace? [Simic] I would like to be extremely direct toward your listeners and would say that we have taken a step forward, because the coming month is going to test the behavior of all three sides involved in the civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, with the clear hope that the Yugoslav leadership is investing in the leadership of the Bosnian Serbs with the hope that it will consistently adhere to the obligations taken in Geneva, and thus show the international public that all of Serbhood [svekoliko Srpstvo] favors peace rather than war, while the Muslim side -- which in the meantime has received immense support, both military and political -- is the side -- and I am now going to quote Mr. Alija Izetbegovic -- that will never agree to peace, but will pursue the realization of its centuries-long dream of creating a fundamentalist state on the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina [sentence as heard]. Therefore, I believe that this is a very important moment -- both tactically and strategically speaking -- for the FRY and for all of Serbhood, since the one-month cease-fire -- under the patronage of UN secretary general's special envoy Yasushi Akashi -- is extremely favorable because it allows the political positions and options of all three sides involved in the war to crystallize, and on the other hand enables the international public opinion to form a balanced attitude toward Yugoslavia, and allows the full expression of the truth about the foreign policy orientation and the Yugoslav leadership's authentic option. [Stojkanovic] The press is reporting that the armed conflicts have been subsiding since the day the cease-fire went into effect, but Alija Izetbegovic has told the Bosnian radio that the Muslims -- if the West does not help them to resolve the situation to their advantage -- will use a secret weapon. He then mentioned the alliance with the Muslim countries against the West. Does this take us farther away from peace? [Simic] No. On the contrary, I believe that in a certain sense this exposes -- the term is perhaps harsh but it is fitting -- Mr. Alija Izetbegovic's position which the West has been covering up for a long time. Therefore, it has been covered up from the very beginning of the civil war, or more precisely, since the Lisbon Conference which was held before the civil war broke out, and when the Muslim side was offered a settlement which was far more favorable than any of the ones that followed. Of course, I am not gloating over this statement, but I assess it as being politically very significant because it exposes the intentions of the Muslim leadership under Alija Izetbegovic, who, using the language of ultimatum, continues to threaten. Moreover, he is now threatening his recent or current allies, in a way that cannot be well received by the international public. [Stojkanovic] Mr. Simic, how would you assess the situation that developed around FRY President Zoran Lilic's statement in Novi Sad, that millions of FRY citizens cannot be hostages of any political leader, either in the FRY, the Srpska republic, or the republic of Serbian Krajina. This statement was later followed by several statements, so we could even say that this statement was to the disadvantage of the Srpska republic negotiating team in Geneva. Is there danger of a conflict developing between the two leaderships -- the Srpska republic one and the FRY? [Simic] FRY President Zoran Lilic's statement was an extremely precise, direct, and I believe, politically extremely wise. There was no way it could damage the Bosnian Serbs' negotiating position in Geneva. In fact, it could only strengthen it, insofar as the problem of the civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina has been artificially connected with Yugoslavia's position. It has been artificially connected with it insofar as the sanctions were imposed on Yugoslavia without any valid reasons. However, if this is the political reality, then we must say that the interests of the people -- therefore, the interests of all of Serbhood -- are above any willful actions of any politician. There can be no comment on this. The fact that the FRY president included himself among the potential people who could -- through their actions -- disturb the strategic goals of both this country and all of Serbhood, speaks for the fact that there was no way that he could have been attempting to fan or inspire any type of conflict. The statement was given principally, with the aim of sobering both the public and certain significant political individuals, warning them that they could not place their personal interests, or even their will, above the interests of primarily one state that has its foundations, that is strong, that will be reborn after the economic revival, that is on the way to being reintegrated into the international community; therefore, no one can play with this.
