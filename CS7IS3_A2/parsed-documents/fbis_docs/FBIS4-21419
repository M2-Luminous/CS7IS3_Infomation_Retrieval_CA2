The schemes will be supported by international financial organizations including the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and Global Environmental Facilities (GEF). Up to $1.2 billion is needed to launch the projects which will treat water and air pollution and dispose of solid waste, said an official from the Foreign Economic Cooperation Office of the National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA). The prevention of acid rain and studies on the environment are also high on the list of the planned projects. NEPA is due to get grants of $200 million to $300 million from GEF to control greenhouse gases and to protect bio-diversity. The agency is now selecting suitable projects around the country. Its reports will be sent to the international organizations for further evaluation. NEPA officials hope the eight projects will solve environmental problems which damage people's health, like pollution in Lake Dianchi in Yunnan Province and Lake Chaohu in Anhui Province. They also hope the projects will check the spread of acid rain in the south of the country. In recent years, China has worked more and more with international organizations on the environment. By the end of last year, NEPA had set up 21 Sino-foreign environmental protection projects. The World Bank and the Asian Development Bank had loaned the agency $1.14 billion by 1993 and together with the GEF, they had granted China $65.61 million for environmental protection and research. The funding helped environmental protections schemes in Shanghai and Liaoning Province, research in Hangzhou Bay and studies on urban infrastructure throughout China. It also helped to promote local environmental protection work and improve NEPA's administrative capacity, said Xie Zhenhua, the agency's director. Cooperation between China and the international agencies has enabled the country to obtain advanced environmental protection facilities and improved its environmental information network.
