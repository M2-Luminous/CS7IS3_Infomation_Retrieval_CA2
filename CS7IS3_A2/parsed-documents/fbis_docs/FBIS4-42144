After he returned to Brussels last night, Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes spoke to Quentin Dickinson: [Begin Claes recording] It seems clear to me that if Algeria does not receive financial and economic aid from the international community, it will find it very difficult to overcome two challenges simultaneously: terrorism as evolved by the fundamentalists on the one hand; and public opinion, which in fact is suffering financially and economically from the consequences of the policy on structural reform. If we want to provide a social safety net, if we want to give a concrete signal to the people that something is starting to move and changing in the right direction, aid has to come from abroad. Otherwise, I really do not see how the Algerian Government can make its program successful. [end recording] [passage omitted]
