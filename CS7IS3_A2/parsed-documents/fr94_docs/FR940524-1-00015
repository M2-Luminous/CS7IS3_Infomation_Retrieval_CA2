FR940524-1-00015 FR940524-1-00005 PART 101&hyph;6_MISCELLANEOUS REGULATIONS 1. The authority citation for 41 CFR part 101&hyph;6 continues to read as follows: Authority: Sec. 205(c), 63 Stat. 390; 40 U.S.C. 486(c). Subpart 101&hyph;6.6_Fire Protection Engineering 2. Subpart 101&hyph;6.6 is added to read as follows: Sec. 101&hyph;6.600␣Scope of subpart. 101&hyph;6.601␣Background. 101&hyph;6.602␣Application. 101&hyph;6.603␣Definitions. 101&hyph;6.604␣Requirements. 101&hyph;6.605␣Responsibility. §101&hyph;6.600 Scope of subpart. This subpart provides the regulations of the General Services Administration (GSA) under title I of the Fire Administration Authorization Act of 1992 concerning definition and determination of equivalent level of safety. §101&hyph;6.601 Background. (a) The Fire Authorization Act of 1992 (Public Law 102&hyph;522) was signed into law by the President on October 26, 1992. Section 106, Fire Safety Systems in Federally Assisted Buildings, of Title I_United States Fire Administration, is commonly referred to as the Federal Fire Safety Act of 1992. This section amends the Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974 (15 U.S.C. 2201 et seq.) to require sprinklers or an equivalent level of safety, in certain types of Federal Employee office buildings, Federal employee housing units, and Federally assisted housing units. (b) The definition of an automatic sprinkler system is unique to the Act. In addition to describing the physical characteristic of an automatic sprinkler system, the definition sets a performance objective for the system. Automatic sprinkler systems installed in compliance with the Act must protect human lives. A functioning sprinkler system should activate prior to the onset of flashover. Sprinklers would provide the level of life safety prescribed in the Act by controlling the spread of fire and its effects beyond the room of origin. (c) This regulation establishes a general measure of building fire safety performance. To achieve the level of life safety proscribed in the Act, the structure under consideration must be designed, constructed, and maintained to minimize the impact of fire. Building environmental conditions are specified in this regulation to ensure the life safety of building occupants outside the room of fire origin. They should be applicable independent of whether or not the evaluation is being conducted for the entire building or for just the hazardous areas. In the latter case, the room of origin would be the hazardous area while any room could be a room of origin in the entire building scenario. (d) The equivalent level of safety regulation does not address property protection, business interruption potential, or firefighter safety. Thorough prefire planning will allow firefighters to choose whether or not to enter a burning building; building occupants do not have a similar option. §101&hyph;6.602 Application. The requirements of the Act and these regulations apply to all Federal agencies and all Federally owned and leased buildings in the United States, except those of the Postal Service and those under the control of the Resolution Trust Corporation. §101&hyph;6.603 Definitions. (a) Qualified fire protection engineer is defined as an individual with a knowledge and understanding of fire dynamics meeting one of the following criteria: (1) An engineer having a Bachelor of Science or Master of Science degree in Fire Protection Engineering from an accredited university engineering program, plus a minimum of two (2) years work experience in fire protection engineering, (2) A professional engineer (P.E.) registered in Fire Protection Engineering, or (3) A professional engineer (P.E.) registered in a related engineering discipline and holding Member grade status in the international Society of Fire Protection Engineers. (b) Flashover means fire conditions in a room where the upper gas layer temperature reaches 600 ○C (1100 ○F) and the heat flux at floor level exceeds 20 kWm2 (1.8 Btu/ft2/sec.). (c) Reasonable worst case fire scenario means a combination of an ignition source, fuel items, and a building location likely to produce a fire which would have a significant adverse impact on the building and its occupants.
