The team of nine ballistic weapons experts received answers to their questions about Iraq's missile programme, UN coordinator Roald Opsahl said here. Opsahl said the team wanted to "check earlier information" on Iraq's missile capacity. The United Nations has banned missiles with a range of more than 150 kilometres (93 miles) in Iraq. The team, led by Frenchman Patrice Palanque, returned to Bahrain Wednesday and will now set up a long-term system to monitor Iraqi weaponry, he said. Another team of four members, led by Briton Gary Dillon, arrived in Iraq Tuesday, Opsahl added. The team is to install surveillance cameras at sites where Iraq could restart its nuclear programme. Meeting UN Security Council Resolution 687 on destroying its weapons of mass destruction is a condition for lifting the UN embargo on Baghdad, imposed when Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990.
