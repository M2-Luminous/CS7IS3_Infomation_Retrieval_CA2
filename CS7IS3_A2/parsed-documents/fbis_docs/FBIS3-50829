He also said that he will submit to Congress a bill on the basic municipalities law in order to give them more autonomy. [Begin Belmont recording] Mayors have the right to submit proposals. We are proposing a much more modern and more expeditious basic law to grant local governments what they have been wanting for years: an opportunity to depoliticize their actions and assume more executive powers, implementing public works programs with their properties and income to benefit neighborhoods. I think that, as the government stated, anything that favors national consensus, such as the government proposal, is an excellent idea, because Peru needs to focus on those things that unite it, not on the few things that divide it.
