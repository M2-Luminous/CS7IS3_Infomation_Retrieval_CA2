Chinese leaders Jiang Zemin and Li Peng have time and again since January this year called for redoubled efforts to increase supplies of vegetables, meat, fish, eggs and other non-staple food, which are common on the shopping lists of urban housewives. The phrase "vegetable basket" program was coined in 1987, when it was designed by the Ministry of Agriculture to increase production and supply of farm produce to meet the growing market demand. As the urban people's vegetable baskets are becoming fuller, however, the program has become so important that it is being used as one of the several important measures by the central government to curb price rises, mainly caused by excessive capital investment in 1992 and 1993. The Chinese leaders have not only urged governments at all levels, at several national meetings this year, to pay more attention to this program, but have also made investigative tours of markets to curb excessive price rises of these products -- increases which caused many complaints by urban residents. During a tour of markets in Beijing on January 19, President Jiang Zemin said that the matter of the "vegetable basket", meaning supply of vegetables and meat, eggs and milk, concerns every household and social stability. He urged officials at all levels for continued efforts to increase production. Just a week later, the State Council, China's cabinet, convened a national meeting on the "vegetable basket" program to boost production. Premier Li Peng told the conference that as the income of the overwhelming majority of Chinese people is relatively low and food consumption constitutes a large proportion of living costs, the prices of food, such as grain and cooking oil, meat and vegetables have considerable influence on people's consumption. The premier concluded that it is important for the government to ensure production and supplies of these products. Li reiterated that the most important job for a mayor is the "vegetable basket" program. The central and municipal governments have taken a number of measures to ensure a steady increase in production of vegetables, meat, milk and other products, such as more investment in production, preventing horticultural land in suburbs from being used for industrial development and reform in marketing networks. Many large and medium-sized cities have set up funds to encourage more cultivated land to be used for vegetable production and to protect the interests of vegetable growers. China's production of vegetables, meat, eggs and milk has been growing steadily over the past seven years since the program was initiated. China last year produced a total of 37.8 million tons of meat, 11 million tons of eggs and 17 million tons of aquatic products, up at least 80 percent over 1987. In addition, the milk output increased by 60 percent and vegetable output jumped by 50 percent to 220 million tons and fruit output was nearly 30 million tons, up 60 percent. The per capita consumption of those products for urban and rural citizens is also on the increase. For example, last year, the per capita average consumption of meat was 32 kg, compared with 18.4 kg seven years ago. On average, a Chinese resident last year consumed 9.3 kg of eggs and 15 kg of aquatic products, while the figures were 5.5 kg and 8.8 kg in 1987. Agricultural production, such as grain, vegetable, meat, eggs and milk, is expected to keep steady growth since initial macro-control progress has been made in China's economy, such as a drop in fixed capital investment, a slow-down of the over-heated real estate market, and protection of arable land. The curbed activities had attracted lots of investment which ought to have gone to agriculture. Therefore, sufficient supplies of grain, vegetables, meat, eggs and milk will mean lower prices of non-staple food, which will in turn contribute to the government's anti-inflation efforts.
