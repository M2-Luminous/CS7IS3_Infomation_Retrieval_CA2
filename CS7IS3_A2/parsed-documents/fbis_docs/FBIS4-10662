During an intervention at the ministerial meeting of the Uruguayan Round of General Accord on Tariffs and Trade [GATT], Cabrisas pointed out that negotiating under the principles of the multilateral system does not seem to be on the U.S. Government's agenda regarding Cuba. He added that the U.S. blockade limits the positive effects of the Uruguayan Round for Cuba by keeping one of the most important markets of the world closed to Cuban exports.
