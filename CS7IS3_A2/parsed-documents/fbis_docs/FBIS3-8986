He also discussed the issue of Sarajevo with Interior Minister Bakir Alispahic. Senada Cumurovic reports. [Cumurovic] After talks with General de Lapresle, Ejup Ganic told journalists what was discussed at the one-hour meeting. [Begin Ganic recording] We informed him that the agreement, the cease-fire, and the disengagement of our Army and the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] forces is functioning in the best possible way, and that conditions are ripening for the Bosniaks and the Croats to return to their homes. The situation is returning to normal in that part of our state. (?At the same time) we pointed out the grave situation in Maglaj where the Serbian aggressor continues to pursue his military aims, and the grave situation in Bihac. Moreover, we pointed to certain events [words indistinct] of Serbian troops in the occupied territories. [end recording] [Cumurovic] As far as the possible negotiations with the Serbian side are concerned, Dr. Ganic mentioned two conditions for these negotiations. [Begin Ganic recording] We are ready to begin negotiations with the Serbian side immediately, providing that they speed up the withdrawal from territories where the Bosniaks were the majority population before the aggression and providing that the international community speeds up the proceedings against war criminals. [end recording] [Cumurovic] The demilitarization of Sarajevo was also discussed with the UNPROFOR commander for former Yugoslavia. [Begin Ganic recording] We informed the general that we agree to the demilitarization of Sarajevo, which is still under blockade, the roads are still blocked, providing that all citizens (?can return to their) homes. [Words indistinct] toward normalization, return of trust, and, of course, the further development of Sarajevo as an undivided city, a single city. [end recording] [Cumurovic] General Bertrand Guillaume de Sauville de Lapresle, who yesterday morning took over command, came to visit Sarajevo today, because he believes -- as he said in his statement -- that there are many reasons that make it important for him to be here. [Begin Lapresle recording in English with superimposed Serbo-Croatian translation] I would say that I have come here so that I could put my professional abilities at the disposal [words indistinct] and help with establishing peace in this country which has suffered so much, and in which I and my troops wish to be of service by working in accordance with political negotiations and aims that would satisfy all the sides in the conflict.
