This seems to be the tone that has been adopted in the new National Secretariat for Provincial and Rural Development, the mission of which is to "raise the standard of living for rural inhabitants at a significantly greater rate than that of the rest of the Bolivian population, and expand the relationship between rural inhabitants and the authorities at all levels." The head of this office, Martha Garcia Ferrufino--the only woman at that level of the Executive Branch--has worked for the last 10 years with peasants in Mizque, Carrasco, Puna, and Tiraque provinces, through the nongovernmental organization [NGO] Center for Agricultural and Livestock Development (Cedeagro), of which she was the director. The interview that follows was carried out in her office at the National Service for Community Development. One's attention is called to the fact that on the walls there are no traditional portraits of leaders of past administrations, but rather maps, papers, and blackboards full of innumerable notes. Her enthusiasm in explaining her plans was only tempered when she remembered her activities in the Cochabamba valley where, she is certain, she will return after fulfilling her new mission. [PRESENCIA] In general terms, what are the objectives of the National Secretariat for Provincial and Rural Development? [Martha Garcia] They involve turning government strategies and policies around toward an environment that is normally forgotten: the rural areas. The provinces are slowly languishing, they have no economic, social, or cultural prospects in the face of the indifference of the city people and the State. I believe that a small space has opened up in this government--that of the Secretariat of Provincial and Rural Development, and of Ethnic, Racial, and Generational Affairs--to be able to resolve, or at least to facilitate, a process of development that brings confidence and energy to the rural population, to be a tool for their future. [PRESENCIA] The distinction between province and community is important. In general, the villages have always had conflicts with the communities, how do you view that? [Martha Garcia] When the President said that we all belong to an ethnic group, he stated a truth. We all belong to an ethnic group--Quechua, Aymara, Guarani, Chiquitana, Mojena, etc.--but also, after 168 years of the Republic, we have another reference, of legal, geographic scope, which is the province. What is in the province? The indigenous-peasant community and the residents of its capital cities and its sections and cantons. But now most of the indigenous groups and peasants have moved to these capitals, because their former employers have been abandoning their family estates. Thus, an almost unified, uniform, and homogenous movement has now developed in the rural area, which does not deny that there must be a level of cooperation between the villages, which are disappearing, and the communities, which look to these small capitals for their economic reference of commercial transactions. [PRESENCIA] How are you carrying out the work? [Martha Garcia] By focusing on what the province is, based on diagnostics made by its own inhabitants, for them to be the first to make a reading of the reality of their corresponding provincial jurisdiction. This means that the inhabitants, at each administrative level, are carrying out a census of their natural resources, to determine how many people are they, who they are, to what culture they belong, where they are located, and what type of production and prospects they have. That is the first thing they should do, to give them the information to also permit them to objectively define what their needs are and develop strategies to respond. I insist that the Secretariat of Rural Development aim to promote activities permitting very flexible proposals to be defined for provincial, global, and also local development in the provinces, beginning with their own inhabitants, and to expand these into the microregions where there are calls for unified efforts to resolve the problems. [PRESENCIA] How will the peasant community become involved in this process, given its diversity and the existence of internal and conflicting authorities within the provinces themselves? [Martha Garcia] One must start with the fact that there is a basic organization in the rural area that must be respected and with which one must cooperate. I am speaking of the ayllu, which is a natural organization; and the peasant syndicate, which is structured and has a hierarchical order. Then, we want to enter in a fashion that is objective and honest, for once, to help resolve the problems of the communities while respecting their structural organizations: ayllus, communal syndicates, subcentrals; in the case of the Guaranis, their assemblies. It is necessary to respond within these contexts, because they have their own ideas of what the local transformation must be and the definition of the services they require. [PRESENCIA] What are the objectives of the Secretariat you are heading, for the next four years? [Martha Garcia] A very dynamic action program will be carried out in the provinces to establish local organizations that will initially be called Provincial Development Councils. The Councils shall be charged with getting political society to work with civil society in each of the provinces. In fact, there already are political authorities (sub-prefectures and mayoralties) and civil authorities, peasant organizations (ayllus or assemblies; unions, and their expression in centrals and sub-centrals), and civic committees. This should permit the design of the provincial development strategy, and the authorities must monitor the process of transforming the education, health, and productive sectors, and provide working guidelines for all the entities doing development work in the provinces. I am referring to the NGO's, Churches, FF.AA [Armed Forces], etc., which must all act according to the same guidelines. Currently, some projects are in a state of chaos; anyone may enter a given geographical environment and establish direct contact, without anyone monitoring them or ensuring compatibility with a global proposal. In summary, the trend is that each province communicate with the authorities to coordinate systems, strategies and control, and even to monitor the different tasks as they are completed, in such a way as to respect the strategy the province itself has laid out, avoiding isolated activities by either public or private entities. [PRESENCIA] In the Executive Branch's new structure, rural areas are divided among three ministries: Human Development, Finance, and Sustainable Development. The latter also has authority over the Institute for Colonization and the National Council for Agrarian Reform. How will your work be compatible? [Martha Garcia] Coordination among the three ministries must be of a complementary nature, of common effort with respect to the strategies that will be designed. Some of them are regulatory in nature, while others support and strengthen the activities that are carried out throughout the entire rural environment, and I repeat that the objective is to serve the provinces, even though there may be differences of focus on what the territory should be, or which actions correspond to cultural expressions, etc. The goal is to respond in an integrated fashion to the needs of the rural inhabitants. I do not believe there will be conflicts, but rather that we will complement each other. [PRESENCIA] But, for example, if the Ministry of Sustainable Development declares a tax reserve in a zone where you have decided to bring new land into production, doesn't that create a conflict between the two? [Martha Garcia] What we are doing is making the proposals compatible and defining what the activities of the three Ministries will be within those zones, which may in fact create conflict. Let us look at the other side. For example, the case of natural resources. The Ministry of Sustainable Development will regulate their use throughout the country, but it is the rural inhabitants who will apply those regulations. But this not only involves conservation, but reproduction of the natural resources in a sustainable fashion. [PRESENCIA] Another potential conflict is between business-agricultural-livestock interests and peasants organized in unions or communities in the same area. How will you address that reality? [Martha Garcia] This is dealt with in the legal area; that is, how the large farmers and ranchers will be treated, as well as the small farmers living in the same zone. For the rest, reality shows significant conflicts in our country: one can see signs of wealth and misery side by side. How to carry out activities in those areas? With respect to our areas of responsibility, this involves small farmers beginning to have a healthier and better consolidated economy, to permit them to live in a more comfortable and modern fashion. The objective--as the minister of Sustainable Development has said--will first be to save the small farmer, to try to resolve the basic problems. Then, serve the large ranchers and farmers. In any case, there will be certain restrictions on everyone--both small and large farmers--particularly with respect to the preservation of natural resources, the forests. Neither large nor small farmers may diminish our national endowment. [PRESENCIA] How do the different secretariats in the Ministry of Human Development coordinate with each other, particularly when several carry out direct activities in the rural area? [Martha Garcia] The secretariats, jointly and in agreement with each other, will design the activities and proposals. Moreover, these will also be agreed upon as an axis with the local participants, particularly in the health, education, and productive sectors. For example, if in the provinces where, together with the local population, we are carrying out work we deem necessary, involving the creation of five school districts, that means the Secretariat of Education should be involved there. What is important is that the definition and geographical coordination of activities be developed locally rather than by the Secretariats. [PRESENCIA] In the area of education, are the proposals of the Educational Reform Support Team and your Secretariat compatible? [Martha Garcia] I believe that the problems are being resolved. The educational reform proposal is being evaluated by all the Secretariats of the Ministry, which are reviewing its defects and weaknesses, but also its successes, based on the recognition that, given the state of the educational system today, we have an obligation to reform it. [PRESENCIA] Many analysts indicate that without large economic investment, the rural standard of living will not improve. How will resources be generated and directed and how will the scale of production of the small farmers be increased if the market is still small? [Martha Garcia] The first market is the rural one, consumption. Our basic objective is to cover the needs of the rural population, and our purpose is to increase production. [PRESENCIA] How will the channeling of resources to the rural areas be organized? [Martha Garcia] I believe that the level of local organization is basic, basic, that is, direct communal participation from diagnosis to problem resolution. That means becoming involved in the peasant economy through productive infrastructure. That leads us to prioritizing the expansion of irrigated land. I am speaking of small projects ranging from rehabilitating irrigation ditches watering between 10 and 60 hectares, to medium projects covering up to 200 hectares. We will follow up implementation of agricultural and livestock programs with technical support, to permit substantial improvement in living conditions and ensure at least increased cash for those communities. The good thing about irrigation systems is that they coordinate different ecological levels. Normally, seed production is carried out at high ecological levels, while irrigation systems are built in the valleys. This means that improved seeds will be produced simultaneously in the high zones and planted in the valley zones, and thus production levels will be improved. [PRESENCIA] Will the money be given as credit or donation? [Martha Garcia] Most of the resources have to come to this country in the form of donation. But they will serve to create a provincial rotating fund that will permit lending for production purposes. It will be a credit that will be managed locally, and we will seek for it to be gradually rotated into a seed bank, which will also be locally managed and administered, which will set an example for saving in the community. [PRESENCIA] Will access to this type of supply be through the community, cooperatives, or families? [Martha Garcia] Community. But within the community individuals, that is, the family, will be respected. Experience shows that both institutions must co-exist: the community, as a level of social control, administration and investment monitoring, and the family, which must ensure efficiency in managing the crops and their relationship with the community. We are speaking of social capitalization, because if the community administers the resources, it should also monitor a level of guaranteed returns, returns that must lead to the generation of surpluses (even if minimum), which can be converted into social capital for the community. In summary, the rotating fund is a credit that normally would be handled in cash. For example, agricultural and livestock warehouses that will initially be co-administered with the community, but which the latter must prepare, and in the future they can administer those resources on their own, while simultaneously acquiring the ability to resolve problems and provide services for production. [PRESENCIA] Does this mean repeating the experience of the Peasant Agricultural Corporation (Coraca)? [Martha Garcia] No. Coraca was administered from the city, not by the community, and it failed because there was no resolution on the part of the community, particularly in the management of its resources. What is now being proposed is to establish cooperation in managing the provincial economy, to make it possible for investment to be defined by the community; that is, for the community to make the request, which will be satisfied through a very well-structured organization within the community, which must exercise social control and have a good level of administration and technology, because it must monitor the management and permanence of those resources. If there is no regular return on investment within the community, then one can only with great difficulty speak of a structural resolution to communal problems. [PRESENCIA] The Secretariat of Provincial and Rural Development is also responsible for relations with peasant organizations. Is it carrying out that activity? [Martha Garcia] I can say that relations with the peasants and Indians will be much more efficient. Until now, there have been only political relations, which have ignored the peasant and Indian bases. Our proposal is to develop relations with the structured bases in the sector with respect to the subcentrals and centrals. The activities will be more direct in the areas where they are located: there will be a more concrete relationship that will resolve all claims that previously were normally handled by hierarchical petitions through the peasant structures. Areas of Extreme Poverty [PRESENCIA] The plan submitted by your Secretariat proposes to serve 60 provinces.... [Martha Garcia] In principle that would be the number, but now we intend to cover 80, because the President requested that we serve all rural provinces, except for the department capitals and the 12 that are under the attention of the Secretariat of Agriculture and Livestock--which reports to the Ministry of Finance--which intends to convert them to intermediate cities. Thus, we will serve 80 of the 108 provinces throughout the country, and approximately 300 sections. [PRESENCIA] What time frames have been defined? [Martha Garcia] Based on different studies, we have determined that approximately 35 provinces already have development proposals. Of the 35, 14 already have organized activities and their proposals for provincial development are already advanced. First, we will attend to those 14, and in 1994, to 24. These provinces are in every department except Pando, which has none at that level of organization. [PRESENCIA] Where are the most depressed areas of the country? [Martha Garcia] Several studies of the poverty levels in the provinces show that most provinces are at a level of poverty or extreme poverty. [PRESENCIA] There is the impression that the standards of living are higher in the east. [Martha Garcia] Yes, but there are exceptions. For example, on a scale of 1 to 100, the Ichilo region rates 77; Sandoval, 60; but Abuna is at 1 and is one of the poorest in the country. Elsewhere, Tapacari has 3; Chayanta 8, and so on. Inefficiency of Contacts Only at Government Headquarters Among its mandates, the Secretariat for Provincial and Rural Development has that of "expanding the relationship between rural inhabitants and the authorities at all levels." That means, among other activities, communicating with the peasant union leaders and agreeing with them on different proposals to carry out. Martha Garcia recognizes that "up to now we have discussed only the formation of the Secretariat with the leaders of the General Trade Union Confederation of Peasant Workers of Bolivia (CSUTCB), which initially accepted it, but we have not laid out definitions. Once the proposal is finished, it will be necessary to discuss it with them, as well as the Secretariat's strategy." She says, however, that the dialogue was developed with the organization that until this week was headed by Paulino Guarachi. But, she comments, "not only in the CSUTCB, but also in the Nationalist Confederation, different political parties are represented, the UCS [Solidarity Civic Union], MNR [Nationalist Revolutionary Movement], etc., and dealing with so many interlocutors here, at government headquarters, is not the most efficient and effective way. So, it is rather at the level of the union centrals, which are the intermediate entities, and the departmental federations, with whom we are trying to arrive at an agreement and jointly define what the strategies will be, because activities now are joint efforts, and are not just on the part of the Secretariat." The Potato, Symbol of the Crisis in the Countryside One product exemplifying the crisis Bolivian peasants are experiencing is the potato. This product, originally from these zones and constituting the main dietary product, is now in a process of genetic degeneration. Martha Garcia explains that low potato production goes back to 1983-84, when there was a severe drought with "rather serious results, forcing the peasants to harvest so intensely that subsequently "there was overproduction of potato, because for other products, the harvest was truly disastrous. But now one cannot even overproduce potatoes. That is, the genetic material in the seeds has deteriorated to such an extent that it has disappeared from almost 60 percent of the community." This means, says Martha Garcia, that "there is no guarantee in the producing communities of their basic foods, which are potato and corn." Thus, she adds, "our greatest concern is to gradually recover this product and try to ensure that the communities can basically produce for their own sustenance. The average current potato yield nationally is 4.5 tons per hectare, compared to a potential average of 20 tons, and the production from a 1/4-hectare parcel can easily be calculated. Thus, one of our objectives is to increase potato production from 4.5 to 5.6 tons per hectare." Exports and Small Farms The current hegemonic trend is to insert ourselves into the international market in a competitive fashion, which among other things, means increasing export levels. This has two direct effects in rural areas: one, the increasing importance of agro-industrial enterprises that produce for export, and two, those who work for these companies are converted into agricultural workers. But most of the peasant population simultaneously maintains its traditions and forms of production, limited by the expansion of small holdings. Given that reality, Martha Garcia says that the Secretariat for Rural and Provincial Development "will try to consolidate and resolve the problems of the small landowner. Issues of salaried agricultural workers will pass over to the Ministry of Labor, because they involve labor relationships." And with respect to small farmers, Garcia explains that this is a structural problem, which "may be resolved only with great difficulty. Surely this problem will be included in the Agriculture Law, in which tenancy and land ownership issues will be defined. What we will do will be to work with those small farmers to ensure them a level of productivity and food subsistence."
