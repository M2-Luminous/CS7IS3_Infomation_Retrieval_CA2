It was a piece of good news that also boosted the prime minister's optimism about successfully concluding Norway's membership negotiations. "This is pleasing. Now I hope we will see rapid progress and a solution for all four countries (Sweden, Finland, Norway, and Austria -- editorial note) within a few days. ``It is of crucial importance that the negotiating tempo is maintained and that all four countries achieve a result. I believe that Norway will also achieve a solution,'' the prime minister said. Shortly before, at his weekly meeting with the press at Christiansborg, he had stressed that it is of crucial importance that the negotiations should succeed. "The words `collapse of the negotiations' do not exist in our dictionary. They will succeed. For the sake of the Nordic countries, for the sake of the EU, and against the background of the future enlargement negotiations with the countries of East Europe," he said. The prime minister said that he would like to see more flexibility in the enlargement negotiations on the part of Spain. "It is necessary that Spain too should understand the consideration that must be given to the Norwegian fish stocks. If the political will exists, the question can be resolved," the prime minister said. [passage omitted]
