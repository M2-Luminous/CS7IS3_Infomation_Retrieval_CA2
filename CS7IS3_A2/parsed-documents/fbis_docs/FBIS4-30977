From our correspondent. Skopje, 24 Apr--Aco Spasovski, secretary of the Macedonian Chamber of Commerce's Department for Economic Policy and Development, claims that economic cooperation between Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] and Slovenia is proceeding without major problems, in spite of the measures that the Macedonian Government introduced for imports of goods from Slovenia. He did add that "minor disagreements" happen in doing business. As we know, in the middle of March Macedonia introduced special 15-percent tax on goods imported from Slovenia. At the same time, it also introduced several additional measures, among which those requiring a mandatory certificate for all goods are particularly important. Macedonian importers can acquire it from the Slovene producer, but it has to be confirmed by the appropriate institution in Macedonia. If it turns out that the goods were not manufactured in Slovenia, the authorities can confiscate or destroy them. All products imported from Slovenia must have labels and all accompanying documentation in the Macedonian language, in Cyrillic. Importers of Slovene goods in Macedonia have already calculated that because of the new measures, the goods will not become 15 percent more expensive, but rather at least 18 to 20 percent, since additional customs duties also have to be added to the taxes introduced by the government. Aco Spasovski is not convinced that with all these measures Macedonia will succeed in reducing the trade deficit that it has in trade with Slovenia. That deficit reportedly amounts to $80-100 million. One could conclude from Aco Spasovski's statements that the Macedonians introduced those measures only in order to get their Slovene partners to abolish the requirements for certificates for Macedonian goods, so that Slovenia would also recognize the documents offered on the origin of goods, and Slovene customs officials would treat goods imported from Macedonia differently. In vino veritas, as the ancient Romans claimed. Macedonian businessmen, in fact, point out that most of the deficit arose because of the Slovene government's protective measures against imports of Macedonian wine. The amounts of Macedonian wine on the Slovene market supposedly declined because of that. Even the first analyses performed in Macedonia showed that things were completely different. In fact, recently Macedonian and Slovene businessmen concluded an agreement according to which Macedonia was supposed to export 15 billion liters of Macedonian wine to Slovenia by June. It is not completely clear, however, whether the Macedonian goods will finally end up on the Slovene market or some other one. On the other hand, Macedonian merchants also have to accept some of the blame. The fact is that those merchants are raising prices uncontrollably for Slovene products, so that those goods are extremely expensive. Since people cannot buy them, large amounts of those goods remain in Macedonian warehouses (it is true, however, that Slovene producers have also not adjusted their prices to the Macedonian market). It is interesting that the Macedonian press is mostly keeping quiet about this Macedonian-Slovene dispute, although it previously wrote enthusiastically about cheap medicines from Slovenia (which undermined the products of the domestic pharmaceutical industry), about expensive Slovene products that they were forced to import because they were not manufactured in Macedonia, and also about the "closed and exploitative Slovene market." There is hope, however, that all these problems will be solved soon. Specifically, a meeting of the joint commission on economic cooperation, proposed by Slovenia, is to be convened soon. The Macedonians, to be sure, expect Slovenia to be the first to take steps. In their opinion, Slovenia ought to take into account the difficult economic situation in Macedonia (previously that country exported 60 percent of its goods to Serbia, and now the border with Greece is also closed), perform a good analysis of the surplus in its favor, and then propose measures that would at least partly coordinate bilateral trade. Members of the Macedonian leadership even think that Macedonia should have certain privileges in trade with Slovenia.
