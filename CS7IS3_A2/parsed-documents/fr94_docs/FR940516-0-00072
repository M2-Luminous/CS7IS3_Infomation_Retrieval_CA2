FR940516-0-00072 FR940516-0-00019 Coast Guard 33 CFR Part 165 [COTP Miami 94&hyph;045] RIN 2115&hyph;AA97 Safety Zone Regulations; Fort Lauderdale, FL AGENCY: Coast Guard, DOT. ACTION: Temporary final rule. SUMMARY: The Coast Guard is establishing a safety zone at Port Everglades, Fort Lauderdale, Florida. This safety zone is needed to protect the Whitbread Round the World Race participant vessels from safety hazards associated with the spectator vessels operating in the area of the Whitbread/Heineken Trophy Village at Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Entry into this zone is prohibited unless authorized by the Captain of the Port, Miami, Florida, or his designated representative. FOR OTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: LT Robert G. Garrott, Port Operations Department, USCG Marine Safety Office, 51 SW. First Avenue, Miami, Florida 33130 (305) 536&hyph;5693. EFFECTIVE DATES: This regulation becomes effective at 11:30 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), April 23, 1994 or upon arrival of the first Whitbread Round the World Race participant vessel. It terminates at 11:30 a.m. (EDT), May 21, 1994 or upon departure of the final Whitbread Round the World Race participant vessel. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking was not published for this regulation and good cause exists for making it effective in less than 30 days after Federal Register publication. Drafting Information The drafters of this regulation are Lieutenant Robert G. Garrott, Project Officer for the Captain of the Port, Miami, Florida, and Lieutenant Jacqueline M. Losego, Project Attorney, Seventh Coast Guard District Legal Office. Discussion of Regulations The event requiring this regulation to be established is the presence of the Whitbread Round the World Race participant vessels at the Whitbread/Heineken Trophy Village. The Trophy Village is located within Port Everglades on the west side of the Atlantic Intercoastal Waterway with its easternmost limits marked by NO WAKE signs. There are significant risks associated with spectator vessels operating in close proximity to the participant vessels. This regulation is issued pursuant to 50 U.S.C. 191 as set out in the authority citation for all of Part 165. Federalism This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that the rule making does not have sufficient Federalism implication to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Environmental Assessment The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this proposal consistent with Section 2.B.2.c of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B and the establishment of safety zones has been determined to be categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. Regulatory Evaluation This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary. The safety zone will only be in effect for such a small area that it is not expected to have a significant impact on any commercial navigation.
