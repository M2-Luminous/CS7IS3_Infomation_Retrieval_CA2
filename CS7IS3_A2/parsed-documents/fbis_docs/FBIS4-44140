"The Southeast is the region of Turkey where most human rights violations occur. Hundreds of mystery murders have been committed in this region and their number is continuing to grow. We receive reports of incidents of torture every day. IHD officials who have been conducting activities in the region are no longer able to do so because of the pressure they face. We no longer have the opportunity to investigate incidents where they occur. According to our findings, migration has taken place because of state oppression and the burning down of villages have been either burnt down or abandoned. The inhabitants of these villages have either emigrated to interior regions or to northern Iraq. Another cause of the migration is the state's approach to these people. People are given three choices: to become village guards, to take to the mountains, or to emigrate. People have chosen the third alternative. Approximately two million people have emigrated to the interior regions of Turkey. Sparks of hatred are carried with each wave of migrants, not the desire for peace. These sparks might start off a fire. This would be a disaster for Turkey. I believe the solution lies in democracy and brotherhood. I observed during my visit that everybody wished to live as equals in brotherhood and peace," Birdal told the TDN [TURKISH DAILY NEWS], commenting on the current violence in the Southeast. Birdal later commented on the official claims that PKK (Workers Party of Kurdistan) oppression had led to migration, saying: "You cannot base policies on lies. There is a great discrepancy between official claims and what the hundreds of people that we have talked to have said. They are the witnesses. We called on deputies to put together a delegation to inspect the region. No one answered our call. The state has to protect its citizens even if the PKK has forced them to migrate. We will oppose all anti-democratic policies. We do not want any tears or any blood shed. These incidents have to end. We have to give our children a democratic world in which they can live like humans."
