Foreign Ministry sources confirmed that, while unexpected visitors decided to leave the Chilean Consulate in Havana yesterday, almost 60 of those who remained inside the Belgian ambassador's residence under similar conditions have already voluntarily returned to their homes. The departure of those who forcibly entered the two missions obviously responded to the certainty that the Cuban decision, which is meant to prevent actions of this type from replacing the legal procedures used to leave the country, will not change. In addition, the Cuban Government thought that this policy was the most appropriate measure to protect the properties of the diplomatic corps in Cuba from the use of violence against them, in keeping with obligations established in international conventions. The situation inside the Belgian residence, according to the information disclosed, points to increasing discouragement among those who remain inside and leads one to the belief that members of the group that entered the residence on 28 May will continue leaving. The internal order at the occupied residence is currently under the responsibility of specialized Belgian personnel following media reports, sent even from Brussels, that revealed a verbal confrontation between some of the occupiers and the Belgian representatives. Meanwhile, 21 persons are living in the German Embassy. These 21 persons, who entered the embassy after stealing a truck and ramming it against the fence surrounding the building, will have to answer for this crime once they leave the mission, according to statements by the Cuban Government. As the number of people who have decided to leave other delegations increases, so does the isolation of those remaining at the German Embassy. Judging from this situation, everything indicates that this episode involving the violation of the immunity of diplomatic missions could be coming to an end sooner rather than later. These actions began a few weeks ago, and Cubans believe they were basically inspired by a permanent U.S. hostility against Cuba.
