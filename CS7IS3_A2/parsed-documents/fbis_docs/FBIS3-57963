Ciampi, who has no official political affiliation, opened the consultations meeting a delegation from the Christian Democrat Party, headed by party secretary Mino Martinazzoli and including Parliament whips Gerardo Bianco and Gabriele De Rosa. The premier then met with the Socialist delegation, led by secretary Ottavio Del Turco, who reiterated his party's support for Ciampi, and then the delegation from the Liberal Party, from which secretary Raffaelle Costa bowed out given that he is a member of the government, responsible for transportation. Ciampi is slated to meet later in the day with the Social Democrats, European Federalists, the Democratic Party of the Left (PDS), Northern League and the Republicans. Consultations will continue tomorrow with meetings with the Greens, Communists, the neo-fascist MSI [Italian Social Movement], Network, SVP [South Tirol People's Party] and the UV [Valdostan Union]. The Christian Democrats held a press conference after meeting with Ciampi and stressed the need not to rush into early political elections. Martinazzoli ruled out the hypothesis of linking general political elections with those for the European parliament, to be held in June. He said it was necessary to "hold early elections in the spring" and then stressed the importance of first passing several key bills before parliament. Whether or not Ciampi's government can count on a majority in parliament will be verified in the parliament during the debate, Martinazzoli added, and said the Christian Democrats would not be alone in backing Ciampi. Among the key bills which Martinazzoli felt should be passed before early elections were those dealing with the right to vote for Italians abroad, the [Justice Minister] Conso bill on preventive custody and two bills linked with the government's economic and finance policy.
