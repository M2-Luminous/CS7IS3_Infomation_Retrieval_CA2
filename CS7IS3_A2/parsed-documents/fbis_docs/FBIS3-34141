Our correspondent has obtained secret documents in which the coup's initiators offer tremendous incentives to Israelis who will invest money in financing the revolution. They also promised $15 million in exchange for engineering the coup. In a world of dubious business dealings, even bizarre schemes like this can sometimes be true. Therefore, a business venture seeking investors in a revolution should also be taken seriously. In the situation which has now arisen, Israelis may find themselves facing each other on the battlefield. In an attempt to maintain maximum secrecy, a representative of the underground in Congo-Brazzaville, sent a facsimile from Montreal, Canada explaining the offer to a senior Israeli reserves officer. Israel television is keeping the man's identity secret. The representative identifies himself as a political figure, with a PhD. He is looking for military experts in Israel who will be willing to carry out a coup for $15 million. He is also proposing that Israeli investors finance the revolution in return for huge incentives which include, he claims, diamond and gold mining rights in western Congo as well as 100 percent interest on their money. The payment of course will be made after the revolution and after the rebels take control of Congo's banks and foreign currency reserves. The Congolese doctor includes maps in his proposal in which he marks out the areas under the control of his supporters, the areas controlled by the government, and the areas controlled by the prime minister's men. He notes that the Israeli embassy in Congo is aware of the underground's strength and capabilities. The situation becomes more complex when one recalls that Israelis are already involved in the training and equipping of the Congolese security forces. This involvement is the private initiative of a public investment firm, known as Carden Investments, whose offices are situated in Ramat Gan. A Carden subsidiary, Levran, recruited dozens of army officers and veterans of the Israeli security forces and sent them to Congo. Carden claims that it received the Defense Ministry's authorization to implement the deal. As reported by YEDI'OT AHARONOT, the head of the company is reserves Brigadier General Ze'ev Zakharin, who is considered an expert in training foreign armies. If the new revolution initiative takes off, Israelis may find themselves at war with each other in Congo with one group helping the government's forces and the other plotting to overthrow the Congolese Government. If such a situation indeed comes to pass, it may have serious political and ethical ramifications at the very least. [In the same broadcast, Jerusalem Israel Television Channel 1 Network in Hebrew adds that "there were many reactions to this evening's report on the involvement of Israelis in plans for a revolution in Congo. The Knesset State Audit Committee will convene again to hold a detailed discussion about the actions of the Israeli Embassy in Congo. Knesset Member [MK] Dan Tikhon, the committee's chairman, said that clear rules should be set with regard to defense related exports. Tikhon expressed fears that this would be a repeat of the Colombia affair [in which an Israeli company trained Colombian farmers suspected of belonging to a drug cartel]. Likud MK Silvan Shalom submitted an urgent motion to the agenda in which he demanded that Yitzhaq Rabin, the prime minister and defense minister, explain whether Israel had sent official advisers to Congo. Shalom also demanded that Rabin explain how reserve army officers, working for a private company, had received permission to leave for Congo to establish special units to support the regime there. In the wake of these revelations, Likud MK Avraham Herschson submitted an urgent motion to the agenda demanding that the defense minister investigate whether reserve Army officers or businessmen had any intention of accepting the proposal to finance or carry out a coup in Congo."]
