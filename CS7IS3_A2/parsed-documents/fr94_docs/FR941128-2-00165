The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. I. Self-Regulatory Organizations' Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Changes The proposed rule changes filed by the Amex and PHLX extend for six months ( i.e., from November 17, 1994, to May 17, 1995) the Exchanges' pilot programs for exemptions from equity position limits for certain hedged positions. 1 The proposals filed by the CBOE and the PSE extend for six months ( i.e., from November 17, 1994, to May 17, 1995), the Exchanges' pilot programs for position limit exemptions for certain hedged equity option positions and certain stock index option positions. 1 Position limits impose a ceiling on the aggregate number of options contracts on the same side of the market that can be held or written by an investor or group of investors acting on concert. The text of the proposals are available at the Office of the Secretary of the respective Exchanges and at the Commission. II. Self-Regulatory Organizations' Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Changes In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organizations included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule changes and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule changes. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organizations have prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. (A) Self-Regulatory Organizations' Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Changes The Commission has previously approved pilot programs by the Amex and the PHLX providing exemptions from position limits for certain fully hedged equity option positions. 2 In addition, the Commission has previously approved pilot programs proposed by the CBOE, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc., and the PSE providing exemptions from position limits for certain fully hedged equity option positions and/or stock index option positions. 3 Each of the pilot programs allow the underlying hedged positions to include securities that are readily convertible into common stock. 4 Under all of the pilot programs, exercise limits continue to correspond to position limits, so that investors are allowed to exercise, during five consecutive business days, the number of option contracts set forth as the position limit, as well as those contracts purchased pursuant to the pilot program. 5 2 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 25738 (May 24, 1988), 53 20201 (June 2, 1988). 3 See Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 25738 (May 24, 1988), 53 FR 20201 (June 2, 1988) (order approving CBOE's equity option hedge exemption pilot programs); 25739 (May 24, 1988(, 53 FR 20204 (June 2, 1988) (approving CBOE's stock index option hedge exemption pilot program); 27786 (March 8, 1990), 55 FR 9523 (March 14, 1990) (order approving NYSE's equity option and stock index option hedge exemption pilot programs); 25811 (June 20, 1988), 53 FR 23821 (June 24, 1988) (order approving PSE'e equity option hedge exemption pilot program); and 32900 (September 14, 1993), 58 FR 49077 (September 21, 1993) (order approving PSE's stock index option hedge exemption pilot program). 4 The Commission expects the Exchanges to determine on a case-by-case basis whether an instrument that is being used as the basis for an underlying hedged position is readily and immediately convertible into a security that is convertible at a future date, but which is not presently convertible, is not a ``convertible'' security for purposes of the equity option position limit hedge exemption until the date it becomes convertible. In addition, if the convertible security used to hedge an options position is called for redemption by the issuer, the security would have to be converted into the underlying security immediately or the corresponding options position reduced accordingly. See, e.g., Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32904 (September 14, 1993), 58 FR 49339. 5 Exercise limits prohibit the exercise by an investor or group of investors acting in concert of more than the number of options contracts specified in the position limit rule within five consecutive business days.
