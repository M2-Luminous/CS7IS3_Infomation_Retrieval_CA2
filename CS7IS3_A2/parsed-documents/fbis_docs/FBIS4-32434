Peto believes that, if the agreement is signed, the conventions of the two parties will, in all probability, approve it. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] On the basis of various newspaper reports, it was expected that the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] would have eight and the SZDSZ four ministries in the new government. In view of the agreement reached on 20 June, do you think that the negotiating delegation managed to obtain adequate guarantees for the SZDSZ when the ministries were allocated? [Peto] This agreement is not yet final, so the time has not yet come for drawing a balance. Many people believe that the coalition bargaining consists only of allocating ministries. However, in addition to this, we also have to agree on issues in connection with the government's order of business and on issues of guarantees. We also have to reach an agreement on issues of content because the policies of the coalition government will depend on these. Those who believe that the coalition agreement is purely a mathematical operation are wrong. I find it unfortunate if the starting point for someone is whether we get three or four ministries. It has to be remembered, for example, that the various ministries have different levels of influence on society's life. The agreement whose framework is being outlined will, in my view, ensure a decent position for the SZDSZ, the smaller coalition partner within the government. As a result of the planned coalition agreement, the SZDSZ will have a serious influence on the whole work of government, rather than only on the operation of certain ministries. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] The party's convention on 26 June will have to approve the coalition agreement. Do you expect serious internal debates within the SZDSZ on accepting the agreement? [Peto] As far as I know, we have also managed to assert a large proportion of our views in the special committees. On the basis of this, I can state that we did not only meet but actually exceeded the expectations of the convention that had empowered us to enter into the coalition talks. I am certain that we will have debates at the convention and at the 25 June meeting of the National Council, but if we sign the agreement, the deputies will most probably approve it. At the moment, there is a limited chance for debating this issue in the party because the contents of the final agreement cannot yet be known. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Together with MSZP Chairman Gyula Horn, you emphasized that the agreement on dividing up the ministries is not yet final. Do you think that serious changes are possible compared with what was published after the talks on 20 June? [Peto] I do not see the coalition talks as closed because we still have to agree on issues of content. Serious debates can be expected in connection with this at today's session of the main delegations because many questions are waiting to be clarified. As for the ministries, some changes are still possible but this will not necessarily affect the proportions. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Is there a chance for agreeing on the supervision of the National Security Office? [Peto] The views of the two parties have become closer on this point, too, and the outlines of a compromise solution are emerging. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] When and at what forum will you decide who should fill the SZDSZ's government posts? [Peto] Naturally, we have for a long time had ideas about whom we would like to nominate for the various government posts. The executive body will make the final decision once the full agreement is known.
