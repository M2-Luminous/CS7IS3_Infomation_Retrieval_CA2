They commented on an article in Sunday's Japanese newspaper MAINICHI that the United States and Japan conducted exercises codenamed C-1, C-2 and C-3, during which representatives of the Pentagon and the Japanese Defence Agency annually drafted plans for invading the Russian Maritime Territory, the South Kurils and Sakhalin. In the opinion of Russian experts, the article does not reflect present-day realities. The world has changed, as has the nature of relations between countries. For instance, Russia and the United States will stage a joint exercise with beaching a landing party. Russian-Japanese contacts have also become more active. They became more open and trustworthy. Russia has adequate forces to protect its Far East both from land and sea, representatives of the Russian chief naval staff claimed.
