In an interview with LE MONDE, he supports the idea of a Pact of Stability for Europe proposed by [French Prime Minister] Balladur but hopes that it will also become a springboard for the expansion of the EU to the former Socialist countries. [passage omitted] Not enjoying the prestige of its Czech neighbor, easily identified with its charismatic President Vaclav Havel, Slovakia nonetheless demonstrated a reassuring responsibility during the political crisis at the beginning of the year that brought down Vladimir Meciar. Just two days after his departure, a broad coalition ranging from Catholic conservatives to former communists was formed under the leadership of Mr. Moravcik to lead the country to the parliamentary elections, which have been brought forward to September. "We have succeeded in calming the political debate," he said, "and we hope that the extremist factions will be gradually marginalized." Man of Compromise One of the main issues in this easing of tension desired by Bratislava relates to the normalization of relations with neighboring Hungary. Since the fall of the communist regimes in these two countries, relations have deteriorated, especially through the controversy over the large Hungarian minority in Slovakia (600,000 people, 11 percent of the population). This controversy is at the heart of the concerns of the Stability Pact proposed by Mr. Balladur. And, in the run-up to the conference on this project in Paris on 26 and 27 May, Mr. Moravcik will come to explain to the French officials that he does not have either the Hungarians' sustained interest nor the Czechs' strong reservations toward this diplomatic initiative. Faithful to his image as a man of compromise, the Slovak prime minister welcomes an initiative that "could provide a framework for the problem of minorities. And the solutions proposed could then be included in bilateral treaties." But this project, drawn up in the wake of the trauma created by the Yugoslav war, could not, in Jozef Moravcik's view, "be limited to just the question of minorities." He stressed that "the stability of the postcommunist countries also depends on their economic development and the future integration into the EU." In saying this, he was echoing a criticism that is increasingly heard among the Central European countries, which are irritated by the uncertainties surrounding the process of integration into the EU and by the Twelve's protectionism. This bitterness is particularly strong because East-West trade has been very imbalanced in favor of the EU since the end of communism. Mr. Moravcik is therefore suggesting that the Stability Pact should go further than its initial framework and become "a positive contribution to the definition of a timetable and criteria making it possible for our countries to prepare for their integration into Europe." In other words, he is stressing that the states of Central Europe are perfectly aware that their rapprochement with the EU depends on a settlement of their historical disputes but that, by limiting itself to this one objective, the Balladur plan loses much of its justification. This is an argument that is also put forward by the Poles, who think they are no longer concerned by the Stability Pact because they have already concluded treaties of friendship with their neighbors, especially the Ukrainians and the Lithuanians. With regard to the Hungarian-Slovak dispute, Mr. Moravcik hinted that Bratislava and Budapest can solve this problem themselves without the arbitration of a multilateral body. As a sign of this new desire for compromise, the Slovak Parliament adopted one of the Council of Europe's two recommendations relating to the use of Hungarian names in Slovakia at the end of April. And, on Tuesday, 10 May, Moravcik's government gave the go-ahead to the other recommendation on bilingual signs in the communes in which large numbers of Hungarians live. In addition, the Socialists and the Liberals, who were in the lead after the first round of parliamentary elections in Hungary, have several times expressed their desire to reach a "historic reconciliation" with the neighboring countries. "The improvement in our relations with Hungary is one of our priorities," the head of the Slovak Government stressed. "We want to conclude a bilateral treaty as quickly as possible." The atmosphere is now clearly more favorable to easing tension. But the main obstacle still has to be overcome: recognition of the inviolability of borders. This is a clause that Hungary has so far always refused to include in a treaty with Slovakia and Romania, arguing that such a pledge had already been given in the framework of the 1947 Paris Treaty and the 1975 Helsinki Agreements. Before envisaging such a declaration on borders, Budapest wants to secure guarantees on the rights of the Hungarian minorities in these two countries. Even though the rapid conclusion of this dispute seems difficult, there is nonetheless a concern to create a new climate of confidence. Jozef Moravcik therefore wants to initiate an "impetus for peace" that is sufficiently strong to withstand electoral changes. Indeed, there is nothing to say that his government will still be at the helm after the September parliamentary elections. The opinion polls are still giving the lead to Vladimir Meciar.
