Serious riots erupted in Nabulus this morning, and our correspondent Moti Amir reports that 15 locals were wounded and a soldier was lightly injured by a stone. The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] has clamped a curfew on the city, as well as on the adjacent refugee camps. Brigadier General Doron Almog, commander of IDF troops in the Gaza Strip, has been trying to calm down the situation. He phoned several Fatah leaders in the area this morning to explain the circumstances of the shooting of six armed Fatah members who aimed their weapons at the soldiers. The six victims were buried late last night in the Jabalyah refugee camp. This morning a curfew was clamped on the camp, as well as on Bayt Lahiyah and adjacent areas. A 24-hour general strike called by Fatah is being observed today in the Gaza Strip. Several stonethrowing incidents occurred near the homes of the mourning families. Locals claim that soldiers tried to prevent them from putting up shacks to accommodate the mourners.
