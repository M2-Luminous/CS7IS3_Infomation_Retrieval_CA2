The decision was made at a meeting of the Korea Federation of University Student Unions (Hanchongnyon), called to set a course of action for unification and other political "struggles" this year. Hanchongnyon, led by its Chairman Kim Hyon-chun of Pusan University, said that the North has adopted a flexible and firm strategy and "efficiently destroyed a scheme by the United States and imperialists to isolate North Korea despite adverse international conditions against it since announcing its intention to leave the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty." "It appears that North Korea could get a firm reply from the United States for the improvement of relations (with Washington) and receive (U.S.) assistance including light-water nuclear reactors," it said. "Such a resolution (of the nuclear problem) means normalization of U.S.-North Korean ties," it said. Hanchongnyon's statement is being read as an indication that leftist student activists intend to adopt the "anti-U.S., pro-North Korean policy" of past student movements despite the recent threat of war by Pyongyang.
