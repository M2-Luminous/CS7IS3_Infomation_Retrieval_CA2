The Republic of Macedonia, an independent country and a member of the United Nations, is deeply interested in constructing relations and cooperation with all its neighbors on the basis of good neighborliness and in the interest of peace and stability in the region. In that sense, we are interested in a broader development of relations and cooperation with the neighboring Republic of Greece, which is of multifold interest to both sides. For that sake, we are encouraged to do our best to create conditions for the normalization of our mutual relations in a principled way and on the basis of equality, as a lasting interest for both countries, and of a larger significance. On this occasion, I would like to reiterate our readiness to sign an agreement with your country guaranteeing the existing borders between the two countries. If necessary, we are ready to accept the United Nations or the European Union as guarantors of this agreement. We support the idea of resuming a dialogue between our two countries as soon as possible, without any previous conditions, on the mutual relations and questions of dissent between us, including the use of the symbols, the name, and so on. That dialogue should continue within the framework of the United Nations and with the mediation of Mr. Cyrus Vance. We are ready to involve all necessary efforts to reach adequate and mutually acceptable solutions to the existing problems. Moreover, we highly appreciate the engagement of the European Union, as well as the promptness of other international factors, in finding the best solutions within the framework of the mentioned dialogue. Therefore, I extend a proposal for a meeting between the foreign ministers of our two countries in one of the European capitals, which will function as a dialogue between the two countries. Mr. Prime Minister, I would particularly like to express our concern about the situation created after the measures undertaken by your government on 16 February this year in relation to our country. The sustenance and the continuation of this situation will cause undesired consequences for the peace and stability in this part of the Balkans, which will undoubtedly lead us to turn to the Security Council. Moreover, due to the European dimension of the problem, the engagement of the CSCE will be indispensable. I firmly believe that, due to the seriousness of all these issues and the responsibility we are bearing, a way for their fast settlement will be found, on a principled and lasting basis, and in the interests of our two countries and peoples. With respect, Kiro Gligorov
