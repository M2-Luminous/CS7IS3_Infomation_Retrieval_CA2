The residents of the community are officers and civilian workers who, by residing there along with their relatives, contribute to raising the combat readiness of their unit. Castro, who is also second secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba, asked about the living conditions of the residents of (El Jobero), who have, among other facilities, a Family Doctor Program physician and other services nearby. Also, in Cumanayagua, the FAR minister visited the Barajagua People's Council, one of Cienfuegos' most outstanding; and, at the special troops regiment, heard a report from Colonel Jose Antonio Marrero on the unit's preparation and combat readiness. Upon taking his leave, Raul reiterated that we can be proud of our four armies -- the Central, the Western, the Eastern, and the Youth Labor Army; of our Revolutionary Armed Forces; of our heroic people; and of our commander in chief, Fidel Castro.
