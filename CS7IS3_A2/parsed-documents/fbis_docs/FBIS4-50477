The bold policy, originally scheduled to come into effect in July, meant that business units in the zone, including state-owned concerns, would no longer be the sub-ordinate adjuncts of government departments. The reform was designed by the State Commission for the Reform of the Economic Structure as a way to help Shenzhen reclaim its status as the pace-setter for market reforms. After having been taken out of the control of government departments, the enterprises would become autonomous entities in keeping with international norms. The Special Economic Zone leadership, however, has faced intense opposition from bureaucrats from both local and central government units. During recent meetings called by the municipal party and government leadership, the bureaucrats claimed that severing their links with the enterprises would lead to chaos and "misguided decisions". Municipal officials said privately, however, they expected the new measure to go through later this year. Under the proposal, the "liberalised" enterprises would only be subjected to a "social supervision regime" that includes regular inspections by tax and auditing departments. "The original schedule is for the measure to be enacted into law by the Shenzhen legislature in the summer," a Shenzhen source said. "Bureaucrats who oppose the reform say their power and even rice bowl will be threatened if they can no longer exercise control over the enterprises." Analysts said Mayor Li Youwei, who favours the reform, was up against a national wave of fiscal conservatism, which manifested itself in new calls for boosting Beijing's macro-level control over the economy. Under the existing system, state-owned enterprises and collectives are assigned as subordinate units to different ministries and bureaus, whose permission is necessary for activities ranging from production to sales. If approved, the new system will also see a much lower level of authority and activities for Communist Party units in enterprises. It is understood Shenzhen has been lobbying Beijing for other autonomous powers, including the conversion of the entire zone into a bonded area and the limited circulation of Hong Kong and other currencies. Shenzhen sources said its leaders hoped the local economy would be rendered "totally market-oriented" in 10 years in order to facilitate the economic integration between the SEZ and Hong Kong. The leaders told Beijing recently that Shenzhen was best equipped to lead the nation in experimenting with reforms.
