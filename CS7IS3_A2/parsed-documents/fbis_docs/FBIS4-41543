This task was set at the third congress of the "Union" popular movement [narodnoye dvizheniye "Soyuz"], held today at the Russian Federation parliamentary center. The movement was set up in December 1990 on the basis of the "Union" group of deputies, which advocated the preservation of a centralized unitarian state and "emergency measures to steer the country out of crisis." Its second congress was held in April 1991, so the present forum was the first since the breakup of the USSR. The congress organizers claim they managed to gather 330 deputies of various levels, including 33 former people's deputies of the USSR, 20 former people's deputies of the Russian Federation, and four State Duma deputies. Apart from them, the congress was attended by representatives from parties and public movements, mainly of the communist and nationalist-patriotic orientation. The delegates approved a resolution that proclaims the intention to submit to the parliaments of former republics of the USSR a proposal to denounce the Belovezhskaya Pushcha agreements, and also to urge all public movements in the independent states [of the CIS] "to start work on expanding interrepublican ties and forming on the basis of these ties a broad movement for the restoration of a single state." The movement expressed its intention to take an active part in preparing the second "Congress of Peoples of the USSR," which is scheduled for October-November 1994. The congress approved "theses of a blueprint for the restoration of a union state," proposed by the previous congress. Former USSR People's Deputy Sazhi Umalatova said in an interview with the ITAR-TASS correspondent she was confident that "all the republic without exceptions, including the Baltic ones," would return to the revived union. However, Viktor Alksnis, a leader of the "Union" group of deputies, told the ITAR-TASS correspondent that he cherished no particular illusions about the movement's prospects. Much will depend on whether there are funds, he noted.
