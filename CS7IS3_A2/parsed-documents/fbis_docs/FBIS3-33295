The national congressional bloc did not obtain authorization to participate in the constitutional revision process. In the meeting, Lula defended the idea of an autonomous position that would have given the party bloc the power to define a framework for participation with the contras [groups opposed to the revision] and decide on which points legislators could vote. But Lula did not even vote. He left before the meeting ended. Had he stayed and voted, the picture would have changed because the final vote ended up in a tie of eight votes for, eight against, and one abstention. The tie left in effect a previous national Executive Board decision limiting the party bloc's participation to voting on the Social Emergency Fund (FSE) and attending negotiations on a maximum agenda to make sure that the revision ends by 15 May. "The tense climate between the Executive Board and the party congressional bloc remains intact," PT Secretary General Gilberto Carvalho said, admitting to being surprised by the new impasse. Deputy Jose Genoino (SP [Sao Paulo]) said the result is a disaster for the negotiations between party bloc members and the contras. "They (contras) need to know whether they can count on our votes or not. Without a decision on this point the negotiation cannot progress," Genoino complained, adding that the decision will continue "tearing" the party bloc. Deputy Eduardo Jorge (SP), congressional party bloc vice president, recognized that the difficulties for negotiations with the contras have increased, but said yesterday's tie shows that Lula's intervention has already helped change the internal crisis. "We started losing by 15 to nil on this question. Then we lost by 15 to four, and now we got a tie," Eduardo Jorge said. Lula also was defeated on the discussion of controversial items in the PT government platform. In order to please radicals and moderates, the moratorium stopped being explicitly mentioned as the path to negotiate the foreign debt, but it stayed camouflaged under a new definition defending the right of the future government to resort to a suspension of payments if creditors are inflexible. Lula did not vote on this issue either. He left a message saying: "My position is to the left of the proposed draft." Federal Deputy Aloizio Mercadante (SP), his economic adviser, not only voted in favor of the proposal but also spoke for it. State Deputy Ruy Falcao, who leads the radicals, said he finds no difference between a suspension of payments and a moratorium. Lula also lost in the vote on Senator Eduardo Suplicy's (SP) minimum income proposal. The proposal, which would have been the basic item in the PT income redistribution program, was defeated by eight votes to seven, with four abstentions, obtained by the party economists' proposal. The board also discussed the issue of the Armed Forces and approved a new draft where support for the Armed Forces' modernization prevails, but without making reference to military projects. Criticism Lula criticized President Itamar Franco for his remarks supporting the candidacy of Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso. "As a citizen, Franco has the right to support any ticket of his liking, but as a president he has other responsibilities and needs to govern the country." Lula then minimized the effect of Franco's remarks. "The president is not wholly behind that ball; he was burned a little already."
