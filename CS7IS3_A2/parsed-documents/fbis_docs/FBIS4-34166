This was the unanimous response of all the APRA leaders who held an enthusiastic rally last night in the APRA headquarters to honor Agustin Mantilla Campos who was recently released from prison. The leaders even proposed that after the current regime has been defeated, the first motion in Congress will be a formal accusation of "high treason" against President Alberto Fujimori and the military leaders supporting him. With these expressions, the leaders discarded any possible rapprochement with the current government as was hinted by Alan Garcia unless great changes occur in the country. The slogan sung by everyone at the rally yesterday was clear in this regard: "The APRA moves on without pacts or alliances." The main speaker was Agustin Mantilla who energetically said that they would never accept a pact with a government that imposed a policy of hunger and misery. He added: "In the 1995 elections, our task will be to take the dictator out of the palace and lock him up in prison." Regarding the possibility of a concensus candidacy, Mantilla was clear when he said that, according to the thoughts of APRA founder Haya de la Torre, a political democracy cannot exist without an economic democracy. He said: "We should not fall into a limping democracy with hunger and misery just because we want to come out of the dictatorship." He added: The struggle is also against neoliberalism, against the auctioning of the country, against the rich who are getting richer. Addressing the rally, which filled the auditorium, Mantilla recognized the need for the APRA to renew its program and government platform. He said: We must look at the new world events and the real situation of the country. But never--he said--abandon the idea that the state must continue to act in the national life. At the end of his speech and in the midst of shouts from his supporters, Mantilla asked the party militants for more work, effort, and sacrifice to be successful in the 1995 elections. Also, leader Jorge del Castillo clarified that Alan Garcia in an interview with a foreign television station never spoke of pacts or alliances. He said that Garcia referred to the possibility of dialogue on issues such as misery or subversion. He added: "He never mentioned an alliance with the dictatorship, his comments were general and some media tried to distort them." [passage omitted]
