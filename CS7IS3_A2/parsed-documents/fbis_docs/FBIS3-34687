You are welcome, brothers, in this house of yours. Many happy returns. God bless you all. I take boundless pride in our brotherhood. One always recalls the memories of the long, hard march and the challenges we faced. We have great faith that God will help us serve the country and the generations to come and fulfill our duties in a manner that will satisfy God almighty and our conscience. I am certain the brothers have a great deal of information on what has happened, and is happening at this phase in our nation's life and our life in this country. There may be, however, an opportunity to enter into some details and listen to your observations on what is happening. We are, here, one family. I am happy to meet with this respectable group of brothers on this day in particular, with the king's private council and with the men, the builders who built this country. You, members of the Senate's Foreign Affairs Committee, are welcome in this house of yours. This is a critical and hard phase in terms of the efforts it requires from all of us. Thank God, this is the country of the big, one family of all origins. We are determined to maintain our national unity and our achievements as far as allowing the individual to share in shouldering his responsibility, chartering the road to the future through democracy, shura, and respect and protection of the Constitution and the National Charter. That charter was formulated by the children of this homeland and sets a course we must follow in the present and future. The individual is very important, indeed. God willing, Jordan will be the state of institutions. This means participation by all people to shoulder their responsibility, with awareness and loyalty, and to prepare the road to the future. Additionally, we must continue our efforts to prevent any party from striking us in the heart, in terms of what we have succeeded in achieving, including democracy and participation by all people in shouldering their responsibility. Through our work, we want to set an example to our brothers in this part of the world. Probably, this is not to the satisfaction of many quarters, because they do not know the true objective and goal we seek to achieve; that is to succeed in our course and reach our objectives and goals. Therefore, the phase requires a great deal of vigilance, awareness, and cohesion by all in the face of all the attempts that may seek to distort the image of this country and its achievements, or march on a road that might lead -- in the view of some people -- to a reaction. We are committed to the path and the course we have chosen. We must preserve it. This is a trust everyone must protect. Thank God, all Jordanians have always demonstrated a degree of awareness -- which they gained through the long hard march -- of all that may threaten that march. But, in my view, and based on what we have seen recently, there has to be an extra degree of vigilance and awareness, a vigilance that will prevent any damage, God forbid. We must look after the interests of the individual and his rights, as well as paying attention to the environment and whatever falls within the realm of our responsibility toward the coming generations. In a larger context, we decided, following a national convention here, to take the road of peace, beginning in Madrid, along with our brothers in the Arab world, particularly the Palestinians. In 1974, the Rabat summit decided that our Palestinian brothers should take charge of their own affairs in compliance with their own and the Arab nation's wishes at that time. Some of you here now took part in that meeting. Our position is clear. As of 1974, we promoted an implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 242, which we co-authored in tough circumstances, and which was the best possible arrangement we could get at that time. Thereafter, our Palestinian brothers took responsibility for themselves. They have our full support. Things then evolved in a way favoring a settlement compatible with a world trend. We began in Madrid. The Jordanian umbrella was a vehicle for our Palestinian brothers to run their affairs, insofar as their rights on their national soil are concerned. We agreed to take part in various conferences, including the multilateral talks, because we wanted the world to be involved in drawing the outlines of peace. Things developed in rapid succession until we came to the point where we could furl the umbrella and relegate it to the closet of history, so our Palestinian brothers might exercise their right to speak for themselves. Then, there was last September's Washington session and the agreement, followed by our signing of the agenda that addressed issues bearing on us here in Jordan, without prejudicing our brothers' rights on matters previously handled by us. I am speaking about Resolution 242 and the Arab territories conquered in 1967. The responsibility for these was switched to our Palestinian brothers, who can count on our full support as they pursue their rights. There have been many proposals and attempts to get Jordan to sign a peace treaty with Israel before details are worked out. Our response was an outright rejection. We stand with a just and comprehensive peace, although we are now dealing with our issues in this country, as well as its rights concerning occupied territories in the south and in the north. Jordanian sovereignty over them should be regained. Regarding water, which is also a topic on the agenda, a formula should be worked out in which we can know our country's share and the shares of other parties concerned. The question of human beings as well as other topics should also be discussed. We believe peace is a goal. It is our duty to seek to reach it. However, there will never be peace unless all these issues are resolved in a satisfactory and comfortable way. Peace comes at the end and not at the beginning. Then, all the elements that should be available to achieve peace should be discussed. We believe anyone who thinks of signing a peace treaty and then begins discussing details cannot reach peace, but will surrender. People will then try to improve their conditions and circumstances. We regret such a situation. We will never accept such a view or concept. Meetings and negotiations on the agenda are continuing in an attempt to deal with all the aspects and issues pertaining to us, through continued dialogue in Washington and other parts of the world. We believe the other tracks will also move. They are actually moving, particularly the Syrian-Israeli track and the Lebanese-Israeli track, in addition to the Palestinian side which is working continuously. We tried, and we will continue to try, to reach the required level to face the challenge and to face up to our responsibilities toward the present and the future, particularly toward our Palestinian brethren. There should be coordination, not only in terms of titles, but also details, in every area in order to extend our support and talk with one voice and in one logic to serve the goals we seek. The picture is improving, but I cannot say that we are 100 percent satisfied with all the aspects that should be dealt with. There is a serious intention to achieve this. Therefore, we will march on this path. We will insist on total coordination on issues of mutual interest until a situation arises in which everyone in this country can choose either membership in this one family to which we belong, or repatriation, or compensation. We are one family. We should adhere to all that has united us in the past. This is a duty at this critical stage, which expresses the fact that we are one family regardless of any consideration. We are coordinating with our brothers in fraternal Syria. Regarding Lebanon, I also believe there is progress in the right direction. I believe there will be progress on the Syrian-Israeli track. Israel will have to recognize Syria's sovereignty over its occupied territories and over all of Golan. On the other hand, it has been said Israel has no claims on any inch of Lebanese territory. Israel's only demand is to guarantee its security which, I believe, can be provided. We, here, have many issues and matters that should be discussed and agreed upon before reaching the phase in which we will be reassured that all matters have been tackled. I believe that between now and the end of the year -- perhaps by the beginning of next year -- we might find that progress has been achieved on all tracks to reach the objective that is sought. What is this objective, as I, as well as my brothers, see it? The objective is to move from the current situation to a completely different one. The objective is that the coming generation will not live as we lived, that is, a life in which they will not be reassured about what will come in the future. We lived from one day to another. The objective is to see people living in an atmosphere that provides them with opportunities to advance in their life and to enjoy stability, democracy, participation in decisionmaking, and peace, that we hope will be just and honorable and accepted by the coming generations. The objective is to see that all opportunities will be available to all to achieve their aspirations and objectives, to live a free and honorable life, to remain steadfast on their land, and to exercise their rights in this life. We want to leave for the coming generations opportunities of which we were deprived. We believe our people have enough potential, if they are given opportunities to advance and to exercise their rights in normal circumstances. What makes us very satisfied is that our country and our people are not in danger and that this position -- which we have safeguarded from the beginning as a genuine Arab -- is not subject to any possibilities like those we have been confronting throughout our life. Our homeland is the homeland of the free people and its people's heads are high in the sky. Our people bow only to almighty God. We do not bargain over principle. We are not lenient vis-a-vis our rights. We seek to fully restore rights to their owners on their national soil and to carry our duties the best way we can for the sake of the coming generations. As regards Jerusalem and our holy places, we cannot forget them for one moment. We have no choice but to continue shouldering our full responsibilities in terms of looking after them on behalf of our Islamic nation. As regards Gaza and Jericho, if the issue is the beginning of the implementation of 242, the time will come when Jerusalem will be the Palestinian-Israeli meeting place. However, as regards our holy places -- toward which we have shouldered our responsibilities and which belong to all Muslims throughout the world, in the past, in the present, and in the future -- we found we had to propose and to endeavor to choose, from within our Islamic group, a good group of people who would represent all Islamic sects. This group of people, God willing, will not be politicized. In other words, they will not be affiliated with any school or be supportive of any one country's policy. We will support them with all our potential, because these holy places belong to all the Islamic world. What we have accomplished is an honor, whether in terms of rescuing these holy places in the first place or in seeking to preserve them despite all that has happened and all that we faced. We encourage dialogue among religions and demand that in terms of sovereignty the holy places be under the sovereignty of God almighty and his worshipers under future circumstances. We hope that this will happen, so the only recognized sovereignty over these holy places will be that of God. We will seek to gain God's satisfaction. We will continue to fear him. The positive results of this will not be confined just to this part of the world, but will have effects on mankind throughout the world. Thanks be to God, during this month we will celebrate the completion of the project we have followed from the beginning, namely, the restoration of the holy dome of the rock. We will continue to support our brethren to the best of our abilities in terms of their needs and desires. In my opinion, Palestine can either lean on this solid wall here [Jordan] or else lean in the other direction in the upcoming critical stage. Palestine represents our kinsfolk, our people, hopes, and aspirations. We are willing to carry out our duty. We never hesitated to do so at any time. We hope God will grant us success in cooperating with our brethren to support them in any way that can lead to wellbeing and success, God willing. With the help of almighty God, there will be nothing but (?success). Incidents took place over here in the recent past. These include the loss of one of the homeland's sons in Lebanon in a grotesque, mean action. However, I am pleased to inform you that our brethren in Lebanon and Syria moved with us to the best of their abilities. This incident was directed against Lebanon, just as it was directed against us. This evil act encroached on the sovereignty, security, and stability of Lebanon, just as it grieved us in causing the loss of one of our good sons. In a telephone conversation a few days ago, my brother his excellency the Lebanese president said that all those responsible for this incident had been arrested and that justice will take its course. He made a point of contacting me personally so that I would not hear this from any other source before hearing it from the president himslef. Naturally, we thanked him. We thank all our brothers for their contributions to exposing this crime and its dimensions and those who are responsible for it and who instigated it. Regrettably this group, in particular, has in the past committed against us and against our diplomatic missions such crimes. On this occasion, it seems orders were issued from an Arab capital where the head of this criminal organization is hiding. Scores of questions have been raised in the past about this organization. All the details must be made available to the people. As regards our domestic arena, the security agencies have, praise be to God, acted at the required level to face and confront some attempts to harm the image of this country, as well as criminal schemes hatched to inflict further harm. The question, with all its dimensions, is now being investigated. But we have to warn that there are certain parties that can reach our young men, who are not in a position to distinguish between good and bad, and influence them through various means and ways and drive them to commit crimes and carry out certain acts. What is even more dangerous is the fact that these parties try to address the point of weakness, which is also the point of strength, in everyone of us, that is, religion and faith. As far as the results are concerned, all these crimes have nothing to do with religion or faith. We noted on several occasions in the past what is being hatched against us, and against our religion, faith, and Islam. We also drew attention to the duty we all must fulfill, that is, not to allow things to go beyond the limits of what is logical and acceptable. The pulpits in mosques are the pulpits of God's messenger, God's prayers and peace by upon him, and of the legal guardians. We believe that, as of now, we should not allow anyone, any more, to exploit them for purposes that have nothing to do with our doctrine and our religion. Islam shall remain clear and pure, since this is what the moderate nation the Muslim nation is all about. One cannot stand idly by over the attempts to drive people to crime and murder. We must warn against another fact. There is a small group of infiltrators who try to damage the entire picture and everything that has been achieved and won. I urge our people in our country to be vigilant and cautious and to close the door to these groups that have connections with foreign parties. Many doubts are cast about these connections. Their contacts may be within a framework broader than that of our Muslim world. When we have enough information, it must be presented to the people so they will know about what is going on. All members of this one family -- Muslims and Christians -- are Jordanians who must band together and pull the rug from under whoever seeks to discredit this country and its achievements. Jordan must remain a strong and steadfast fortress that serves Palestine and our brothers and well-intentioned people throughout the great Arab homeland. We pray that God may grant us success and guidance, and that these are the results. We are quite confident that life and death are in the lap of the gods. Our life span is fated by God. What we are after is God almighty's satisfaction and his help in allowing us to succeed, as long as we live, to fulfill our duties so our heads can remain held high. I thank you for this visit and meeting. If you have any questions or comments, I'd be grateful and happy. I thank you so much, brothers. Thanks be to God, this country is doing its bit and its duty. God willing, our brothers from Yemen will get together. They sought our help in their endeavor to maintain Yemen's unity and map out the outline of a promising future for a cherished part of our great Arab homeland, and we have been receptive. We will be glad to see Amman once more play the role of the capital of accord and reconciliation, when we play host to them quite soon. It will count as a major achievement. For us, it will mean more than just an effort we exerted or a duty we fulfilled. Hopefully, it will usher in a resolution of intra-Arab differences within the framework of an Arab family, as we have always wanted and worked for. It will be an opportunity for each of us to do their duty by our kinsfolk and brothers. We pray for success from God. In regard to our Armed Forces, they will continue to have our maximum support within the limits of our resources. I recently visited the Jordanian contingent within the international peacekeeping forces in former Yugoslavia. I was impressed by their high morale and the humane, but yet firm, way in which they conducted themselves. I myself was surprised to learn that next to France we have the second largest contingent there. We have been asked to contribute an even larger force, but I said we could not commit any more troops to that operation. We must thank God that the Jordanian soldier's character and moral standards and commitment to responsibility have earned him universal respect.
