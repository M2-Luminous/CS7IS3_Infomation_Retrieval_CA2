Why now? [Hasan] During the Madrid conference, a meeting with an Israeli journalist might have been construed as an attempt to intervene in the peace process. Therefore, everything was done through official spokesmen. But now, after the White House meeting between Clinton, Peres, and myself, I believe it is important to present our points of view and concepts. I must note that something annoyed me, and I will take this opportunity to clarify it. I am referring to the report published in the newsletter issued by BIPAC (the pro-Israeli lobby in Britain). It quoted -- in a very imprecise way -- a conversation I had with the editor of the Lebanese newspaper AL-SAFIR and created the impression that I had said that the meeting with Peres in Washington had been "forced" on me. I have already sent Peres a message on that via Grenville Janner (a leader of British Jewry). That story harmed the Washington meeting, which took place in an atmosphere of mutual respect. It was also another reason why I thought it right to meet with an Israeli journalist now. [Avrekh] The assumption in Israel has always been that Jordan would be the first -- or at least the second -- Arab state to sign a peace treaty with Israel. For years, there were meetings between Israelis and Jordanians, and you made sure the border remained quiet. Do you foresee an Israeli-Jordanian peace accord in 1994? [Hasan] Definitely. I would like to stress that Jordan was, in fact, first. Already in the 1930's, my grandfather, King 'Abdallah, offered the Jews autonomy. At that time, as is known, the State of Israel had not yet been established, and that idea could have served as a framework for coexistence. In fact, my grandfather paid with his life for his beliefs. Jordan adopted a long list of initiatives. There is a lengthy history of meetings between senior Israelis and Jordanians. In my view, the question is why we did not manage to make progress on basic security issues for 25 years. It is our impression that Israel finds it hard to agree openly and publicly to final recognition of its borders with Jordan. In fact, this is quite a marginal issue compared with the territorial problem with Syria or the demand for withdrawal from Lebanese territory. Israel apparently fears creating a precedent. But we, for our part, aspire to the principle of implementing sovereignty on our borders, and I am referring to the borders from the time of the British Mandate. If we manage to define sovereignty within the concept of borders, then we will be able to make progress on water and refugee issues. I would like to stress that the peace we want is a "warm peace." Therefore, for instance, we welcomed the Declaration of Principles between Israel and the PLO because it broke the "taboo." The very act of shaking hands was important, but what has still not been done, and must now be done, is to insert that agreement of principles into an overall peace framework. It is clear that statesmen on both sides are trying to create "windows" to peace. But if we do not have a vision of a peaceful region, it will be very hard to achieve peace in the most important areas. The water problem cannot be solved through bilateral meetings. The human problem cannot be solved by making Jordan a "garbage dump" in order to solve the demographic problems of the region. We therefore welcomed the good news of the Clinton-al-Asad meeting; we welcomed the good news of the talks between the Palestinians and the Israelis. But we must ask ourselves: Will it lead us to a "warm peace?" [Avrekh] You talk about returning to the mandatory borders, but in negotiations both parties have to give up something. Can we reach peace this way? [Hasan] In Jordan's case, there is a clear, simple line which starts in the Jordan Valley, runs through the center of the Jordan River, and continues up to the Red Sea. Therefore, we are not talking about the demarcation of new borders, but rather of recognizing a principle -- even if this recognition has not yet been made public. This must be done in the framework of the bilateral talks. I would like to explain that I am not bringing up this problem as part of an attempt to raise obstacles or sabotage the process. This issue is important to our people. People will say, as you mentioned earlier, that for 20 years our countries have been neither at peace nor at war. Jordan, for of its own security considerations, was committed to preventing infiltrations across its western border. People will ask what Jordan received in return for this? American visitors come and tell us: We want open meetings between Jordanians and Israelis. I say: Instead of holding public meetings on tourism or on economic issues, which we are doing anyway at the Washington and Paris talks, we must meet on the issue of sovereignty. This will let us leave the problems of border demarcation behind and let us move on to discuss the rational use of our resources. [Avrekh] How will the Palestinians fit in here? [Hasan] At the moment, I am talking about the sovereign affairs of the State of Israel and the Kingdom of Jordan. This especially pertains to the southern part of the 'Arava valley. For example, if one seeks to promote the idea of a canal between the Dead Sea and the Red Sea, or develop the Elat-al-'Aqabah free trade zone concept, then the current situation, in which soldiers stop potential investors at the cease fire lines because it is a security area, is inconceivable. Therefore, a resolution of this problem will constitute a breakthrough. [Avrekh] Do you see the possibility of establishing a joint airport between al-'Aqabah and Elat? The 1986 London Agreement (between King Husayn and Shim'on Peres) spoke of granting Jordan access to a Mediterranean port. Do you believe that progress toward implementing these ideas can be made in 1994? [Hasan] This once more brings us back to our starting point -- the border question. After all, if one talks about an airport, one is also dealing with civilian airspace zones and so forth. This is also true with regard to ports. Thus, if we satisfactorily resolve of the problem of sovereignty, we can make progress toward effectively treating other problems. [Avrekh] The London Agreement got off to a promising start, but suddenly got "stuck." What exactly happened there? [Hasan] I believe there were different interpretations: There was former Secretary of State Shultz' interpretation, Peres' interpretation, and perhaps also our own interpretation. But eventually what happened was that Peres, foreign minister at the time, went back to the Israeli Government with proposals which were based on the agreement. The government had just changed, and Shamir had assumed the premiership. The London Agreement did not head the government's list of priorities and it was "frozen." Shultz, for his part, was too slow in presenting the issue. We can also go back to 1974. At the time we had some agreements of a limited nature which were reached after the Yom Kippur War. The possibility of a partial withdrawal to the lines of the "Alon Plan" [plan by former Labor party minister calling for territorial compromise with Israel retaining control of strategic areas] was discussed. There was also an idea, raised in 1972, for a Jordanian-Israeli confederation. Ultimately, none of this was implemented. As for the 1986 plan, it is important to stress that we presented a development plan for the occupied territories. It is reasonable to assume that this plan would have prevented a great many of the manifestations of extremism you have been forced to live with since 1988. The plan, however, was rejected and Israel viewed it as a Jordanian attempt to intervene in the affairs of the occupied territories. [Avrekh] Were the issues of water and economy, that you mentioned before, discussed by King Husayn and Shim'on Peres in Amman approximately two months ago? [Hasan, laughing] I will put it this way: Yes, these issues were raised in the framework of the continuous contacts with Mr. Peres. [Avrekh] When, in your opinion, will Israelis be able to visit Petra? You must know that this has always been the dream of many Israeli youths. [Hasan] The question of tourism and reciprocal visits is very important and has to be discussed in the framework of the peace process. The issue of tourism must be resolved in the framework of bilateral agreements between our two states. [passage omitted] [Avrekh] How would you describe Jordan's involvement in the peace process between the Palestinians and Israel? [Hasan] First of all, one must remember that Jordan granted the Palestinians shelter -- and, on the other hand, benefited from their contribution during three demographic waves in 1948, 1967, and 1991 (when Kuwait and other Gulf states expelled Palestinians to Jordan). As for the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles, it focuses on the 1967 refugees. The pre-1967 refugees, or in other words those from 1948, are asking: What do we gain from this declaration? This clearly is an emotionally charged problem. We must make people understand that peace offers something for everyone, for every human being. This cannot be explained in a one-sided fashion. You, for example, have a concept calling for the ingathering of the diaspora, of bringing Jews to Israel from various, diverse, communities around the world. In addition, the State of Israel also has a demographic problem. We, when talking about a comprehensive peace, the water problem.... [pauses] For example, we have to deal with the matter of water consumers in disputed areas. In my opinion, most people realize this. They understand that peace is indeed an effective panacea, as long as peace is established throughout the entire region. This is the reason we stress the need for a comprehensive peace. [Avrekh] What do you expect to be achieved at the meeting between King Husayn and President Clinton in Washington? Generally speaking, what is the present state of relations between Jordan and the United States? [Hasan] Following the developments of the past three years and Operation Desert Storm, many questions about Jordan's role and positions were aired. However, I believe that there is growing recognition for the active role Jordan plays for the United States; something between Israel as a strategic asset and the strategic value of the oil wells. In order to fulfill such a difficult role -- the "Finlandization" of Jordan, if that is the way it can be described (with reference to the important role played by neutral Finland during the Cold War) -- one must understand the kind of conditions required to guarantee stability in Jordan. Stability and security are a comprehensive and all encompassing concept. I am also speaking in terms of "hard" security, which common to Jordan and other countries in the region: The military's role in deterring terrorism, preventing infiltrations by radical elements, drug interdiction, stopping weapons sales, and even preventing money laundering. There are also problems of "soft" security. I am referring to problems connected with economic and social progress. I would like to see more efforts to redress inequality. Only recently has the American press begun to write about a situation in which the average per capita income for a Palestinian is $800, as compared to $15,000 for Israelis or for residents of the Gulf states. These problems, which are closely linked to a person's ability to live with dignity, must be resolved in the framework of the peace process. As for the meeting between King Husayn and President Clinton -- I think it must lead to practical steps. For example, in my meeting today with a congressional delegation, we discussed the establishment of a Middle East free trade zone, something similar to NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement) in our region. We spoke of cooperating in the establishment of a Middle East development bank. As I said before, agreement on the issue of sovereignty and border demarcation is a prerequisite for all this. Afterwards, we can start work on resolving the water problem, on developing the region's human potential, and on effecting the economic integration of the region to bring us into the 21st century. [Avrekh] With your permission, I would like to return to the Clinton-al-Asad summit. In your opinion, has al-Asad changed because the USSR collapsed and he now needs the United States, or because he realized with time, that war, or a state of war and no peace, will lead him nowhere? [Hasan] It is a combination of the things you mentioned. The bipolar world we knew when the USSR existed is gone. That means that new regional definitions and characteristics must grow now. We have to recognize that we must redefine the Middle East as a "region." Almost every part of the world is defined as a region, while, though called this, the Middle East has so far been a collection of individual countries that have not operated on a regional basis. The international community has bilateral contacts with the various countries, not with the region as such. In 1975, Syria, Egypt, and Jordan signed an agreement for economic cooperation with Europe. Israel and Lebanon signed a similar agreement. I am certain that it benefited Israel much more than it did the Arab countries. I believe that Damascus feels, just as we feel here in Amman, that it would be very difficult to compete with other regions if we do not define the Middle East as a region. For example, South Africa, where peace has also been made now, is seeking international investments and the world's attention. It would be very difficult to go on talking in the sterile context of individual Arab capitals or "lonesome Israel." Indeed, I am certain that the time has come to redefine Southwest Asia, or the eastern Mediterranean shores. I believe these views certainly exist in, and are expressed by Damascus. Naturally, in order to make this aspiration come true, the parties involved should be given incentives -- and not only negative ones. President Nixon once told me that in order to attain peace, you have to "pressure" each of the parties a little. Well, Jordan has been "pressured" enough... (laughing). [Avrekh] What do you see as the solution to the security problems of the Middle East by the year 2000? [Hasan] I believe in the concept of a Middle East conference on security cooperation. As will be recalled, this was done in Europe with success. We must identify and define our enemies, and I speak of common enemies such as terrorism, which is a clear case, or drugs. In this case, we may certainly speak of regional cooperation. At the same time, if we are stuck with dealing with the old "skeletons" of the previous conflicts, it would be very hard to produce movement or flexibility toward an agreement to reduce the size of the military establishments in the region. Incidentally, I believe that on this matter we pay too much attention to American research institutes such as Brookings, Enterprise, or Carnegie. What do we, the residents of the region, contribute to the vision of our regional security? This issue was raised in my discussion with President Clinton and Minister Peres. [Avrekh] How do you view the ups and downs of the Israel-Palestinian negotiations? What do you think of 'Arafat's conduct? [Hasan] To a certain extent, the problems stem from the manner in which the agreement of principles was made -- the secrecy of the Oslo talks. Still, as we have said several times before, it is essential to move on from Oslo and the Washington handshake to the practical things required to make the autonomy materialize. [Avrekh] What are the implications of the PLO-Jordan economic agreement on economic relations between Israel and the West Bank? [Hasan] It is obvious that the central banks of Israel and Jordan share a common interest in promoting an economic entity that could mediate between the various Palestinian territories. Naturally, we would like to see international, as well as Arab, investments in the territories through existing apparatuses. Obviously, the Palestinians want to establish a development bank, but I would like it to be established in a regional framework. In the end, it is up to the Palestinians to decide on how to solve the practical problems. [Avrekh] What is your view of economic cooperation between Israel, Jordan, and the Palestinians by the year 2000? [Hasan] Well, in 1970, an Israeli research institute presented an "assignment of duties" between Israel, Egypt, and Jordan. The basic idea was that the Arab countries will provide the manpower, while Israel provides the technology. I believe that such strict assignment of duties is not required. I would like to see the Middle East as the European coast of Asia, and the Asian coast of Europe. [Avrekh] Could you point at a date when a peace accord will be signed between Israel and Jordan? [Hasan] I have already mentioned that we need "warm peace." I hope that 1994 will be the year of crossing the threshold to such peace. Whether this crossing of threshold will include the signing a peace contract, depends on the creativity and honesty of the parties. [Avrekh] But you believe it is possible? [Hasan] We live in the Middle East, so we have to believe in miracles....
