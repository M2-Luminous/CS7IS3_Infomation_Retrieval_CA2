Institutions of political science and law should, under the unified leadership of party committees and governments, fully display their functions and create a stable and political environment for the province's reform, opening up, and economic development. After listening to the views of participants from Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Xuchang, and Nanyang, Li Changchun said: Doing two types of work simultaneously and laying equal stress on both are an important component of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. All levels of party and government leaders should properly understand the dialectical relations between reform, opening up, economic development, and social stability, and improve their understanding on the importance of preserving social and political stability. Li Changchun pointed out: Development is the central issue, reform is the driving force, and stability is the foundation. All levels of party committees and governments should pay full attention to political science and law, increase the impetus of maintaining social stability, and persist in doing two types of work simultaneous and laying equal stress on both in the course of deepening reform and stepping up development. Li Changchun continued: All levels of party and government leaders should conscientiously carry out the responsibility system for comprehensive management of social order. [passage omitted] Departments of political science and law throughout the province should strengthen their leadership functions, severely crack down on all kinds of crimes, and examine and handle major and important economic crimes. [passage omitted] During the discussion, Comrade Ma Zhongchen pointed out: All levels of party committees and governments should apply the method of one divided into two in their work. Comrades on the front of political science and law should fully understand the difficulties arising from the deepening of reform, the adjustment of interests, and the increase in the people's contradictions. They should raise their awareness of social problems that may possibly arise from the introduction of major reform measures. Ma Zhongchen stressed: Comprehensive management of social order is a social systems engineering, which should proceed under the unified leadership of all-level party committees and governments.
