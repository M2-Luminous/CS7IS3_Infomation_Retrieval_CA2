FR940419-0-00078 FR940419-0-00019 The first comment refers to the LOFC clause for ARCS and its alternates for TCRR, TAT, TES, and Site Specific contracts. Each of these clauses contains restrictions pertaining to sites where the contractor previously worked for EPA and on any work that may jeopardize CERCLA enforcement actions which pertain to a site where the contractor previously performed work for the EPA under the contract. This limitation is required because work on related sites could adversely affect EPA's CERCLA enforcement action at a site where the contractor previously performed work for EPA. The LOFC alternates for TCRR, TAT and TES contain limitations for geographic areas. These limitations apply only during the period of performance of the contract. They are included in the TCRR and TAT clauses because these two types of work cannot be performed by the same contractor in the same geographic area because the risk of a conflict occurring is too great. In the TES contracts, the geographic limitation on remedial and implementation work is necessary because of the risk associated with extremely sensitive litigation information, the unauthorized disclosure of which would jeopardize EPA's enforcement actions. The second commenter uses the term ``unrelated sites'' in the comment concerning restrictions on private contracting. We are unclear as to the commenter's definition of this term. EPA's LOFC clause and alternates limit CERCLA work which pertains to a site, or limit work that may jeopardize enforcement actions which pertain to a site, where the contractor previously performed work for EPA under the contract. The only other site limitations are those in the TCRR, TAT and TES Alternates which pertain to sites within the geographic area of the contract. There are no restrictions to sites outside these limitations. We agree with the commenter that stated that it would be difficult to administer or enforce the limitations that pertain to the performance of CERCLA work or work which jeopardizes enforcement actions at sites where a contractor has not performed previous work for EPA. However, EPA's intent in the LOFC clause is not to require excessive administration but rather to have contractors rely on information of which they are aware at the time they consider entering into a contract for work at other sites. No extensive searches, certifications, or control systems associated with administration are required. 8. Basic LOFC clause (ARCS) paragraphs (a) and (b)_Contractors right to compete. One commenter suggested that the clause include the same ``free to compete on an equal basis'' language in the alternate LOFC clauses. The commenter further stated that the clauses require clarification that, when a contractor has prepared the statement of work or other solicitation package for a private party, the restriction of the clause does not apply. Another commenter requested that the clause be expanded to provide that any contractor that contributes to the development of the statement of work or the solicitation package should be ineligible to participate in follow-on Superfund remedial action projects. We agree with the recommendation that the clause be changed to be consistent with its alternates, which include ``free to compete on an equal basis'' language, and have made this change in the final clause language. We also agree with the commenter's conclusion that the restriction when a contractor has prepared a statement of work or solicitation package under the terms and conditions of a Government contract, as either a prime contractor or subcontractor, would not apply to work performed for private contractors. EPA does not generate statements of work or solicitations for the use and benefit of a private party. Therefore, no clarification to the clause is necessary. The ARCS contracts provide for a contractor's involvement with the complete cleanup of a site from the beginning to the end, including follow-on remedial action projects. The LOFC clause for the ARCS contracts has been specifically written to accommodate the special nature of the ARCS program to take advantage of a contractor's expertise and keep the competitive base as open as possible, especially when EPA has purchased the technology. Therefore, we disagree with the comment that the clause should be expanded to make any contractors, which participate in the development of the statement of work or solicitation package, ineligible from participating in such activities. To make ARCS contractors ineligible would be overly restrictive and disruptive to the Superfund program. 9. Basic LOFC clause (ARCS) paragraph (c)_Broaden limitation. One commenter recommended that we broaden this paragraph to exclude a contractor from working for any party on any contract for the types of work specified. We disagree. Such a change would be too restrictive to ARCS contractors. 10. Alternate I (TCRR) paragraph (d)(3)_Applicability of TAT restriction. One commenter recommended that the clause be clarified to indicate the TAT restriction in the TCRR clause only applies to TAT type contracts offered by the Federal Government because if it applied to both Government and the private sector it would be overly broad and restrictive.
