Under the bill, advertisements may amount to five percent of the daily broadcasts over one Estonian-language and one Russian-language radio channel. Private radio and TV stations are allowed to spend 20 percent of their airtime on advertising. Tiit Sinissaar, chairman of the Pro Patria parliamentary faction, therefore voiced the opinion that granting state radio and TV permission to advertising broadcasts does not affect the activity of private stations. The legislators carried Wednesday a motion stipulating that Estonian Radio and Estonian Television are independent legal persons which jointly administer the radio and TV broadcasting center. The motion put forward by the Liberal faction, under which the radio, the television and the broadcasting center would form one single organization, found no support in the parliament. The motion to include a "principle of political balance" in the broadcasting law was also rejected. According to the proposal, a radio or TV station, which allows airtime to a political party, should give other parties at their request the same amount of time on the air. Sinissaar told reporters it would at present be impossible to observe such a principle of balance. "We have about a score of competing political parties and if this principle was implemented dividing airtime between parties would be the principal occupation of the radio and TV stations," he said.
