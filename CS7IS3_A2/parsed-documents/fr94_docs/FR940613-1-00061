FR940613-1-00061 FR940613-1-00006 (b) Actions that are not participation in management pre-foreclosure. (1) Actions at the inception of the loan or other transaction. No act or omission prior to the time that indicia of ownership are held primarily to protect a security interest constitutes evidence of participation in management within the meaning of this Subpart. A prospective holder who undertakes or requires an environmental investigation (which could include a site assessment, inspection, and/or audit) of the UST or UST system in which indicia of ownership are to be held or requires a prospective borrower to clean up contamination from the UST or UST system or to comply or come into compliance (whether prior or subsequent to the time that indicia of ownership are held primarily to protect a security interest) with any applicable law or regulation is not by such action considered to be participating in the UST's or UST system's management. (2) Loan policing and workout. Actions that are consistent with holding ownership indicia primarily to protect a security interest do not constitute participation in management for purposes of this subpart. The authority for the holder to take such actions may, but need not, be contained in contractual or other documents specifying requirements for financial, environmental, and other warranties, covenants, conditions, representations or promises from the borrower. Loan policing and workout activities cover and include all such activities up to foreclosure or its equivalents, exclusive of any activities that constitute participation in management. (i) Policing the security interest or loan. A holder who engages in policing activities prior to foreclosure will remain within the exemption provided that the holder does not by such actions participate in the management of the UST or UST system as provided in §280.210(a). Such actions include, but are not limited to, requiring the borrower to clean up contamination from the UST or UST system during the term of the security interest; requiring the borrower to comply or come into compliance with applicable federal, state, and local environmental and other laws, rules, and regulations during the term of the security interest; securing or exercising authority to monitor or inspect the UST or UST system (including on-site inspections) in which indicia of ownership are maintained, or the borrower's business or financial condition during the term of the security interest; or taking other actions to adequately police the loan or security interest (such as requiring a borrower to comply with any warranties, covenants, conditions, representations, or promises from the borrower). (ii) Loan work out. A holder who engages in work out activities prior to foreclosure or its equivalents will remain within the exemption provided that the holder does not by such action participate in the management of the UST or UST system as provided in §280.210(a). For purposes of this rule, work out refers to those actions by which a holder, at any time prior to foreclosure or its equivalents, seeks to prevent, cure, or mitigate a default by the borrower or obligor; or to preserve, or prevent the diminution of, the value of the security. Work out activities include, but are not limited to, restructuring or renegotiating the terms of the security interest; requiring payment of additional rent or interest; exercising forbearance; requiring or exercising rights pursuant to an assignment of accounts or other amounts owing to an obligor; requiring or exercising rights pursuant to an escrow agreement pertaining to amounts owing to an obligor; providing specific or general financial or other advice, suggestions, counseling, or guidance; and exercising any right or remedy the holder is entitled to by law or under any warranties, covenants, conditions, representations, or promises from the borrower. (c) Foreclosure on an UST or UST system and participation in management activities post-foreclosure_(1) Foreclosure. Indicia of ownership that are held primarily to protect a security interest include legal or equitable title acquired through or incident to foreclosure or its equivalents. For purposes of this subpart, the term foreclosure or its equivalents includes purchase at foreclosure sale; acquisition or assignment of title in lieu of foreclosure; termination of a lease or other repossession; acquisition of a right to title or possession; an agreement in satisfaction of the obligation; or any other formal or informal manner (whether pursuant to law or under warranties, covenants, conditions, representations, or promises from the borrower) by which the holder acquires title to or possession of the secured UST or UST system. The indicia of ownership held after foreclosure continue to be maintained primarily as protection for a security interest provided that the holder undertakes to sell, re-lease an UST or UST system held pursuant to a lease financing transaction (whether by a new lease financing transaction or substitution of the lessee), or otherwise divest itself of the UST or UST system in a reasonably expeditious manner, using whatever commercially reasonable means are relevant or appropriate with respect to the UST or UST system, taking all facts and circumstances into consideration, and provided that the holder did not participate in management (as defined in §280.210(a)) prior to foreclosure or its equivalents. For purposes of establishing that a holder is seeking to sell, re-lease an UST or UST system held pursuant to a lease financing transaction (whether by a new lease financing transaction or substitution of the lessee), or divest an UST or UST system in a reasonably expeditious manner, the holder may use whatever commercially reasonable means as are relevant or appropriate with respect to the UST or UST system, or may employ the means specified in §280.210(c)(2). A holder that outbids, rejects, or fails to act upon a written bona fide, firm offer of fair consideration for the UST or UST system, as provided in §280.210(c)(2), is not considered to hold indicia of ownership primarily to protect a security interest. (2) Holding foreclosed property for disposition and liquidation. A holder, who did not participate in management prior to foreclosure or its equivalents, may sell, re-lease an UST or UST system held pursuant to a lease financing transaction (whether by a new lease financing transaction or substitution of the lessee), liquidate, wind up operations, and take measures to preserve, protect, or prepare the secured UST or UST system prior to sale or other disposition. The holder may conduct these activities without voiding the exemption, subject to the requirements of this subpart.
