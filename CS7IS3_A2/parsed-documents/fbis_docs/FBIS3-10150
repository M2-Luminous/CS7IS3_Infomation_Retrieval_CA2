This means that we will be able to have access to credit facilities, different from bilateral cooperation, for financing investment projects. Jaililie moreover explained that the $410 million deficit in the balance of payments that had to be covered in 1993 -- which entailed having recourse to the second Support Group -- was overcome thanks to the aid granted by Japan, which was the only country that fulfilled its promise of help in time. Jaililie pointed out that Japan was "the only country that staked everything for Peru, and that disbursed exactly the $110 million it had pledged to give us." He added that this contrasts sharply with the United States' attitude, as its Congress has raised a number of objections to disbursing its $105 million share. As is public knowledge, last year Peru called on countries with which it has friendly relations to help it overcome the deficit it would incur in its balance of payments. The United States and Japan answered this appeal by committing themselves to granting us $210 million [as published] of the $410 million we needed. The United States would disburse $105 million, and Japan $110 million. Some European countries would contribute with a smaller share. And yet a year has elapsed, and the United States has not yet disbursed the promised $105 million because the U.S. Senate has charged Peru with violating human rights. Japan on its part has punctually paid out its share. Jaililie stated that negotiations with the United States are in the hands of Finance and Economy Minister Jorge Camet. The only thing that is known about the progress of these negotiations is that the U.S. Government -- through AID -- will soon disburse $35 million, but nothing has been said about the rest of the money. It should be pointed out that the United States is not the only one that has failed to honor its commitments. Some European countries and international organizations have been delaying the disbursement of the funds agreed upon at the meeting of the Donors' Board held in Paris in June 1993. To date, the only thing that Peru has been granted is a cancellation of its debt with Germany and Switzerland, amounting to some $300 million.
