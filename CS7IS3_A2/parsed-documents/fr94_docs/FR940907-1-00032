ACTION: Notice of public meeting and extension of comment period. SUMMARY: The Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) invites representatives of industry, state and local government, and the public to an open meeting on qualifications of pipeline personnel. The purpose of this meeting is to hear views of interested persons on issues raised as a result of a recently published Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) regarding qualifications of pipeline personnel. The comment period is also being extended. DATES: The meeting will be held on September 29, 1994, from 9 a.m. until 4 p.m., eastern standard time. This meeting may conclude earlier if all persons wishing to speak have been heard. The comment period is extended until October 31, 1994.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Albert C. Garnett, (202) 366&hyph;2036, regarding the public meeting, or Docket Unit, (202) 366&hyph;5046, for copies of material in the docket regarding the proposed rule. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On August 3, 1994, RSPA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), (59 FR 39506), that proposed requirements on pipeline operators to qualify pipeline personnel who perform, or directly supervise those persons performing, regulated operation, maintenance and emergency response functions. This action would amend current standards for training personnel performing operating or maintenance activities on hazardous liquid and carbon dioxide pipelines, and extend those standards to personnel performing similar functions on gas pipelines. This action was taken to ensure that pipeline personnel have the necessary knowledge and skills to competently perform these regulated functions. The intended effect of this proposed rulemaking is to improve pipeline safety by requiring operators to assure the competency of pipeline personnel through training, testing and periodic refresher training. Certain parties have stated a desire to confer with RSPA regarding the issues the NPRM presented. Accordingly, RSPA has determined that a public meeting is appropriate to receive additional comments for consideration in preparing the final rule. The purpose of the meeting is to hear views and receive information from the public. In addition, RSPA officials may ask clarifying questions. Interested persons are invited to attend the meeting and present oral or written statements on matters raised by the NPRM. Any person who wishes to speak should notify Daphen√© Floyd at (202) 366&hyph;1640. Please estimate the time that will be needed to speak. RSPA reserves the right to limit the time of each speaker, if necessary, to ensure that everyone who requests an opportunity to speak is given one. Individuals that are not scheduled to comment will have an opportunity to comment only after approval of the meeting officer. The comment period is extended until October 31, 1994, because the close of the initial comment period follows immediately after this meeting. Therefore, commenters may not have sufficient time to include information from this public meeting in their comments.
