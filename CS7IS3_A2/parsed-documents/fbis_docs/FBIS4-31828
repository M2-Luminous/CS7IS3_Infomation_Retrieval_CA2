A controversial provision of the law orders the defense minister to purchase "Iryda" aircraft from the Mielec Transportation Equipment Plant [WSK Mielec]. This is the first time that Lech Walesa has filed a motion to examine the legality of a law that he had signed before. Lech Walesa has addressed the Constitutional Tribunal to examine the legality of Article 36 of the budget law which orders the defense minister to purchase 3.7 trillion zlotys' worth of arms equipment produced in Poland, including 300 billion zlotys' worth of "Iryda" aircraft manufactured at WSK Mielec. According to the president, in imposing the obligation, the parliament interfered with the powers of the executive branch (the government), and it also breached the constitutional principle of separation of powers. In addressing the tribunal, Walesa fulfilled a request by Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk who even prior to the budget enactment, had made a strongly-worded protest against Article 36. As far back as April, Kolodziejczyk assured journalists that the president had promised him to file a suit over this form of the budget law. "It is a precedent that is unacceptable for legal reasons and for reasons of substance. If the minister is to bear constitutional responsibility for the Armed Forces' readiness, then one must not tie his hands with decisions on how he should spend money," the National Defense Ministry [MON] chief told ZYCIE WARSZAWY yesterday. Sejm imposed the purchase of "Iryda's" from the WSK Mielec on Kolodziejczyk, on a motion of some Sejm deputies -- mainly from the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] -- who are associated with the domestic arms industry. "By devoting the money to buy the `Iryda's,' the parliament made a decision to defend the Polish arms industry," says SLD's Stanislaw Janas who is one of the Sejm deputies. "But that does not mean that we ordered the minister to spend all the money for domestically- produced equipment. The MON budget amounts to almost 48 trillion zlotys, so if the minister wants to spend the remainder of the money abroad, he can do that at any time." We found out only yesterday about the president's motion to the Constitutional Tribunal, but it was submitted there on 24 May which is over three weeks ago. Lech Falandysz, deputy chief of the President's Office, told ZYCIE WARSZAWY: "From a populist standpoint, the meaning of the motion is unfavorable to the president as he is taking a chance on being disliked by the WSK Mielec workforce. We were hesitant for a while on whether or not to file the motion, but in the end, the president said he had promised before to file it, so that is what he did." This was the first time that Lech Walesa addressed the Constitutional Tribunal to examine the legality of a law already in force (which means it must have been signed by him). Thus far, when the president has been very unhappy about a law, he vetoed it first.
