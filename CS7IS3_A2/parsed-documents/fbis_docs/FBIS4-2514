After the meeting, Patten's spokesman said that a statement will be made by Chief Secretary Chan Fang On-sang on the case. Mrs. Chan Fang On-sang did make a statement, saying that the British and Hong Kong governments are naturally concerned about Xi Yang's fate. Obviously, Mrs. Chan was backed by Patten, who was supported by the British Government. Mrs. Chan merely repeated what Patten and the British Government wanted her to say. Because of his involvement in criminal activities incompatible with his capacity as a reporter, MING PAO reporter Xi Yang violated the State Security Law by spying and stealing important state financial secrets. The Beijing judicial organs arrested, tried, and sentenced him in accordance with the law. This is China's internal affair and brooks no foreign interference. Some people in Hong Kong do not understand China's laws and judicial procedures and are not clear about Xi Yang's criminal offense. It is understandable that they have requested more information about the case. However, a handful of figures like Martin Lee and Sze Tu-wah have acted diametrically. On the one hand, they say that they know nothing about the Xi Yang case and "not even the kind of crime of which he is charged." On the other hand, they attacked the Chinese judiciary for being "unfair" and "hostile to the freedom of press," "brutally trampling upon human rights," and "intentionally dealing Hong Kong press circles a head-on blow at the first encounter." Regarding Xi Yang's criminal offenses, officials responsible for the relevant Chinese departments have answered questions raised by the press circles on various occasions, clearly pointing out that he stole state secrets, including the unreleased plans of the People's Bank of China concerning savings interest rate changes, the decisions by the People's Bank of China on participating in international gold bullion transactions, and other major financial secrets. A few days ago, Zhu Yucheng, deputy director of the XINHUA Hong Kong branch, and Lu Ping, director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, gave an account of the nature of the case and the grounds for the sentence. Zhu Yucheng said: It is true that Xi Yang has been convicted of stealing major state financial secrets. As he has violated the "PRC Security Law," he must be handled in light of the "PRC Criminal Procedural Law." The purpose of not trying the Xi Yang case openly is to prevent leakage of state secrets during the trial. This conforms to article 111 of the "PRC Criminal Procedural Law": "Cases involving state secrets or privacy shall not be tried openly." These remarks are based on responsibility and not made willfully by any individual. We believe that the Chinese judicial departments will be very prudent in the arrest, trial, and sentencing of a Hong Kong reporter who has violated the criminal law. Based on evidence and the law, the case will be handled realistically. Wu Jianmin, spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said yesterday: "Each country has its own commercial and economic secrets. If these secrets are stolen, the person involved, of course, must be punished." Has the Hong Kong British authorities not introduced the "Government Security Law" from Britain? In Britain, you cannot make everything public and secrets are not to be leaked. For the sake of Hong Kong's overall interests, former legislative councilor Sit Hao-yan made public some material concerning the airport and he was investigated by security officials for leaking secrets. For the sake of maintaining the secrets of the Independent Commission Against Crime [ICAC], the Hong Kong people are still kept in the dark about the case of Tsui Ka-kit, who was sacked by the ICAC. Naturally, China has its own secrets as well as laws for maintaining secrets. The handling in accordance with the law of a person who has stolen major financial secrets is precisely a manifestation of the legal spirit. We do not know why the Hong Kong British authorities have made indiscreet remarks and shown "concern" over an espionage case. What kind of law is it in the world which allows one to maintain its secrets but does not permit the other to fight against spying? This reminds us of the Han Dongfang case which took place last year. Han was handled according to law and his passport was revoked for violating China's criminal law. Taking advantage of the case, the British Government wantonly carried out provocations and even "showed great concern" by raising it to a diplomatic level. The Hong Kong British authorities attacked China's handling of the Han Dongfang case as "violating human rights" and "contravening the International Law," saying it "would dampen the confidence of the Hong Kong people for a long time to come." The followers of the Hong Kong Alliance for Promoting Democracy in China added fuel to the flames, lodged protests, held sit-in strikes, and stirred up trouble for some time. We can draw the following conclusion, after reviewing the past and current situations: The British side's concern over the "Xi Yang case" is not for the individual. They think that the individual can be used to smear mud over China, incite Hong Kong people's discontent against China, dampen the confidence of the Hong Kong people in their future, and meddle in Hong Kong's smooth transition. All people of goodwill should heighten their vigilance. The British side did not gain any advantage from the Han Dongfang farce which they played in the past. How can they attain their objective with the "Xi Yang case" today?
