Responding to the offer of an unconditional summit made by North Korean leader Kim Il-song, a government official said Tuesday that the two sides will meet beforehand to schedule the summit for July in Seoul or Pyongyang, or a third place named by North Korea. He added, however, that contacts with Pyongyang will follow Seoul's judgement that North Korea is sincere about the summit. The summit's success or failure is totally up to the North Koreans despite varying internal and international conditions, he stressed, forecasting the meeting would be held in July if North Korea showed sincerity. Meanwhile, the government plans to accept any change of date for the preliminary contacts if North Korea counterproposes a date that is within one week of June 28, the date proposed by Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok. If North Korea launches another political offensive, such as the 10-point program adopted by its Supreme People's Council on April 7 last year, the government will stop seeking a summit and instead intensify its efforts to secure a UN resolution imposing sanctions on the North. Earlier Tuesday, Deputy Premier and National Unification Minister Yi Hong-ku met with senior presidential secretary for foreign and national security affairs Chong Jong-uk to discuss preparations for the preliminary contacts.
