FR940202-2-00071 FR940202-2-00053 National Science Foundation Academic Research Infrastructure Program; Notice of Competition The National Science Foundation announces the FY&hyph;1994 competition for the Academic Research Infrastructure Program. This program is designed to improve the condition of research equipment and facilities in our Nation's academic institutions in all areas of science traditionally supported by the National Science Foundation. One of the goals of the program is to assist graduate and undergraduate academic institutions, including those that historically have received limited Federal research and development funds, to improve their academic science and engineering infrastructure. The Program consists of two components: instrumentation and facilities modernization. The former provides support for the acquisition or development of major state-of-the-art research instrumentation. The latter provides support for the renovation and/or repair of existing science and engineering research and research training facilities. In FY&hyph;1994, separate competitions will be held for instrumentation and facilities modernization. The Program expects to allocate approximately $50 million in FY&hyph;1994 for instrumentation and $50 million for facilities modernization. Previous proposal success rates for the program have been 26% for instrumentation and 30% for facilities modernization respectively. Awards for instrumentation will range from $100,000 to $2 million with a required matching/cost sharing at the level between 30&hyph;50% for all institutions. Awards for facility renovation/repair projects will range from $100,000 to $2 million with a required 50% matching/cost sharing on the part of the submitting institution from Ph.D.-granting institutions or at a level between 20% and 50% from non-Ph.D.-granting institutions. It is not the intent of the program to fund new construction or expansion of existing facilities. Proposals may be submitted by institutions of higher education, independent nonprofit research institutions, research museums, and legally incorporated consortia thereof. Proposals for Instrumentation must be received by March 15, 1994, and proposals for Facilities Modernization must be received by April 5, 1994. For additional information and proposal guidelines, call the Office of Science and Technology Infrastructure at (703) 306&hyph;1040, or write to: the National Science Foundation, OSTI, 4201 Wilson Boulevard, Arlington, VA 22230, or send email requests to: ari@nsf (BITNET) or ari@nsf. gov (INTERNET). Dated: January 27, 1994. Sherrie Blevins Green, Program Manager for Academic Research Infrastructure. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;2286 Filed 2&hyph;1&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7555&hyph;01&hyph;M
