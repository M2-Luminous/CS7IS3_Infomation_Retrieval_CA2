They destroyed more than 400,000 of opium plants. The NCB [Narcotics Control Board] team, assisted by CRPF [Central Reserve Police Force] jawans, set on fire the plants spread over 30 plots on April 4, said Mr S. Nag, assistant director of the Bureau, in Calcutta on Monday. According to the Union Finance Ministry sources, opium cultivation is rampant in east Siang and Lohit districts of Arunachal Pradesh for quite some time. Apart from opium, another alarming trend is the massive cultivation of high-quality ganja in the Ukhrul and Senapati districts of Manipur which fetches Rs 1,500 and above a kg. A major haul of about 1.5 tons of Manipur ganja in Calcutta in December last by the NCB is an eye-opener.
