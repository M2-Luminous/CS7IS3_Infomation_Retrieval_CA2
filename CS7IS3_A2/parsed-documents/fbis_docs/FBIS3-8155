[Begin Vacaroiu recording] As you well know, the examination of the possibility for a government reshuffle lasted for quite a long time and created a number of problems in the operation of the executive. Eventually, together with the ruling party, the PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania], we reached the conclusion that in the current very difficult stage, in practical terms it would be best to have a monocolor government team which includes PDSR representatives and some experts. As I mentioned before, we mainly thought that the government team should include highly qualified people and good organizers who are able to implement the reform program for 1994, which is a very complex program. At the same time, we also took into consideration the practice in most countries and the recommendations of the Council of Europe regarding the appointment of civilians, people with high professional qualifications, to the helms of two ministries, the Ministry of National Defense and the Interior Ministry. For example, we chose Gheorghe Tinca, who, as you know, has occupied the position of state secretary with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He is a lawyer by profession. He worked on disarmament issues for a very long time with the United Nations. At the same time, he is a person of integrity, with good professional training. Doru Taracila, currently vice president of the Senate, will occupy the position of minister of interior. He is also a lawyer by profession, with a good training, and a person whom we believe will bring a new moving drive in the activity of finalizing the reform process. But in a primary and very delicate area, we believe Mr. Taracila will carry out a much more intensive activity to fight crime and corruption in Romania together with Mr. Danescu, who will continue to occupy the position of secretary of state and will be deputy interior minister. Our nomination for the position of justice minister, a nomination accepted by Romania's president, was Mr. Chiuzbaian. He is also a lawyer by profession, currently president of the Lawyers' Union of Romania and general inspector in the Ministry of Justice. We believe that he has the necessary qualifications to continue what we have started with Senator Ninosu in this area of reform of the legal system, and we hope that in a very short time he will succeed in finalizing this reform and, at the same time, to lay a new basis for the functioning of prosecuting magistracies in provinces. We proposed Paul Novac for the position of minister of transportation, a proposal also accepted by Romania's president. Mr. Novac currently holds the position of secretary of state in the Ministry of Transportation. He is a fine expert. He has held positions at various levels in the respective specialty, he has managed to fulfill his duties correctly, and we believe that in this very difficult ministry, due to the variety of activities that it has to coordinate, he will succeed in fulfilling his duty and giving a new impetus to the reform process in Romania. These are the four nominations that we have submitted to President Ion Iliescu. Following the analysis carried out in these past days, these nominations have been accepted, and here we are. Today this acceptance took concrete shape in the appointment of the new ministers. I extend them heartfelt wishes for success and, first, I wish to say that I am convinced that they will adjust very rapidly and we will succeed in establishing a competent government team that is capable of implementing the program of reform, which, as I have already mentioned, is a very difficult and complex program. At the same time, however, it is a program expected by the population, because its goal is to end the current crisis, to reduce inflation as much as possible, and to create an adequate framework that will allow for the improvement of people's standard of living. In conclusion, I want to express the hope that the political forces represented in parliament and trade unions will be at our side and will support the new government team in this difficult period. Thank you. [end recording]
