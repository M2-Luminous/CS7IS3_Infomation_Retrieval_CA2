How did the talks with Under Secretary Peter Egardt go, with the Finance Committee, with Lars Tobisson? What will happen to the gasoline tax, child care subsidy, unemployment insurance, and direct write-offs? No information on Wednesday, and the krona makes a jump. But the currency traders deny any New Democratic impact on the exchange rate. Perhaps they have tired of their premature joys and disappointments. Perhaps they have drawn conclusions from the way it has ended up so far. After putting up a lot of fuss New Democracy [NYD] supports the government's policy, satisfied with victories such as lower value-added tax [VAT] for tourists and higher tax for incomes over 16,560 kronor a month. New Democracy itself regards the reduced VAT on hotels, restaurants, and public transportation last summer as its greatest direct victory in the Riksdag. "We succeeded, by acting very educational, in making the others understand how large and important the tourist industry is, that a German who stays four nights in Sweden gives us as much new money as an exported Volvo," says party secretary Marianne Ostlund, who also stresses the founding of Next Stop Sweden. The cut in the VAT is also pointed out in New Democracy's own summary of the second year in the Riksdag. It was not mentioned, however, that the party pushed for elimination of the basic deduction for state income tax in 1994 and 1995. On the other hand, the Conservatives are quick to point out that effort. That New Democracy has arranged for a tax increase for half of Sweden's full-time employees is an argument that could entice renegade Conservative voters back home to the fold. When New Democracy made its comet-like career in the political sky, the Conservatives primarily assumed the role of observer. The Liberal Party and the Social Democrats were those who went to battle against what they categorized as opposition to refugees and populism. Now, apart from the refugee issue in which Bengt Westerberg and Ingvar Carlsson are setting the tone, it is the Conservatives who complain the loudest. Prime Minister Carl Bildt was not kind in his comments after the carnival Wednesday last March, when New Democracy voted against abolishing partial pensions for the second time, although the proposal was a copy of New Democracy's own, and, further, sent back the guidelines for the economic policy to be reworked. Before the vote of confidence for the Bildt government the following week, Education Minister Per Unckel, Lars Tobisson, and party secretary Gunnar Hokmark took New Democracy to task for unreliability and lack of consistency. Now it is time again. Hokmark calls Ian Wachtmeister the "knight of the unions" in a press announcement. "New Democracy acts counterproductively all the time. They say that they want to reduce the power of the unions but oppose the proposal for general unemployment insurance, which in practice means cementing the power of the unions. "If they had been reliable, so that we could have made crisis agreements with them, the small businessmen's tax situation would have improved sooner, as well as the labor legislation. Which is what they say they want. With its behavior New Democracy has come to legitimize agreements across the boundaries, and those are damaging," Hokmark reasons. His colleague in New Democracy, Marianne Ostlund, scoffs at the Conservative attacks. "Since the election we have lost 40 percent of our voters and gotten 40 percent new ones. The new ones are coming from the Conservatives; we are a threat to them. "Moreover, the other parties choose to avoid us, not the opposite. They do not want to see us housebroken. Like when we and the Social Democrats on the Housing Committee had agreed on an ROT [construction materials for Repair, Renovation and Addition] package, the Social Democratic leadership said no for that reason." But the Conservatives and New Democracy do not disagree on everything. The Conservatives, who before the election hoped to use New Democracy as support for more radical change in the public sector, regards New Democracy as a centrist party. Ian Wachtmeister does, too; he often calls New Democracy an extreme center party. This is the reason for the perplexing lack of consistency by New Democracy. On the one hand, on the SAF [Swedish Employers' Federation] and small-businessman side, the party wants to reduce compensation and subsidies levels considerably. On the other hand, the popular leftist side, it is wrong to take money from ordinary people when they have a hard time anyway. The first time this duality became evident was in December 1991. The government proposed freezing child subsidies, and New Democracy threatened to vote with the Social Democrats for raising them by 85 kronor a month at a total cost of 2 billion. This, although the party had already said that it was willing to reduce government spending on family policy and later specified it at minus 22 billion kronor. The Finnish contagion was the primary reason, but New Democracy's threat to oppose contributed to the outflow of currency, which caused the head of the National Bank, Bengt Dennis--since then Wachtmeister's favorite object of hate--to "shoot" the marginal interest rate to 17.5 percent. Wachtmeister bowed to the interest pressure at that time. And later. This Janus face was clearly shown last spring as well, on the issue of lower unemployment compensation. New Democracy's own line is that the compensation should be 70 percent of the wage. But when the government proposed cutting back from 90 to 80 percent, New Democracy imposed new conditions on voting with the government: The VAT must be lowered. Interest rates rose, the krona dropped, and New Democracy gave way once again. But with the promise of later negotiations, which gave us lower VAT for tourists and elimination of the basic state deduction. Naturally, the government is satisfied with the fact that New Democracy is working according to the proverb about empty barrels. But the capriciousness is nerve-racking; here you have a party that talks about deregulation and competition, and then it gets involved in the Telecommunications Agency's rate increases and is prepared to halt the incorporation of the Post Office for raising the postage by 70 ore, yes, even by a 30-ore increase after the Post Office's newly invented discount stamps. Most nerve-racking of all, however, is the way the party acts outside the walls of the Riksdag building. It is a glorious July evening in Almedalen in Visby. A couple of thousand suntanned vacationers. Ice cream, beer, candy, hot dogs. "Come on, come on. You are coming along? Here come we who hate all authority," there booms from the loudspeakers. Ian Wachtmeister is singing along. And Bert Karlsson. But most sparkling of all is Vivianne Franzen's singing. Her passion is contagious. The audience claps in unison. She has it under control. "Soon it will only be a question of time before our schoolchildren must turn to Mecca when praying." "The mathematics are simple. In 60 years the Swedes will be a minority in Sweden. Unless we do something," chairman Ian Wachtmeister fills in. The audience in Almedalen does not protest. But for the politicians of the other parties these statements become another two heavy stones in the mental wall which prevents agreement on issues other than refugee policy. On refugee issues no one makes agreements with New Democracy. But the party's indirect effect is obvious. For example, the government wants to limit the opportunity for reconsidering asylum cases. The Social Democrats want to send asylum-seekers home while their appeals of expulsion decisions are being processed. Kosovo Albanians and Bosnians must have visas. "When extremists get a foothold the point of compromise is shifted to others in their direction," is the summing up of Ingvar Svensson, a Christian Democratic Coalition Riksdag member, who believes that New Democracy has also affected the foreign aid policy, where 1.5 billion of the annual appropriation disappeared in the crisis package. But what happens next? When other parties under the pressure of the Yugoslav tragedy and New Democracy's agitation have placed limits on the asylum opportunities, how should Wachtmeister then proceed in a matter on which the party has leaned so heavily? And how should the party act during the spring Riksdag in order to maintain its antiestablishment image, without for that reason appearing irresponsible? It would be natural to limit the Riksdag squabbles to two issues. Making the child care subsidy conditional on a taxable child support compensation, or cutting back on the parental insurance and fighting for ROT incentives, for example. In the election movement this could be supplemented by lower VAT on services that provide jobs and make small businessmen happy. And refugee policy of course. "I don't know. We are not that strategic, we do not maximize our votes in such clever ways as others. I think there will be more issues--right now there are about eight--since our Riksdag members are involved to such a degree that they cannot be stopped," says party secretary Ostlund, who himself would like to become a member of the Riksdag and anticipates considerable turnover in his own group, since it has to live up to the thesis that long-term representation is bad. Great uncertainty reigns in all parties as to how New Democracy will act when the election approaches. For the Social Democrats it does not matter as long as New Democracy does not submit totally Social Democratic-adapted proposals, which it could be embarrassing to oppose. The ideal for the Social Democrats is for New Democracy to have to leave the Riksdag with 3.9 percent. That figure is nightmarish for the nonsocialist parties. Best of all, of course, they would like for New Democracy to break up chaotically during the spring and be punished with some ridiculous percentage point in the election, while the voters vote for the government to stay. But the next best thing is to continue to govern with the support of New Democracy. In spite of all. New Democracy's Contributions in the Riksdag - Obligatory price labeling in stores remains. - The venture capital companies Atle and Bure. - The Telecommunications Agency was prevented from raising rates for private persons in 1992. - The National Tourist Council replaced the Board for Swedish Image which gives the branch company Next Stop Sweden 100 million kronor. The government wanted to scrap it altogether. - Partial pensions remain. - The retirement age was not raised to 66 years. - The Research Council Board remains. - The cutback in legal aid was prevented. - Stockholm's Teachers' College will be moved to Sodertalje. "All of Greater Stockholm cheered," writes New Democracy in its summary of Year One in the Riksdag. In Year Two, it is assumed, the Sodertalje residents cried, since New Democracy made a 180-degree turnaround and saved the school for Stockholm. - The free radio became freer. More frequencies. - VAT on hotels, restaurants, and public transportation lowered from 21 to 12 percent. - No basic deduction for state income tax in 1994 and 1995.
