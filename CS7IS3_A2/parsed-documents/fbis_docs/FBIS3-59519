This programme, which was already the subject of an initial ministerial discussion in October, has two dimensions which fall in the jurisdiction of the European Community (this part will be the subject of a Council-EP [European Parliament] joint decision) and EURATOM (to be approved by a unanimous decision of the Council, according to Article 7 of the EURATOM Treaty). The political consensus (which should make possible the final adoption of the framework programme before the expiry of the current Parliament's mandate) is still faced with a series of fundamental differences concerning three points: the global amount of expenditure, the breakdown of funds between the various lines of action, the role of the Joint Research Centre (JRC). Discussions are looking tedious and will probably drag into the night. Below are more details regarding the three items. (1) the overall amount of 13.1 billion ECUs proposed by the Commission is still considered too high by several delegations, including the United Kingdom's. On 18 November the EP proposed a 600-million-ECU increase in order to include the THERMIE [European Technologies for Energy Control] programme. This would bring the overall amount to 13.7 billion. A compromise could be reached at the level initially proposed by the Commission, by "freezing" temporarily part of expenditure, to be released at a later phase of execution of the fourth framework programme. This procedure already demonstrated its usefulness on the occasion of the third framework programme (there was also considerable difficulty here concerning funding). (2) the breakdown of funds between the various lines of action to be achieved through specific programmes. The EP would like to place particular importance on non-nuclear energies, socio-economic research, industrial technologies, ECSC [European Coal and Steel Community] research as well as on the promotion of international cooperation and the diffusion and optimalization of research results. Among the national delegations, there is a tendency in favour of work on the environment and life sciences and technologies, in parallel to a certain decline in the primordial interest reserved in the third programme on information technologies and communications. (3) the role of the Joint Research Centre (JRC): the Council is expected to give its political agreement to the guidelines foreseeing that the JRC's institutional activities will be fully financed by the framework programme and that the JRC can participate in Community actions outside the programme (e.g. PHARE [Poland-Hungary--Actions for Economic Reconversion], TACIS [Technical Assistance Program for the CIS], etc.) by benefiting from Community financing linked with these actions in the framework of a competitive approach. Following on what is the case with national laboratories, the competitive part should enable the JRC to offer its expertise for the participation in actions to be implemented according to the "shared financing" formula. The Presidency believes that a political agreement on these three key problems would enable the Council, as part of the joint decision-making procedure with the Parliament, to ratify the 1994-1998 framework programme before the EP is dissolved in spring and to ensure the continuity of the Community's research policy. Minor differences in view remain, however, on other points. The Council should, moreover, have no major problems in adopting: (a) protocol No 2 of the ITER [International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor] Agreement on cooperation between EURATOM, Japan, the Federation of Russia and the United States with regard to activities having to do with the detailed project (EDA) of the experimental thermonuclear reactor; (b) a Council resolution on the future of test reactors. This resolution would mark the Community's interest in safeguarding an adequate and performing potential of such reactors while underlining its concern for the situation of the fuel cycle. The Council will also underscore the importance that it attaches in health care to the medical applications of test reactors, especially for the production of radio-elements indispensable for the diagnosis and therapy of certain illnesses, in particular cancer.
