Introduction Tokyo Electric Power is aggressively pursuing R&D of new energy. Especially promising in this respect is a fuel cell, for which expectations run high when it is implemented as a power generation system closely linked to sites where demands originate. At present, the company is conducting basic research in the fused carbonate and solid electrolyte fuel cell types, while, at the same time, engaging itself in the validation test of the Itsui 11 MW plant using a large capacity installation for regional supply as well as development of element technology involving a phosphate fuel battery. With respect to small-capacity equipment, in order to gain knowledge concerning development of a large-capacity equipment, the company is continuing a validation test aimed at grasping the practical capabilities of plants developed by manufacturers. Following report 2 which appeared in the previous issue, this paper will deal with the 200kW fuel battery installed at Shibaura 4-chome District Thermal Supply Center (Shibaura FHC) focusing on operational condition and performance verifications based on long-term operations. 2. Summary of Plant The fuel battery installed within the Shibaura DHC is a pre-PC-25 battery (the initial lot (53 machines produced) of PC-25 currently being shipped by IFC, an American firm) designated as PCX, a package-type water-cooling atmospheric-pressure battery with rated output, 210 V; and output voltage, 210V, 3&phgr;, 50H. It is possible to obtain heat of approximately 210 Mcal/H when hot water with temperatures in the range 70-80°C constitutes rated capacity. This PCX was installed Kandenko Co. main office building's underground floor in March 1988; after its indoor operations had been verified, it was moved to Shibaura DHC First Plant in May 1990. The Shibaura DHC is designated as the [19.6ha] district by Tokyo Metropolitan Government, and its first plant with its all electric heat supply facility with a receiving capacity of 1,500kW, installed in the underground floor of Shibaura Square Building, consists of a high-efficiency heat pump and a large-scale heat storage tank. Almost all electric output of PCX is consumed as DHC's electric power; moreover, since nearly all exhaust heat can be supplied to heat a storage tank, we are verifying not only reliability and durability of the plant but also conducting a verification test aimed at gaining some idea of the facility's performance as a cogeneration system. 3.

The cumulative generating time set to operating hours of the Kanko Denko Head Office Building as of now, 31 January 1993, is in excess of 17,000 hours. Although the main unit of the battery had been exchanged twice, as a plant, these hours represent the longest operating time in the world. Moreover, immediately after the facility had been moved to the Shibaura DHC, the world record of 3,246 hours were set. Judging from the operating conditions of PCX thus far observed, first of all, at Kandenko Main Office Building, because of the plant's adjustment tests and the initial problems associated with PCX, it was necessary to halt the operations frequently, which contributed to lowering of time availability factor. After it had been moved to Shibaura DHC, however, we enjoyed relatively stabilized operations, raising the time availability factor to 71.1%. However, because of a drop in voltage, it became necessary to limit output. For this reason, the usage ratio based on calendar day was low. After the old battery was replaced by a new one, because of the adjustment tests which made it necessary to stop operations, and combined with invertor problems, the availability factor is somewhat low; however, an average operating load of 137.6kW represents a considerable improvement.

Table 2 shows PCX thermal supply performance of PCX at Shibaura DHC. During the period since August 1989, when operations began, until December 1992, a total of 1,183 Gcal of heat was supplied to the DHC thermal storage tank. This constituted 3.9% of the total heat output at DHC during this period. Especially with respect to the hot water supply, by supplying 50% of the fuel battery's exhaust heat, PCX was able to meet 69.2% of DHC's energy needs. It also is contributing to the production of hot water to some degree. As for cold water, although an adsorption type refrigerator was installed experimentally, with the temperature of hot water at 75°C, enabling PCX to use its heat, COP remained low at 0.3°C even when it was at its highest; consequently we were not able to use it in actual operations. A daily average of the amount of hot water supplied was 1,366Mcal. This represents 26.6% of planned heat output of 5,135Mcal at the rated operation time (214kcal/H). Although this figure is somewhat lower than the calendar day usage ratio of 32%, we were able to use 85.2% of heat generated by the PCX plant at DHC. 4. Battery Main Unit In June 1991, because of a drop in battery voltage, the main unit of the original PCX battery became incapacitated when its cumulative power generating time reached 10,250 hours. It was then replaced by a reserve battery, PCX No.1 equipment (validation test completed at the company's New Tokyo Thermal Power Station) which already had put in 5,000 hours. Like the original battery, under the similar circumstances, this one also stopped working in May 1992, when a cumulative total of operation hours reached 9,723. It became evident from this that the durability of PCS battery's main unit, namely, its effective life, is approximately 10,000 hours. However, since reformer and other equipment still are functioning well, we had decided to replace only the battery's main unit and to continue our test until 1996. Fig. 1. Properties of Battery I-V We assembled Toshiba 200kW battery's main unit (prototype No. 1), which has the same specifications as ONSI Company product PC-25, a modified version of PCX, into the PCX plant. In August 1992, jointly with Toshiba, we began testing its effective life value. With respect to the PC-25, based on its experience with the original PCX battery, the company improved part of the material and changed battery's current density from 300mA/cm<sup> 2</sup> to 235mA/cm<sup> 2</sup> . In addition to the change made in its form and setting of piping, modifications in control systems and cooling conditions through raising of rated voltage became necessary. In replacing the PCX battery with the PC-25, we studied the extent to which these can be matched. The properties of Toshiba 200kW battery's initial I-V are shown in Fig. 1. In comparison with the PCX battery, the battery voltage, including the part in which battery's current density is decreased, has been raised substantially. Fig. 2. Energy Balance at 200kW Fig. 2 shows the energy balance (obtained when accumulated hours reached 2,500) of the plant equipped with the new 200kW battery. Power generating efficiency is as high as 36.6%. When this figure is compared with the 30.2% efficiency of the PCX battery (the value obtained when accumulated operating hours reached 5,600 as had been reported previously), it became clear that the increase in battery voltage has resulted in the substantial increase in efficiency. However, gain in power-generation efficiency was counterbalanced by a decrease in exhaust heat recovery efficiency. As a result, we obtained an overall efficiency of 79%, approximately the same as that of the PCX battery. Fig. 3 traces changes which occurred in battery voltage as of February 1993 during the course of power generation for over 2,000 hours. The test data covers the use of the plant for only a short period of time, and in comparison with that of the PCX battery, a drop in voltage of the new battery is small, and effects of start-stop are not clearly shown. Fig. 3. Shift in Battery Voltage Through Time (Equivalent With the exception of the test period devoted to data collection, thus far, because of the invertor problems, the plant operating load was restricted, not exceeding 150kW. 5. Long-Term Usage Conditions of Reactor In order to improve the reliability of the fuel battery, important problems which must be dealt with, in addition to that of the battery's main unit, have to do with achieving longer effective life of a reformer and other chemical reactor catalysts. Since the beginning of operations, we hardly have had any problem with the reformer and low-temperature fuel processing units (desulfurizer and CO transformer) of this PCX, still going strong after over 17,000 hours of continuous operations. These will serve as a valuable validation data. With this test research, in order to validate plant's performance, including twice-a-year load tests, we conducted from time to time the analysis of gas constituents found at the outlets of the reformer, CO transformer, battery anode and cathode. Fig. 4 shows relationships between the conversion rate of the reformer's methane [= (CO+CO<inf> 2</inf> ) / (CO+CO<inf> 2</inf> +CH<inf> 4</inf> )], thus far obtained from analytical results, and reforming pipe temperature. Also shown in Fig. 4 is the city gas flow rate. During this period, because of the problems involving PCX battery's main unit and a change made in the temperature setting of the reforming pipe, output-reforming temperature relationships are found to vary. Fig. 4. Reforming Pipe Temperature and Methane Conversion When we examine the same output (city gas flow rate) shown in this figure, we can see that the methane conversion rate increases as the reforming temperature climbs. The dotted lines of the graph represent the conversion rate of methane reforming reactions in a chemical equilibrium state when the difference between the reforming pipe temperature and internal reaction temperature is hypothetically set at 50°C under the same reaction condition (1 atm. S/C=3.5). When a load is low, we can see that the tendency is to approach fairly close to equilibrium state. Moreover, as flow rate increases, a methane conversion rate tends to go down; for this reason, it appears that the setting of reforming pipe temperature is raised so that the conversion rate can be maintained at a certain level. Fig. 5. Change in Performance of Reformer and CO Fig. 5 below shows changes occurring in methane and CO transformer's conversion rates through time. The methane conversion rate is designed to compensate temperature so that, as shown in Fig. 4, the CPX's original reforming pipe temperature can be set up (for output). As you will see from the graph that under 100kW output hardly any changes occur in methane conversion rate since the beginning of the operations. Recently, however, output is exceeding 150kW, causing substantial reduction in the methane conversion rate. At present, even if the methane conversion rate should become lower, since the hydrogen usage ratio of the battery's main unit is not increasing out of proportion, we do not have any process problems. It will be necessary, however, to monitor the situation in the future. Effects of the CO conversion rate [=Co<inf> 2</inf> / (CO+CO<inf> 2</inf> )] on the flow rate and temperature, on the other hand, are relatively small. Consequently, the plant is able to maintain good operating conditions since the beginning, to date, showing hardly any performance degradation. With respect to the desulfurizer, moreover, since sulfur content of the city gas is low, about 5 ppm (odorant), it is not possible to obtain data containing dusulfurization ratio. However, for the present, we see no strong indication of toxic effects involving the reformer. In the future, as long as power generation goes smoothly, we intend to continue with the validation of the durability of these reaction catalysts. 6. Plant Reliability Since this PCX plant is a testing machine, we had had many problems in the beginning. After it was moved to Shibaura DHC, however, with the exception of gradual degradation of the battery's main unit itself, we were able to enjoy relatively stable operations. However, at present, it has yet to reach the level of practicality required of a commercial machine. The number of troubles which occurred in the course of CPX operations are categorized and summarized in Table 3. From July 1991 to June/July 1992, a cut-off period at Shibaura DHC, the replacement of the old battery with the new and an overall maintenance of the facility were carried out. Because of the operating experience and the state of PCX No. 1, the maintenance work, including a preventive measure, carried out for 1992 consisted of the following: replacing a water condenser and a cooling water circulation pump reserve; changing an air-flow-control valve and the type of non-stoppage electric source unit; use of domestic electric parts products; and a complete exchange of cooling water piping packing.

Moreover, degradation of the PCX battery's main unit and corrosion of the heat exchanger, considered typical phosphate fuel battery problems, also have occurred. When viewed in terms of the period involved, because of the effects of the enforced measure, the number of failures per 1,000 hours gradually has been decreasing, especially a clear trend for improvement, insofar as the same types of troubles are concerned, is emerging. However, because of the long-term operations, new troubles also are being generated. Our plan is to examine causes of these troubles and implement a measure for improvement so that the same problems will not occur in the next generation of the equipment developed. After August 1992, as facility maintenance began to take effect, water leaks and rudimentary electrical problems began to decrease. However, the fact that the plant controller's PI/O base broke down twice indicates the need for improvement in instrumentation and control systems. As a problem involving unmanned equipment occurring since August 1992, we must mention a failure of the invertor which hit us immediately after the old battery was replaced by the new. Because a fuse was cut and a transistor sustained a damage, it became necessary to shut down the plant. The same thing happened again when the invertor pole was replaced. Since we experienced hardly any problems when operating with the 150kW battery, we came to the conclusion that this might have been caused by assembling the main battery unit with high voltage into the invertor without providing any design margin. By making various measurements around the invertor, we were able to identify electric parts which possibly could be exceeding utilization requirements. In February 1993, the invertor's condenser, fuse, and other electric parts were replaced, and their installation verified the stable operations of the PCX plant at the rated output. 7. Future Test Schedule Our plans are to undergo pre-utilization inspection necessitated by the change made in the battery, subsequent to which, to continue the verification of durability of the new fuel battery and of effective catalytic life of the reformer and mono-oxidation transformer until 1996. At the same time, we plan to examine an actual operating setup by carrying out operations and by simplifying maintenance. In addition, our plans include introduction of the Tomitsu Energy Park's 50kW battery and three other small equipment, and we hope to fully utilize our experience gained through the operation of the PCX plant in developing these battery equipment.
