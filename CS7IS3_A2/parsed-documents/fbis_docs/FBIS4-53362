FBIS4-53362 "dreas095_d_94007" FBIS-EAS-94-095 Daily Report 17 May 1994 South Korea Peace Foundation Clarifies Remarks Peace Foundation Clarifies Remarks SK1705031294 Seoul YONHAP in English 0305 GMT 17 May 94 SK1705031294 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Washington, May 17 (YONHAP) -- Kim Tae-chung's Asia-Pacific Peace Foundation on Monday clarified the former opposition Democratic Party [DP] chairman's remarks about North Korea's possible possession of nuclear weapons, which have been causing a stir in South Korean political circles. In an interview with THE WASHINGTON TIMES, Kim Tae-chung, who is visiting the United States, reportedly said that North Korea's possession of two or three nuclear bombs is nothing compared with the Western world which has more than 20,000. Kim's comment was interpreted in South Korea as meaning that it would not pose much of a problem even if Pyongyang had two or three nuclear bombs. The remark created shock waves in Seoul since it came only days after the minister of the National Unification Board (NUB), Yi Hong- ku, said if Pyongyang developed or had "even one-half of a nuclear bomb," it would be regarded by Seoul as nullifying the inter-Korean denuclearization declaration. "Below the statement in question is an underlying principle that North Korea should not develop nuclear weapons under any circumstances," said the Asia-Pacific Peace Foundation. Yi yong-chak, director of the foundation's Washington office, said Kim made the remark in response to a WASHINGTON TIMES interviewer's question on whether the United States should not redeploy nuclear weapons in South Korea if the international community could not stop North Korea from developing nuclear arms. Yi said Kim Tae-chung replied to the question by saying that it would be meaningless to redeploy nuclear weapons in South Korea. Under circumstances where the United States has several tens of hundreds of nuclear bombs, it would mean nothing even if North Korea came to possess two or three atomic weapons, Kim Tae-chung was quoted by Yi as telling THE WASHINGTON TIMES. Kim said he opposed the redeployment of nuclear weapons in South Korea, according to Yi. Kim stated further that if North Korea managed to acquire nuclear weapons, it could never establish diplomatic relations with the United States and other Western countries. They would be of no help to North Korea either, Kim added. The strong reaction to Kim's statement in South Korea was prompted by press reports that took his remarks out of context, Yi said. In its report, THE WASHINGTON TIMES quoted Kim as saying that even if Pyongyang has nuclear weapons, they would be useless if "we don't attack North Korea." Kim was also reported to have said the no. 1 priority for North Korea is not developing nuclear weapons but improving relations with the United States. Washington should offer to establish diplomatic relations with Pyongyang as well as security guarantees as part of a package deal, Kim said. If North Korea rejected such a proposal, then China would join U.N. sanctions against its neighbor, Kim predicted.
