Even if their predictions are true, astrologers do not mean to tell the truth. Their predictions are lies based on probability, which could, by sheer coincidence, be true on certain occasions. By the same token, traitors are also liars, even if they tell the truth. One might hear nice words and admire them. However, once one finds out who uttered these words, their sense is lost and their beauty turns into insults and vulgar expressions. "We have fought honorably, and we make peace honorably." Beautiful words, right? You will laugh when you find out who said these words and when. The speaker is Hafiz al-Asad and the occasion is his meeting with his new lord, Clinton. It is common knowledge that Hafiz al-Asad had no honor on two occasions during which fighting was truly honorable. The first is the June war, when al-Asad was defense minister, and gave the Golan as a gift to the Zionist entity. The second is the October war when Damascus was about to be captured had it not been for the chivalrous Iraqi leadership and its heroic army that came to the rescue. The Iraqi army removed the enemy and drew up a plan for attack and infiltration into the enemy's defenses. However, only hours before carrying out the plan, it was surprised that the "honorable fighter" had accepted a cease-fire, because its premeditated objective was "provocation" rather than liberation. We do not want to do injustice to the man. Therefore, we testify that he displayed "honor" on many occasions in which fighting was not honorable. He had the "honor" of destroying the city of Hamah and killing 25,000 of its people and supervising the massacre of the Tadmur desert prison. He had the "honor" of killing Palestinians and the national movement in Lebanon since the 'Ayn al-Rummanah events in 1975 and up until now. He had the "honor" of watching, and sometimes assisting in, the Zionist army's attacks on Lebanon. He had the "honor" of watching the massacre of the Palestinians in Sabra and Shatila. The highest order of "honor" won by Hafiz al-Asad was through two stands in which he expressed his "national honor" which he brags about more than extremist nationalist leaders. The first, when he "honorably" sided by the Iranian aggression against Iraq for eight years. The second, when he had the "honor" of participating, along with the allied forces, in the 30-state aggression against Iraq. A person displaying all this "honor" in his fights will definitely have the "honor" of throwing himself into the lap of the cousins (Rabin and Peres). Even if the Golan returns through a disgraceful settlement, al-Asad still bears the disgrace of surrendering it and leaving it for 27 years without liberation. We are here talking about usurped Syrian Arab territory, and not Jerusalem, Baysan, or Nazareth. Indeed, traitors are liars, even if they tell the truth.
