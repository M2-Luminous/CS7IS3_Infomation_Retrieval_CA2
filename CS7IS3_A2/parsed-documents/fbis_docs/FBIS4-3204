The CPC does not like to listen to such criticism and has always denied this, saying that this is Chinese-style socialist democracy, which is more democratic than Western parliaments. Is the NPC system democratic, or is it a rubber stamp of the CPC? Let the Second Session of the Eighth NPC held by the CPC not long ago answer the question. Qiao Shi Urges Deputies To Hold Deliberations According to the Agenda Arranged by the Congress Prior to the convocation of the congress, Qiao Shi summoned the chiefs of all the delegations, set forth the tasks, urged them to hold deliberations according to the agenda arranged by the congress, and told them to not go too far or make unexpected proposals. In light of CPC general practice, interim party groups are established for holding national-level meetings, which form small groups, branches, and provisional party committees composed of party-member deputies. On the day before the opening of the congress, a preparatory meeting of party members is held and they are requested to carry out the orders from the top. The presidium published in the press is merely a form shown to the public. It is the central group of the congress which commands, leads, and exercises control over the congress. Through the interim party committees and basic level party organizations (branches and groups) of the delegations, the central group firmly exercises control over operation of the congress. Motions Deviating From the Congress Agenda The central group is most worried about the proposals and motions presented by the deputies which deviate from the congress agenda. Prior to the current congress, a number of bills and proposals deviating from the congress agenda were submitted. During the session, the deputies again made bills, proposals, and joint speeches, which deviated from the congress agenda: Deputies Strongly Demand That Officials Make Public Their Property Deputies from Shanghai, Tianjin, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang strongly demanded that members of the CPC Central Committee's Political Bureau, state councillors, NPC vice chairmen and CPPCC vice chairmen who are party members, and ministers of various committees and ministries give an account of their economic status, as well as the political, economic, and working conditions of their dependents and relatives so that they can be placed under NPC supervision and can win popular trust. When deputies from the Shandong and Jiangsu delegations planned to submit such a joint motion to the congress for examination, the central group and the party committees of some delegations held that the motion "overstepped the bounds." Qinghai Blames Central Leadership for Damaging Its Own Reputation A deputy from Qinghai pointed out that the central leadership called for support for the poor provinces to end their backwardness, but no funds have been allocated and a request for enjoying the preferential policies similar to the coastal areas was not even approved. As a result, local leaders and masses said: The central leadership is saying one thing but doing another, thus damaging its own reputation. Ningxia Deputies Complain About the New Tax System The deputies from Ningxia had a different view on the State Council's tax reform and revenue-sharing system: To narrow the gap between regions and assist the development of the backward, poor, and remote regions, a different tax system should be formulated in light of the economy, output value, and base figures of each province, municipality, and autonomous region. Deputies From Beijing and Hebei Say Streamlined Cadres Incompetent Deputies from Beijing and Hebei pointed out: Party and government organs have not taken due action in the work of streamlining cadres. Some of the streamlined cadres have sought employment in economic entities, financial organizations, or large joint venture. When they cannot not make a gain or the conditions are inferior to their former units, they resume their former positions and some even get a promotion. Last year, the number of cadres streamlined was less than 10 percent of the set target. The motion submitted by the Beijing delegation said: As streamlining constitutes an important measure of reform, it should become a regular work and the set target must be met on schedule. Triads Running Wild in Shanxi A Shanxi deputy urged the NPC Standing Committee's survey team to probe into the activities of triads in Shanxi. The deputy pointed out: The provincial government and the procuratorial and judicial organs always try to shift their responsibility by saying that the "problems are thorny" and "most of them constitute a problem among the people." The deputy said: The problem lies in the government leaders. When the question was raised by the deputy, the delegation party committee called for seeking unity of thinking and not raising the issue. But some deputies asked the party committee: What is the motive behind that? Inner Mongolia Requests the Preferential Policies of a Special Economic Zone A deputy from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region submitted a motion asking the central leadership to ratify Inner Mongolia's request to enjoy preferential policies similar to the Hainan Special Economic Zone [SEZ] so that they can open the door to the Republic of Mongolia and Russia. Some deputies proposed that leaders of the autonomous region and prefecture governments should be composed of the local nationals. Hainan Wants To Set Up Red Light Districts A Hainan deputy asked whether the government could make legislation, allowing Haikou and Sanya to set up red light districts, which would enable the two cities to become more like a capitalist society, enhance social order, and increase revenue. Shandong Urges Separation of Party Leadership From Government Administration A Shandong deputy said: The people's congresses are the highest organs of state power. But they have actually become subsidiaries of the party committees and governments. This does not conform to the PRC Constitution. Party organizations should not meddle in government work. The functions of the party should be separated from those of the government and the party committee secretary and deputy secretaries must not concurrently take up the offices of government and the people's congress. Hubei Wants To Embody the Authority and Dignity of the "People's Congress" A Hubei deputy said: To embody the authority and dignity of the people's congress, it is necessary to first establish the status and functions of the people's congress. The functions and powers of the people's deputies should be defined so that they are representative. The proportion of nonparty figures and mass representatives should account for over 35 percent, and gradually increase to over 55 percent, which can fully represent the people of all strata. Deputies from Hubei plan to jointly submit a motion with the Hunan deputies: To fully embody the authority and representativeness of the people's congress, we propose that the proportion of nonparty figures and mass representatives be set at over 35 percent, which will be raised to over 45 percent at the 14th NPC. Anhui Deputies Want Veto Power and the Right To Remove Officials In light of the powers authorized by the constitution on people's deputies, a deputy from Anhui pointed out that people's deputies have the right to address the people's congress on examining and removing incompetent officials and even ministers, the premier, and the president. The standing committees of the people's congresses have the right to veto the decisions, policies, and personnel arrangements of the governments at all levels. However, the people's congresses at all levels are actually under the control of the relevant party committees. Deputies From Three Northeast Provinces Demand War Compensation From Japan A total of 120 deputies from Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang submitted a joint motion: The Japanese authorities must openly apologize for the aggressive war launched against China and compensate for the losses incurred on the Chinese people. It is said that Hubei deputies also submitted a similar motion, demanding that Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa apologize to the Chinese people during his visit to China. Qiao Shi's "Three-Point Instruction" In the face of these motions, Qiao Shi made a three-point instruction at a meeting of chiefs of the delegations held on 13 March: First, the interim party committees and central groups of all delegations should offer guidance in light of the main theme of the NPC and CPPCC sessions and correct the deviations. Second, regarding practices which exceed the limits during the session, persuade as much as possible and give full play to the key role of the central groups. Third, the main theme should be stressed and unity of thinking and views should be sought at the party committee and central group meetings. Measures must be adopted to avoid unnecessary motions and bills, which might affect the session. At the meeting, Li Ruihuan said: When someone has gone too far, you should step out and stress the main theme of the congress at all times. The party committees and central groups of all delegations must have their delegation well in hand and try to stop the bills and motions that overstep the bounds. Qiao Shi summoned the chiefs of the delegations to a meeting on 16 March, where he urged them to keep to the main theme at the final stage of the session and to not let the problems which deviate from the main course affect the achievements attained at the session. Qiao Shi emphasized: Full play should be given to the role of the core of all delegations. Obviously, the bills and motions submitted by the deputies to the congress reflect popular will to a certain extent. It is the public opinion taken from the lower to the top levels. Instead of accepting such public opinion, the CPC attacked the practice and tried by every means to strangle these "unexpected motions." Can this be interpreted as democracy? Conversely, they imposed their theme to the congress and to the people at the basic levels. Is this what they call Chinese-style socialist democracy? At the NPC session, Qiao Shi gave a vivid lesson to the deputies, enabling them to clearly see through the so-called Chinese-style socialist democracy.
