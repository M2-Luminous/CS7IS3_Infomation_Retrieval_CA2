This is aimed at ensuring the safety of those people and that of the Vietnamese inhabitants as well. The report also indicates that foreigners have been deceived bitterly by local people while the former, in turn, have created no less multitudinous insecurity and anarchy among the Vietnamese people and government. In Cambodia, residents and foreigners, especially the Vietnamese and Thais, are in a similar situation and are even more powerful than those in Vietnam. They are living in an uncontrolled manner and have created indecency throughout the country. They are currently polluting the environment along rivers and in villages; destroying fine ancient traditions; causing insecurity in society; and committing thievery, robbery, dupery, prostitution, obscenity, vices, and so on. As for the Government of the Kingdom of Cambodia, it has lately striven to produce an immigration law with the aim of taking different measures to restore social order. Some local political analysts have expressed the belief that the political situation in Cambodia will ease to some extent if the government strives to codify the immigration law quickly and if the National Assembly speedily adopts it. Owing to the lack of a law, it is hard to organize these foreign residents in an orderly fashion. The delay in the promulgation of the law has been severely criticized. It is also known that an anti-Vietnamese demonstration recently was deterred. Analysts are of the opinion that there will be obstacles in the implementation of the law as the problem of Vietnamese in Cambodia is complicated and also has political implications. It is expected that there will be some reaction from the Vietnamese Government after the immigration law is enacted and after its enforcement. It, however, is hoped that the settlement of the issue of foreign residents in Cambodia will help ease some of the problems surrounding the issue of a roundtable meeting between the government and the Khmer Rouge.
