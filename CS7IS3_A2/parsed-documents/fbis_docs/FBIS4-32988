The so-called "Majority Current" and the "Democratic Left" canceled each other out. Take, for example, the lists of 113 candidates for Sandinist Assembly membership to be elected at the Congress. Only five were registered on both lists. That does not mean that all the other candidates were militants of the other group. The two tried to attract votes to their lists, including those allegedly "without any leanings," which means they were undecided. They also tried to obtain support by including candidates in exchange for mutual support. This way of making up the lists led some to rebel, or at least that was the case with the Democratic Left. During the period for registering nominations for the National Directorate (DN), Bayardo Altamirano registered independently. He later refused to decline in favor of Damaso Vargas, even after the names of the Sandinist Assembly were announced. That is why there were 16 leftist candidates on the ballot. There was basic agreement on line of thought and on the lists presented by the two tendencies. But the voters gave themselves some leeway, which led to some surprises in the final results. This explains why neither list managed to overshadow the other. Of the total 113 members elected to the Sandinist Assembly, 45 were from the national roster, of which 26 were on the Democratic Left list and 17 were on the Majority Current list. Meanwhile, two names were on both lists: Francisco Rivera and Lucio Jimenez, who is considered an "orthodox," but is known to lean toward the Majority. There were 41 lists, of the total 68 departmental lists, registered by Democratic Left and 27 by the Majority. Of the 15 members of the DN, 10 were on the Democratic Left list and five were in the Majority. One of the 10 leftists was a declared Majority supporter. A second was Bayardo Arce, who took no sides until the last minute when he simply threw his support to Commander Daniel Ortega. The two most outstanding surprises were those not elected to the DN: Sergio Ramirez, the main Majority leader, and Julio Lopez, who was not elected to the Sandinist Assembly. Everybody thought Lopez was the Democratic Left's ideologist and main leader. Another indication that the election results were unpredictable is that out of the 113 members of the Sandinist Assembly elected, 22 won more than 300 votes, but only three are Democratic Left cadres: Daniel Ortega, Tomas Borge, and Lumberto Campbell. In addition, 17 received less than 200 votes, and out of these 12 belong to the Democratic Left, including outstanding cadres such as Felix Contreras, Emmet Lang, and union leaders Mario Quintana, Gustavo Porras, and Damaso Vargas. In fact, three of their running mates made it through the women's quota: Ruth Herrera, Janeth Chavez, and Maria Esther Solis. It does not seem then that one list had the upper hand. The congress was full of contrasts: The Majority current had as candidate Victor Manuel Gallegos (Pedrito el Hondureno), who certainly does not represent the "renewal" and "democratic" sector. Another contrast was that during the heat of the debates, when the Sandinist Assembly was already elected and it seemed that the Democratic Left had "crushed" the Majority, a "negotiation" was suggested for the sake of unity to choose a "balanced Directorate." Fernando Cardenal made the proposal public and official. In practice, this would have meant negotiating a single roster ballot. The proposal came from the Majority, whose members were the biggest critics of single roster ballots during the First Congress. Confusion came out of the Congress. It is said that Mariano Fiallos was purged even though he was one of the candidates sought the most by both trends. The truth is that he declined both candidacies because of his work with the Supreme Electoral Tribunal. Another contrasting fact is that the Democratic Left has on its list people like Lucio Jimenez and Sandra Ramos, among whom is not only a pending legal suit but a sharp political confrontation regarding the legitimacy of property claimed by the CST [Jose Benito Escobar Sandinist Workers Federation] from the Women's Secretariat. There was also Roberto Gonzalez who competed with Lucio Jimenez for the post of CST secretary general, which also added to the polarization felt in this Congress. There was surprise at the election of barely known or unknown Miskito Thomas Tooker, from Rio Coco, who campaigned alone and managed, without being on any list, to obtain 180 votes to represent the RAAN [Northern Atlantic Autonomous Region].
