He said such an appointment is necessary because the former PAC chairman, Datuk Dr. Affifuddun, was recently appointed parliamentary secretary for the Ministry of Finance. Speaking in the discussion of an emergency motion this evening, he said the appointment of a PAC chairman from among opposition members of Parliament would mean that the government is proving that it is sincere and serious. He said that despite the losses suffered during two successive years, the PAC has still been unable to act, because it does not have a chairman. "The government needs to prove it is serious by creating a Royal Investigation Commission to investigate the financial scandal," he said. He said he feels that the foreign exchange losses recently suffered by the Central Bank are the result of "gambling." As an example, he cited the case of Mongolia, where two former central bank governors and three of their employees were prosecuted for negligence and exceeding their authority when they gambled in the foreign currency market, producing losses of $90 million. In his lengthy discussion, Lim, who is a DAP member of Parliament from Jelutong, took part in urging the government to admit that it had injected 3 billion ringgit into the BNM's account to resolve the problem of a net shortage of 2.01 billion ringgit. "The government was willing to do that in order to provide enough capital funds for the BNM to operate and to restore the power and image of the governor and other bank officials," he declared. He questioned the capability of the BNM, which has acted as savior of financial institutions facing problems, because the BNM itself is in a financial crisis.
