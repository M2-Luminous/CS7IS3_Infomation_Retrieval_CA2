The consumption of non-renewable fossil fuels is "barbarianism," he said, but emphasized that safety principles had to be respected in nuclear power plants. Benda has been opposed to putting into operation the nuclear power plant now being under construction in Temelin, south Bohemia, until a "nuclear" law is passed by the parliament. The law is to clearly define the plant operator's responsibilities and address burnt-out fuel dumping. The "Velvet Revolution" did not solve environmental problems; in fact, the environment is being destroyed now even more than in the past, Benda said. "Let us not delude ourselves by thinking advanced European countries do not overexploit the environment. At home they keep everything neat and orderly, but their waste often ends up in developing countries," he cautioned. In Germany, the government subsidizes waste treatment, and waste is sold to the Czech Republic for low prices, Benda said, adding that this had led many Czech waste treatment plants to started buying waste from Germany. The problem will have to be solved by the proposed law on waste. The passage of that bill has been delayed in part because the Trade and Industry Ministry has not yet prepared a bill on packaging, Benda said.
