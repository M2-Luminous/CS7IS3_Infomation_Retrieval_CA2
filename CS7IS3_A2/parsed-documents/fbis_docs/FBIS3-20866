Stazic: "Stipac Provoked Rift in HSS"] [Text] Zagreb--The suspended members of the Croatian Peasants' Party [HSS], Mirko Madjor and Dr. Josip Stojanovic, confirmed at a news conference on Monday that the rift in the party that they had announced has happened. The crisis of such dimensions, in their words, was not triggered by them but by HSS President Drago Stipac and Chief Secretary Mirko Glokovic. Pointing to the further violation of the bylaws, Madjor claims that Stipac has introduced tyranny into the HSS political tyranny, which is contrary to the party's traditions. Both Madjor and Stojanovic assert that a recent meeting of the HSS Executive Committee was not conducted according to the bylaws, and that Madjor, because of a telephone threat, was prevented from participating in the meeting. Following all of this, and especially following the Stipac interview in SRPSKI GLASNIK in which he expressed his concurrence that Croatia become a federation and a national state of the Croat and Serb peoples, Madjor states that what is at issue in the HSS is not just a conflict over organizational, personnel, and financial issues, but a conflict of the political and ideological views of Stupac and a group of people that surrounds him as well as the "Kasinska" group. Madjor and Stojanovic are also convinced that the public will soon find out on whose account and in whose interest Stipac set off the conflict in the HSS. In a rather long speech, Ante Babic, an HSS member and a minister plenipotentiary, as well as head of the Information Section in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, gave his views, or rather aired the dirty linen of the HSS publicly. That is to say, Babic had been declared a "mole of the HDZ [Croatian Democratic Community]" by some HSS Presidency members. Defending himself, Babic stated that the epithet of "HDZ mole" would be more suitable for Drago Stipac because, "I have heard him say innumerable times that he had agreed precisely on this with President Tudjman." Babic said of Stipac that he is a "very narrow-minded person who is not even capable of managing a local community, not to mention the HSS." Stating that Dr. Tihomir Radja, a member of the HSS Presidency, is close to Liberal circles, Babic informed Stipac that it is precisely Radja who wanted to carry out a coup last year in the HSS while he, as a president of the party, was on a visit to Canada, and that Madjor and Stojanovic prevented Radja from doing so. Babic at the end warned Drago Stipac that, now that he no longer has people like Madjor and Stojanovic who are loyal to him, Radja and the "present leadership of the HSS" will remove him from his position as head of the party.
