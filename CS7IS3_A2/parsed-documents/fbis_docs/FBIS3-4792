Hiroshi Kumagai, international trade and industry minister, disclosed that he had talks with U.S. Ambassador to Japan Walter Mondale last weekend. Mondale said Japan has more to do to open its auto market than addressing macroeconomic issues, Kumagai told a regular press conference. Mondale spoke "very harshly" on Japan's trade stance, said Kumagai. Kumagai's remarks indicate Tokyo's understanding that the United States places highest priority on auto and auto parts issues under the bilateral trade "framework" talks. Kumagai said the Japanese auto industry should "listen earnestly" to U.S. discontent over slow access to the Japanese auto market, which is to suggest the industry should push ahead with a voluntary plan to expand purchases of U.S.-made automobiles and auto components. On the state of the nation's economy, Kumagai said there are signs of an increase in activity, citing the latest improvement in employment and manufacturing statistics. It is still unclear if the recession has bottomed out or not but overall sentiment has turned upward, he noted. It is unlikely that Japan's economy alone would stay in the doldrums, Kumagai said.
