With the goal of finding out any trends in auto wheel weight in the marketplace and providing basic resource data for future wheel manufacturing, the Light Metal Wheel Committee of the Japan Light Metal Association conducted a study in June and July of this year. The committee conducted a survey on steel wheels and the light metal alloy wheels (solid and fabricated) manufactured by the companies comprising the committee, and they looked at the narrowest, widest, and greatest quantity (the average value for the product made and sold in the greatest quantity) for each rim size. The results show that although the survey makes no distinction between wheels used on passenger cars and those used on trucks and busses, there is a large difference in weight between light metal alloy wheels and steel wheels when they are used on trucks and busses. Among light metal alloy solid wheels, those with the narrowest rims seek lighter weight, whereas attractive design is most valued in those with the widest rims. In the 17 inch wheels, the study found weight differences as large as 6.8 kg. In the case of light metal fabricated wheels, however, the change in the weight difference at each rim size was not as clear cut. Because there is no clear distinction between steel wheels used on passenger cars and trucks, a simple comparison is difficult, but the variation in weight difference for each rim size of the narrowest wheels represented only the difference in volume, and there was almost no variation due to design. As a result, the committee learned that the change in the weight difference at each rim size varies similarly for both steel wheels and light metal alloy solid wheels. There was almost no difference in weight between solid and fabricated light metal alloy wheels, and when there was a difference it was less than one kilogram. However, the difference between light metal alloy wheels and steel wheels grows larger over 15, 16, and 18 inches, with the difference being 5-6 kg at 16 inches, and about 18 kg at 18 inches. Graph
