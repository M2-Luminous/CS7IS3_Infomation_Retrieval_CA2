SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Student Loan Reform Act of 1993, enacted on August 10, 1993, established the Direct Loan Program under the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA). See Subtitle A of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;66). Under the Direct Loan Program, loan capital is provided directly to student and parent borrowers by the Federal Government rather than through private lenders as in the Federal Family Education Loan Program.

The standards for participation in the Direct Loan Program in the second year were published in the Federal Register on February 17, 1994 (59 FR 8080). The Secretary will select schools for the 1995&hyph;1996 academic year from schools that respond to the February 17, 1994 invitation to participate in the Direct Loan Program, as well as those eligible schools that applied for the 1994&hyph;1995 academic year.
