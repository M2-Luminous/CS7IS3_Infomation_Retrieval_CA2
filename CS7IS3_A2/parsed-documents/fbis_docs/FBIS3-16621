In the opinion of certain Western politicians, the present states of relations between Russia and the United States is characterized by this term. The "Cold" War and open military confrontation have ended.... Both sides have been expressing seemingly very appealing and correct slogans about cooperation, but in practice.... Furthermore, it is practice which shows that fundamentally new relations -- businesslike relations befitting partners who respect one another -- are taking shape between the two great powers. Relations which are imbued not by coldness but by professionalism, undoubtedly without the initial euphoria which marked the breakthrough of the 90's. Perhaps this is why U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry's first visit to Russia is a working visit. And the questions he has come to discuss in our country are not those typical of grand ceremonies but are of the most everyday type, requiring mutual efforts to resolve them. The plane bringing Secretary Perry did not touch down at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport until 1000 hours on 17 March, but within 90 minutes the head of the Pentagon was already being received by Army General Pavel Grachev, Russia's defense minister. The very first phrases which the leaders of the two countries' defense departments exchanged confirmed that they are both clearly aware that, to a very large extent, mutual relations between the defense ministries and the defense ministers themselves determine the overall climate of interstate relations between Russia and the United States. Security problems have been crucial in this sphere too long for them to be simply swept aside at a stroke. Now, as William Perry himself showed by what he said when addressing students and staff at George Washington University four days ago, ruling circles in the United States are still prey to the fear that Russia may revert to the path of an "authoritarian, militarist, imperialist power, hostile to the West." It may be said here and now that these are groundless inventions, but it can also be acknowledged that the Americans do not rule out such a possibility -- and consequently they are taking the corresponding preemptive measures. But the aims of the U.S. Defense Secretary's visit include not just a desire to convince himself of the sincerity of our country's peace-loving course but also to discuss joint efforts in the sphere of the conversion of defense production and progress in the elimination of that part of the former USSR's nuclear arsenal that is due to be scrapped (these questions will also be raised during his trip to Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and Belorussia [Belarus]). [passage omitted] The very first talks in Russia, according to the U.S. guest, were satisfactory to both sides. As Army Gen. Pavel Grachev said at a brief meeting with journalists after the general talks and after a one-on-one conversation lasting almost 30 minutes, there was a significant coincidence of views on questions of bilateral ties, on the prospects for Russia's participation in the "Partnership for Peace" program, and on the Bosnian problem. Incidentally, Russia will be ready to sign the agreement on affiliating to the "Partnership for Peace" program as early as the end of March when the experts have completed their study of the necessary documents, the Russian Federation defense minister announced. That same day William Perry had meetings and talks with Andrey Kokoshin, Russian Federation first deputy defense minister, and Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the Russian Federation Armed Forces General Staff. On day two of the visit the head of the Pentagon will be received by Viktor Chernomyrdin, premier of the Russian Government.
