FR940407-0-00031 FR940407-0-00004 By letters dated January 14, May 12, and August 18, 1993, the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) stated that the proposed amendment did not conflict with current MSHA regulations (administrative record Nos. UT&hyph;818, UT&hyph;841, and UT&hyph;860). By letters dated June 10 and August 11, 1993, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) responded that it had no comments on the proposed amendment (administrative record Nos. UT&hyph;844 and UT&hyph;855). By letter dated April 14, 1993, the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) commented that, with respect to Utah's proposed definition of the term ``road,'' ``hydrologic and erosion control measures'' need to be included as part of the road as described in the second sentence of the definition. SCS further stated that this addition is needed because such measures may be needed to mitigate the effects of drainage areas and watersheds of road construction and use (administrative record No. UT&hyph;832). In response, OSM has found in finding No. III.C.2. that Utah's proposed definition of the term ``road'' is substantively identical to the Federal regulatory definition of ``road'' at 30 CFR 701.5. In addition, Utah's rules at Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;752.200, .210, .220, and .250 set performance standards for primary and ancillary roads that include hydrologic measures that are no less effective than the corresponding Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.150(b)(1), (3), and (5) and 817.150(b)(1), (3), and (5). These State rules read as follows: 752.200. Road Drainage. Roads will be located, designed, constructed, reconstructed, used, maintained, and reclaimed in according to R645&hyph;301&hyph;732.400, R645&hyph;301&hyph;742&hyph;400 and R645&hyph;301&hyph;762 and to achieve the following: R645&hyph;301&hyph;752.210. Control or prevent erosion, siltation, and the air pollution attendant to erosion by vegetating or otherwise stabilizing all exposed surfaces in accordance with current, prudent engineering practices; R645&hyph;301&hyph;752.220. Control or prevent additional contributions of suspended solids to stream flow or runoff outside the permit area; * * * * * R645&hyph;301&hyph;752.250. Refrain from significantly altering the normal flow of water in streambeds or drainage channels. Therefore, although Utah's proposed definition of ``road'' at Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;100&hyph;200 does not include SCS's recommended term ``hydrologic and erosion control measures,'' the aforementioned State rules do include performance standards that mitigate the effects on drainage areas and watersheds of road construction and use them in a manner no less effective than the corresponding Federal regulations. On this basis, OSM cannot require Utah to revise its program in response to SCS's comment. C. State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(4), OSM is required to solicit comments from the SHPO and ACHP for all amendments that may have an effect on historic properties. By letters dated October 16, 1992, and March 31, 1993, OSM solicited comments from these offices (administrative record Nos. UT&hyph;791 and UT&hyph;828). Neither the SHPO nor the ACHP commented on the proposed amendment. D. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Concurrence
