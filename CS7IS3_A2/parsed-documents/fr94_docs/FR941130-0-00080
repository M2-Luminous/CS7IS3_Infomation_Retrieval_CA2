The Secretary proposed to amend the overaward threshold provisions for the campus-based programs (page 32265). To reduce burden for both the student and the institution, the Secretary proposed to allow an institution to disburse funds under the Federal Perkins Loan and FSEOG programs to a student when he or she is no longer enrolled if the assistance was awarded while the student was still an eligible student (page 32265). Federal Perkins Loan Program The Secretary proposed to remove the definitions of ``Default rate'', ``Defaulted principal amount outstanding'', and ``Matured loans'', and add the definitions of ``Disposable income'', ``Enter repayment'', ``Making of a loan'', and ``Satisfactory arrangements to repay the loan'' (pages 32265&hyph;32266). The Secretary proposed to amend the reallocation formula for the Federal Perkins Loan Program, and to establish an appeals process by which the anticipated collections requirement may be waived for institutions with ``low default rates'' (page 32266).

In accordance with statutory changes, the Secretary proposed to allow an institution to increase the minimum monthly repayment amount to $40.

In accordance with statutory changes, the Secretary proposed to eliminate the 50-percent limitation on the number of Title 1 schools in a State that meet the eligibility criteria and provided that teaching in any Title 1 school that meets the eligibility criteria now qualifies a borrower for a loan cancellation. This change will increase the opportunities for receiving loan cancellations and encourage more teachers to teach in low-income schools (pages 32268&hyph;32269). The Secretary proposed to expand the loan cancellation employment provisions (page 32269). The Secretary proposed to amend the definition of permanent and total disability to include the inability of the borrower to attend an institution because of an impairment that is expected to continue indefinitely or result in death (page 32269).
