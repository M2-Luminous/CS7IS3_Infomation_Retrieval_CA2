"The goal is to open the door and to ensure that discrimination (against French companies) is eliminated," an aide to the prime minister explained. Authorities here do not expect Balladur to return bearing fat contracts. But they do want to see the ice broken. "In China, as elsewhere, contracts are won by constant presence and frequent visits," the aide explained. "Nothing can be done without such an opening." Forced onto the sidelines for more than a year, during which the Chinese economy flourished, French exporters are eagerly awaiting the first fruits of a normalization in Franco-Chinese relations. The two countries ended their rift in a joint communique issued January 12. China recorded economic growth of 13.5 percent last year, when imports shot up 27 percent. The surge in buying was worth nearly 100 billion dollars for foreign companies. But French firms were in essence ruled out of the competition for the lucrative Chinese market after the 1992 sale to Taiwan of 60 Mirage 2000-5s. In Canton, where the French consulate was shut down, France lost a subway contract to Germany. Funds totalling two billion French francs (340 million dollars) to finance contracts for the telecommunications group Alcatel-CIT have also been frozen. Sources here estimated that French companies last year lost between three and six billion francs (517 million and 1.03 billion dollars) in Chinese contracts. As a result France recorded a trade deficit with China that came to 12 billion francs (2.06 billion dollars) in 1993, against 11 billion francs in 1992. Before the row over the aircraft sales, France's share of the Chinese market came to three percent, a figure that had fallen to 1.6 percent in 1993. The German share last year was nearly six percent and the Italian 2.6 percent. But with normalization of relations French firms should once again be able to compete in such key sectors as automobiles, railways, grain, water treatment and construction. Aides to Balladur stress that China's needs are great, noting Chinese energy and telecommunications requirements account for a quarter of demand in such sectors worldwide. In addition, they added, China is seen as a reliable payer.
