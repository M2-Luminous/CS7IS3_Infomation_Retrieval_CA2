Lieutenant General Fathi Muhammad 'Ali al-Muqim assumes the post of president. The Sudanese factions distributed the ministerial portfolios among themselves and without publicity in order not to cause new problems among them. The arrangement agreed upon recently will prepare the way for an expanded meeting in which the names that occupy what is called "the grouping committee" [hay'at al-tajammu'] will be announced.
