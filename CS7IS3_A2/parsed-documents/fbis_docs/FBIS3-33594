Congress approved the FSE with just one change. [Begin recording] [Reporter Luciane Bacellar from Brasilia] The FSE was approved by 402 votes of the 500 congressmen present for the voting. Only one change was made: The government lost its power to reduce the bank PIS [Social Integration Program] contribution. Congress approved the FSE but it has yet to decide whether to implement it immediately. The voting may take place this afternoon. The administration needs 293 votes to implement the FSE immediately. The date of the session at which the bill will be promulgated will be decided later. Only then will the FSE be implemented and will Minister Cardoso go ahead with the second phase of his economic plan: the Real Value Unit, URV. [Senate Speaker Humberto Lucena] Congress must first conclude its work so that the minister can do his part. If the amendment is approved we will immediately call a session to promulgate it because it must be promulgated at a plenary meeting. [end recording]
