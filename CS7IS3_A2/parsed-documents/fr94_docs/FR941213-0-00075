FR941213-0-00075 FR941213-0-00018 ACTA does not define ``light-duty truck,'' and ACTA's legislative history provided no guidance as to which vehicles to include in a ``light-duty truck'' definition for theft prevention purposes. In the NPRM, NHTSA proposed to base its definition of ``light-duty truck'' for Theft Prevention Standard purposes on NHTSA's definition of ``truck'' at 49 CFR 571.3: ``a motor vehicle with motive power, except a trailer, designed primarily for the transportation of property or special purpose equipment.'' After taking into account ACTA's 6,000 pound gross vehicle weight rating limitation, NHTSA proposed to define ``light-duty truck'' as: A motor vehicle with motive power, except a trailer, designed primarily for the transportation of property or special purpose equipment, that is rated at 6,000 pounds gross vehicle weight or less. 2. Specifying ``Major Parts'' NHTSA also sought public comments on major parts for MPVs and LDTs. 49 U.S.C. 33101(6)(A) through (K) specifies parts that are ``major parts.'' Under section 33101(6)(L), NHTSA has authority to specify as ``major parts'' other parts that it specifies are ``comparable in design or function to any of the parts listed.'' At 49 CFR 541.5, NHTSA has specified the major parts on high theft passenger car lines that must be marked. With a few exceptions, ยง541.5 lists all major parts specified in 49 U.S.C. 33101(6). The agency did not use its authority to add additional parts to the list. After passage of ACTA, there is no longer a statutory limit on the number of parts per vehicle that may be marked. However, the costs of marking a vehicle may not exceed $15 (in 1984 dollars). In discussing the proposal for marking major parts for LDTs and/or MPVs, NHTSA applied the same criteria used to select the current 14 major parts specified in the Theft Prevention Standard at ยง541.5(a). The selection criteria are whether the parts are among those most frequently repaired or most costly to replace. (See 50 FR 19728, at 19732; May 10, 1985.) Relying on public comments in response to the ANPRM, NHTSA proposed that parts listed in the Theft Prevention Standard at ยง541.5(a)(1) through (11) should, if present on a vehicle, be treated as major parts for MPVs and LDTs also. Since the 11 parts listed are among the most frequently repaired and costly to replace, NHTSA tentatively found that the parts, if present on MPVs and LDTs, should be major parts. In the NPRM, NHTSA also proposed to designate additional parts as major parts for MPVs and LDTs. Although right and left rear quarter panels (designated as major parts in 49 CFR 541.5(a)(12) and (13)), are not necessarily present on MPVs or LDTs, NHTSA proposed that for MPVs, in lieu of quarter panels, side-panels should be designated as major parts, and for LDTs, pickup boxes or cargo boxes should be designated as major parts. NHTSA stated its belief that the side panels and pickup or cargo boxes are among the parts most frequently repaired. NHTSA also proposed to include cargo doors on an LDT or MPV, as major parts. 3. Motor Vehicle Glazing as ``Major Parts'' In response to the ANPRM, certain commenters recommended that windows and other pieces of motor vehicle glazing be specified as major parts for all high theft vehicles. One company, Prospective Technologies, cited the relative ease with which vehicle glazing could be marked, and the low cost of marking (which Prospective estimated to be $5.00 per vehicle). Prospective also cited Nissan's success in lowering theft rates of the Nissan 300ZX by as much as 26 per cent after the windows of all 300ZX models were etched with the vehicle identification number beginning in model year 1992. Based in part on this favorable information, NHTSA proposed to specify marking of passenger motor vehicle parts. NHTSA tentatively agreed that specifying pieces of glazing as major parts to be marked pursuant to the Theft Prevention Standard would further the statutory purpose. Since the markings on glazing would be in plain view, all types of motor vehicle theft, not just theft for the purposes of chop shop operations or other trafficking in stolen motor vehicle parts, might be deterred. NHTSA sought comment whether lower theft rates would result if only some glazing parts were specified for marking and if so, which parts could be excluded. NHTSA also sought comment on three additional issues arising from the proposal to require marking of glazing parts. 4. Parts Marking for Non-High Theft Lines 49 U.S.C. 33103 requires NHTSA, by October 25, 1994, to promulgate a parts marking standard applicable to major parts installed by manufacturers of ``passenger motor vehicles (other than light duty trucks) in not to exceed one-half of the lines not designated under section 33104 as high theft lines.'' In carrying out section 33103, NHTSA began by reviewing theft rates of the 231 vehicle lines that were listed in the 1990/91 theft data. (See 59 FR 12400, March 16, 1994) A total of 116 vehicle lines (any line rated at number 116 or lower) was in the eligible pool of lines potentially subject to parts marking pursuant to section 33103. Pursuant to the statutory mandate, NHTSA removed all light duty truck lines from the eligible pool. Section 33103(a) further directs NHTSA to select only lines ``not designated under section 33104 of this title as high theft lines.'' Thus, NHTSA removed any passenger motor vehicle line that NHTSA had previously determined to be high theft. NHTSA tentatively applied the definition of ``light duty truck'' proposed in the NPRM, and stated it would make appropriate changes if a different definition were adopted in the final rule.
