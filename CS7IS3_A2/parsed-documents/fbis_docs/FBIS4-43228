And, unfortunately, the principal political parties must stand accused, despite their denials, of having diverted these elections from their real objective. The results show that many voters cast their votes on the basis of domestic issues, reflecting wide-ranging disillusionment. The government coalition parties have received a reprimand, and a relatively harsh one at that. Apart from the scandals, they have also suffered the consequences of the unpopular austerity plan and of having so far failed to reconcile, as they promised, the citizen and politics. Unacceptable as it may be, we have to accept that the big winner in these elections is the party of those disillusioned with the political system and of those who voted in large numbers for the extreme right, who split their vote among small parties with no future, or sought refuge in an apparently very significant abstention vote. In French-speaking Belgium, the PS [Socialist Party] suffered a very severe defeat. The virtuous words of Philippe Busquin did not succeed in neutralizing the negative impact on the PS's image of the scandals that have been so much discussed of late. The devastation would have been worse still without the presence of popular and increasingly ambitious Jose Happart heading the party's list of candidates. The PSC [French-speaking Social Christian Party] also lost considerable ground, and that was a personal failure for its president, Gerard Deprez. His reelection as party president, previously taken for granted, has now been thrown wide open. The loss of support for the PSC is probably partly due to the Demaret-Thys scandal. As to the Ecologists, they have probably been punished for their misalliance with the majority on the vote on institutional reform in return for ecotaxes, a move that was both improvised and unpopular. A part of their electorate will not forgive them for having entered the troubled waters of the policy-making. As to the PRL [French-speaking Liberal reformation Party]-FDF [French-speaking Democratic Front] alliance, its strategy no doubt paid off. But will its increased support be confirmed at the next elections? The question is pertinent to the extent that it most certainly harvested protest votes which are by definition volatile. Nevertheless, the PRL-FDF is now just a few points behind the previously dominant PS. On the other hand, the Flemish Liberals suffered a bitter defeat. They fell far short of achieving their ambition to unseat the CVP [Flemish Christian Democratic Party] as Flanders' leading party. An initial conclusion is that the desire for political change by the Liberals at the national and the regional level will probably not be achieved immediately. Despite or precisely because of their defeat, the majority parties now seem destined to continue through to the end of their term as early elections would threaten to be disastrous for all concerned. They must therefore make every effort to return to form and endeavour to take concrete account of the problems in society which lie at the root of the worrying advance of the extreme right. The Liberals day has yet to come.
