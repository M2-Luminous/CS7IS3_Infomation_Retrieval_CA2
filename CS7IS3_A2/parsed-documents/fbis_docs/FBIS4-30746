[BILD] Are you going to stop the privatization? [Horn] No, the privatization will be continued, but under parliamentary control. We do not want to deprive anyone of his legal property. [BILD] What effects will the Socialists' election victory have on German-Hungarian relations? [Horn] Hungarian-German cooperation has great importance in the development of our economy. We need the Germans to expand our economy and become full members of the European Union as quickly as possible. Therefore my first foreign trip will be to Germany.
