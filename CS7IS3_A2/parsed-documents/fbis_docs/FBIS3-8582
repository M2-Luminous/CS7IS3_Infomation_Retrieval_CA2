He said the view was not held only by him, as Kovac's candidacy resulted from preliminary agreements of the opposition parties and groups in the case of the no-confidence vote in Meciar's government. Until recently, Roman Kovac held the post of deputy premier. He was, however, dismissed by Meciar as he stood up against him.
