After opposition parties filed charges of electoral fraud, 107 electoral boards decided to review the vote count certificates for the 16 May elections, an activity which the [word indistinct] joined this Thursday under the premise that not all the certificates had been manipulated. Pena Gomez said the fact that he is joining the certificate review does not mean he is validating the figures manipulated by the vote counting center. The politician said he will prove that the tens of thousands of people who supported him, which he described as a considerable number, are twice the number of those who supported the Reformist Social Christian Party (PRSC), which nominated President Joaquin Balaguer. The PRD said the majority of its members could not vote because their names were not included on the voter lists even though they had their credentials. [passage omitted]
