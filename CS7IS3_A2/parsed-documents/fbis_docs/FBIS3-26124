Governor Chen Shineng maintained: In 1994, we will concentrate on fulfilling the following five major tasks: 1. To profoundly implement the spirit of the 14th CPC National Congress as well as the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; 2. To comprehensively accomplish tasks set out at the Seventh Guizhou Provincial CPC Congress; 3. To rapidly build a socialist market economy by vigorously deepening reform, expanding opening up to the outside world, furthering structural readjustment, improving management, and increasing efficiency, and building a diligent and clean government; 4. To raise the province's total gross national product by 8-9 percent, primary industrial output value by 2.2-3.2 percent, total agricultural output value by 3-4 percent, secondary industrial output value by 9.5-10.8 percent, total industrial output value by 12.5-13.5 percent, tertiary industrial output value by 14-15 percent, and local revenue through existing channels by 9.1 percent over last year; 5. To energetically develop all types of social undertakings. Governor Chen Shineng noted: We are bound to confront numerous favorable conditions but a host of difficulties as well in accomplishing the above mentioned tasks. First and foremost, reform aimed at instituting a diversified revenue system will place a significant strain on the province's revenue growth. After instituting a unified income tax system, enterprises are bound to come across more challenges in respect to market competition and find it more difficult to control price hikes and raise funds due to a series of restrictions caused by "bottlenecks" and more painstaking to effect structural readjustment. In view of this situation, Chen Shineng stressed that enterprises should take the initiative to improve all sorts of work and adapt themselves to a new economic environment. Besides, governments at all levels in Guizhou should also make intensive efforts to emancipate minds, seek truth from facts, deepen reform, expand opening up to the outside world, boost morale, carry out practical work in a down-to-earth manner, secure sustained economic growth, tackle contradictions, and safeguard political and social stability. Governor Chen Shineng held: In 1994, in accordance with "The CPC Central Committee Decision on Several Questions on Building a Socialist Market Economic Structure," we must make redoubled efforts to expedite the pace of reform by making clear-cut emphases and proceeding in a planned way. We should make vigorous efforts to intensify reform in the following six areas: 1. To conscientiously organize and effect financial, revenue, banking, investment, planning, and foreign trade systems reforms; 2. To speed up property rights system reform with an eye to gradually establishing a modern enterprise system; 3. To foster and develop a market system and continually push ahead with circulation structural reform; 4. To further deepen rural reform and establish and perfect a socialized rural service system; 5. To deepen distribution system reform and rapidly build a social security system; 6. To make a success of personnel system reform and practically transform government functions.
