For general information, contact the FAR Secretariat, Room 4037, GS Building, Washington, DC 20405, (202) 501&hyph;4755. Please cite FAR case 94&hyph;754. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 (the Act), Pub. L. 103&hyph;355, provides the authority to streamline the acquisition process and minimize burdensome requirements unique to the Federal Government. Major changes that can be expected in the acquisition process as a result of the Act's implementation include changes in the areas of Commercial Item Acquisition, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, the Truth in Negotiations Act, and introduction of the Federal Acquisition Computer Network. This notice announces FAR revisions developed under FAR case 94&hyph;754, based on Section 2101 of the Act that (1) adds to the list of unallowable costs found at 10 U.S.C. 2324(e)(1), the costs of lobbying the legislative body of a political subdivision of a state; (2) adds to the list found at 10 U.S.C. 2324(f)(1) of costs to be clarified in the cost principles, the cost of ``conventions''; and (3) expands the coverage to the Coast Guard and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Section 2151 amends 41 U.S.C. 256 to include all the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 2324, as amended by Section 2101. Therefore, the provisions are made generally applicable to all other executive agencies. The new FAR language, with only minor variations, was transferred from the current coverage in the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations (DFARS). The FAR Council is interested in an exchange of ideas and opinions with respect to the regulatory implementation of the Act. For that reason, the FAR Council is conducting a series of public meetings. However, the FAR Council has not scheduled a public meeting on this rule (FAR case 94&hyph;754) because of the clarity and non-controversial nature of the rule. If the public believes such a meeting is needed with respect to this rule, a letter requesting a public meeting and outlining the nature of the requested meeting shall be submitted to and received by the FAR Secretariat (see ADDRESSES caption, above) on or before January 12, 1995. The FAR Council will consider such requests in determining whether a public meeting on this rule should be scheduled. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act This proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq. , because most contracts awarded to small businesses are awarded through sealed bidding on a firm fixed price basis. The cost principles apply only to contracts which are not firm fixed price. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments from small entities concerning the affected FAR subpart will be considered in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately and should cite 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq . (FAR case 94&hyph;754), in correspondence. C. Paperwork Reduction Act The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the proposed changes to the FAR do not impose recordkeeping or information collection requirements, or collections of information from offerors, contractors, or members of the public which require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq . List of Subjects in 48 CFR Parts 31, 37, 42, and 52 Government procurement. Dated: December 6, 1994. Capt. Barry L. Cohen, SC, USN, Project Manager for the Implementation of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994.
