FR940505-1-00179 FR940505-1-00012 Today's proposal does not contain specific auditing procedures, however, EPA fully intends to specify specific auditing procedures for each fee program in the final promulgation. EPA invites comments on the auditing procedures that should be used for each of the fee programs. (8) Reconciliation Procedures. Program audit provisions for fee programs must also be accompanied by reconciliation procedures, designed to compare credited emissions with actual emissions. The reconciliation procedures must specify a range of appropriate actions or revisions to the program requirements (e.g., increase the fee) that will make up for any shortfall between credited and actual emissions revealed by the audit. Such measures must be automatically executing to the extent necessary to make up the shortfall, with state action required only to identify which of the specified actions are necessary to make up the shortfall. Such measures must not require a revision to the SIP to be effectuated once identified by the state, rather the measures must be built into the original EIP design (or incorporated by reference). As with the auditing procedures, the EIP directs states to perform reconciliation procedures at time intervals consistent with RFP milestones and other emission inventory requirements. The reconciliation procedures in the EIP clearly indicate that EPA can reconcile a fee program by increasing the fee; however this increase must execute automatically. This language indicates that EPA, for example, could propose that if it determines, through the auditing process, that a fee program for a given source category has not yielded within 10 percent of the predicted effect, it will increase the fees by 50 percent to reconcile this shortfall. While EPA fully intends to include reconciliation procedures for each fee program in the final promulgation, this NPRM does not contain such procedures. EPA invites comment on the the best way to reconcile fee programs should the program audits show that the effect of a program is not what was estimated. (9) Implementation Schedule. A fee program in the FIP must include an implementation schedule. The schedule must include dates for notifying potentially affected sources, as early as possible, about the impending program, initialization and start-up procedures, submittal requirements from affected sources, and the reconciliation process and any subsequent actions required to make up for any shortfall that occurs. The implementation schedules for each fee program are contained in the detailed discussions of each program. (10) Administrative Procedures. As part of a fee program, EPA must establish appropriate administrative procedures. For example, a fee program must ensure the proper administration of the fee collection process. Is should be noted that the EIP contains requirements for the use of collected fees. These rules do not supersede the Miscellaneous Receipts Act and are therefore not applicable to the Federal Government in the FIP. While EPA fully intends to include administration procedures for each fee program in the final promulgation, this NPRM does not contain such procedures. EPA asks for comment as to how these procedures should be structured. E. Fuels Programs 1. Reformulated Fuels a. Federal Reformulated Gasoline. Since the 1970s, gasoline sold in California generally has been subject to two sets of emission related standards: federal standards promulgated by EPA under the Clean Air Act and California standards set by CARB. Both EPA and CARB have established two-phase reformulated gasoline programs which affect much or all of California's gasoline. Reformulated gasoline, as prescribed by section 211(k) of the Act, is to improve air quality by requiring that gasoline be reformulated to reduce motor vehicle emissions of toxic and tropospheric ozone-forming compounds. On December 15, 1993, the EPA Administrator signed the final rule requiring the sale of reformulated gasoline in the 9 largest metropolitan areas with the worst ozone nonattainment problems in the U.S., as well as in a larger number of areas which have voluntarily chosen to participate in the program. The Los Angeles Metropolitan Area (which includes Ventura County) is one of the mandated areas. Sacramento is not among the areas currently slated to receive federal reformulated gasoline, but a bump-up of Sacramento to ``Severe'' will subject that area to the reformulated gasoline requirement, effective one year after reclassification. Due to California's reformulated gasoline program described below, we do not propose to require the sale of federal reformulated gasoline in Sacramento in this FIP. In Los Angeles, federal Phase I reformulated gasoline will reduce VOC emissions by 13&hyph;21 percent beginning in 1995, relative to base California gasoline and depending on the type of I/M program in place. NO X emissions will remain unchanged (no net increase over baseline NO X levels). Beginning in the year 2000, a more stringent federal Phase II VOC standard will apply and VOC emissions will be reduced by 16 percent relative to pre-1995 California gasoline, assuming enhanced I/M is in place. In addition, beginning in the year 2000, EPA is requiring that reformulated gasoline reduce in-use NO X emissions by 6.8 percent, on average, again relative to pre-1995 California fuel.
