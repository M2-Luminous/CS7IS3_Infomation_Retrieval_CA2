The minister noted that the Russian side feels concern over the position of the Russian-speaking people in the Baltics. Kozyrev confirmed Russia's desire to join the Council of Europe and expressed hope that the practical solution of this issue will not take more than one year. The minister noted that May 21 marks another anniversary of Andrey Sakharov's birth, a date which traditionally fills the hearts of honest Russian people with a hope for the successful continuation of the cause of this outstanding champion for human rights. "I believe that Russia will be Sakharov's Russia rather than Zhirinovskiy's," stressed Kozyrev. He underlined that the operating Constitution and democratically elected Russian parliament are a guarantee that the present changes will be irreversible.
