"The stands taken by the two sides were a long way from compromise," INTERFAX was told by a senior official from Russia's Finance Ministry. The IMF delegation wants the main differences connected with the granting of the 2nd half of the $1.5 Bn [billion] credit to be discussed between Russia's Prime Minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin, and the head of the IMF, Michel Camdessus. The two men are to confer Tuesday evening, the Finance Ministry source said. The acting Finance Minister, Sergey Dubinin, is expected to join them. This stand will make it possible for the IMF leadership "not to miss the main thing" during the upcoming meeting with Chernomyrdin -- that is obtain official assurances on the fundamental issues, the Finance Ministry official said. In answer to INTERFAX's question about prospects for the work of the IMF mission in Moscow after Camdessus's departure, the source said that two possibilities are the most probable. First: further talks will be halted after fruitless meetings between the head of the IMF and the Russian leadership. The other possibility is this -- the dialogue will continue, provided that Moscow and the IMF reach a compromise. In this case the two sides will have to coordinate "three or four" figures connected with the parameters of Russia's economy.
