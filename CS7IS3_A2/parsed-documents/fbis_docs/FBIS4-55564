As of 9 May, we can participate in meetings of the WEU Council and in the work of working groups, maintain contacts with the WEU "planning cell," and participate in various peacekeeping operations and in the evacuation of the population from endangered areas. On the other hand, the status of associate partner does not offer the chance to use the WEU's collective protection or the right to veto its decisions or vote on its supreme representatives. Defense Minister Pavol Kanis drew attention to the fact that the WEU was the third international institution in the security sphere in which we participate in one way or another. So far, we have been most active within the framework of UN peacekeeping forces, where a Slovak engineering battalion successfully operates. In this context, Kanis "bemoaned" the Army's budget, which does not allow us to make sufficient use of all of the opportunities provided by such cooperation, not to mention the fact that a further cut in this budget is currently being contemplated. An interesting view was expressed by Minister Kukan when he was asked to explain the fact that last week U.S. political scientist Zbigniew Brzezinski again "forgot," in one of his articles, to include Slovakia among candidates for NATO admission among the Visegrad Four states. According to Kukan, all politicians who committed this "mistake" assured him in personal conversations that this would not happen again. He said that he was unable to explain Brzezinski's repeated "errors" but could not resist adding that "his views and political analyses do not carry all that much weight in the United States today."
