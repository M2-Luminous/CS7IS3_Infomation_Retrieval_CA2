Not only are up to 3,000 foreign journalists expected in South Africa to cover the story, but the ANC had to contend with the generalised threat presented by the right wing. Mr Niehaus said the ANC was especially concerned about safety on the election roadshows of ANC President Nelson Mandela. Reports of Mr Mandela being conveyed from rally to rally at high speed had also caused concern. He denied that Mr Mandela's drivers were driving too fast and said journalists were creating problems by trying to beat Mr Mandela to his destinations. He said speeds were dictated by traffic authorities seeing convoys through their areas. Journalists thronging around Mr Mandela to get off-the-cuff comments also created problems. Mr Niehaus said the ANC would have press marshals in all the regions.
