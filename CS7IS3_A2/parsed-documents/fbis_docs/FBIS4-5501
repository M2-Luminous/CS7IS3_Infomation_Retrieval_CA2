To that end, the fiscal 1993 white paper on agriculture says "a new control system" should be developed to ensure stability in domestic rice production and balanced supply and demand. The report does not mention any specifics of how such a new system should operate, although a ministry official said it is the first time for the ministry to use the phrase "new control system" in reference to rice in its official reports. "This reflects the view that it's no good to just stick to the status quo," said Teruo Miyake, research division chief of the minister's secretariat. Miyake made the comment when reporters asked for comments on the existing rigid foodstuff control system. Under the Food Control Law, the government regulates production and distribution of rice and bans commercial trade in rice. The law was also the legal backbone of Japan's ban on rice imports. Many consumer groups and farmers have criticized the law and its underlying system as outdated, since it was passed in 1951 when Japanese rice was in short supply. Under the law, the government used to buy much of the rice crop for resale to consumers at lower prices, but now buys less than a fifth and oversees the independent distribution of an additional 40 percent. The remaining 40 percent is counted as being consumed by the farmers and their extended families, but some is distributed on the black market outside of government channels. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa announced last December the partial lifting of the rice import ban as a concession to the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of global trade talks. But the food control law itself has been untouchable to date. Japan has also pledged to eliminate the remaining restrictions on imports of 12 agricultural products, including dairy products and corn starch, and to reduce tariffs on agricultural products. The report underlines the need for measures to minimize the impact on domestic farmers of the market-opening steps while promoting larger-scale farms to compete with imports. It also proposes the use of new technology and innovation to raise productivity under growing international competition. Regarding the import of beef, which was liberalized in 1991 under agreements with the United States and Australia, the report points to significant increases in both imports and consumption over the past few years. Per capita beef consumption for fiscal 1992 climbed 52 percent from fiscal 1985, but increased imports reduced self-sufficiency in beef from 72 percent to 49 percent, the report says. It also notes that the sharp increase in beef imports has had a detrimental effect on domestic beef production, resulting in declining prices for wholesale beef and calves. The report urges promotion of large-scale beef production, selective breeding, and streamlining of production and distribution to slash production costs. The report also touched on other topics: -- The cool, wet summer last year caused record damage of 1.3 trillion yen to agricultural production, resulting in the worst rice harvest in the postwar period and a record 956 billion yen in damage to rice crops alone. -- Food consumption by nonfarming households inched up 0.1 percent in real terms in fiscal 1992. -- Agricultural production rose 4.1 percent in fiscal 1992 after a poor harvest in 1991, but remained below average as the agricultural production index stood at 99.4 against the base rate of 100 for fiscal 1990. -- The agricultural work force fell 6.1 percent in fiscal 1992, the largest drop in 12 years. -- The 1992 food self-sufficiency rate was unchanged at 46 percent on a caloric basis. The rate for grain was also unchanged at 29 percent. -- Rice in Japan is about eight times more expensive than U.S. rice at the average exchange rate for 1993. Japanese rice was priced about four times higher than U.S. rice in the early 1980s.
