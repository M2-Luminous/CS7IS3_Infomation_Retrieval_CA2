Ever since his first speeches, Frei has noted the "impersonality of power" as a government formula: "In this case, there are no personal ties, only institutional ties. Government ties with the Armed Forces and their commanders are extraordinarily positive." Frei stated that a discussion agenda has been drafted on issues the government believes should be defense policy guidelines. He said: "General Pinochet made a trip at the institutional level. I met with him before his trip and we will assess his trip when he returns, as is done with all the Armed Forces commanders." Gen. Pinochet's visit to Europe caused protests among some European associations, particulary during his stay in the Czech Republic.
