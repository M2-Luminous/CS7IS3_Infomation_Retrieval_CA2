The demonstrators -- who were led by the Mutual Support Group (GAM), which is striving for the return of 45,000 people who have been victims of violent actions -- asked the TSE not to validate "the settlement between the Executive and Legislative Branches" through the referendum. Late in 1993, the TSE announced a referendum that would allow 3.429 million voters to approve or reject reforms that seek to shorten the terms of the Executive and Legislative Branches. According to the multisector social forum that comprises various civilian groups, the referendum is only a result of the demands and pressure exerted by the IMF and the IDB [Inter-American Development Bank], both of which are compelling the government to sell various state enterprises. The Labor and Popular Action Union (UASP) issued an appeal to all groups, urging them "to comprise a united front that rejects the settlement that is about to take place." On 16 November the executive and legislative branches agreed to introduce the reforms, thereby ending a confrontation which began on 27 September -- when President Ramiro de Leon Carpio requested the resignation of 116 deputies. GAM leader Nineth Montenegro issued an appeal to the Guatemalan people, urging them to abstain from voting on 30 January because the very act of voting will legitimize a settlement between the government and the congressmen. If the referendum -- which was proposed by the Executive Branch, endorsed by Congress, and announced by the TSE -- is approved by a majority, the reforms approved will be enforced 60 days after the TSE announces the results. The current Legislative Branch should conclude its term on 14 January 1996, but, because of a dispute with the Executive Branch stemming from former President Jorge Serrano's self-inflicted coup on 25 May, the legislators' removal was brought up. Provisional legislators will only remain until January 1996, when congressmen elected in the 1995 general elections should assume their posts. President de Leon Carpio's successor must also be elected on this occasion.
