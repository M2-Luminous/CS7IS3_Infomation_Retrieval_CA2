A NODONG SINMUN analyst says: Such a suppression is a rash act committed by those who took off even the "civilian" veil and openly unsheathed the sword of the military dictatorship. As for the participation of students of Namchongnyon in the Seoul rally against the "parliamentary ratification of the Uruguay Round accord," there was nothing wrong in it. Checking the "endorsement of the accord" is vital to the existence of the people. It is natural that South Korean students and people rose up in a struggle against the treacheries and despicable moves of the puppets.

It is clear to every one that the puppets resorted to such brutal crackdown, consider that if they allowed students from local areas to participate in the Seoul rally against the "parliamentary endorsement of the accord," it would develop into a massive anti-"government" struggle.
