ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: This Notice announces a debenture recall of certain Federal Housing Administration debentures, in accordance with authority provided in the National Housing Act. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Richard Keyser, Room B133, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC. 204510, telephone (202) 755&hyph;7510. This is not a toll-free number. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Pursuant to section 207(j) of the National Housing Act, 12 U.S.C. 1713(j), and in accordance with HUD regulations at 24 CFR 207.259(e)(3), the Federal Housing Commissioner, with approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, announces the call of all Federal Housing Administration debentures with coupon rates of 7.5 percent or higher, except for those debentures subject to ``debenture lock agreements,'' that have been registered on the books of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, and are, therefore, ``outstanding'' as of September 30, 1994. The date of the call is January 1, 1995. To insure timely payment, debentures should be presented to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia by December 1, 1994. The debenture will be redeemed at par plus accrued interest. Interest will cease to accrue on the debentures as of the call date. Final interest on any called debentures will be paid with the principal at redemption. During the period from the dates of this notice to the call date, debentures that are subject to the call may not be used by the mortgagee for a special redemption purchase in payment of a mortgage insurance premium. No transfer or denominational exchanges of debentures covered by the foregoing call will be made on the books maintained by the Treasury Department on or after October 1, 1994. This does not affect the right of the holder of a debenture to sell or assign the debenture on or after this date. Payment of final principal and interest due on January 1, 1995, will be made to the registered holder or assignee. Instructions for the presentation and surrender of debentures for redemption will be provided to holders by the Department. Dated: September 20, 1994. Jeanne K. Engel, General Deputy Assistant Secretary for Housing-Federal Housing Commissioner. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;23986 Filed 9&hyph;27&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4210&hyph;27&hyph;M
