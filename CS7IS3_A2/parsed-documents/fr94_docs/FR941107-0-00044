FR941107-0-00044 FR941107-0-00016 PART 15_RADIO FREQUENCY DEVICES 1. The authority citation for Part 15 continues to read as follows: Authority: Secs. 4, 302, 303, 304, and 307 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 154, 302, 303, 304, and 307. 2. Section 15.323 is amended by revising paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(5), and (e) to read as follows: §15.323 Specific requirements for isochronous devices operating in the 1920&hyph;1930 MHz sub-band. * * * * * (c) *␣*␣* (1) Immediately prior to initiating transmission, devices must monitor the combined time and spectrum windows in which they intend to transmit for a period of at least 10 milliseconds for systems designed to use a 10 milliseconds or shorter frame period or at least 20 milliseconds for systems designed to use a 20 milliseconds frame period. * * * * * (5) If access to spectrum is not available as determined by the above, and a minimum of 40 duplex system access channels are defined for the system, the time and spectrum windows with the lowest power level below a monitoring threshold of 50 dB above the thermal noise power determined for the emission bandwidth may be accessed. A device utilizing the provisions of this paragraph must have monitored all access channels defined for its system within the last 10 seconds and must verify, within the 20 milliseconds (40 milliseconds for devices designed to use a 20 milliseconds frame period) immediately preceding actual channel access that the detected power of the selected time and spectrum windows is no higher than the previously detected value. The power measurement resolution for this comparsion must be accurate to within 6 dB. No device or group of cooperating devices located within 1 meter of each other shall occupy more than three 1.25 MHz channels during any frame period. Devices in an operational state that are utilizing the provisions of this section are not required to use the search provisions of paragraph (b) of this section. * * * * * (e) The frame period (a set of consecutive time slots in which the position of each time slot can be identified by reference to a synchronizing source) of an intentional radiator operating in these sub-bands shall be 20 milliseconds or 20 milliseconds/X where X is a positive whole number. Each device that implements time division for the purposes of maintaining a duplex connection on a given frequency carrier shall maintain a frame repetition rate with a frequency stability of at least 50 parts per million (ppm). Each device which further divides access in time in order to support multiple communication links on a given frequency carrier shall maintain a frame repetition rate with a frequency stability of at least 10 ppm. The jitter (time-related, abrupt, spurious variations in the duration of the frame interval) introduced at the two ends of such a communication link shall not exceed 25 microseconds for any two consecutive transmissions. Transmissions shall be continuous in every time and spectrum window during the frame period defined for the device. * * * * * PART 24_PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES 1.
