[passage omitted] The brother chairman of the Presidential Council spoke at the meeting, expressing his thanks and gratitude for the high national unionist spirit demonstrated by the sons of Yafi' District, the heroic strugglers who have shown true belonging to the homeland and faith in unity. He noted that the secessionist rebels, led by the traitor and agent al-Bid, have imposed challenges on unity by their plots and pursuit of their destructive selfish interests. He said the broad national support for the Armed Forces, which are defending unity and legitimacy, demonstrated by the sons of the Yemeni people all over the Yemeni homeland, is a sincere expression of the meaning of unity for our people. Unity means pride, dignity, existence, and the fate for all Yemenis. It is not possible to imagine the present and future of Yemen without unity. The masses of our people have zealously and eagerly stood up for unity to bolster it, baptizing it with the pure blood and the precious sacrifices of the sons of our people and their Armed Forces in order to preserve and maintain unity. He added that unity deserves all sacrifices. Our people are willing to make more sacrifices and they will defend their unity, even if they have to use stones if weapons are not available. They will uphold the slogan of unity or death. The brother president praised the stands of the sons of the Yafi' District, who have valiantly confronted the gang of secession and rebellion and defeated it in more than one location. The sons of Yafi' have proven to be strong strugglers who are loyal to principles and to the homeland's causes and unity. He said our people are today formulating a new history in their life and effort to make a prosperous, stable future which cannot be imagined without unity. He pointed out that our struggling Yemeni people, who have been hardened by experience, have championed their will all along and are today capable of defeating this new challenge imposed by the criminal secessionist gang on unity. The Yemeni people will emerge victorious, God willing, because the will of the people derives from the will of God. He said all efforts will be mobilized in the next stage to repair and reconstruct what has been destroyed by the war imposed by the secessionists on the homeland and to build a new Yemen based on unity, democracy, comprehensive development, broad popular participation, building modern institutions, establishing law and order, respecting human rights and social justice. The meeting was attended by brother Yahya al-Ra'i, member of the House of Representatives.
