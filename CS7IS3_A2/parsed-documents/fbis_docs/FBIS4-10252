President Chamorro's remarks prove that military power is subject to civilian power and that, as she promised on 2 September and during her stay in Mexico, the Army chief will retire during the course of the year. President Chamorro announced on 2 September 1993 at the Olof Palme [Convention Center] that Humberto Ortega would retire this year, which prompted a disrespectful reaction from the Ortega brothers toward the president in the presence of Latin American diplomats. The presidential announcement, which created friction between the top military commanders and the government, forced the Executive Branch to convene an extraordinary emergency meeting at the OAS, where the government gained continent-wide support. "Neither Humberto Ortega nor anyone in the Army will retire due to U.S. pressures or due to anyone's whim. Within the context of the 2 September announcement I will never retire," the EPS general emphatically stated after meeting yesterday with National Assembly President Dr. Luis Humberto Guzman to discuss topics related to the Military Organization Law. "I must clearly establish my position regarding the issue of my dismissal under pressure. To insist that Humberto Ortega will step down this year is to take a superficial view of the Military Organization Law," stressed Ortega after adding that he will not leave his post under those conditions "out of dignity and principle." Ortega admitted that relations between the Executive Branch and EPS "have not been good" since the presidential announcement of 2 September. "This does not mean that I am enthroning myself as commander of the Armed Forces, but my departure will be within the framework of the Constitution and the Military Organization Law," the EPS chief added. Article 144 of the Constitution establishes that the president of the Republic is the chief of state and government and commander in chief of the nation's Defense and Security Forces. Questioned about the authority of President Chamorro, who is empowered to replace the EPS chief, Ortega replied evasively: "It is not a matter of the president removing the EPS chief nor of the Army removing the president as has historically occurred in Latin America, but we must work harmoniously for the good of the nation and avoid falling to extremes," he stated. The high-ranking military officer indicated there is no consensus between the EPS and the Executive Branch on the aforementioned law. Nevertheless, he refused to specify the points of conflict. "The Army wants an agreement on this," he underscored. He said it is very probable that an agreement will be reached within 15 days so the law can be sent to the Legislative Branch. Ortega defiantly said that if no agreement is reached in these two weeks, "the EPS will see what course it will take," but he refrained from indicating what measures the military command would take. He indicated that the Military Organization Law must have the consensus of the National Assembly, the EPS, and the Executive Branch. "We must draw up a strong and firm law among all the involved sectors," he said. Meanwhile, National Assembly President Luis Humberto Guzman threatened to draw up this law if it does not reach the assembly soon. "If the Military Organization Law is not sent to the National Assembly in the first half of this year, we will proceed to draft it," he said. Guzman said the Nicaraguan people were promised that this law would be drawn up in the first half of the year, and this promise will be kept. "We (the parliament) are not setting a deadline for the presentation of the Military Organization Law but one cannot wait forever," he stressed. Regarding the removal of Humberto Ortega from the EPS, he was categoric in stating: "If the president announced that this year she would appoint a new EPS chief, that is what must happen. It does not merit discussion." "After talking with Ortega, the impression I have of him, is that he is aware that his position is temporary," Guzman said. This contrasts with Ortega's remarks to journalists. Guzman also denied that there is U.S. pressure for the removal of the Army chief.
