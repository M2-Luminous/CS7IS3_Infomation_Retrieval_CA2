FR941020-0-00009 FR941020-0-00004 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 94&hyph;ASW&hyph;9] Alteration of VOR Federal Airways and Jet Routes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This action changes the name of the Shreveport, LA, Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range/Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) facility to the Belcher VORTAC. At present, the Shreveport Regional Airport and Shreveport VORTAC have the same name, but are not collocated. A navigational aid (NAVAID) with the same name as the airport should be located on the airport. This action reflects the name change, where necessary, of the Shreveport VORTAC that is not located on the airport with which it is associated. EFFECTIVE DATE: 0901 UTC, December 8, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William C. Nelson, Airspace and Obstruction Evaluation Branch (ATP&hyph;240), Airspace-Rules and Aeronautical Information Division, Air Traffic Rules and Procedures Service, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20591; telephone: (202) 267&hyph;9295. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Rule This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) changes the name of the Shreveport, LA, VORTAC to the Belcher VORTAC. At present, the Shreveport Regional Airport and the Shreveport VORTAC have the same name, but are not collocated. FAA Handbook 7400.2D states that a NAVAID with the same name as the airport should be located on the airport. This action reflects the name change of the Shreveport VORTAC, which is not located on the associated airport. This action is editorial in nature. I find that notice and public procedure under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are unnecessary, because this action is a minor technical amendment in which the public is not particularly interested. Jet routes and domestic VOR Federal airways are published, respectively, in paragraphs 2004 and 6010(a) of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994, and effective September 16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The jet routes and airways listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
