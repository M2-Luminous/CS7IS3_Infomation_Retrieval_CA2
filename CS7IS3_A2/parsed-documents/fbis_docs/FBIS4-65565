Sergio D'Antoni called it "confused," "unrealistic, and "generic." The program presented by Silvio Berlusconi has been rejected by the trade unions. The CGIL [Italian General Confederation of Labor] leader demolished it using with his severe criticism of the prime minister's Senate speech on Tuesday [17 May]. The CISL [Italian Confederation of Trade Unions] secretary general was slightly less harsh: "neither passed nor failed," the government will be judged on its deeds, but it was given very low grades in several subjects. All the trade unions have issued their assessments, nullifying the albeit cautious expressions of favor that Berlusconi won a fortnight ago when he promised the three federations full observance of the July 1993 collective bargaining agreement. Pietro Larizza of the UIL [Italian Federation of Trade Unions] had already criticized the government's aims -- "That is not a program; it is merely a draft of a program" -- because of the number of questions left unanswered and its excessively vague formulations. In a crescendo of alarmed comments, Trentin declared himself "worried and frightened" by the "substantial vagueness" rather than by the program's gaps and omissions. It reveals both the difficulty in reconciling the various tendencies within the coalition and the attempt to "reserve such a broad discretionary decisionmaking margin as to prompt serious concern about how the government intends to manage its relations with parliament and the social partners." This very serious charge is almost tantamount to one of authoritarianism. The CGIL secretary general noted "serious ambiguities" concerning foreign policy, a "surprising methodological contrast" with the programs of all the other governments of the industrialized countries, and major inconsistencies left unresolved by the historical assessment of fascism. A "total" absence of analysis of the Italian economic crisis, which has led to a complete silence regarding the means of reviving the economy envisaged by the July agreement. Trentin also criticized the tax proposals and the way in which Berlusconi intends to resolve the matter of guarantees regarding his business interests. The section concerning unemployment was given a definite thumbs-down. The CGIL leader accused the government of wanting to carry out "complete deregulation throughout the labor market, modifying existing legislation to the extent of promising a continuation of the Ciampi government's policy, which was itself very much open to criticism." It would entail making employment "increasingly unstable," with the result of increasing the number of unemployed, as in Spain. The CISL's verdict was a negative one, too, though the tone and the language used at the press conference that D'Antoni and his deputy, Raffaele Morese, devoted to Berlusconi's program were somewhat different from those of the CGIL secretary. Faced with a government plan that "does not choose and that creates expectations on all sides," with a considerable "gap" between the stated objectives and the policies for achieving them, "we will issue a challenge," placing the emphasis on an incomes policy, responding "to every point," and defending the trade unions' role in the policy of consultations, without any preconceived opposition. Indeed, D'Antoni's reservations did not extend as far as to make him advocate a no-confidence vote in the Senate. "At this stage it is better for them to govern." In other words, if he were a senator, the CISL secretary would probably choose not to vote, since he could not grant his vote of confidence." Though they do not consider the creation of a million jobs impossible ("who could say they oppose it?"), the CISL leaders find the proposals for achieving this objective very unsatisfactory, if not actually counterproductive. It would be better to implement the measures identified in [European Commission President] Delors plan, which depend chiefly on boosting public works and a reorganization of working hours. The proposals with regard to taxation seem unclear too: Does the promise of tax exemption for those earning less than 10 million lire affect only employed workers, or self-employed workers, too? It is a major difference, since according to the experts consulted, the resulting loss of revenue "would vary from 600 to 6,000 billion lire." The CISL also wants to know how this loss of revenue will be compensated. Even CISNAL's [Italian Confederation of National Trade Unions] initial enthusiasm has cooled having been given some "surprises" by Berlusconi's program -- some good, some bad. The assessment issued by its secretary general, Mauro Nobilia, is worth quoting, not so much because of his confederation's influence (very small in numerical terms), but because of the union's closeness to the MSI [Italian Social Movement]. Nobilia was reassured by the "reaffirmation of a state presence in the economy," while he feared a "sharply derestrictive" approach, and he appreciated the references to solidarity and the family, the rejection of the patronage system, the boost to the role of small business, and the intention to "examine" the Maastricht Treaty. But he believes that the program was "ill-defined" on the subject of taxation and is "very worried" about the measures announced affecting the labor market.
