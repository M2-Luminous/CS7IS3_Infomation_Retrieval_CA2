This was one of the recommendations made by Southeast Asian coastal and sea management experts at a three-day conference on sustainable development of coastal and ocean areas in Southeast Asia which ended Saturday. It was organised by the Southeast Asian Programme in ocean law, policy and management (SEAPOL). The experts believe that while the mechanisms were still relevant, its elements -- some of which were 20 years old -- could be improved as more vessels were using the straits and new coastal development projects came up. The basic principles for safety of navigation and consequently prevention of pollution that we have laid out remain solid but the problem is whether we have been left behind by development, said Indonesia's ambassador at-large Professor Hashim Jalal. International Maritime Organisation (IMO) programme manager Dr. Chua Thia-Eng said a long-term financing mechanism to combat marine pollution was necessary and oil spill contigency plans strengthened at the regional and national levels. But, he said, the problem of marine pollution could not be resolved by governments alone as it required public support such as in reducing waste disposal into the sea. Department of Geography Associate Professor Dr. Chia Lin Sien of the National University of Singapore said the the element of human error as a cause of accidents at sea should be given serious attention in view of the increasing traffic in the straits. People manning the ships have to be properly trained and the vessels in good condition, he added. Conference joint-chairman Professor Tommy Koh agreed that a problem faced globally was in the training of seamen and this had led to crews being below par. Another problem was an aging fleet with few new ships being commissioned and those in service unseaworthy, said Professor Koh, who is director of Singapore's Institute of Policy Studies.
