Stoyan Andov told AFP he had passed the invitation addressed to all 24 of Athens's Euro-MPs to the Greek deputy chairman of the European Parliament, Yeoryios Anastasopoulos, on the sidelines of a pan-European transport conference being held in this Cretan town. The offer comes a month after Athens imposed a controversial trade blockade on FYROM in an effort to force the former Yugoslav republic to change its flag, its name and its constitution, and cease what Greece views as hostile propaganda and territorial claims towards the hellenic state. "It is a shame that we cannot speak to each other in such a situation, at least among parliamentarians," Andov said, adding that direct contacts between the neighbour countries had reached a dead end. Anastasopoulos, however, told AFP he had indicated to Andov that a visit by Greek Eurodeputies to Skopje "could take place, but (only) in the event of a normalisation of relations between the two countries." Anastasopoulos said the offer would be considered, but that he was sceptical as to the usefulness of such a meeting. Andov said he had been unable to discuss the crisis with Greek governmental representatives, but that he had a "friendly" talk with Konstandinos Tsimas, a Greek Eurodeputy of the ruling Socialist (PASOK) [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] party. Tsimas said the two men had "chewed the fat," but that, although he would pass on Andov's invitation to his party, he "could not see a lot of interest" in the offer. In a separate development in Bonn, FYROM President Kiro Gligorov said Wednesday he favoured global discussions with Greece, but stressed he would not bow to the pressure of the embargo. The embargo "could have tragic consequences" for the stability of the region, he told journalists on a visit to Germany a day ahead of a meeting with Bonn's Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel. He added that the bilateral standoff could only be resolved through "dialogue, compromise and good faith," and called on the European Union [EU] and the United Nations to participate in efforts to find a solution. Since Greece began its political offensive against Macedonia two years ago, only two Athens-based Eurodeputies and no national parliamentarians at all have made the trip to FYROM. One Greek Eurodeputy, leftist Mikhael Papayianakis, and around 600 Greek intellectuals and celebrities have criticised the blockade. The embargo was sparked last month after the United States formally recognised FYROM. Many Western countries have also recognised the former Yugoslav republic, while Greece's EU partners have fiercely condemned the Athens blockade.
