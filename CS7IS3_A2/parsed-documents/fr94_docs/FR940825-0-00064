FR940825-0-00064 FR940825-0-00014 a. Residential Wood Combustion Program. Attainment of the 24-hour and annual standards is based on control strategies designed to reduce wood smoke. Attainment is demonstrated through the establishment of a voluntary residential wood combustion curtailment program, wood stove replacement program and home weatherization program. The specific control measures are supported and enhanced through an aggressive air pollution public awareness program. More details regarding these control measures are as follows: (1) Episodic Wood Burning Curtailment Program. The IDEQ is in charge of declaring episodic voluntary wood burning curtailments in the Pinehurst nonattainment area. A voluntary burn ban is declared when 24-hour PM&hyph;10 levels in the nonattainment area, as estimated by nephelometer, are measured to exceed 100 μg/m 3 . To keep the public informed regarding particulate air quality levels, a 24-hour PM&hyph;10 prediction is made for the Pinehurst/Silver Valley area after an IDEQ meteorologist calculates lower atmospheric stability and evaluates nephelometer, upper air temperature sounding, snow cover, surface temperature, delta temperature, wind speed, cloud cover, National Weather Service and occasionally commercial weather service data. Wood burning advisories are made in conjunction with the air quality report and are issued weekdays and, as necessary on weekends and holidays, by 9 a.m., from November 1 through the end of February. The advisory is recorded on a telephone answering machine for both the public and media. When a voluntary wood burning curtailment is declared, the IDEQ directly contacts the media and conducts radio and television interviews to publicize the existence of a burn ban. Voluntary curtailment declarations are also carried routinely by the local radio station and newspaper. IDEQ requests a 25 percent emission reduction credit for its voluntary curtailment program in the Pinehurst nonattainment area during 24-hour worst case periods. The 25 percent credit is greater than the ten percent generally suggested by EPA for voluntary curtailment programs. The recommended ten percent credit is viewed by EPA as a ``starting point in assessing the effectiveness of residential wood combustion control programs.'' However, final judgement of the amount of credit to be granted is determined by EPA's regional offices based on the program features outlined in EPA's Guidance Document for Residential Wood Combustion Emission Control Measures, September 1989, (EPA&hyph;450/2&hyph;89&hyph;015). More than ten percent credit may be granted based on the program's effectiveness. IDEQ cites residential wood heating surveys that were conducted in the Ada County/Boise PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area, that indicate a 43 percent effectiveness rate for the voluntary curtailment program in that part of Idaho. The State points out in the Pinehurst SIP that the Pinehurst City Council adopted a resolution (on November 11, 1991) supporting the curtailment program and requesting all Pinehurst citizens, except those who must rely on wood burning as their sole source of heat, to not burn wood during a curtailment episode. Therefore, the features of the Pinehurst curtailment program, the effectiveness data obtained from Ada County/Boise coupled with the demonstrated local support for the curtailment program by the leaders of Pinehurst is the basis for IDEQ's 25 percent emission reduction claim. According to IDEQ calculations this 25 percent reduction is equivalent to a PM&hyph;10 emission reduction of 51.3 lbs/day and a 24-hour PM&hyph;10 ambient reduction of 20 μg/m 3 . Based upon the surveys conducted in Ada County/Boise, the support by Pinehurst City officials and the recent success during the 1992&hyph;1993 and 1993&hyph;1994 wood burning seasons in preventing PM&hyph;10 concentrations from exceeding the 24-hour NAAQS, EPA is satisfied that at least a 25 percent emission reduction is occurring when voluntary episodic wood burning curtailments are declared in Pinehurst. Therefore, EPA is accepting the 25 percent credit claimed for this control measure. Further description of this program and justification for EPA's action is set out in the TSD, contained in the public record corresponding with this action. (2) Public Awareness Program. The wood smoke public awareness program for the Pinehurst/Silver Valley area plays a critical role in ensuring that the residential wood combustion program is successful. Public awareness of the problems associated with wood smoke has a significant effect on how well the different components of the wood smoke control program are accepted. IDEQ has utilized the following methods to promote public awareness about the wood smoke problem in Pinehurst: education brochures for each household, utility bill inserts, newspaper articles_public service announcements (PSA's), educational materials for elementary schools, surveys to determine the level of awareness and response to programs, radio interviews, radio PSA's, outreach to wood stove dealers and wood/pellet fuel outlets, and Speakers Bureau through service clubs and community meetings. IDEQ's well-established public awareness program was enhanced in 1991, when $14,550 was awarded by the Pacific Northwest and Alaska Bioenergy Program to provide wood energy education in Idaho's Silver Valley (which includes Pinehurst). For the 1993&hyph;1994 and 1994&hyph;1995 residential heating seasons, a wood stove advocate has been hired by IDEQ to serve as an information outlet regarding wood stove issues and also track the progress of reducing wood stove emissions.
