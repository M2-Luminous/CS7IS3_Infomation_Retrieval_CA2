The decision to devalue the CFA francs was reached at 2010 GMT, a devaluation of 50 percent which means that henceforth 1 French franc is equal to 100 CFA francs with effect from 12 January which is less than two hours from now. It should be noted that the anti-devaluation front members, that is, those against devaluation, fell with their arms in hand because they had fought hard to gain the maximum out of the backup measures. This front, represented by President Abdou Diouf, fought hard for nearly 48 hours to get the maximum concessions. From the beginning people were talking of 75, then 100 percent of devaluation. But we arrived at 50 percent. Here is Cameroonian Finance Minister Antoine Ntsimi, who read the official communique of heads of state and delegations of the franc zone. [Begin Ntsimi recording] By this measure, which should contribute significantly to the competitiveness of member states' economies and create conditions for the rapid restoration of major domestic and external balances, the West African Monetary Union [UMOA] and the Bank of Central African States [BEAC] authorities aim at improving the living conditions of our people; establishing a suitable climate for a sustained and lasting growth; resolving the unemployment problem which is currently hitting the most active force of our population; reviving exports and returning of capital placed in foreign banks; and the encouraging domestic savings. The implementation of this new strategy of adjustment of our economies will benefit from the financial support of the Bretton Woods institutions and all countries that are our partners in development, especially France. [end recording] On his part, France also undertook to support members of the franc zone by a series of backup measures such as the cancellation of public debts for the poorest countries and alleviating the debts for others. France will also help set up a special fund for development for African countries. French Cooperation Minister Michel Roussin made this pledge on behalf of the French Government: [Begin Roussin recording] Therefore, France will support efforts aimed at any adjustment embarked upon. The French Government will propose to its parliament immediate unilateral measures to alleviate the debt of each country of the zone. For the poorest countries, all the debt through development aid still outstanding to France will be cancelled. The decision to write off arrears owed to the French Development Fund will enable the fund to resume its assistance in each of the franc zone countries. France will contribute significantly to the opening [words indistinct] funding of its partners, members of the franc zone, within the context of a program which will be concluded with the International Monetary Fund.
