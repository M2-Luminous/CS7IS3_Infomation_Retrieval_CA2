While certain politicians described it as sad development for democracy, Prime Minister Tansu Ciller called it running away from the elections. This is how the politicians assessed the DEP's withdrawal from the political arena so close to the elections and when it had fielded its candidates all over Turkey: Prime Minister Tansu Ciller said: I was expecting such a decision. This is running away. I always said that the elections will be held in a secure atmosphere. Everyone will vote freely for whomever he wants. This is what they feared most. CHP [Republican People's Party] leader Deniz Baykal said: I hope that this decision will not turn into a protest, for then a difficult situation will arise. The DEP should reconsider its decision. Interior Minister Nahit Mentese said: This is cowardice. It was impossible for them to win in the elections. They were looking for a pretext not to take part in the elections. Nihat (Marka), deputy leader of SHP [Social Democrat Populist Party] parliamentary group, said: They should have run in the elections for the sake of democracy. From the viewpoint of democracy, this decision is deplorable. Sevket Kazan, deputy leader of the RP [Welfare Party] parliamentary group, said: The DEP made this decision fearing that it will not be able to win the elections. It had lost its hope on the elections.
