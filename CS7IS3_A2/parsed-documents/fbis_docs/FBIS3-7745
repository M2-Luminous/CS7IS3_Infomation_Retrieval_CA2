Carnogursky said in an interview for SLOVENSKY DENNIK last week that it would be no problem to recall the government. The main problem would be to form a government that was not dependent on the votes of the Hungarian deputies. It seems that, at the moment, you and the opposition cannot find common ground.... [Duray] Your observation is correct from both the political and the tactical points of view. If the participation in the government of a specific political structure is not being given consideration, there is not sufficient reason for talking about support for a government in which it will not be represented. A vote of no confidence in V. Meciar is not connected with support for another government. This issue is associated with the political legitimacy of the parties in parliament, of which none, apart from the Slovak National Party, had an independent state in its program. The fact that the government of the current prime minister has abused its power is something else. It wants to place economically loyal people around itself--loyal on account of their share in privatization. This is in fact causing cracks in the opposition, which is also interested in a share of privatization so that it can reward its supporters with "gifts" from it. This is partially a power and partially a financial struggle. [Vargova] Mr. Duka-Zolyomi has emphasized that, if a grand coalition was discussed at the opposition's talks last year, it was a grand coalition in the broadest sense of the word. Does this mean that you were given specific promises? [Duray] No one discussed a grand coalition with us. We declared our readiness to take part in such a government, but we received no offer. If I remember correctly, a grand coalition has been on the agenda since the beginning of last December, and, since that time, it has been clear that no consideration is being given to our participation in it. [Vargova] If the situation were to change, which department would you be interested in? [Duray] We are prepared for certain posts, including ministerial ones, in health care, the economy, education, and culture. We have experts capable of filling such posts, and I am convinced that they will do better than the current government.
