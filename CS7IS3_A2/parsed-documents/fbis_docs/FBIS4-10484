On arriving at the airport he reviewed his main activities in Europe. In view of the fact that in Europe he had reiterated his desire to privatize state enterprises, he was asked about the Senate's determination not to privatize ANDE [National Electric Power Administration], Corposana [Water and Sanitation Corporation], Antelco [National Telecommunications Administration], and INC [National Cement Industry]. He answered that he fully respected the senators' decisions, but he made it clear that he will inform himself fully of the scope of that decision and will speak afterward with the senators. "It is not a question of talking about privatizing enterprises.... For example in ANDE's case, the distribution, maintenance, invoicing, etc., can be privatized. This can even be done through bids or with the private sector," he insisted. He commented that he had asked for "fresh resources in terms of foreign investment, nonreturnable cooperation, and the financing of the expansion of social programs." He stressed that he had received the EC's commitment to support these plans, and that, of course, he had discussed our democratic process. He also stated that he had discussed the situation of the Pilcomayo River, state reform, the third stage of industrial reconversion, and the Chaco's sustainable development, etc. He gave no details on these points. He then said: "It is not the government's idea to get the country into debt, but to advance in accordance with our possibilities so as not to affect the pocket and stomach of the people. "I have spoken about the openness of our government in the sense that governments and the armed and police forces are always accused of corruption. Moreover, in some European countries the winners of bids even figure on their balance sheets the commissions they pay to Latin American countries," he said. He announced that, together with other chiefs of state, they hope to "submit a project of openness" during the meeting they will have with President Bill Clinton on 9 and 10 December in Miami, Florida, referring to the Summit of the Americas. He announced that he had found the possibility of modernizing our railway in order to count on a rapid transit system between Asuncion and neighboring towns. He even spoke of the intention of connecting Asuncion with Itaipu Lake and finally with the [Paraguay-Parana River] waterway through a railway system. A mission is going to come for the technical studies, but for the time being there are no details. Finally, he admitted that our country is unknown in Europe. "I am pained to see that we are not known in the world," he said.
