The meeting was opened by President Askar Akayev of Kyrgyzia. In his opening address the president expressed the desire to see the meeting make "the first step towards the peaceful settlement of the Karabakh conflict." Taking part in the forum are Chairman of the Board of the Inter- Parliamentary Assembly Vladimir Shumeyko, Speaker of the Parliament of Kyrgyzstan [as received] Afiyaddin Dzhalilov, Armenian Parliament Chairman Babken Araktsyan, representatives of Nagorno-Karabakh lead by Karen Baburyan. Roger Janson of Finland is attending as an observer. On the eve of the meeting Vladimir Shumeyko told journalists that he was attaching great significance to negotiations on the Karabakh problem. It is impermissible for two countries both of which are members of the Commonwealth to wage war against each other, he said. Recently Azerbaijan agreed to recognise Nagorno-Karabakh as a party to the conflict, which marked a considerable shift, which increases chances of success. Afiyaddin Dzhalilov said before leaving Baku for Bishkek that the Azeri side regards the meeting in the Kyrgyz capital as an important step along the path of settling the conflict. Along with this he declared that the Commonwealth member-states "must at last recognise that Armenia's actions are aggressive and express due political evaluation thereof."
