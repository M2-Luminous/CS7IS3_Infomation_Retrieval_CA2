Mr. Sanxhaku called "groundless" the charge on the defendant Nano. Opposing the evidence presented at the court by the prosecutors, Mr. Sanxhaku said the Levante Co. have been chosen by the Italian side and not by Fatos Nano. Further on, Mr. Sanxhaku read the main indications of contracts and invoices related to the Italian aid. Attorney Sanxhaku said that the partial knowledge with minutes of the investigation and the short time at their disposal have not have made it impossible for him to fully defence his client. At these circumstances, Mr. Sanxhaku said "it is impossible for me to ask the innocence or guiltiness for my client." While Agim Tirana, the other Nano's attorney, tried to use two testimonies made in the trial in favour of Defendant Nano. The former premier Nano considering himself outside the process by adopting the same stand toward the court, said the charges against him have political motives. He said nothing about the falsification of official documents and misappropriation of the Italian aid for Albania. The other three codefendants, Sokrat Plaka, former deputy foreign minister, Robert Gjini, former secretary general at the Ministry for Foreign Economic Trade and Relations, and Hasan Hallko, former director of the Food Department at the ministry, declared they were innocent and the procedure followed so far has been unjust. At the end, the court will hand down its final decision on April 3, 1994.
