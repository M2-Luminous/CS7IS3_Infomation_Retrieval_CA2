At the same time, they also decided to announce measures to deal with the non-performing loans of financial institutions. These measures will be included in the comprehensive economic measures the government will prepare in mid-January. The ministries and agencies say the measures will be announced on the premise that income tax reductions as well as increases in the consumption tax to about 7 percent in April 1995 should be made simultaneously. However, they also say a plan to delay consumption tax increases -- in case it disrupts the economic recovery -- should be clearly spelled out in relevant bills for tax reform. A special feature of the measures is that considerations are given to the economic situation. Financial authorities plan to persuade the ruling coalition parties and economic circles about these measures. However, it seems Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa will face difficulty in coordinating the ruling coalition parties because some of them, including the Social Democratic Party of Japan, are strongly against the idea of increasing the consumption tax rate. Other stimulus measures the ministries and agencies are planing to incorporate in the bills are "increases in the amount the Housing Loan Corporation will allow consumers to borrow for home purchases as well as tax decreases for house renovation expenses"; "purchases of land on which mortgages have been set by banks prior to drawing actual plans for large scale public land utilization and to relaxing land taxes"; "abolishing the special corporate tax as early as 1994, which was introduced during the Gulf war"; and "lifting the ban on corporate purchases of their own company stocks." The ministries and agencies are also trying to work out specific measures regarding the nonperforming loans of financial institutions. At the same time, they will launch medium- and long-term measures designed to speed up the timing of public works; they will also spend large portions of the 430 trillion yen earmarked in the current fundamental plan for public investments for the ten-year period ending in 2000. Moreover, they are planning to show a blueprint of the economic situation for the beginning of the 21st century -- including the easing of government regulations as well as the reform of the industrial structure and the employment situation -- pending coordination among government agencies and ministries. As a result of an expansion in income tax reductions and public investments which are part of the current economic measures, the government will boost the actual economic growth rate by 2 percent or more over the next 15 months. Because of this, the government will aim at making the growth rate, which is expected to be almost 0 percent in fiscal 1993, recover to 2 percent in fiscal 1994 and to 3 percent after fiscal 1995, a steady growth route. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is scheduled to announce such fundamental ideas at a news conference on New Year's day. These economic measures are being worked out on the premise that the general consumption tax will be raised starting April 1995. The consumption rate for cars, for instance, will be temporarily dropped from 4.5 percent to 3 percent in April 1994, but that is to induce people to buy new cars before the tax rate is raised. The consumption tax increase is a precondition to abolition of the special 2.5 percent corporate tax introduced to raise revenues for the Gulf war. As a source of revenue to make up for the shortfalls which will be created by income tax reductions, the government plans to issue "emergency bonds" until it can raise the consumption tax. Moreover, the government stresses that if it fails to achieve its plan to increase the consumption tax, the plan to expand public investment will be linked to the issuance of more construction bonds, which will worsen financial situation and will hamper activation of the Japanese economy in terms of the medium- and long-term perspective. Because of this, economic ministries and agencies, including the Finance Ministry, are assuming the stance that they cannot help but change the economic measures if they are not be able to increase the consumption tax after 15 months.
