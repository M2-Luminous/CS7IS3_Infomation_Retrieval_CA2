FR940418-1-00023 FR940418-1-00005 C. The 1981 and 1986 SIP Submittals 1. The 1981 SO 2 SIP Submittal A Utah SO 2 SIP revision was submitted with a letter dated August 17, 1981, by the Governor of Utah to address the attainment of the SO 2 NAAQS in Salt Lake County and portions of the nonattainment area in Tooele County. Additional information was submitted by the State on December 7, 1981 and January 25, 1983. On February 7, 1983, the Governor submitted a request to redesignate all of Salt Lake County and the nonattainment portion of Tooele County to attainment. On March 23, 1984 (49 FR 10926), EPA proposed to delay any action on the request to redesignate the area to attainment until final resolution of several issues. A detailed discussion of this SIP revision is contained in the March 23, 1984 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and should be used as a reference for additional information. This SIP revision contained several complex national issues, such as what constitutes ambient air and whether attainment demonstration is sufficient without dispersion modeling or monitoring. Section 50.1 of Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) defines ``ambient air'' simply as ``that portion of the atmosphere, external to buildings, to which the general public has access.'' Application of that regulatory provision is based on an evaluation of where public lands are involved, where private lands are subject to little restriction on access, or conversely, where lands adjacent to a source are clearly restricted for the public. Kennecott has maintained for some years, that public access to the property (and therefore, the atmosphere) in question has been and is precluded. The cumulative effect of Kennecott's property holding, property exchanges, installation of fences, posts, no-trespassing signs, and security patrolling, supports the Company's claim to control use of the relevant property. There was information on termination of limited elk hunting practices in the area. Kennecott's man-made barriers, and other security measures, together with the inherently rugged nature of the mountainous terrain involved, were believed to effectively preclude access. The control strategy for the 1981 SIP has several parts: (1) Emission limitations on several low-level stacks at the smelter (e.g., boilers and heat treaters); (2) reasonably available measures to control or eliminate fugitive emissions; and (3) cumulative emission limits for the main stack (see additional discussion on these emission limits in 2.b. below). The State's strategy was based upon measured ambient data in the lower elevation near the smelter. EPA identified the major deficiencies of the State analysis: (1) The State made no attempt to demonstrate the effects in the upper elevation (above 5600 feet in the Oquirrh Mountains); and (2) the database at the smelter was insufficient to be used reliably with the established emission limits, given the assumption in the development of the emission limits technique. Modeling analyses performed by the State and EPA to demonstrate attainment in the upper elevation were screening analyses only. EPA concluded that dispersion modeling in this complex terrain was unreliable and that the only method that could be used for this determination was monitoring. The 1981 SO 2 SIP was conditionally approved on the assumption that the emission limits were consistent with federal 1985 stack height rules and, therefore, adequate for attainment of the SO 2 NAAQS. The redesignation of the area to attainment was denied. (50 FR 7059, February 20, 1985) 2. The May 2, 1986 GEP SIP Submittal The Utah Stack Height SIP was submitted by the Governor with a letter dated May 2, 1986. The submittal included regulations to address (1) GEP stack height credit and dispersion techniques, (2) a new Section 17 of the SIP that listed all existing stacks in Utah greater than 65 meters, and (3) a technical support document for Section 17 of the SIP. The Kennecott Magna stack analyses were part of this submittal. Subsequent submittals to support the Kennecott analyses were received in letters dated October 6, 1986, December 3, 1986, November 13, 1987, and May 17, 1988. The Kennecott smelter stack height credit was a significant component of the Utah SO 2 SIP emission limits conditionally approved on February 20, 1985. Briefly, a condition in that approval required the State to determine whether the 1215-foot stack would be GEP once the revised stack height regulations were promulgated. If not, the emission limits would then be revised as necessary.
