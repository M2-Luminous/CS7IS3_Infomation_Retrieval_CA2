Developments in the past few days, in which National Executive Committee members have questioned the actions of PRD President Porfirio Munoz Ledo and accused him of violating party statutes, prompted the urgent meeting. It was called on such short notice that Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, PRD presidential candidate, had to interrupt his political campaign to meet with the PRD's National Executive Committee in an attempt to reach an agreement. The PRD parliamentary subcoordinator has acknowledged that formulas and mechanisms for PRD unity are urgently needed. Maria Elena Martinez de la Vega is staying abreast of developments. Maria Elena, good afternoon. How are you? We have heard that because they were being hounded by newsmen, the PRD's National Executive Committee decided to change the venue for its meeting, which is being held behind closed doors. How are you? [Martinez] Fine. In fact, the meeting has been quite closely held, Pepe. The PRD's National Executive Committee is meeting at the home of Efigenia Martinez. Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, Porfirio Munoz Ledo, Mario Salcedo, Lucas de la Garza, Jesus Ortega, and Ramon Sosa Montes have arrived -- in short, all the members of the PRD's National Executive Committee. They began arriving at approximately 1700 this afternoon. We do not know how long the meeting will last. Gilberto Rincon Gallardo told us they will try to smooth out the differences between various currents within the PRD so as to restore the party's institutionality. Thus far, no PRD member who has arrived at Efigenia's home has made a statement. We hope that when they do come out, they will have overcome their differences and we may be able to speak to a member of the PRD. [Announcer] Maria Elena, this afternoon you gave us an advance report on what was happening within the PRD. You spoke to the PRD's parliamentary subcoordinator. He acknowledged it was urgent that PRD members find formulas and mechanisms for achieving badly-needed unity, especially at this difficult time in the electoral process. [Martinez] Yes, those were the words of Gilberto Rincon Gallardo, who as you noted is the PRD's parliamentary subcoordinator. He said the various currents within the PRD must realize that formulas and mechanisms for achieving PRD unity and ending internal party conflicts must be urgently sought. We interviewed him today at PRD national headquarters. We were there since 1100 this morning, awaiting the outcome of the National Executive Committee meeting. Rincon Gallardo said the various party currents must unite and restore the party's institutionality. He also said they can reach this agreement and that it is urgent that this process get under way. Pepe, as soon as any member of the PRD emerges, we will talk to him and report back to you. [Announcer] Yes, of course, we will stay in touch with you on this topic of so much interest. Thank you, Maria Elena.
