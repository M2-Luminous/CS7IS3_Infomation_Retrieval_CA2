After it had ended, Kravchuk replied to questions from journalists. Speaking about the actions of Crimea's parliament, which has renewed the text of the Republic of Crimea's Constitution in its 6 May 1992 edition (in particular it is about mutual relations between Crimea and Ukraine on the basis of treaties and agreements, dual citizenship, and setting up military formations on the peninsula's territory), Ukraine's president noted that the appeal by Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko to the world community condemning the position of the Crimean deputies had received the support of many international organizations. The head of the Ukrainian state assesses the "Ostankino" Television Company's portrayal of the events on the Crimean peninsula as the conscious incitement of people to confrontation. Replying to a question regarding the work of Ukraine's Supreme Council, Kravchuk emphasized that the beginning was more optimistic than the further work of the parliament. "Although when we were discussing the Crimea issue in the Supreme Council I saw that the majority of deputies had a responsible attitude to the Crimean problem." In the opinion of Ukraine's president, life will put everything in its place and parliament will occupy the proper statesmanlike position. Kravchuk observed that he had not changed his views on the presidential election. In this, in particular, he is supported by the leadership of Nikolayev and its oblast. "In order to elect a president it is necessary to create a legal basis for power. Incidentally, Crimea is a vivid confirmation of this. Crimea got autonomy in 1990, but the law on the delimitation of powers was adopted two years later. In this time the legal vacuum was filled, which led to a situation where the accumulated political and legal problems may be resolved only by returning to a starting position." To a question regarding the truth about our state being pushed "from below" toward a federative system, the president said that in order to elaborate federative laws one should have a professional parliament and work every day for three years.
