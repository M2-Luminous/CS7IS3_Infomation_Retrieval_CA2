Vladimir Kazimirov Ends Baku Visit"] [Text] Azerbaijani leaders have turned down Moscow's proposal for a cease-fire in the area of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict that would have gone into effect at 0000 on 1 February. This transpired on the afternoon of 31 January after the completion of talks in Baku between Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev and Vladimir Kazimirov, chief of the Russian Federation's mediatory mission, who had arrived in Azerbaijani capital. According to reports from Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry sources, the talks were held in a difficult atmosphere. Before noon the Russian diplomat discussed the Russian plan for a peaceful settlement with Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov one on one for more than two hours. The two sides considered the possibility of a cease-fire to go into force on the night of 1 February along the entire front line. Vladimir Kazimirov, who earlier visited Yerevan and Khankendi (Stepanakert), managed to obtain the Armenian side's agreement to the cease-fire. He then had to convince the Baku authorities of the need to reciprocate. To all appearances, the meeting of the Russian diplomat with the Azerbaijani foreign minister was inconclusive. In a press release on the results of the meeting, Vladimir Kazimirov said that "the conflicting parties still hold uncompromising stances." Nonetheless he expressed his hope that a cease-fire agreement would finally be reached and would go into force on the night of 1 February. However, Kazimirov's meeting with the Azerbaijani president, which took place a bit later, confirmed that Baku was unprepared to compromise with the Armenian side. After the meeting with the Russian diplomat, Geydar Aliyev said that signing a cease-fire agreement would be possible only after Armenian troops left occupied Azerbaijani territories. According to Aliyev, currently Armenian troops occupy seven Azerbaijani districts outside Nagorno-Karabakh, and agreeing to negotiate with Armenia before the troop withdrawal would mean Azerbaijan's submission to Yerevan's pressure. To all appearances, Azerbaijan's refusal to sign a cease-fire in the region without preconditions means that a meeting of the foreign ministers of Russia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia in Moscow scheduled for this week will be postponed indefinitely. An official spokesman for the Russian Foreign Ministry told your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent that Moscow was not inclined to see the results of the Baku talks as a failure of the mediatory mission. In the near future Moscow will continue its peacekeeping efforts to broker a truce in the region. "Without a cease-fire none of the parties is likely to have its demands satisfied," the representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry said.
