The meeting began at around 7 P.M. shortly after Hosokawa and Kono met separately with Takako Doi, speaker of the House of Representatives, who urged the two rivals to come to terms on the issue. Ichiro Ozawa, co-leader of Shinseito [Japan Reneweal Party], the second-largest but most influential party in the ruling coalition, attended the top-level meeting along with LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori. Mori told reporters just before the start of the meeting that the LDP leadership agreed to meet with Hosokawa and Ozawa in response to a compromise proposal made by Doi, a former chairwoman of the Social Democratic Party (SDP). Doi proposed passing the bills without setting a date for implementation and then discussing revision of the package in the next ordinary Diet session, coalition sources said. Earlier, Hosokawa met with Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the SDP, the largest party in the coalition, to seek his support for a face-off with Kono, officials said. The SDP has been opposed to making further concessions on the political reform bills. The coalition and the opposition, including the LDP, failed to reach an accord over the issue Thursday night at a meeting of the joint council of the two Diet houses. The council was made up of 10 members from the coalition who voted for the bills in the lower house and 10 legislators from the opposition who opposed the package in the upper house. The alliance moved closer to the LDP position by amending the government's four-bill reform package, which was voted down by the House of Councillors last Friday. The package passed the more powerful House of Representatives last November. The coalition's compromise proposal would increase the number of single-seat constituencies to 280 from 274 in the original bill and cut the number of proportional representation seats correspondingly to 220 from 226. The mix is intended to replace the current multiple-seat constituency system in lower house elections. The coalition is also backpedaling on the initial blanket ban on corporate donations to individual politicians by allowing members of local assemblies to receive such donations for five years after the reform bills are enacted. In the joint council session, the LDP rejected the compromise, and counterproposed its own slightly revised reform package, which was rejected by the lower house in November. The LDP version calls for 300 seats single-seat constituencies and 171 under proportional representation, as well as allowing individual politicians to accept corporate donations through designated fund-raising organizations. The coalition refused to accept this, and Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary general of Komeito and the coalition's chief negotiator, who chaired the meeting, declared an end to the effort by the joint council to find ground for a compromise. If the talks between Hosokawa and Kono end in failure, the coalition will send the package back to a plenary session of the lower house to seek a two-thirds majority to pass the bills, some coalition members hinted. This would require some 70 rebels from the LDP to vote for the package. If the bills fail to be passed, Hosokawa will be forced to have his cabinet resign en masse or dissolve the lower house for a snap election, political analysts say. Hosokawa said Thursday he will not cling to power if he fails to achieve political reform by Saturday's close of the Diet session.
