FBIS4-434 "drafr070_a_94016" FBIS-AFR-94-070 Daily Report 12 Apr 1994 CENTRAL AFRICA Rwanda Defense Ministry Urges Citizens To Fight RPF Defense Ministry Urges Citizens To Fight RPF EA1204130094 Kigali Radiodiffusion Nationale de la Republique Rwandaise in Kinyarwanda 0910 GMT 12 Apr 94 EA1204130094 Kigali Radiodiffusion Nationale de la Republique Rwandaise Kinyarwanda BFN [Communique issued by the Ministry of National Defense; place and date not given] [Text] After hearing the lies spread by Radio Muhabura, the Ministry of National Defense informs Rwandans and the Rwandan Armed Forces of the following: 1. All Rwandans, the entire Rwandan Armed Forces -- that is the Army and the Gendarmerie -- are called upon not to believe the lies broadcast by Radio Muhabura which are meant to divide Rwandans and their Armed Forces. 2. Radio Muhabura is spreading lies saying that the Akazu [Habyarimana, his relatives, and close friends] forces are killing the Nduga [Hutus from the south] and other people whose opinions differ from those of the Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development and the Coalition for the Defense of the Republic. The words are baseless and are only geared towards dividing Rwandans into two. They are saying that some are Kiga [Habyarimana's Hutu subclan] while others are Nduga so that they do not unite and so that the enemy can take over the country. The tricks of the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] have been known to Rwandans for a long time. 3. Radio Muhabura is consistently lying that the soldiers who guarded his excellency the president of the Republic started the war and that other Army units stopped assisting them. This lie is also not surprising since lying is one of the characteristics of the RPF. Soldiers, gendarmes, and all Rwandans have decided to fight their common enemy, who they have all identified, together. The enemy is still the same. He is the one who has always been trying to return the overthrown monarch. 4. The Ministry of Defense calls on Rwandans, soldiers, and gendarmes to do the following: Citizens are asked to act together, to carry out patrols, and to fight the enemy. Citizens are asked to support their Armed Forces by showing them the location of the enemy. The Armed Forces are asked to continue to carry out their duties by protecting our country and its citizens. Rwandans and the Rwandan Armed Forces are called upon not to listen to the lies of Radio Muhabura and other radios which spread RPF news, as this is meant to divide Rwandans and to cause fear. It is really sad to see how the rebels are sending the youth to the war front, trying unsuccessfully to fight a war they cannot win and believing that they can capture the country. That is just a dream, as all Rwandans are alert.
