So far, there have been few reports and all that we can say now is that the Krajina delegation landed at [Zagreb] Pleso airport aboard an UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] helicopter at 0930. With tight security measures, they arrived at the Russian Embassy at 1000. At the meeting with the Russian president's special envoy, Vitaliy Churkin, the head of the Krajina delegation expressed discontent with the composition of the Croat delegation. Namely, the Croatian side is not being led, as was agreed, by Gojko Susak, but by Hrvoje Sarinic. While the first results of the negotiations are awaited, let us say that President Milan Martic is currently holding a meeting with his closest associates. We, however, have asked Djordje Bjegovic, chairman of the caretaker government, to say something more for Belgrade Radio about the draft agreement that is most probably being discussed in Zagreb. Is this a new agreement, or is it something that has now been seen for the first time in these regions? [Bjegovic] First of all, I think that it is most important to say that the good thing is that peace is being discussed. Certainly that this first stage regarding the cease-fire and [word indistinct] signing such a document is the most important task, which should be regarded as a preliminary one. I think that what we may say in this situation is that there are no other agreements apart from corresponding modalities in a section of the line of separation. This part of the job should be documented with corresponding plans, that is, maps that would certainly verify this line of separation, so that one knows what we are talking about. The agreement, as a text, has never been a problem. The problem lay in the deployment of forces and certainly in the most important part of the job, the one that ensures peace, so that the artillery can finally be moved and thereby opportunities to shell one position from another are removed. I think that, in this situation, this is extremely difficult. I think that the other aspect is most important. I think that, as the Croatian delegation has already changed its composition, it is impossible to expect anything to be signed in such a situation. The most important thing to say in the present situation is that our delegation is in Zagreb for the first time, and I think that, in this case -- let us express it in a sportsman's way -- we now have the white pieces [as in chess] and I am sure that this part of our cooperativeness will be (?appreciated) by the world. [Stankic] One more question: The negotiations are being held in the Russian Embassy, at the Russian initiative, and with Vitaliy Churkin, special adviser to the Russian president, attending. What can you tell us about the Russian role in all this? [Bjegovic] Well, you know, Russia [words indistinct] plays a relevant role. I think that at this moment, their role is much more specific than it was a year ago. The job that Russia wants to complete is exactly of the kind that we may expect, with a far greater level of security, to reach results, than was the case in the past. However, I can also say in this situation that this is not the time for us to be too optimistic. I would be happy if the Russian representatives would now exert their influence in an (?equality) way, that is, if they would exert their influence in the [word indistinct] stage, which now means the cessation of hostilities. Therefore, not partially, but (?completely). [Stankic] Mr. Bjegovic, thank you for this conversation. We are going to report again when we have new information. [end recording]
