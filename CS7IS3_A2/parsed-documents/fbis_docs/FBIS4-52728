The Mozambican Committee for Friendship with the People of the DPRK said in a statement April 23 that the IAEA manipulated by the United States is picking quarrel only with Korea, a non-nuclear state, while conniving at the production of nuclear arms in other countries. If the U.S. and IAEA truly want global peace, they should destroy all nuclear weapons, check the nuclear development of Japan and South Korea and stop slandering Korea over the fictitious "nuclear issue", the statement said. The Ghanaian National Institute of the Chuche Idea demanded in a statement April 10 that the United States discontinue the "Team Spirit" joint military exercises for good and stop at once the deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea for peace and security of the world. The Guyanese National Committee for the Study of the Chuche Idea of Comrade Kim Il-song, in a statement April 26, criticized the IAEA Secretariat and the UN Security Council for applying, under the U.S. patronage, the extremely discriminatory and prejudiced double standard to the "nuclear issue" of the DPRK. The Nepal Workers and Peasants Party, in a protest letter addressed to the U.S. President on May 1, branded the stepped-up preparations of the United States to resume joint military exercises against the DPRK, a socialist state, as an act of disturbing global peace, especially peace and security in the Korean peninsula. It urged the United States to immediately withdraw its nuclear weapons, over 40,000 troops and Patriot missiles from South Korea.
