Reinforcements for 2d Russian UN Battalion"] [Text] An advance detachment of Russian "Blue Helmets" set off from Ryazan by a military aviation aircraft 25 March. It will reinforce the personnel of the 2d Russian battalion which is part of the UN peacekeeping forces on the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina where, once the Russians arrived, it became possible to conclude the long-awaited peace between the warring sides. The dispatch of an additional contingent from the Russian Army to Sarajevo with equipment and weapons, Colonel General Yevgeniy Podkolzin, commander of the Airborne Troops, said in a conversation with your KRASNAYA ZVEZDA correspondent, is being effected with the knowledge and agreement of the UN Security Council. This concerns an additional military contingent of our "blue helmets" numbering 300 men, which has been allocated by a directive of the Russian president and with the agreement of the Federation Council in response to a request from Secretary General Butrus-Ghali to participate in conducting peacekeeping operations in Bosnia-Herzegovina. As the Airborne Troops commander stressed, the presence of Russian paratroopers from the UN peacekeeping forces is a key aspect in the implementation of the plan for the political settlement of the Bosnian crisis, put forward by Russia in the second half of February. But recently, after Russian paratroopers mounted posts on demarcation lines and the collection points of Serbian heavy guns which have been transferred under control of UN forces, and when mutual cooperation between the UN and Serbian commands was established, as is clear from reports coming into the Foreign Ministry and reports from Colonel Viktor Vorobyev, commander of the battalion, the command of the UN forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina is making attempts to change the original task for our UN battalion. The question of giving it appropriate peacekeeping status is deliberately being dragged out, which is making it possible to put the Russians in the UN reserve. At present, the commander of the Airborne Troops reported, our paratroopers have left a key post across the River Miljacka, as well as several posts on a likely avenue of tank approach in the Serb area of Grbavica. The Russians' positions have been occupied by French "Blue Helmets," which is a violation of the treaty with the Serb side, and may lead to an escalation of tension in this area which is explosive as it is. Obviously, Col. Gen. Podkolzin noted, bringing Russian peacekeeping forces into Sarajevo, and reinforcing them by 300 servicemen, the first detachment of whom is now being sent to Bosnia, and also our intention to send military observers to the area of the airport of the city of Tuzla, is generating concern in the West that Russia has taken on an excessively active role in settling the crisis in the Balkans. Nevertheless, the commander of the Airborne Troops said in conclusion, in accordance with the political settlement plan, we are continuing to send our "Blue Helmets" to Sarajevo. Today's landing party comprises 100 servicemen: 59 officers and warrant officers, and the rest -- noncommissioned officers and soldiers who have performed their compulsory service in the Airborne Troops and have concluded contracts with the Ministry of Defense. ...An inspection of the "Blue Helmets" was carried out on the airfield near Ryazan. It was conducted by Major General Nikolay Staskov, deputy commander of the Airborne Troops for the Peacekeeping Forces. For the first time, before the departure of the "blue helmets," a blessing ceremony was carried out which was conducted by clergy from the Orthodox and Islamic faiths (those going to Bosnia include Muslim soldiers).
