Therefore, we must adhere to the theory of Comrade Deng Xiaoping with regard to building socialism with Chinese characteristics and to the party's basic line, be based on reality, fulfill the plan on schedule and without fail, and win a victory in handling the knotty problems. Attending yesterday's conference were leading personnel from the regional level organs, including Qian Fenyong, Bai Enpei, Liu Zhen, Zhang Tingwu, Yang Zizhen, and Alatanaoqier. In his speech Wang Qun pointed out: The "8-7" plan formulated by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council for helping 80 million poor people throughout the country deal with their problems of dressing warmly and eating their fill during the seven years before the end of this century has a bearing on the whole situation. It is a big event that has a bearing on the interests of China and the Chinese nation. Over the past half century, the CPC has experienced countless complications in leading the people of various nationalities across the country and also scored great achievements attracting worldwide attention. However, there are 80 million people in the country and 30 million people in the region, who are still in poverty status. This warrants leadership at all levels meditate. In this sense, fulfilling the "8-7" specific plan marks a great historical change in which China and Chinese nation have thereupon cast off the poverty and entered a brand-new, wealthy, civilized, and developed period. Only by thoroughly casting off poverty can we eloquently prove that poverty and polarization do not belong to socialism. Only commonly becoming wealthy represents the socialism with Chinese characteristics and can prove that the CPC is completely and thoroughly working for the happiness and interest of the vast majority. Wang Qun pointed out: We should implement the spirit of directive given by Comrade Jiang Zemin with regard to "thinking of new ways in helping the poor." Specific measures adopted by the region in fulfilling its "3-7" plan chiefly are as follows: 1. It is imperative to foster the viewpoints of the market economy in helping the poor by handling the knotty problems. The establishment of systems of socialist market economy has brought about an excellent opportunity of development to the poor localities. The volume of demands raised by both vast domestic and foreign markets to the professions of planting and raising and to the industries of natural resources has become increasingly large. This is just a good opportunity for the poor localities to vigorously carry out their plans. We must renew our concepts and accelerate the development of the large-scale commodity economy. We cannot become wealthy by engaging in the production of petty commodities and will certainly be rich by engaging in the production of important ones. 2. We must first help the poor foster their confidence while giving support to them. We should direct the poor localities and households to wage an arduous struggle, to be self-reliant, to define their own goal in line with their reality, and to be determined to cast off poverty and become wealthy. 3. In helping the poor by handling the knotty problems, we should be based on deepening the reform in rural and pastoral areas. According to the market law, a good job should be done in readjusting the industrial structure and product mix of rural and pastoral areas. First, we should stabilize the household responsibility system linked with their output of rural and pastoral areas. Based on this foundation, we should establish or improve the dual system with the integration between centralized and decentralized management and gradually expand the scale of collectively owned economy to enhance the actual strength of collectives in helping the poor. Efforts should be made to bring into play the enthusiasm of collectives and poor households so as to give full expression to the socialist superiority. 4. In helping the poor by handling the knotty problems, we must adhere to the principle of supporting the poor in the course of development. Supporting the poor in the course of development means that it is necessary to rely on the joint forces fostered by the state support and the cooperation of the masses to develop or build the projects of casting off poverty and becoming wealthy. In view of the autonomous region, measures to conduct capital construction among farm fields and pastoral farms and to build the projects of ecological benefits should be adopted to improve the productive conditions and to build some proper-scale bases of farm and livestock commodities, which have stable and high yields as well as high benefits. 5. In helping the poor by handling the knotty problems, we should concentrate our financial and material resources on giving priority to dealing with the key problems encountered by poor localities and households and on creating necessary conditions for them. 6. In helping the poor by handling the knotty problems, we should bring political strong points into play. The region has had a long-standing tradition of unity among the nationalities and progress, as well as of equality and mutual assistance among various nationalities. We should carry out the activities of encouraging the masses to commonly become wealthy, issue the letter of responsibility to every household, and turn the activities into the conscious act of the masses. 7. In helping the poor by handling the knotty problems, a good job should be done in conducting intellectual, scientific, and technological support. In conducting poverty control, we must first carry out ignorance control and vigorously conduct the activities of social education. Efforts should be made to forcibly make cultural knowledge popular, to popularize science and technology, and to enable the poor households to obtain one or several capabilities in technology. 8. Tasks adopted for helping the poor by handling the knotty problems should be fulfilled within the given date. Leadership at all levels should integrate without conditions or haggling the principle of having the people, townships (sumu), banners (counties) become wealthy with the development of the banner-county level economy, as well as of township and vanguard enterprises. They should develop enterprises with various ownerships and be winners in having markets well in mind and in casting off poverty. Lastly Wang Qun stressed: Party committees and governments at all levels should enhance their leadership over the work. Principal leading personnel should take personal charge of the work and leading personnel sharing the tasks in this regard should earnestly grasp the work. They should strengthen their services and realistically assume the duties imposed on them by history. Efforts should be made to establish the systems of supervision and inspection in this regard and to win a new victory in deepening the reform, fostering unity and stability, and making the economy leap forward. During the work conference, Wu Liji also delivered a speech in which he pointed out: In fulfilling the region's "3-7" plan for helping the poor by handling the knotty problems, it is imperative to achieve in adhering to the following seven principles: First, we should adhere to the principle of integrating the work of dealing with the problems of dressing warmly and eating one's fill with that of becoming better-off and wealthy. [passage omitted] Second, we should adhere to the principle of integrating the work of helping the poor in the course of development with that of helping the poor while conducting opening up. [passage omitted] Third, we should adhere to the principle of integrating the work of encouraging the people to become wealthy with that of encouraging townships, banners, and counties to do so. [passage omitted] Fourth, we should adhere to the principle of integrating economic development with intellectual development. [passage omitted] Fifth, we should adhere to the principle of integrating material production with population growth. [passage omitted] Sixth, we should adhere to the principle of integrating the material civilization drive with that of spiritual civilization. [passage omitted] Seventh, we should adhere to the principle of integrating state support with local self-reliance. [passage omitted]
