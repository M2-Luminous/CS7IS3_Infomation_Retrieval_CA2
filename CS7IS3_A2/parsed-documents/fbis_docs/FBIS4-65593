Although progress has recently been made -- for example, the settlements for Sarajevo and Gorazde and those for a Croat-Bosniak federation -- the situation is still "fragile." Both Kinkel and [French Foreign Minister] Juppe stressed that many obstacles still have to be eliminated on the road to a peaceful solution. Before German journalists, Kinkel was reserved in his evaluation of the results of the negotiations. "I do not want to be seized with false euphoria, we have so often been disappointed." After his talks with President Yeltsin and [Russian Foreign Minister] Kozyrev, he hopes for Russian pressure. Referring to the lifting of the arms embargo for the Muslims' benefit, which is recommended by the U.S. Senate, Kinkel said that "10 of the 12 states of the European Union [EU] have problems with the lifting of the arms embargo." Moreover, in the UN Security Council, Great Britain and France would vote against it. On Friday evening, Kinkel also met with Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic in Geneva. [passage omitted] While the agreement that was negotiated between Croats and Muslims and centrally handled by the Americans in Vienna apparently started from 50 percent for these two groups, the circle of ministers in Geneva agreed on a ratio of 51 percent for the federation to 49 percent for the Serbs. Thus, it accepted the ratio that was put forward by the European Union as early as at the end of last year. [passage omitted]
