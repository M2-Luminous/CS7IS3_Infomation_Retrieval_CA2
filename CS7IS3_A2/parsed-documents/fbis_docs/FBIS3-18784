This unilateral measure permits the United States to take retaliatory measures against countries that are opening up their markets insufficiently to U.S. products. "Although this decision has been dictated by the U.S.' vast trade deficit ($59.3 billion) with Japan," Robert Urbain continued in a press release issued in Brussels on Monday [7 March], "the moment chosen to announce this measure is entirely inappropriate, since it comes just after the conclusion of the arduous negotiations on a GATT agreement thatwill be signed officially one month from now in Marrakesh." Mr. Urbain said that, "without seeking to attach too much importance to the effects on our foreign trade caused by resorting to this `Super 301' weapon, which must be considered more as a means of dissuasion and whose reintroduction is certainly also motivated by domestic policy considerations," its use "runs totally counter to the procedures aimed at combatting unfair competition." "Falling back on unilateralism to resolve trade conflicts should be avoided at all costs," the foreign trade minister concluded.
