"The massacre perpetrated on Saturday 5 February in Sarajevo market is a turning point in the Bosnian drama. No one can fail to be disturbed by what we have witnessed. The international community would have to hang its head in shame if it were to let such an act of barbarism occur again. A UN inquiry is underway to determine the source of the attack. However, our reaction must not be conditioned by the results of the inquiry. What is important is that we make a fresh attack impossible, that is, by putting an end to the siege of Sarajevo. "Since yesterday, and with the agreement of the president of the republic and the prime minister, we have been consulting with our partners -- the U.S. secretary of state, our partners in the European Union, and, above all, those countries with troops on the ground. "A consensus has been reached to convene the North Atlantic Council as soon as possible. At this meeting, France will push for the following ultimatum to be put to the belligerents in the clearest terms possible: "1) The siege of Sarajevo must be lifted, meaning that all Serbian troops must pull back to a distance making renewed shelling of the town materially impossible. In particular, all Serbian and Bosnian heavy weapons in a radius of 30 km around the town must be placed under UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] control. This measure will be the first stage in establishing UN administration over Sarajevo, one of the components of the European Union peace plan which was accepted in principle by all parties. "2) If these two requirements are not met by a deadline set by the allies, all resources, including air force, must be implemented to enforce them. "3) The means of implementing this action, if it is adopted by NATO, will be defined and applied in consultation with the United Nations and its secretary general." For his part, Defense Minister Francois Leotard said in a statement: "At present (...) it is not possible to determine the origin of firing. This emphasizes, moreover, the extreme difficulty of managing this crisis militarily, if this were necessary. However, we all agree that it is the siege itself that is the cause of all these deaths. Today, Sarajevo has a death toll of approximately 10,000. This siege cannot be tolerated and we must put an end to it (...). "The use of force, whether in the air, at sea, or on the ground, for us has always been secondary to a political settlement. Air strikes, which are of course the subject of so many comments, are not in themselves or by themselves a response. They are and remain a tool for making reason heard. We have never, and even less today than yesterday, abandoned this method. I remind you that the 3,000 soldiers on the ground in Sarajevo, some 75 percent of whom are French, are on a humanitarian protection mission based on a series of UN resolutions. We regularly see them carrying out their mission with exceptional bravery and self-sacrifice, and I want to again stress this point to you. I merely note today that, from now on, their task will be made even more difficult than before."
