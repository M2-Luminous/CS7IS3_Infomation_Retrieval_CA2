FR940328-0-00030 FR940328-0-00012 Two individuals of this population were observed in 1993 by Joel Lau, TNCH (HHP 1993b1, 1993b2). The entire species totals fewer than 50 known individuals. Lycopodium nutans grows on tree trunks, usually on open ridges and slopes in 'ohi'a-dominated wet forests and occasionally mesic forests (HHP 1991h5 to 1991h7, Hosaka 1937) between 2,000 and 3,500 ft (600 and 1,070 m) in elevation (Robinson 1914, Selling 1946). The vegetation in those areas typically includes kanawao, uluhe, 'uki, Hibiscus sp., hame, and kopiko (HHP 1993b1, 1993b2; S. Perlman, pers. comm., 1991). The primary threat to L . nutans is stochastic extinction and/or reduced reproductive vigor because of the small number of remaining individuals and limited distribution. Additional threats to L. nutans are the noxious alien plants Koster's curse and strawberry guava. Hillebrand (1888) described Pelea lydgatei based on a collection by John M. Lydgate from Palolo Valley, Oahu. In an action not accepted by other taxonomists, Emmanuel Drake del Castillo (1890) transferred the species to the genus Evodia . In 1944, St. John described two new species, P. descendens and P. semiternata , which he later determined were synonymous (St. John 1979). Current authorities, however, do not accept St. John's species as being sufficiently different from P. lydgatei to maintain them as distinct taxa. Thomas G. Hartley and Benjamin C. Stone (1989, Stone et al . 1990, Wagner et al . 1990) synonymized the genus Pelea with Melicope , resulting in the present combination. Melicope lydgatei is a small shrub of the citrus family (Rutaceae) that has leaves arranged oppositely or in threes. The glossy, papery leaves, which are 1.6 to 5.1 in (4 to 13 cm) long and 0.6 to 2.6 in (1.5 to 6.5 cm) wide, vary from lance-shaped to oblong. Flowers are usually functionally unisexual, with both unisexual and bisexual flowers growing on the same plant. Its aromatic, greenish white flowers are about 0.2 to 0.3 in (4 to 7 mm) long and arise singly or in clusters of two or three. The four-lobed capsules, which have sections fused for one-fourth to one-third their length, are between 0.6 and 0.9 in (14 and 22 mm) wide, and contain one or two glossy black seeds, about 0.2 in (5 mm) long, in each section. Both the exocarp and endocarp (outermost and innermost layers of the fruit wall, respectively) are hairless. The species' leaf arrangement (opposite or in groups of three), the amount of fusion of the fruit sections, and the hairless exocarp and endocarp distinguish it from others in the genus (Hillebrand 1888; St. John 1944, 1979; Stone 1969; Wagner et al . 1990). Melicope lydgatei was formerly known throughout the Koolau Mountains of Oahu from Hauula to Kahana, Kipapa Gulch to Waimano, and Kalihi Valley to Wailupe Valley (HHP 1991i1 to 1991i8, 1991i10 to 1991i12, 1993c). Only three populations totalling fewer than 10 individuals, distributed over a 7.5 mi (12 km) distance, remain within its historical range: Along Poamoho Trail near the boundary of State (Ewa Forest Reserve) and private lands; along Manana Trail, growing on State land in Ewa Forest Reserve; and along Peahinaia Trail on private lands (HHP 1991i9, 1991i13, 1993c). This species typically grows in association with Acacia koa (koa), 'ohi'a, uluhe, kopiko, and Bobea elatior ('ahakea lau nui) on open ridges in mesic forests and occasionally in wet forests at elevations between 1,350 and 1,800 ft (410 and 550 m) (HHP 1991i2, 1991i4 to 1991i6, 1991i8 to 1991i10, 1991i12, 1991i13, 1993c; Stone et al. 1990). The primary threat to M. lydgatei is stochastic extinction and/or reduced reproductive vigor because the few individuals that remain are restricted in distribution. In 1826, Charles Gaudichaud-Beaupre described Rollandia crispa from a fragmentary specimen of a leaf he collected. Gaudichaud-Beaupre probably assigned it the specific epithet based on the crisp or crimped leaf margin (Rock 1919). Names to which this species have been referred are Lobelia crispa (Endlicher 1836), R. crispa var. muricata (Rock 1919), R. grandifolia (Hillebrand 1888), and the illegitimate name, Cyanea rollandia (Gray 1861).
