"I think certain sections of the media have tended to swallow their own propaganda and myth," he said. "Prior to the elections the debate on federalism was stifled and instead editorials turned out a bland uniformity of thinking." Mr Tillett also criticised opinion surveys, saying most had predicted three per cent national support for the IFP. However, the party garnered 10.5 per cent of the votes for the National Assembly. "It would appear sections of the media were paralysed into impotency by their transitional jargon and the media appeared to lapse into a certain lingua franca of...informed speculation." Prof Keyan Tomaselli of the University of Natal's Centre for Cultural and Media Studies on Monday said incorrect predictions of support for the IFP were due to unreliable population statistics provided by the state, particularly for rural and peri-urban areas. He said the IFP had lost the support of the English press in the past year because it had become a threat to economic stability and therefore a menace to big business. The English press was free- market orientated, he said, and naturally sided with business.
