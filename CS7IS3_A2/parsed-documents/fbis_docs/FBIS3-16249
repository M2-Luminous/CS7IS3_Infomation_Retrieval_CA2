In Serbian the word "magla" means gloom or fog. Magla -- fog -- features in many extremely colorful popular phrases relating most directly, unfortunately, to the present stage of the protracted Bosnian conflict. People who have lost their composure are described by the Serbs as having "fog descending over their eyes." Fleeing cowards are described as having fled into the fog, and people who behave unthinkingly and thoughtlessly and take a leap into the unknown, as "plunging into the fog." As BBC radio reported, "twice in the last eight days UN forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina have been ready to launch air strikes against Serb positions." World opinion is being purposefully and methodically prepared for another escalation of the Bosnian military conflict. This is being done, to use the Serb expression, under cover of a "diplomatic fog" -- talk about peace-making and about how allegedly it has finally proved possible to achieve a breakthrough at the peace talk among the conflicting parties. Yet there are only separate Muslim-Croat talks, which it would be more correct to describe as a conspiracy aimed against the Serbs. After Washington, where U.S. Secretary of State Christopher managed to bring the Muslims and Croats together by promising U.S. dollars to cement their still extremely problematic alliance, more detailed consultations shifted to Vienna. According to recent reports, an agreement has been reached on dividing Bosnian lands into Swiss-type cantons. The Serbs have nothing against a Muslim-Croat federation, which could eventually become a confederation with Croatia, provided only that it is not the intention to form the new cantons at the expense of Serbian lands. But Muslim leader Alia Izetbegovic is already making absolutely overt demands of the Serbs for territorial concessions in favor of the nascent federation! At the same time the cynical U.S. and NATO blackmail of the Serbs is growing all the time. It is in this context that we should view both the recent act of piracy by the Phantom aircraft which downed four Chaykas in the skies over Banja-Luka and the recent combat air patrols by NATO bandits [stervyatnik] over Maglaj. As world news agencies have reported, British Lieutenant General Rose, commander of UN forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina, asked Yasushi Akashi, the UN secretary general's representative in the former Yugoslavia, for authorization to launch air strikes against Serb positions and was given it. After which Phantoms made combat flights into the Maglaj area, although they were unable to carry out the mission because of bad weather. Maybe the most monstrous thing in this episode is Russian diplomacy's latest act of treachery toward the Serbs. Kozyrev's department is behaving as if nothing extraordinary has happened, and in recent days presidential envoy Vitaliy Churkin has even made statements which essentially constitute pressure on the Bosnian Serbs. The fog surrounding "Yeltsin's Balkan initiative" is gradually dispersing, and on the eve of Kozyrev's meeting with Christopher in Vladivostok the British newspaper THE TIMES made a prediction which, unfortunately, looks extremely plausible: "It looks like the Americans have concluded a new Yalta carve-up with Moscow." In which case, the newspaper concludes, "one can only sympathize with the Serbs." It would be more correct, however, to say that sympathy should be extended not only to the betrayed Serb people but also to us Russians, since the Phantoms currently swooping over Maglaj are in fact also ready to open fire on Russia's interests!
