FR940610-2-00108 FR940610-2-00065 (2) The applicant's experience in dispensing, or conducting research with respect to controlled substances. (3) The applicant's conviction record under Federal or State laws relating to the manufacture, distribution, or dispensing of controlled substances. (4) Compliance with applicable State, Federal or local laws relating to controlled substances. (5) Such other conduct which may threaten the public health and safety. In determining whether a registration would be inconsistent with the public interest, the Deputy Administrator is not required to make findings with respect to each of the factors listed above. Instead, he has the discretion to give each factor the weight he deems appropriate, depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case. See David E. Trawick, D.D.S., Docket No. 88&hyph;69, 53 FR 5326 (1988). In this proceeding factors one, two, three, and five apply. Factor one is applicable based upon the California Board of Pharmacy's suspensions and probation terms imposed on the licenses of Respondent pharmacy and the pharmacist's license of Mr. Kastigar in 1985 and 1988. Factor two applies because Respondent dispensed controlled substances without a physician's authorization or for no legitimate medical reason on a number of occasions between 1983 and 1993. Factor three is applicable based upon the conviction of Mr. Kastigar in the Municipal Court for the South Bay Judicial District, County of Los Angeles, State of California, of one count of unlawfully furnishing controlled substances. Factor five applies because Mr. Kastigar made two material falsifications on the application he submitted for a new DEA Certificate of Registration on June 4, 1993. No evidence of explanation or mitigating circumstances has been offered by Respondent. Therefore, the Deputy Administrator concludes that Respondent's application for a DEA Certificate of Registration must be denied. Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104, hereby orders that the application executed by Village Drug, on June 4, 1993, for a DEA Certificate or Registration as a retail pharmacy, be, and it hereby is, denied. This order is effective June 10, 1994. Dated: June 3, 1994. Stephen H. Greene, Deputy Administrator. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;14161 Filed 6&hyph;9&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4410&hyph;09&hyph;M
