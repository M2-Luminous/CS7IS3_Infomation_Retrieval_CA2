This was confirmed by the Defense Ministry. However, the question arises, how the possible arms sale to Turkey can be reconciled with the new arms law. Two weeks ago, officers from the Turkish Army visited the depot at Zonhoven, where the excess equipment is stacked up in a big shed, waiting for potential buyers. Last Friday 11 March], the Turkish military also paid a visit to Lombardsijde, where another battery is stored. They asked about the price, and requested that Belgians train the Turkish military in operating the antiaircraft guns. So far, it is merely an exchange of information. This was confirmed to DE MORGEN yesterday by the Defense Ministry, which also stated that it is now waiting for the Turks to decide whether they will actually buy the Hawk batteries. However, there seem to be no other potential buyers. The Hawk batteries come from two Belgian battalions in Germany which were shut down. Their arms were dismantled and transported to Belgium. The deal involves a total of four batteries in Zonhoven and one battery in Lombardsijde. Each battery is equipped with three launching mounts and with tracking and detection radars. They include some 300 short- and medium-range missiles. When the Belgian army purchased the equipment in the sixties, it had paid several billions of francs for it. Throughout the years, the equipment was gradually automated. The news about the Turkish interest in Belgian Army equipment was circulating at last weekend's International Kurdish Conference in Brussels. In the corridors, participants said it was an outrage that Belgium is selling equipment to a country which is fighting a civil war with the Kurds -- even though Turkey is a member of NATO. Arms law One might, indeed, wonder whether the arms sale to Turkey can be reconciled with the letter and spirit of the new Belgian arms law. The law -- a consequence of the painful arms crisis which toppled the Martens VIII government in 1991 -- has been in force since April 1993. Article 4 lists the criteria by which an export permit can be refused. Such a refusal is possible if the export "is seriously contrary to Belgium's external interests or to the international goals pursued by Belgium, especially if it would contribute to a manifest violation of human rights." So far, there is no problem, since the Hawk missiles can only be used to shoot down airplanes. The Kurds -- with whom the Turks are fighting a bitter war -- have no airplanes. Things change when one looks at the section in Article 4 which states that arms exports are forbidden if "the country of destination is faced with heavy internal tensions which might lead to an armed conflict (or if the country) is involved in a civil war...." This is definitely the case in Turkey. In 1992, there was already a lot of fuss about the selling of AIFV armored vehicles from Cockerill Mechanics Industries to Turkey. The arms law was not in force then. Later, Kurdish spokesmen claimed that the AIFV's were used as mobile police stations. At present, they are reportedly used to encircle villages, in anticipation of the Air Force's arrival. At the time, the European Community refused to impose an arms embargo on Turkey, in exchange for (idle) Turkish promises that human rights would be respected. So the sale of Belgian arms to other countries continues to create a great deal of turmoil. Last week, several Flemish peace organizations protested against the planned sale of Mirage fighter planes to Chile. They are especially displeased fact that former Chilean dictator Pinochet still controls the South American country's army. Yesterday, AGALEV (Green Party) demanded that the government be accountable to parliament for the Army selling weapons on its own, or for authorizing arms exports in general. The Greens endorsed the peace movement's protest. "Safe transactions are impossible," they argue, "because the arms can be easily misused in internal or regional conflicts." "No one knows the Belgian arms' final destination after the official sale, or their potential side effects," AGALEV said in a statement.
