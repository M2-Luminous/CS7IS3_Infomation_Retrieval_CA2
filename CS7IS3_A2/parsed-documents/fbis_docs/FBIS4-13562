Officially, the purpose of their visit is to attend the ceremony marking the end of the renovation of the al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, but knowledgeable sources say this is yet another attempt to court Israel's Arabs. Our correspondent Yo'el Dar has more details: For many years, all Arab countries ignored their brethren living in Israel, especially the Muslims. Israel's Arabs were barred from visiting the Arab countries, making the pilgrimage to Mecca, and studying at Cairo's al-Azhar University. The Arab League, too, refused to recognize Israel's Arabs and treated them as agents and collaborators of the Zionists and the State of Israel. Recently, however, earnest efforts have been made to court representatives of the Israeli Arab community. The PLO-Tunis embraced its secular circles, particularly HADASH [Democratic Front for Peace and Equality]; Egypt found its way to the heart of heads of local councils and activists in Darawshah's party; while Jordan and Saudi Arabia took clergymen and conservative circles under their wings. A large group of heads of local councils and qadis left for Jordan today. The official purpose of their visit is to attend the celebrations marking the end of the renovation of al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. However, a look at the composition of the delegation shows that its members were not chosen at random and that the fact that it headed by a representative of the Islamic Movement is no mere coincidence.
