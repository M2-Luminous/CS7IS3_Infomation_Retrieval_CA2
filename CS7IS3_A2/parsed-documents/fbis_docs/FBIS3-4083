Gold enterprises have now left the rigid control of the planned economy and the pattern of solely relying on state policy for development, and have entered the great sea of the market economy. China is a big gold-producing and gold-consuming country. Since reform and opening up, our country's gold industry has rapidly developed and our gold production ability has increased five times. In order to expedite the development of the gold industry in our country so as to meet the needs of market economy, reform, and opening up, the state has tremendously reformed the system of production and management of the gold industry. First, reform of the system. The State Administration of Gold Control has been abolished, and the management system combining the government and enterprises has been changed. The China Gold Company, which is now under the leadership of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, has really become an economic entity, and "the company has the right to occupy and utilize according to law the assets granted to it by the ministry for operation and management, as well as the right to reap profits from the assets and take disciplinary actions regarding the assets." Second, reform of policy. Our country has carried out a reform of the pricing system of gold beginning in September 1993, and the purchasing price of gold inside the country has been increased 80 percent in one stroke, so that it matches the gold price in the international community. However, the preferential policy and favorable treatment provided by the state to gold enterprises has been canceled. For example, the development of the gold industry no longer enjoys low-interest bank loans; gold mines no longer enjoy preferential tax waivers or reductions, but must pay value-added taxes, resource taxes, and geological resource compensation fees; the system of retention of foreign exchange by gold enterprises has been abolished, and so on. All of these work to strip gold enterprises of their patron saint, so they can only enter the market and develop and compete according to market laws. At the same time, the state will gradually open up the gold market, and gold will gradually lose its original currency role and enter the market as a commodity. Third, expand opening up. The state has agreed to let the gold industry carry out pilot projects for attracting foreign capital to develop China's gold mines, and the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has granted the China Gold Company the corresponding rights. A person in charge of the China Gold Company told this reporter that the company will first open up some low-grade gold mines which require hard effort in ore dressing, to carry out limited cooperation with foreign businessmen. Foreign businessmen have been responding to the idea very enthusiastically and have come to China to discuss cooperation. On 20 January, Xu Daquan, vice minister of metallurgical industry, said when meeting the gold delegation led by former Canadian Prime Minister Mulroney that China welcomes powerful foreign companies coming to China for cooperation. Cui Lan, chairman of the board of directors of the China Gold Company, said during an interview with this reporter that, when we attract foreign capital to develop gold resources, we are not doing so merely for attracting funds; it is more important that we grasp the opportunity to learn advanced technology and management experience from developed countries through cooperation in development. The company has already reached cooperation agreements with some advanced companies from abroad. Cui Xiwu, general manager of the China Gold Company, said that, along with reforms of the gold price system and industrial system, our country's gold production and management system and operation strategy will change in five directions: From the pattern in which the China Gold Company oversees administration and shoulders unlimited responsibilities while its subordinated enterprises operate in a scattered manner to the pattern whereby the company is a shareholding state company while its subordinated enterprises become the main body for production and operation; from the pattern in which the company operates mainly to discharge government duties and functions to the pattern whereby the company completely becomes an enterprise which runs the business entities well and realizes consortium-like operation; from the pattern in which the company monopolizes business and carries out construction with its own funds, to the pattern whereby it actively utilizes domestic and foreign funds and realizes joint-venture operation with funds from within and without the country; from the pattern in which the company only engages in gold exploration and dressing to the pattern whereby it promotes gold products, develops areas to which gold products can be applied, and diversifies operation so as to transcend various trades; and from the pattern in which the company uses only domestic resources to the pattern whereby it uses both domestic and international resources, and walks toward internationalized operation incorporating both the domestic and international markets.
