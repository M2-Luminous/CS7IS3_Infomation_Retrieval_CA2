He said an Eskom transformer failed and a municipal transformer was subsequently damaged. "The police routinely investigate any explosion, but in this case the problem was an electrical one," he said. He said Eskom had by late Wednesday night begun repairs and that power to the north west town should be restored by Thursday afternoon.
