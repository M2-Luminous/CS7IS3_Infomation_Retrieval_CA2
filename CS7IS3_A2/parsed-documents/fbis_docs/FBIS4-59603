FBIS4-59603 "drnes094dd_94019" FBIS-NES-94-094 Daily Report 14 May 1994 Palestinian Affairs Hamas Rejects Cairo Accord, Vows To Pursue Jihad Hamas Rejects Cairo Accord, Vows To Pursue Jihad JN1405195294 (Clandestine) Al-Quds Palestinian Arab Radio in Arabic 1630 GMT 14 May 94 JN1405195294 (Clandestine) Al-Quds Palestinian Arab Radio Arabic BFN [Text] The Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, has issued a statement renewing its rejection of the Cairo agreement that has thrown away Palestinian rights. The agreement carries the seeds of its failure. What took place in Cairo, the statement emphasized, only confirms and lends legitimacy to occupation. The anniversary of the proclamation of the Zionist entity on our Palestinian territory, which falls tomorrow, Sunday, 15 May, comes less than two weeks after the signing of the ill-boding Cairo accord, and at a time when our protracted conflict with the Zionist enemy is at a crossroads. The scale of the fraud involving demeaning concessions that capitulationists have sought to sell to our people is now clear to our Palestinian Arab people, and to our Arab and Muslim nations. They cannot any longer whitewash the sins and the aggression they have committed against our people, cause, land, and sacred rights. Hamas emphasized that far from being the end of the road for the Palestinian cause, the ill-boding agreement is only the end of a stage. Nor does it spell our people's abandonment of the option of jihad against the enemy, or the foreclosure of their ambitions for which countless martyrs have fallen. The Cairo agreement marks the end of a phase in the Palestinian case and the end of the patriotic and militant role of the Oslo, Madrid, and Cairo faction. Hamas' statement undertook to pursue jihad and the fight for liberation and to consolidate national Palestinian unity. It promised our people to rally their jihad forces together to cope with this decisive phase in our people's history.
