FR940810-0-00089 FR940810-0-00021 OSHA believes that some of these potential problems attributable to negative pressure enclosures may be averted. However, the record also indicates that the use of this control technique shares with other asbestos control methods, a primary reliance upon the skill and training of designers and workers to assure its effectiveness. In addition, under some circumstances even the proper use of negative pressure enclosures can introduce additional hazards into the workplace. One feature of some negative pressure enclosure systems, negative air ventilation, was singled out by some participants as the primary means of reducing exposures to employees working within them. OSHA notes however, that the requirement for NPEs as adopted in the 1986 rule, did not contain any criteria for such ventilation, and that the rationale for requiring NPEs did not rest on the capability of ventilation to reduce employee exposure. Therefore, OSHA regards the recommendation for requiring special ventilation as a new claim, to be supported by evidence and testimony submitted to this record. One of the main characteristics of the negative pressure enclosure system is that the air pressure inside the enclosure is less than outside the enclosure. This pressure difference is created by a fan exhausting air, through a filter, from inside the enclosure to outside the enclosure. Under negative pressure, any leaks in the walls of the enclosure will result in clean air coming into the enclosure, rather than contaminated air leaking to the outside. The system is primarily designed to keep asbestos from contaminating the building. As stated earlier, this approach does not appear to improve working conditions inside the enclosure. Negative air ventilation draws clean air from outside the enclosure at sufficient quantities and at strategic locations, so as to provide clean air in the worker's breathing zone. Support for negative air ventilation was submitted by numerous participants. For example, Mr. D'Angelo testified that ``negative air ventilation is the single most effective engineering control reducing worker exposure as well as reducing the risk to adjacent bystanders or other operations.'' Further, he recommended a minimum of 8 and up to 20 air changes per hour to assure appropriate ventilation is maintained (Tr. 3078, 3087). This process, ``which has expanded on the negative pressure enclosure, (is) called air flush methodology'' (Tr. 3085). Other participants also supported the use of ``air flushing'' techniques, or directed make-up air. Chip D'Angelo, an asbestos abatement consultant described the principle as moving airborne fibers out of the work area with air velocity, thereby ``flushing'' the area by bringing in air from sources outside the enclosure additional to that brought through the decontamination chamber. He further described moving the air away from the worker and toward the negative air filtration machines and directing the moving air to ``dead spots'' in the enclosure by use of baffles and flexiducts (Tr. 3035) (see BCTD, Ex. 143 p. 90, and citations therein). Mr. Cook, an asbestos abatement contractor, appearing for the BCTD, testified that ``it's a fairly easy technology to implement, depending on the situation.''(Tr. 805). Mr. Medaglia, president of an engineering firm suggested adding to the definition of a negative pressure enclosure, the phrase ``*␣*␣* all areas within the enclosure are swept by the flowing air towards the exhaust fans *␣*␣*'' (Tr. 3052). Other support was provided by New Jersey White Lung Association (Tr. 601&hyph;2), NIOSH (Tr. 228 and 257), R. Sawyer (Tr. 2161), D. Kirby (Tr. 170), Global Consumer Services (Tr. 2341) and J. Cook of QSI International (Tr. 804.) However, some engineers who testified did not utilize the technique; Exxon noted in its testimony that ``you can't, quite honestly, get enough volume of air velocity to convince yourself you are going to get good equal mixing within an entire enclosure'' (Tr. 2680); and NIOSH noted in its submitted testimony, that ``we are not aware of any studies evaluating their effectiveness (NPE's) or delineating important parameters such as *␣*␣* minimum air flow'' (Ex. 9). NIOSH recommended that OSHA incorporate into the rule for negative-pressure enclosures, design requirements for air-flow patterns within the enclosure to move airborne particles away from the worker'' (Ibid). Although ``air flushing'' is the ventilation approach most recommended for use within negative pressure systems, actual data showing its success is limited. In recognition of the support from engineers who have utilized these systems, OSHA is requiring a performance based version of ``air flushing'' as a component of the negative pressure enclosure system. OSHA is also requiring ventilation which ``directs the air away from exposed employees'' when other controls are used for Class I work where no there is insufficient data to support a ``negative exposure assessment.'' Participants also argued that the use of negative pressure systems under stated circumstances was unnecessary and would not contribute to employee protection against asbestos exposure. Working outdoors was one such circumstance. Amoco submitted data in which 95% amosite was removed from an outdoor pipe run without negative pressure enclosure in which most samples indicated very low fiber levels (Ex. 7&hyph;39). However, the following work practices were also used: restricted access, immediate and double bagging of debris or use of airtight chutes, barricaded area, use of HEPA equipped vacuums, respirator, decontamination procedures, and training and supervision of the operation by a competent person.
