SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This notice provides instructions to applicants for Federal assistance under JTPA Title IV, Migrant and Seasonal Farmworker Programs for PY 1995, and consists of: Part I_Introduction; and Part II_Solicitation for Grant Application (SGA). Part II constitute invitations from the Department of Labor (DOL) for public agencies, and private nonprofit organizations authorized by their Charters or Articles of Incorporation to provide training and employment and other services described in this notice to submit funding applications for Migrant and Seasonal Farmworker Programs for PY 1995. Part I_Introduction and Background JTPA establishes programs to prepare youth and unskilled adults for entry into the labor force, and to afford job training to those economically disadvantaged individuals and others facing serious barriers to employment who are in special need of such training to obtain productive employment. In accordance with 29 U.S.C. 1501 et seq ., regulations promulgated by DOL to implement JTPA are set forth at parts 626 through 638 and 1005 of Title 20, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). As stated at 20 CFR 633.102, it is the purpose of section 402 of JTPA, 29 U.S.C. 1672, to provide job training, employment opportunities, and other services for those individuals who suffer chronic seasonal unemployment and underemployment in the agriculture industry. These conditions have been substantially aggravated by continual advancements in technology and mechanization resulting in displacement and contribute significantly to the Nation's rural employment problem. These factors substantially affect the entire national economy. Because of the special nature of farmworker employment and training problems, such programs are centrally administered at the national level. Programs and activities supported under this section shall, in accordance with section 402(c)(3) of JTPA: (1) Enable farmworkers and their dependents to obtain or retain employment; (2) Allow participation in other program activities leading to their eventual placement in unsubsidized agricultural or nonagricultural employment; (3) Allow activities leading to stabilization in agricultural employment; and (4) Include related assistance and supportive services. Regulations promulgated by DOL to implement the provisions of Title IV, section 402, of JTPA are set forth in 20 CFR part 633 and part 636. In addition, State and local governments and Native American applicants must conform to Administrative Requirements at 29 CFR part 97. Non-profit organizations must conform to Administrative Regulations at 29 CFR part 95. Migrant and other seasonally employed farmworker programs are also subject to 29 CFR parts 93 (New Restrictions on Lobbying), 96 (Audit Requirements for Grants, Contracts and other agreements), and 98 (Disbarment, Suspension and Drug-free Workplace requirements). Should the regulations at parts 633 and 636 conflict with regulations elsewhere in 20 CFR, the regulations at parts 633 and 636 shall control with respect to programs and activities governed by these Parts. 20 CFR 633.103(b). Further, should any instructions in this notice conflict with JTPA regulations, the JTPA regulations shall control. Applicants should consult and be familiar with 20 CFR part 633 in its entirety. Pursuant to 20 CFR 633.201, DOL will not consider any funding application when fraud or criminal activity has been proven to exist within the applicant organization, or when efforts by the DOL to recover debts established by final agency action have been unsuccessful. Prior to the final selection of an applicant as a potential grantee, DOL will conduct a Responsibility Review of the available records to establish an organization's overall responsibility to administer Federal funds in accordance with 20 CFR 633.204. Any applicant which is not considered or selected as a potential grantee because of these provisions shall be advised of its appeal rights. Comments From the States Executive Order 12372, ``Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs,'' and the implementing regulations at 29 CFR part 17, are applicable to this program. Pursuant to these requirements, in States which have established a consultation process expressly covering this program, applications shall be provided to the State for comment. Since States also may participate as competitors for this program, applications shall be submitted to the State upon the deadline for submission to DOL. 20 CFR 633.202(d). To strengthen the implementation of E.O. 12372, DOL specifies the following timeframe for its treatment of comments from the State's Single Point of Contact (SPOC) on JTPA section 402 applications: 1. As required by 29 CFR 17.8(a)(2), the SPOC must submit comments, if any, to DOL no later than 60 days after the deadline date for applications; 2. DOL will forward those comments to the applicant within 10 days of their receipt from the SPOC; 3. The applicant must submit its response to the SPOC's comments, if any, to DOL no later than 10 days after the date of receipt from DOL; and 4. DOL will notify the SPOC of its decision regarding the comments and response, but will not implement that decision for at least 10 days after the SPOC has been notified.
