[Correspondent Pagiela] The Wanda textile plant in Sosnowiec, the mining electronic equipment plant in Tychy, and the Fablok locomotive factory in Chrzanow are among the enterprises on strike. We have been told that the OPZZ [All-Polish Trade Union Agreement] unions have joined the strike. Despite earlier announcements, muncipal transport is not on strike in Silesia. Marek Kepski, chairman of the Solidarity Silesia-Dabrowa region, said that a strike of public transport would inconvenience the public, and Solidarity wants to avoid this. The decision as to whether a public transport strike should take place in Silesia will probably be made on 15 March. [Announcer] Piotr Pagiela was speaking from Katowice. Public transport in Koszalin was not working between 0400 and 0700 hours because the work force of the MZK [Municipal Transport Enterprise] joined the Solidarity strike. [passage omitted]
