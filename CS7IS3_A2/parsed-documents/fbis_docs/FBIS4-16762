On 16 April, the Party of Russian Unity and Accord's [PRES] Federal Council Presidium held its session which considered the results scored by PRES regional organizations in local elections (out of 122 candidates to local power bodies, 27 representatives of the Shakhray party have been elected). Furthermore, the PRES leadership discussed preparations for a "Russia-wide subbotnik [day of voluntarily donated work] of civil reconciliation" as well as a number of questions related to PRES' future activity. On the same day the People's Party Free Russia's [PPFR] Council met for a session. PPFR honorary chairman Aleksandr Rutskoy and State Duma deputy Vasiliy Lipitskiy took part in its work. The session participants shared their impressions from their organization's activity in the recent period, making a number of decisions aimed at invigorating the performance of party structures, and also discussed changes and amendments in the PPFR's program and rules. The "Rutskoy party" is expected to acquire a "social-democratic" character, but the final decision about the PPFR's ideological makeup will be made at a party congress scheduled for the end of May. It is not ruled out that a number of regional organizations of the "Rutskoy party" will also take part in the congress of a new movement, Accord for Russia [Soglasiye Radi Rossii], which is also to open in May. Meanwhile, PPFR leader Vasiliy Lipitskiy deemed it essential to express his negative attitude to the pending signing of the Memorandum on Civil Peace, noting that real civil accord can be based only on a radical change of course by the ruling elite and the abandonment of "reforms for reforms' sake." Pointing to the high likelihood of a major social explosion in the very near future, Mr. Lipitskiy stated that "in such a situation, public association leaders cannot sign with these authorities an agreement that envisions preservation of the status quo without running the risk of parting with their social base."
