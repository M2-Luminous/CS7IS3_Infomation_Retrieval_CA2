Daurenbekov, deputy chairman of the republic State Committee on Statistics: "Increasingly Fewer Job Vacancies"] [Text] According to the assessment of the Ministry of Labor's employment department and the republic State Committee on Statistics, the situation in the labor market continued to deteriorate over the past few months. Beginning last September the number of vacancies reported to the employment service by enterprises and organizations continued to decline steadily. Over the elapsed year, of 237,000 persons who have applied to the employment centers, jobs were found for only 104,500. The share of nonworking persons among all applicants looking for a job has increased. More than half of those who applied to the service last year are women; almost one half (49 percent) are young people between 16 and 29 years of age. The problem of their employment remains especially acute in Atyrau, Kzyl-Orda, East Kazakhstan, and Semipalatinsk Oblasts and the city of Leninsk. As a result of the continuing decline in demand for labor force, the situation deteriorated even further in January: Of all persons who applied to the employment service, jobs were found for only one in four; in Atyrau Oblast, approximately one in 20; in Kzyl-Orda and North Kazakhstan Oblasts--one in nine to 10; and in Aktyubinsk, Semipalatinsk, and Kustanay Oblasts--one in six to seven. Overall in January 7,300 unemployed were registered, 45 percent of them rural residents. A new trend in the labor market should be noted: While last year the demand for labor systematically exceeded the number of unemployed (especially in the summer months), as of 1 February almost 43,000 persons had the status of unemployed. At the same time the number of job vacancies (those that enterprises and organizations reported to the employment service offices) amounted to 28,000, that is, one and a half times less. Another important point that should be kept in mind is the mismatch between the supply of and demand for labor by territories, population centers, and professional skill level. Of the total number of unemployed, 16,000 (37.4 percent) were receiving unemployment benefits; the rest were covered by other forms of social protection. The situation with respect to hidden unemployment continues to worsen as well. According to the oblast employment centers' data, 1,194 enterprises with a combined labor force of more than half a million people have halted production partially or fully or shifted to a shortened work schedule. More than 154,000 persons are on compulsory leave.
