Finance Minister Rudolf Hommes has said a document is being drafted to eliminate what he described as excessive subsidizing of the agricultural sector. He also announced that the local price of coffee would be revised before August. [Begin Hommes recording] There is excessive protection of the agricultural and livestock sectors. This excessive protection is main reason for this price hike. Something can be done through foreign trade by expediting the import of certain types of food products. [end recording] With this remark, Minister Hommes announced the government's determination to disable the system whereby a minimum price is set for the import of rice, sugar, beans, and other government-subsidized products. For the time being, the import of potatoes, rice, cooking oil, and certain cereals will get the green light. [Begin Hommes recording] For instance, the prices of materials for the cooking oil industry are too high and there is excessive protection in this area. I wonder why the gentlemen [not further identified] are so silent. [end recording] Before flying to London, where he would meet with several businessmen interested in investing in Colombia, Hommes announced he would revise the local price of coffee and said that a decree will be issued next week to prevent the participation of pension and dismissal funds in Banco Popular's privatization process.
