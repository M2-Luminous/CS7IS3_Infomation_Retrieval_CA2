The three containers of phosporous pentasulphide arrived here four weeks ago from the Indian port of Bombay for transshipment to a consignee in Egypt, port officials said. The Defence Ministry ordered the containers to be released this week following investigations regarding the end use of the cargo. The chemical is used to make pesticides and is also an ingredient in the manufacture of nerve gas. The Egyptian embassy in Colombo had informed the authorities that the cargo was intended for the legitimate use of one of its chemical plants, the Dyestuffs and Chemicals of Kafar Dawar.
