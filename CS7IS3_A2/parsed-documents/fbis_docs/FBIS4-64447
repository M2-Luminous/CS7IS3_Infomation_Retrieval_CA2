FBIS4-64447 "drweu086aa_94002" FBIS-WEU-94-086 Daily Report 3 May 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Nordic Battalion: No Additional Troops for Bosnia Nordic Battalion: No Additional Troops for Bosnia LD0305172594 Stockholm Radio Sweden in English 1615 GMT 3 May 94 LD0305172594 Stockholm Radio Sweden English BFN [Excerpts] Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Finland announced today they will not be sending more troops to swell the Nordic UN battalion already in Bosnia. The British UN commander in Bosnia, Lieutenant General Sir Michael Rose, made an appeal for more soldiers at a meeting in Denmark yesterday of Nordic defense ministers. The ministers also say today they would like strong decisive leadership of the UN military operations in Bosnia. Radio Sweden's Toni Rafidi has more: [Rafidi] The Nordic defense ministers said better leadership is needed in UN military operations. However, they supported last Friday's incident when Danish tanks responded to a Bosnian Serb artillery attack near the Nordic battalion headquarters in Tuzla in northern Bosnia. [passage omitted] Commander Rose indicated at a news conference on 2 May that peace would come quicker if the UN had more soldiers, and said he believes the earlier Gorazde disaster could have been avoided if they had had more ground troops. [Begin Rose recording] And by not having enough troops we take enormous risks and sometimes we have disasters, as we saw with Gorazde. Had we had troops in Gorazde, the 800 troops that I'd been promised for Gorazde, then I do not believe that the Bosnian Serb Army would have attacked that safe area. Well, we need about another 10,000 troops in all to sustain the level of activity that we are sustaining at the moment. [end recording] [Rafidi] But today the defense ministers announced the Nordic countries will not be sending more troops. Sweden says that the close to 1,600 soldiers already there makes it one of the biggest per capita contributors of troops in the former Yugoslavia. Sweden's Defense Minister Anders Bjoerck mentioned the United States as one country that should contribute more and, while at a news conference in Washington on Monday after having informal talks with top White House officials, Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt took the opportunity to criticize the U.S. policy of not sending ground troops to Bosnia. He said he thought it was totally natural for the Americans to take part in ground defense, adding that he thought it could become askew [as heard] when a leading nation only helps out while being 2,000 meters in the air.
