His comment follows last night's announcement by the Freedom Alliance that it won't make any more concessions in negotiations with the ANC [African National Congress] and the government. Mr. Meyer told television news that the alliance had communicated to him today to facilitate further discussions, but its inflexibility might make a settlement impossible. [Begin Meyer recording] It's a question of how do you negotiate. Do you negotiate to ensure a settlement at the end which provides a win-win situation, or do you want a win-lose situation? I'm afraid that is not attainable under these circumstances, and in the end I believe what we need to get clarity on from the Freedom Alliance is whether they are, in fact, wanting a solution that could lead to an inclusive settlement.
