The aircraft was met at the airport amid magnificent ceremonies attended by the Air Force commander, the deputy foreign minister, and the charge d'affaires of the embassy of the Islamic Republic of Iran in Moscow, who has lost all members of his family in that heart-wrenching tragedy. The funeral ceremony of these martyrs was staged at noon today in the burial ground of Chizar's martyrs, in the presence of Foreign Minister Velayati, and with the participation of the masses of people. Referring to the cause of the crash, one of the people who has just returned to Tehran from the scene of the crash told our correspondent: In view of the sensitivity of the issue, the mission of the investigation team has been extended to enable them to complete their investigation. He added: Preliminary investigations in the area have shown that the crash was not due to a technical fault, and the aircraft was in fact shot down. He also denied reports issued by a news agency, and said: The downed aircraft was not moving toward the war zone with a particular objective. However, due to the rapid and sudden change in air pressure which led to windows being broken, the pilot was forced to divert the plane to low altitude areas to reduce the pressure.
