FR940920-1-00074 FR940920-1-00008 The proposed guideline limits are summarized below. 1. Municipal Waste Combustor Organics The proposed guidelines would require existing MWC's at large MWC plants to meet a dioxin/furan emission level of 0.50 ng/dscm TEQ or 30 ng/dscm total dioxins/furans, corrected to 7 percent O 2 . Existing MWC's located at small MWC plants would be required to meet a dioxin/furan level of 1.0 ng/dscm TEQ or 60 ng/dscm total dioxins/furans, corrected to 7 percent O 2 . The TEQ emission levels would be calculated using the 1989 North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) international toxic equivalency factors (TEF's), using the methods described in section II.F of this preamble and section 60.58b of subpart Eb of today's proposed NSPS. 2. Municipal Waste Combustor Metals The proposed emission guidelines would require MWC's at large plants to control PM to a level of 27 mg/dscm corrected to 7 percent O 2 . The emission guideline PM level proposed for MWC's at small plants is 69 mg/dscm, corrected to 7 percent O 2 . Municipal waste combustors at both small and large existing MWC plants would be required to meet an opacity level of 10 percent using a 6-minute averaging period. The proposed emission guidelines would also establish specific emission levels for Cd, Pb, and Hg. The proposed guidelines would require existing MWC's at large plants to meet a Cd emission level of 0.040 mg/dscm, a Pb emission level of 0.50 mg/dscm, and an Hg emission level of 0.080 mg/dscm or an 85-percent reduction in Hg emissions. For existing MWC's at small plants, the emission guidelines would be 0.10 mg/dscm for Cd, 1.6 mg/dscm for Pb, and 0.080 mg/dscm or an 85-percent reduction in Hg emissions. 3. Municipal Waste Combustor Acid Gases The proposed emission guidelines for acid gases would require all existing MWC's located at large plants to control SO 2 emissions to a level of either 35 ppmv or 75-percent reduction (at 7 percent O 2 , dry basis) on a 24-hour geometric mean basis and HCl emissions to a level of either 35 ppmv or 95-percent reduction (at 7 percent O 2 , dry basis). All existing MWC's located at small plants would be required to meet an SO 2 emission level of either 80 ppmv or 50-percent reduction (at 7 percent O 2 , dry basis) on a 24-hour geometric mean basis and an HCl emission level of either 250 ppmv or 50-percent reduction (at 7 percent O 2 , dry basis). 4. Good Combustion Practices Today's proposed emission guidelines would require all existing MWC's at plants with capacities above 35 Mg/day to comply with specified operating practices that reflect GCP. These operating practices include CO levels, combustor load levels, and flue gas temperatures and are specified below.
