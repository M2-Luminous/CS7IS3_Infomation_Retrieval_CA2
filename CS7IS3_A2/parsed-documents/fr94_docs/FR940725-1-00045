The State must demonstrate the extent to which the requirements of section 223(a) (12)(A), (13), (14), and (23) of the Act are met. If the State fails to demonstrate full compliance with section 223(a) (12)(A) and (14), and compliance with (13) and (23) by the end of the fiscal year for any fiscal year beginning with 1994, the State's allotment under section 222 will be reduced by 25% for each such failure, provided that the State will lose its eligibility for any allotment unless: the State agrees to expend all remaining funds (except planning and administration, State advisory group set-aside funds and Indian tribe pass-through funds) for the purpose of achieving compliance with the mandate(s) for which the State is in noncompliance; or the Administrator makes a discretionary determination that the State has substantially complied with the mandate(s) for which there is noncompliance and that the State has made an unequivocal commitment to achieving full compliance within a reasonable time. Where a State's allocation is reduced, the amount available for planning and administration and the required pass-through allocation, other than State advisory group set-aside, will be reduced because they are based on the reduced allocation. * * * * * 22. Paragraph (f)(6)(i) in §31.303 is revised to read as follows: §31.303 DSO Substantial Compliance. (f) *␣*␣* (6) *␣*␣* (i) Substantial compliance with section 223(a)(12)(A) can be used to demonstrate eligibility for FY 1993 and prior year formula grant allocations if, within three years of initial plan submission, the State has achieved a 75% reduction in the aggregate number of status offenders and nonoffenders held in secure detention or correctional facilities, or removal of 100% of such juveniles from secure correctional facilities only. In addition, the State must make an unequivocal commitment, through appropriate executive or legislative action, to achieving full compliance by Fiscal Year 1994. Full compliance is achieved when a State has removed 100% of such juveniles from secure detention and correctional facilities or can demonstrate full compliance with de minimis exceptions pursuant to the policy criteria contained in the Federal Register of January 9, 1981 (46 FR 2566&hyph;2569). * * * * * 23.

Failure to achieve full compliance as defined in this section shall terminate any State's eligibility for FY 1993 and prior year formula grant funds unless the Administrator of OJJDP waives termination of the State's eligibility. In order to be eligible for this waiver of termination, a State must request a waiver and demonstrate that it meets the standards set forth in paragraph (f)(6)(iii)(C) ( 1 ) through ( 7 ) of this section: ( 1 ) Agrees to expend all of its Formula Grant award except planning and administration, advisory group set-aside, and Indian tribe pass-through funds, to achieve compliance with section 223(a)(14); and ( 2 ) Removed all status and nonoffender juveniles from adult jails and lockups. Compliance with this standard requires that the last submitted monitoring report demonstrate that no status offender (including those accused of or adjudicated for violating a valid court order) or nonoffender juveniles were securely detained in adult jails or lockups for any length of time; or, that all status offenders and nonoffenders securely detained in adult jails and lockups for any length of time were held in violation of an enforceable State law and did not constitute a pattern or practice within the State; or, the number of status offenders and nonoffenders securely detained in adult jails and lockups is less than 9 per 100,000 juvenile population in the State; and
