One method depends on the restoration of relations of trust with Israel in the defense and security spheres which have been virtually frozen since 1967. During his first visit to Israel, [French Foreign Minister] Alain Juppe yesterday announced France's intention of "resuming a fuller political and military dialogue, especially in the sphere of research cooperation in the security sphere." After the break which followed the Six Day War, and the embargo on arms supplies to the Jewish state, this dialogue is resuming. This is one aspect of the "new impetus, the new course," which Alain Juppe intends to give to Franco-Israeli relations now that the mutual disagreements have vanished, washed away by the current peace process. So, it is official. Defense Minister Francois Leotard will come to Israel next month to open a new chapter in relations which enjoyed their golden age well before the 1967 war, when France was the main ally of the young Jewish state. Already, Tsahal Chief of Staff General Ehud Barak has recently made a visit to France lasting several days, the first at this level for around 30 years. The head of the General Directorate of Armaments (DGA) and Armed Forces Chief of Staff Admiral Lanxade are also expected in Israel soon. Although the resumption of high-level contacts is spectacular, their aim is at present to explore the opportunities for cooperation between the two countries' military industries. Paris' Peace Efforts Joint development projects could emerge. For instance, the Israeli Aeronautical Industries, wishing to move over to civilian activities, are seeking a partner to develop a small satellite launcher. The French minister also announced the signing, in the near future, of a cooperation agreement between the CNES [National Center for Space Studies] and the Israeli Space Agency. A few weeks ago, the Americans granted the Israelis the right to participate in joint projects in the space sphere. But the resumption of "political and military" dialogue with Israel can also be explained by the new regional security situation emerging in the framework of the peace negotiations. France is anxious to have a presence and fears that the United States will try to impose a "preserve" in this strategic sphere extended to the whole of the post-Gulf War Middle East. Participating in the "security guarantees" which should accompany a peace agreement, safeguarding the interests of French military industry in the region is the issue of the current battle. It is reflected in Paris' efforts to play a full part, not only as a member of the European Union, in the multilateral negotiations group on disarmament and security questions. "We see only advantages in becoming more involved in that," Alain Juppe said in Jerusalem. According to a French source, the obstacle no longer comes so much from Jerusalem, but rather from Washington.... Franco-Israeli relations are undergoing a spectacular improvement, and Alain Juppe's visit has taken place in an atmosphere of great cordiality. A greatly appreciated gesture further warmed the atmosphere: the lifting of the visa requirement imposed on the Israelis and the nationals of other countries in the region, since the violent attacks of 1986 in Paris. Today, the French foreign minister is starting the Palestinian part of his visit. He is due to visit the Gaza strip, without Israeli escort, and to have talks with the local PLO officials. "France wants to do all it can to ensure that autonomy succeeds," Alain Juppe said yesterday, while stressing that it was a "difficult challenge." For this purpose, new funds have been announced to help the establishment of the Palestinian administration and to train the cadres of autonomy. An agreement on Fr60 million will be devoted to investment in the territories in the course of this year. Unlike his predecessors at the head of French diplomacy, Alain Juppe has had an easy task in Jerusalem: Since the Oslo agreement, supporting the Palestinians and strengthening ties with Israel are no longer antinomic.
