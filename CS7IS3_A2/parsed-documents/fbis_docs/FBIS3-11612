It becomes effective upon its publication in the official gazette. The sore point is that the opposition has filed, or will do in the next few hours, a petition with the Supreme Court to declare the law unconstitutional. The problem is one of interpretation. [Begin recording] [Deputy Edil Sandoval] The petition of unconstitutionality is presented against resolutions that violate the Constitution or affect the interests of one or more individuals. If the Supreme Court admits the petition, which I do not believe it will, and decides in favor of the petition, such decision will only benefit those who signed the petition. Therefore, in the worst of cases the decision will not invalidate the law. [passage omitted] [Deputy Carlos Borth] The Constitution also grants deputies the right to make this type of petitions in special cases. Let us recall that the capitalization law regulates the transfer of five enterprises to the private sector. We, the MIR [Movement of the Revolutionary Left], will specifically oppose the transfer of YPFB [Bolivian Government Oil Deposit] [passage omitted] [end recording]
