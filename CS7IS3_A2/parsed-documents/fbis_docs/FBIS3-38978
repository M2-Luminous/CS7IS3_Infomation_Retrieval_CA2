On Tuesday morning, member states had: (a) defined their position on agriculture by accepting the Commission proposal on the immediate alignment of prices (with the possibility of transitional national compensation payments); (b) noted certain differences over regional policy (definition of regions of Nordic countries falling under Objective 1); (c) confirmed their position on the problem of transit through Austria. In the afternoon, these total or partial positions were presented to the applicant countries in four separate successive sessions. The applicants confirmed that: (1) they reject the Community position on agriculture; (2) Austria does not accept that the current transit agreement would expire three years after membership and asks that it remain valid until 2004; (3) all four maintain for the most part their demands on regional matters.
