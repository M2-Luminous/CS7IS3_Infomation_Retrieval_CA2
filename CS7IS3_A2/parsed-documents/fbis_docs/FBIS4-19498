The ministers discussed the security aspects of recent developments in Europe, above all in the former Yugoslavia, and a plan for cooperation between the Czech and German armies to consist of 36 joint operations. They also talked about the attitude of Russia to the Partnership for Peace project and to developments in Bosnia. "The situation is complicated by the fact that Russia as a superpower would like to have some sort of special status within the Partnership, and would also like to take a share in common responsibility for the security of Europe," Baudys told CTK. With Russia having expressed dissatisfaction at the most recent events in Bosnia-Herzegovina, for example, a situation had arisen where all sides should put their cards on the table and speak openly, he said. The point of issue had to be the original decision of the UN Security Council, which had given the mandate to NATO troops. Russia playing a larger part in international negotiations on the former Yugoslavia would mean a change in the agreed approach, said the defense minister. He praised the performance of Czech soldiers serving in the former Yugoslavia in UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection Force] units, saying they were some of the best there. Ruehe told CTK he valued the intensive and regular dialogue with representatives of the Czech Army. The next meeting is to take place in Prague in six months' time. Today Baudys left Hamburg for Munster. From there he will continue to Bonn, which he is visiting at the invitation of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, close to the German Christian Democratic Union (CDU). Baudys belongs to the Czech Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL).
