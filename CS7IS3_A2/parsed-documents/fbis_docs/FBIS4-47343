Gorbonos, Kirov Belarusan Technical Institute; UDC 621.039.76:504.055] [Abstract] Hot flue gases are filtered by a stainless steel grid with a wire diameter of 0.003-0.004 mm. The housing of the unit contains multiple units consisting of several stages each. The height of the housing and the number of units are determined by the type of fuel and the rate of gas flow. Each unit contains a latticed disk attached to the face of the first stage. The diameter of each stage is determined by the diameter of the previous one. The effectiveness was tested. The number of solid particles is determined, as is the dependence of the degree of scrubbing on the number of filters for a particle size of 1.0 �m. Scrubbing decreased with the number of filters. By regulating the number of filters one can obtain the optimal ratio of the gas dynamic resistance of the scrubber and the degree of scrubbing. The device is most effective on particles 1.0 �m in size and greater. A 70% rate of scrubbing can be obtained. The device can be removed and cleaned for repeated use.
