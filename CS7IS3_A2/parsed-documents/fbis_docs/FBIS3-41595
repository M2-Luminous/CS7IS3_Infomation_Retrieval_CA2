The final session went three hours over the time set for it to provide opportunity for further discussions, especially with regard to a number of disputed issues, such as contamination resulting from nuclear wastes and the prominence the U.S. delegation gave to the issue of pollution in the Gulf of Aqaba. During the final session, the conferees followed up on issues relating to preserving the environment, particularly marine pollution and other sources of pollution, such as chemical wastes, as well as exploiting the potential of each state in the region. During the discussions, they agreed on some standards and measures to organize international and regional efforts to preserve the environment, which is the project Japan presented to the conference. They also agreed to carry out further studies to help combat pollution, prevent environmental catastrophes, and resolve the issue of oil spillage into the Gulf of Aqaba, which is bordered by four countries: Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, and Israel. This is a project that the [words indistinct] refused to address now. The statement issued by the conference, the meetings of which continued for four days with the participation of more than 44 countries and numerous international bodies concerned about environmental issues, noted that the United States and Russia, the cosponsors of the multilateral talks, [words indistinct] the EC, and Japan, showed their willingness to fund projects they want to carry out in the region.

They demanded that this subject be referred to the Arms Limitation Committee. This upset Egypt and the Arab delegations. Saudi Arabia, the Gulf countries, and the Palestinians supported Egypt's stand in this regard and decided to refer the whole issue to the Steering Committee [words indistinct] the five committees of the conference. On the other hand, conference circles denied reports about reaching an agreement on setting up an [word indistinct] center in Jordan, from which Israel could benefit.
