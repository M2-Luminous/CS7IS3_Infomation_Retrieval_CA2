The report states that the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, together with the Russian Ministry of Defence and other ministries, is to begin negotiations on this issue and to draft the appropriate agreements. The obviously contradicts the agreements initialed by the government delegations of both states, and raised doubts about the true intentions of the Russian Government delegation in the process of drafting the agreements. This statement caused justified concern for the planned meeting between the presidents of Latvian and Russia and the development of potential political dialogue. It does not assure domestic and foreign political stability, and diminishes trust in Russia as a partner state in agreements. The building of Russian military bases on Latvian territory would be a real threat to Latvian sovereignty and security and would destabilize not only the Baltic region, but also Western Europe. Over the last few hours, I have repeatedly attempted to contact the commander-in-chief of the Russian North-West Military Group General Mayorov and President Yeltsin's administration in order to obtain an explanation. As yet, I have not received an answer, which points to deliberate evasion from providing an explanation. Latvia will never allow the building of a Russian military base on its territory. [Signed] Guntis Ulmanis, president of the Republic of Latvia.
