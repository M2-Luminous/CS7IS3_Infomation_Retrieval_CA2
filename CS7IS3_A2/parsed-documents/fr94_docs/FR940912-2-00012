ACTION: Notice of first meeting of conference. SUMMARY: The Working Group on Intellectual Property Rights of the White House Infrastructure Task Force (IITF) issued a preliminary draft of its report, ``Intellectual Property and the National Information Infrastructure,'' on July 7, 1994. Copies of the report may be obtained by calling the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office at (703) 305&hyph;9300 or by sending a written request to the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Box 4, Washington, D.C. 20231, marked to the attention of Terri A. Southwick, Office of Legislative and International Affairs. The preliminary draft, on page 134, stated that the Working Group would sponsor a conference to bring together copyright owner and user interests to develop guidelines for fair uses of copyrighted works by and in public libraries and schools. The draft further stated that anyone who wished to participate in the conference should request to do so by sending a request to Terri A. Southwick. The participants have been chosen and notified. Every effort was made to ensure that a wide diversity of opinion will be represented at the conference. Roughly equal numbers of participants were chosen from owners of copyrights, educators and librarians. Those who requested to participate but could not be accommodated due to the large number of requests are invited to attend this and all subsequent meetings. There will be an opportunity for those not chosen to participate to make or submit comments and questions. All meetings will be open to the public. DATES: The first session of the conference will be held in Washington, D.C. on September 21, 1994. It will begin at 12:30 and last until 5:00. ADDRESSES: The conference will be held at the Department of Commerce Auditorium, Department of Commerce, 14th Street & Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Working Group on Intellectual Property Rights, chaired by Assistant Secretary of Commerce and Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks Bruce A. Lehman, was established as part of the White house Information Infrastructure Task Force. The Task Force, chaired by Secretary of Commerce Ronald H. Brown, was created to work with Congress and the private sector to develop comprehensive telecommunications and information policies aimed at articulating and implementing the Administration's vision for the National Information Infrastructure (NII). ``Intellectual Property and the National Information Infrastructure; A Preliminary Draft of the Report of the Working Group on Intellectual Property Rights'' represents the Working Group's examination and analysis to date of the intellectual property implications of the NII, and includes the Group's draft findings and recommendations. The Working Group's concerns about the role of fair use in the NII environment were expressed in the preliminary draft. Guidelines for library and educational use of printed matter and music that were voluntarily adopted by diverse parties and set out in the house and Conference reports accompanying the 1976 Copyright Act appear not to apply to the NII environment and thus to require modification or elaboration to deal with digital works and on-line services. The initial meeting on September 21, 1994, will establish the structure through which such modifications or elaborations may be achieved. The Working Group solicited written comments from the public on the preliminary report in a notice published at 59 FR 35912 on July 14, 1994 and gave notice of hearings on the preliminary report in a notice published at 59 FR 42819 on August 19, 1994. The hearings are being held in Chicago, on September 14, 1994 in Los Angeles on September 16, 1994 and in Washington on September 22 and 23, 1994. The written comments received, the testimony given at the hearings, and any guidelines or recommendations agreed to by the participants of the ``Fair Use'' conference will be considered by the Working Group in the Final Report. Dated: September 7, 1994. Michael K. Kirk, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce and Deputy Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks.
