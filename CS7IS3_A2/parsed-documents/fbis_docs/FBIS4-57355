The first satellite from Cordoba was developed within the sphere of the province's Science and Technology Secretariat with the participation of a group of researchers that had worked on the now-deactivated Condor-II project. The research activities were supported by the National Atomic Energy Commission in the province through the state enterprise CORATEC [expansion not given], which was created in 1992. The project will have a final cost of some $1.2 billion, and it is thought that most of it has been built in Cordoba, although it does have some imported parts. The satellite, which is the size of a shoe box, will be used for agricultural, geological, and environmental purposes.
