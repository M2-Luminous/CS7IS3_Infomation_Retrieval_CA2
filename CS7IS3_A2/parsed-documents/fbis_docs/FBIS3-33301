The source said members of the Simon Bolivar National Guerrilla Coordinating Board (CGSB) detonated an explosive device at the American School parish in Cali, the third largest city in the country, resulting in no casualties but extensive property damage. The attack, the second so far this week, destroyed windows in the school in the capital of Valle del Cauca Department, some 400 km southeast of Santa Fe de Bogota, an official report stated. Last Tuesday the rebels detonated an explosive device at a Mormon temple in Cali, causing extensive property damage. The action is part of a campaign of attacks initiated by the rebels last January to protest the arrival of 150 U.S. Army soldiers from the U.S. Corps of Engineers, who are carrying out social projects in southwestern Colombia. The CGSB issued a communique a few days ago saying all entities sponsored by the United States or by U.S. capital are considered military targets. Since that time, two seminarians from that country have been kidnapped and three Mormon temples and educational and financial centers in the largest cities have been attacked. In the next few weeks, the Colombian Congress will investigate President Cesar Gaviria to determine if he did in fact violate the Constitution by authorizing the foreign mission to work in the country without permission from the Legislative Branch. The police spokesman said security measures will be tightened at institutions or centers that are possible targets for attacks. Moreover, rebel commando units torched four buses in Medellin, some 540 km northwest of this capital, which has frightened bus owners, many of whom have refused to provide service.
