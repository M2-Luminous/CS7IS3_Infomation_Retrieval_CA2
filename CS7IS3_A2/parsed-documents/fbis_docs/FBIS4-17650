Replying to journalists' questions, he said in particular that the development of relations with countries of the Asia-Pacific region fully corresponds to Ukraine's foreign policy concept. The realities of life in our state, he said, nudge us toward searching for new partners, who have already accumulated a great deal of experience in various fields. In the opinion of Anatoliy Zlenko, on the one hand this experience would be extremely useful in the implementation of reforms in Ukraine, and on the other hand it would be useful in the practical resolution of economic problems. We would like to see advantageous partners in the countries of the Asian region, who are currently also looking for a way in to new markets, the minister noted. On the way to Kiev Anatoliy Zlenko stopped in Ashgabat, where he met the leaders of Turkmenistan's cabinet of ministers. The discussions centered on the development of bilateral relations, particularly in the economic field.
