Serb soldiers and a tank confronted 30 French troops guarding weapons at Krivoglavci, northwest of Sarajevo, and demanded the weapons, said Eric Chaperon, a spokesman for the UN Protection Force. The weapons were placed under UN control following a February 9 accord between Bosnian Serbs and Moslems on a ceasefire and withdrawal of heavy weapons within a radius of 20 kilometres (12 miles) from the capital Sarajevo. The spokesman could not describe the nature of Serb threats but said the situation was tense. A high-ranking UNPROFOR official telephoned the Bosnian Serb stronghold of Pale after the encirclement at 2:OO p.m. (1200 GMT), and the Serb tank withdrew. Serb troops continued to surround the weapons site, the spokesman said. Serb troops tried to seize heavy weapons from the Krivoglavci site on Tuesday but withdrew after receiving orders from their command post of Lukavica, contacted by UNPROFOR. Following Sunday and Monday's NATO air strikes on Serb positions around the eastern Bosnia Moslem enclave of Gorazde, Serb troops have also placed mines around three weapons collection sites, blocking UN personnel guarding the sites, an UNPROFOR spokesman said Wednesday.
