The result of the referendum is "important for the country and good for Europe." Klestil strongly appealed to all parties to "accept the decision of the voters in a democratic spirit, to close ranks, and to tackle together the major challenges the country now faces." It is one of the most important rules of democracy not to the day after the election tense with the confrontations of before. In their news conference, neither Federal Chancellor Franz Vranitzky nor Vice Chancellor Erhard Busek displayed "any inclination for experimentation." Both stated that cooperation at the level of government with those parties that have taken a negative position toward EU [Eureopean Union] entry was "not possible" in the coming legislative term, either. Vranitzky said that the election campaign would be used to create "fundamental trust in our party among the people." "In the interest of Euorpean integration," the government parties showed "self-evident solidarity." Vice Chancellor Erhard Busek said that the Austrian People's Party [OeVP] would "continue the path on which it had embarked." [passage omitted] "The Austrians opted for the future and for optimism." This is how Foreign Minister Alois Mock commented on the result of the referendum. "Once more, the Austrians showed that they are better than they themselves think of themselves. The Austrians definitely wanted to have a say when it comes to building a new Europe, and not remain outside." Heide Schmidt, chairwoman of the Liberal Forum, spoke of a decision for openness. As an opposition party, it was not easy for the Liberal Forum to support the government line. The "Yes to the EU" was, nevertheless, the right decision, because this was proof of a responsible opposition policy. On behalf of the Greens, Peter Pilz announced that "as of tomorrow, the Austrian Greens" would "keep an eye on Brussels and Strasbourg," -- because now Austria would need somebody to carefully watch that the transit treaty will still exist in six years. [passage omitted] In a reaction late last night, [Freedom Party of Austria Chairman Joerg] Haider said "I am neither the winner nor the loser," and announced that the government would "not be happy for too long about its undoubtedly high level of support." The mists would rise, and then those "conditions" of which he warned would come into play. In view of the enormous propaganda, the 66-percent support was "actually a poor result," Haider said in his analysis of the result, in which he described entry opponents as "patriots" and supporters as "European-minded Austrians" who "obviously" do not "attach great importance" to democratic structures.
