Checked against standards specified by the bureau for imported chemical fertilizer, these shipments posed the following quality control problems: The first problem was the large proportion of shipments not meeting standards. In 1993, of a total of 32 batches of chemical fertilizer weighing a total of 726,100 tons, five batches weighing a total of 165,369 tons, worth $29,536,800, were found not to meet standards. On the basis of weight, 22.77 percent of the imported chemical fertilizer was substandard. Second was a serious problem with shipment batches. For example, the fertilizer imported through Dalian from the United States was chiefly ammonium phosphate in 125 batches weighing a total of 611,020 tons. After inspection by the Liaoning Provincial Bureau of Commercial Inspection, three batches, weighing a total of 110,518 tons, which comprised 18.9 percent of the total weight, were found to be substandard. The nitrogen content of one batch was only 17.76 percent (contract requirement was 18 percent). In another two batches, the moisture content exceeded that of contract specifications. At the same time, two batches of a triple calcium phosphate mix, imported from the United Kingdom and weighing a total of 54,851 tons, worth a total of $10,411,700, were also found to be substandard after checking by the Bureau of Commercial Inspection. In one batch, the amount of free acids was found to exceed specifications, and in another batch, the granular size also did not meet requirements -- a 100 percent noncompliance. On the shipments described above that did not meet contract specifications, the Liaoning Bureau of Commercial Inspection issued certificates of noncompliance, so that the parties concerned may seek compensation from their foreign suppliers. With respect to the problem of quality in chemical fertilizers imported through the port of Dalian last year, related offices in the Liaoning Provincial Bureau of Commercial Inspection has the following suggestions: 1. All agencies dealing with poor quality fertilizers imported from abroad must seek compensation from their foreign suppliers on the basis of the signed certificate issued by the Bureau of Commercial Inspection attesting to the problem, so they can recover their economic losses and protect the state's well-being. 2. In the future, in accordance with state regulations and international custom, all units engaged in importing chemical fertilizers must state in detail in the formal contract they sign with their foreign suppliers, the type of chemical fertilizer ordered, its requirements for product composition, quality, weight, and packaging, a statement for payment for damages, a penalty clause, and a disagreement clause. Otherwise, if the contract is unclear and not comprehensive, once the fertilizer imported is found not to meet specifications, there is no way to seek compensation from the foreign supplier. This may even cause the state undeserved economic loss. 3. All units engaged in importing chemical fertilizers must check for substandard products according to contract specifications, so that timely action can be taken--what batches to reject, what batches to negotiate for a lower price, what batches need to be replaced, and what batches call for compensation. 4. User households everywhere that purchase imported fertilizer should check for the certificate or stamp of approval given by the Bureau of Commercial Inspection on the product. It is quite possible that all products without the stamp or certificate of approval may be imitations. Users must be on the alert for being deceived. 5. After the imported chemical fertilizer has been received, all receiving units must petition the Bureau of Commercial Inspection for certification that the product meets specifications before it can be sold for subsequent use. If the inspection is not made in time, and a quality problem is later found, it may be impossible to recover damages because the time limit has expired. What is worse may be the great economic loss suffered by the user.
