In view of administrative and other technical works to be required, agreement around late June, as widely sought, is too late, said the Ministry of International Trade and Industry ministry official, who requested anonymity. A forum set up by the seven-party coalition is working on tax reforms, including multiyear tax cuts designed to spur domestic demand, to show Japan's commitment to the plan at the Naples summit of the seven industrialized countries in early July. The official said he has no knowledge on whether Ichiro Ozawa, a coalition key figure, will fly to Washington shortly in search of a breakthrough in the trade framework talks. Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito, is said to have a considerable clout in the government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and is believed to have played a major role in last week's settlement of the cellular phone trade dispute between Tokyo and Washington. It is not desirable for men such as Ozawa, who is not the leader of Japan, to play a part in getting the stalled talks moving again, the MITI official said.
