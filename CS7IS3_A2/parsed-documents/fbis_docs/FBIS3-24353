The most diverse theories are being advanced. Some people are even assuming that there is some kind of secret conspiracy with the president, who would prefer that the investigation not dot all the i's. Others, conversely, see a behind-the-scenes agreement with the Duma leaders. It is no accident, they say, that one of Shakhray's men, Andrey Voykov, was placed at the head of its administration. What are your ideas? [Gaydar] Of course there is always the temptation to see the authorities as crafty, perfidious, and far-sighted, but most frequently this is not the way things really are. I do not believe in complicated political schemes in general and I certainly do not expect them from the present executive authority. Politics, as a rule, is arranged more simply and rigidly. Refined schemes involving multiple moves are usually undermined by the rough current of life right in the first stages. Therefore I absolutely do not believe in schemes involving intricate intrigues on the part of the president. Shakhray's position was a bit of a surprise to me too; to be honest, I did not anticipate such a turn. All I can say is that I completely reject the story that there was a misunderstanding--"ah, we were not aware, ah, we did not know." These people are intelligent enough to know and to be aware. What is wrong? The hypothesis I came up with is this: The terrible temptation of centrism gained a hold. Centrism as a means of access to power. In politics, in my view, there exist two completely different strategies. The first: You have your own convictions and ideas about what the country needs. You defend them, you fight for them. If you cannot defend them while in power, you work with the opposition. That can take years, perhaps decades. This political strategy proceeds from the idea to the world view. The second strategy: Politics as the art of staying in power. It presupposes the ability to react very flexibly to the changing political waves, to skip from one to another, to significantly change your outlook and points of reference. Here it is absolutely necessary to prove that you are the greatest centrist, that you are prepared to cooperate with everyone. And if you have come from one particular side, in order to prove that you are a centrist, naturally, you have to make friends with representatives of the opposing side. You have to hold out your hand to them, demonstrate your loyalty. Speaking in extremely simple terms, I think it is here that we find the basis of the political drift of Sergey Shakhray and many other former democrats. [Borin] But someone will say to you: "I have not betrayed anybody, I simply changed my basic principles, my attitude toward the matter." [Gaydar] Oh, it is difficult to pretend here. It is immediately apparent for whom the cause is the most important thing and for whom it is terrible painful to lose all the trappings of power. Because power is terribly attractive. It makes a person unusually vulnerable. The prospect of suddenly becoming simply an ordinary private individual again is terribly frightening. I have seen this in people who, it seemed to me, were absolutely not susceptible to it. [Borin] When you retired, did you experience something like this? [Gaydar] No, I did not experience anything of the kind, not at all. Although I understand that feeling quite well. That is, I can see the tiny fragments from which such a feeling is formed. People's attitude toward you changes. Endless problems arise. You see boorishness. And many, many things like that. Previously a person was great and everyone loved him, everyone told him how intelligent he was, how valuable his opinion was, how everyone wanted to make friends with him... And suddenly it turns out that none of that was true, that now he is some kind of weird half-wit. And in general what has he done? Moved from one mistake to another? And why is he still in this position? You must also figure out... [Borin] People are rude to him, they remind him of the laboratory chiefs who, they say, shook the entire country. [Gaydar] I regret very much that Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin did not share his ideas about the laboratory chiefs and prime ministers while he was working under me. As I recall, he was very polite, unusually polite, I would say, to the point of being sickening. Perhaps he simply did not know that one of the principles adopted in cultured society is that the level of politeness does not depend on whether a person is your superior or not... So many of those who are in power today understand what awaits them when they leave power. And some people are terribly frightened by this. And then they are prepared to chain themselves to their little chairs, thinking up all kinds of reasons why they cannot leave. Policy has changed, everything has changed, but they still have to be there. [Borin] Are you talking about the upper echelons of power? [Gaydar] Not necessarily at all. It is by no means only the pompous forms of power that are attractive. The very connection to power is already an immense temptation. Many of the most diverse people ask to be included on one commission or another. The very admission to the corridors of power, the possibility of coming and participating in the process of decisionmaking, which might very well turn out to be quite different from what you would like--this is still a temptation. You were there, perhaps you even said something that did not exactly fit in with what the boss was saying, and the boss nodded, gave it some thought, and did it his own way--but still there is the temptation. You are fully aware that you are playing the role of a democratic shield for the nomenklatura, but you are incapable of refusing. I know excellent people who have not been able to refrain from this. And if the boss wants to surround himself with such a clique of former democrats, he will have absolutely no difficulty finding the people he needs. Perhaps not the top ones, not the most courageous, not the most intelligent, but simply with some democratic past. [Borin] While the democrats are squabbling amongst themselves and betraying one another, the real power remains in the hands of the apparatchiks, the bureaucrats. [Gaydar] Of course! There are such incredible masters here! I will give you one example. In September I accepted an invitation to work in the government again. Literally a couple of days later--current questions were being discussed at a meeting--suddenly, quite unexpectedly, out of the blue, a note from Finance Minister Fedorov concerning reorganization of the government was brought up. The note was old, from July or August, before I was working there. The essence of the note was that the Ministry of Economics had to be abolished and all these functions, for which I was responsible, would be concentrated in the Ministry of Finance. After that it was assumed that I would immediately jump down Fedorov's throat and start a terrible fight with him and he would then beat me off and run to complain to the higher authorities. I got together with Boris and we had a few laughs. But situations like this are coming up constantly, they are created brilliantly. And what sweet temptations the apparatus throws out to you! Let us do all of this. And why do you not do this little bit, which would be very good for the family. How nice and splendid it will be, and everyone will be so satisfied! To be honest, my colleagues laughed at me when I made them write down in the gift book the presentation of some kind of badge, etc. But it is my deep conviction that such purism is actually useful. It simply teaches the apparatus that such little things do not go so cheaply. [Borin] Have there been attempts to approach you like that? [Gaydar] Yes, of course there have. It is inevitable. [Borin] So, are these kinds of intrigues inevitable? Are there no methods of fighting against them? [Gaydar] Well, what can I say. This is a subject that is very difficult to discuss, to describe. If you start to bring an intriguer out into the open, to prove how he is twisting things and lying--then the intrigue has already achieved its purpose. You are damned if you do and damned if you don't... These, unfortunately, are methods it is very difficult to combat in direct and open polemic. [Borin] You know, in our circle we always used to be afraid of what they called losing face. We were sentimental in the good sense of the word, if you will. The well-known words "Let us hold hands, friends, so we do not fall alone" expressed our main feelings, our aspirations. But now, it seems to me, the author himself would no longer write them, sensing that they, alas, are as if from another time. [Gaydar] Yes, we have lost our sentimentality. I think this is very bad. How did it happen? A very complicated question. I would say this. There used to be a fairly simple arrangement: us and them. They were the authorities. They were cruel and evil. We were not the authorities. We could be destroyed and oppressed by them, we were dependent on them. But we were intelligent, honest, and good. We had our morality, we had our norms of behavior. We could hold each other's hands. This is not out of 1937. It is the way things were at the end of the fifties and beginning of the sixties. This is not the way it was with mass terror, this is the way it was with a gentle authoritarian regime which, by and large, did not bother anyone who did not deliberately pick a fight with it. It allowed people to speak their minds in their own homes, it allowed them to be themselves, to be intelligent and worthy, as long as they did not sneak up to it with leaflets and dynamite. It seems to me that this is the basis of the intelligentsia culture from which Okudzhava and many other excellent writers sprang. Incidentally, in a certain sense these are the revived traditions of the Russian intelligentsia, Russian society. That is the way it was in the 19th century as well. Then too there was a gentle authoritarian regime, there were also "us" and "them," and we also had our own morality. In general it seems to me that gentle authoritarianism which precludes direct contact with the authorities is a fairly healthy environment for this kind of intelligentsia culture and morality. [Borin] And now? Is this the result of rubbing elbows with the authorities? [Gaydar] Things are much more complicated now. It is no longer "us" and "them." Now the authorities are divided and society is divided. There are many very different kinds of "us" and many very different kinds of "them." I would never have thought that people whom I knew well would suddenly end up in the enemy camp, as our political opponents. Evil opponents. But that is the way it has turned out. I went to the president and vouched for some of my friends. He said to me: "This one did this and that." I answered: "I do not believe it, that cannot be." [Borin] And how did it turn out? [Gaydar] In various ways. Sometimes it was discovered that it was slander, an attempt to discredit somebody. But sometimes--yes, alas, it was true. [Borin] In the press today there are a lot of arguments about the position of the former procurator general Aleksey Kazannik. They say that since he thought that political amnesty was disgraceful he could refuse to implement this decree and then retire. One thing is clear: A noble person ended up as a plaything in the hands of the others in the procuracy. I am not saying anything about the helplessness and inconsistency of the presidential administration. [Gaydar] I am not Aleksey Ivanovich's judge. By and large I agree with him. The fight against the extremely dangerous Duma decree could have and should have been waged long before it was adopted. Well, what about Aleksey Ivanovich? In a certain sense he is that kind of person. In my view, he is a man of high moral qualities. To be honest, I expected nothing less of him. [Borin] The period when you were in the government today is called the "romantic," "heroic" period of our reforms. How is this to be understood? When conducting the reforms, did you try to stay within the confines of some moral rules? Not to lie, not to promise what you could not deliver? [Gaydar] I think you are right. Moreover, lying is an economic category of the highest degree. Ruslan Imranovich tried to prove to me that panic was not an economic category. He was wrong, panic is absolutely an economic category. It exerts an immense influence on the development of the entire complex of financial processes. Stock exchange panic, foreign currency panic, etc. So lying is also a completely economic category. Something is always being demanded of the state, of the politician. First: Either do not promise anything, or promise something and try to do it. This, of course, is very dangerous if certain dangerous and difficult things are promised. The other extremely widespread policy is when you promise things but you do not do them. In economics this is called discrepancy between the budget based on commitments that have been made and the budget based on financial flows. That is, you have promised everything to everyone. And then: "Well, you see, there is none. I will give you none, and you none, and I will not give you any either." This is the underlying foundation for the extremely severe financial crisis we are experiencing right now. It is related to the attempt to implement precisely that policy since the spring of 1993. Then, in the autumn, we tried to fight, to do something. But not to the end. We did not manage to, we were unable to. Such a policy is very risky. Because it discredits the state. Extreme financial problems are created for all who believed in the state. Millions of people suffer, ties are disturbed among enterprises, suppliers of raw material, suppliers of semimanufactured products, and suppliers of electric energy. The immense economic chain is broken. And it is all because it was convenient for me to say: "I will do this, I will give it to you." And then go into another room and say: "Of course, I will not give them a thing." That is a very vulnerable economic policy. And if it is an economic policy of realism, I assure you it has never led anyone to anything good and it never will. [Borin] For decades we have lived under the power of favorites whose principle has been: After us, the flood. Does this mean that they are raising their heads again. [Gaydar] Well, generally speaking, of course.
