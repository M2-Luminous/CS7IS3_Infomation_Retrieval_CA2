Lu Yu-chun, director-general of the National Police Administration, said that from 1990 through 1993, police here seized a total of 1,092 kilograms of heroin and 3,566 kilograms of amphetamines worth a combined street value of billions of US dollars. "Without the police crackdown, those drugs would have been circulated either in Taiwan or re-exported to other countries," he said. The US State Department submitted the 1993 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report to Congress earlier in the month, accusing Taiwan of allowing the production of illicit amphetamines and of increasingly playing a role in the laundering of drug money. According to the report, Taiwan has become an important Southeast Asian transit center for heroin. It said movement of the drugs is difficult to detect because of Taiwan's heavy merchant marine traffic. Wang Chun, director of the Bureau of Criminal Investigation, admitted that more efforts need to be taken in the fight against drug smuggling and more money budgeted for the purpose. Only NT$2.8 million [new Taiwan dollars] (US$106,060) is used by Taiwan police to combat drug trafficking each year, as compared with US$12 billion appropriated by the United States. He also said Taiwan needs to change the law that treats drug addicts as criminals rather than as patients so that they can get help to kick their habits. Local police seized an average of three or four kilograms of drugs each year before 1989. But the figure rose to 154 kilograms in 1991 and a stunning 810 kilograms in 1993. Police in the central Taiwan County of Chiayi in a raid on May 11 [date as received] seized 336 kilograms of high-grade heroin, prompting Premier Lien Chan to announce a nationwide campaign against drug smuggling.
