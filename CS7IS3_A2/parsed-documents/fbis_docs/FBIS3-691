Apart from the thousands of people running and toyi-toying [protest dancing] down the Lucas Mangope Highway, people in cars, minibuses and others piled on trucks were blaring horns and displaying the clenched fist black power salute. Police presence was at an absolute minimum with only three police cars seen hurrying towards [words indistinct] Bophuthatswana's reincorporation into South Africa. Two Bop police Hippos outside the university in Mmabatho were all that remained of evidence of the intense confrontation between students and police in the past three days. The only policemen at the scene was standing on the armoured police personnel carrier and using the vehicle's public address system to repeat over and over: "We want peace". Thousands of people headng towards an African National Congress [words indisticnt] were shouting: "We have done it. We have brought the government to its knees."
