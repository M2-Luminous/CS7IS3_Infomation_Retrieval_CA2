As we all know, the station was built by Belarus in 1979, during the construction of the Ignalina nuclear power plant. Moscow then subordinated the station to the Lithuanian Railroads. After the collapse of the USSR, Lithuania obtained possession of the station. The latter, however, is located on Belarusian territory and belongs to us, Belarus. Commission Chairman Ivan Tsyareshka spoke at the session. [Begin Tsyareshka recording] The negotiations have been unjustifiable dragging on for too long. It is difficult to resolve certain issues with Lithuania -- not just the border issue, but also that of Belarusian property located on Lithuanian territory. Meanwhile, we are successfully resolving similar problems with our other neighbors, including Latvia, Ukraine, and other republics. [passage omitted] Tension is growing on a daily basis. We have found ourselves in an absurd situation: Belarusian freight trains are moving along Belarusian rails, but the Lithuanian side collects all the payments just because those trains pass through a small station named Hadutsishki. Sound thinking has always been part of the Belarusian mentality, but we must uphold our interests. [end recording] Deputy Foreign Minister Stanislaw Ahurtsow, head of the delegation, pointed out that the Lithuanian side is purposefully raising a hue and cry over Hadutsishki. [Begin Ahurtsow recording] [passage omitted] It will be very difficult to resolve this issue at the level of delegations. We must engage both the legislature and the government. Here I have the diplomatic note that was sent to the Lithuanian side on 10 June. Let me read it: The Belarusian Foreign Ministry has learned from competent sources that at the [words indistinct] maintenance section, the Lithuanian side is dismantling railroad tracks and embankments and shipping them out of Belarusian territory. The ministry voices its protest against such actions by the Lithuanian side and views them as an encroachment on the property of the Republic of Belarus. The ministry believes that these actions will be immediately discontinued and the railroad tracks restored. The Belarusian side reserves the right to take appropriate measures to protect its property. [end recording] The commission produced a draft resolution to be submitted for approval by the Supreme Soviet Presidium. The resolution envisions that by 1 September 1994 all the tracks on Belarusian territory, currently used by the Lithuanian side, be transferred under the jurisdiction of the Belarusian Railroads. It was decided to suggest that the Council of Ministers consider the possibility of building a parallel track at this section of the Belarusian Railroads.
