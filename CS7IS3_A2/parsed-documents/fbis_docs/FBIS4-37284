He is rather thinking that a legal authority would be found to take a decision on the future presidency of Afghanistan. The term of office of Borhaboddin Rabbani, as the president, and Golboddin Hekmatyar, as the prime minister, should end in less than 10 days' time, on the basis of decisions made by the Islamabad and Jalalabad meetings. At the same time a member of the mediation team from the southwestern sector of Afghanistan, Dr. Shams, whose objective is to resolve the country's crisis through peaceful means, said today that this team has carried out the second round of its mediatory talks with Rabbani and Hekmatyar on Saturday and Sunday, and it has been agreed the two sides' representatives should begin direct talks from Monday. He expressed the hope that during the first round of talks between the representatives of Afghanistan's president and prime minister, the time of cease-fire and the time of opening the routes leading to Kabul would be determined and declared. Dr. Shams said: Almost all the leaders of Afghanistan's jihad groups have announced that they will take part at the consultative and decision-taking session of Herat; and it is very much hoped that peace would be established in Afghanistan.
