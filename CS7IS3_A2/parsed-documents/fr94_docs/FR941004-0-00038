ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: EPA is approving a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Maine. Maine revised its ``111(d) plan'' for the control of total reduced sulfur (TRS) emissions from existing kraft pulp mills. The revised plan was submitted by the Maine Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) on April 27, 1994. The revised plan consists of a revised regulation entitled ``Chapter 124: Total Reduced Sulfur Control From Kraft Pulp Mills.'' The revised plan satisfies EPA's requirements for adoption and submittal of a plan to control TRS emissions from designated facilities in accordance with section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act (CAA). DATES: This final rule is effective December 5, 1994 unless, by November 3, 1994, adverse or critical comments are received. If the effective date is delayed, timely notice will be published in the Federal Register . ADDRESSES: Comments may be mailed to Linda M. Murphy, Director, Air, Pesticides and Toxics Management Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region I, JFK Federal Building, Boston, MA 02203. Copies of the documents relevant to this action are available for public inspection during normal business hours, by appointment at the Air, Pesticides and Toxics Management Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region I, One Congress Street, 10th floor, Boston, MA; Air and Radiation Docket and Information Center, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., (LE&hyph;131), Washington, DC 20460; and the Bureau of Air Quality Control, Department of Environmental Protection, 71 Hospital Street, Augusta, ME 04333. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Daria L. Dilaj at (617) 565&hyph;3249. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On September 19, 1990 (55 FR 38545), EPA approved Maine's 111(d) plan for controlling total reduced sulfur (TRS) emissions from existing kraft pulp mills in accordance with section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act. Maine's 111(d) plan consists of a regulation entitled ``Chapter 124: Total Reduced Sulfur Control from Kraft Pulp Mills.'' The State of Maine, in adopting a plan pursuant to section 111(d) of the CAA to control TRS emissions from existing kraft pulp mills, chose to adopt requirements for existing brown stock washer systems which are not required to be controlled under EPA guidance. Under section 116 of the CAA, the State of Maine is legally entitled to adopt more stringent emission standards for stationary sources than required or recommended by EPA. The State of Maine in its response to public comments on the proposed regulation specified that they felt that the control of TRS emissions from brown stock washers was important because of the magnitude of potential emissions from uncontrolled washers and the height at which they are emitted (i.e., they are more likely to have negative impacts on local residential areas because they are emitted at lower levels and are subject to less dispersion). Kraft pulp mills were required to meet most of the requirements of the regulation by January 1991, but were given until January 1, 1994 to meet the requirements for brown stock washers. On April 27, 1994, the State of Maine submitted a formal revision of Chapter 124 as an amendment to the 111(d) plan. The purpose of the revision is to extend the deadline (i.e., January 1, 1994) for brown stock washer systems to January 1, 1997. This extension addresses industry's concern that it be allowed to coordinate its efforts to comply with the SIP with its efforts to comply with EPA's forthcoming Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standard for the pulp and paper industry. This MACT standard is expected to be promulgated by September 1995. Maine believes a three-year compliance extension of the brown stock washer controls should be sufficient to allow industry to consider any impacts of the Federal MACT standard. Since the brown stock washer requirements of Maine's TRS regulation are more stringent than the applicable EPA requirements in the EPA guideline document entitled ``Kraft Pulping: Control of TRS Emissions from Existing Mills'' (EPA&hyph;450/2&hyph;78&hyph;003b), the compliance extension for the brown stock washers is acceptable. EPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. However, in a separate document in this publication, EPA is proposing to approve the SIP revision should adverse or critical comments be filed. This action will be effective December 5, 1994 unless, by November 3, 1994, adverse or critical comments are received. If the EPA receives such comments, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by simultaneously publishing a subsequent document that will withdraw the final action. All public comments received will then be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this action serving as a proposed rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. If no such comments are received, the public is advised that this action will be effective on December 5, 1994. Final Action EPA is approving the revised 111(d) plan controlling TRS emissions from kraft pulp mills submitted by Maine Department of Environmental Protection. The revised plan which consists of the revised regulation entitled ``Chapter 124: Total Reduced Sulfur From Kraft Pulp Mills'' affects six existing kraft pulp mills in the State of Maine. Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future submittal of a 111(d) plan by any State. Each request for approval of a 111(d) plan shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. Regulatory Process Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq. , EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds. Union Electric Co. v. U.S. E.P.A. , 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410 (a)(2). This action has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions from the requirement of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. The US EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on US EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by December 5, 1994. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2).)
