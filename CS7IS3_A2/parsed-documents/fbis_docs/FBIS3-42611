The former specialists in "the dialectics of socialism" and "optimum planning" have declared their readiness to carry out the prime minister's directive on "adjustment of the course of economic reforms" and to curb inflation by "primarily nonmonetary methods." It is no coincidence that the strange combination of words (similar to "fighting a fire by nonfire methods," "rescuing someone who is drowning by not pulling him out of the water," and the like) has become part of the vocabulary of Council of Ministers officials. A common economic dilemma for any country's government--inflation or a production recession (unemployment)--has become exacerbated to the limit because of the extremely deformed structure of the economy and the absence of developed market institutions. For this reason, it is still impossible for the voters to be pleased by the good condition of even one of the two key macroeconomic parameters. Everything that was accomplished in 1993 was to lower inflation by one-third (to 900 percent annually) and slow the rate of recession by a factor of 1.7 (to 11 percent). However, the voter, like the president and his prime minister and the financial institutions, has not finished and wants to see a global result right away. And those who want to meet all the voters' demands at once (the hypnotists, lawyers, academicians, and those who are simply crazy) make their appearance right away. While the first two categories of political illusionists received a vote of confidence in the 12 December elections, the academicians' hour of triumph came during the government crisis in mid-January. There is no question that statements by the "group of experts," which promises to cope with both the recession and inflation right away, are aimed at pleasing the premier, who is naturally worried to death about both problems. The guarantees are being given by persons who are quite reliable--the academicians. It is unlikely that they will really be lying. However, the premier would not have become the head of the government if he had not learned from his own mistakes and been insured against possible political traps. Viktor Chernomyrdin is well aware what the first attempt to make use of the services of the "reputable" economist Leonard Vid cost him. After the former deputy chairman of the USSR Gosplan [State Planning Committee] provided Mr. Chernomyrdin with his written concept of the reform, the press accused the prime minister of attempts to revive the system of directive management of the economy. Mr. Vid disappeared completely from the political scene as a result of the economic experiment in the spring. This time, Viktor Chernomyrdin is being cautious, and "the experts" have been attached to his first deputy, who will assume full responsibility for the work's unavoidable failures. It has also not been ruled out that the government order to the academicians is a budgeted grant for the economic NII [scientific research institutes], which are at death's door and whose staffs are comparable with the work force of associates in large corporations. However, regardless of the true motives for enlisting the services of these persons in the Council of Ministers or how long they are held in the White House, the damage inflicted on the Russian economy by the use of "nonmonetary methods" will be enormous. After all, each "nonmonetary" day will cost the country the inflation, measured in percentages that are entirely monetary, which is being generated by the increased productivity of the printing press.
