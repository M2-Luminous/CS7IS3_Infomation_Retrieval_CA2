By the end of last week, the chamber had considered 136 bills. It is State Duma committees that bear the brunt of legislative sponsorship -- they have drawn up 63 bills. Individual deputies have sponsored 33 bills; the government, 28; the president, 11; and the Constitutional Court, 1. This regards what has been done "in gross," whereas the output of more or less finished products is fairly modest. In all, 15 laws have been passed (of them, seven have already been signed by the president, and the others are with the Federation Council). Around 20 bills have been approved in the first reading and one has passed the second reading. An overwhelming majority of the approved laws concern the socioeconomic area. On one hand, this is a package ensuring the functioning of the economy: the budget plan, the laws on changes in payments to state extra-budget funds, on state foreign borrowings and credits. On the other, a package on social safety nets: on raising the minimum wage and on pensions. Typically, the government has lobbied for both the economic and social-populist bills. The deputies have passed at their own initiative the laws on their status and on the procedure for the coming into force of laws enacted by the Federal Assembly. This list also includes the related law on the Constitutional Court, which the deputies see as a guarantee of the preservation of parliamentarianism. Far from all committees have shown equal lawmaking zeal. According to an established tradition, the main burden has been shouldered by the legislation committee under Vladimir Isakov from the Agrarian Party of Russia [APR]. Its record includes three laws already passed, four laws approved in the first reading, and 12 decrees. The budget committee under Mikhail Zadornov from "Yabloko" is second. Third place is shared by the security committee under Viktor Ilyukhin from the Communist Party and the committee on labor and social protection under Sergey Kalashnikov from the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR]. The relatively small defense committee under Sergey Yushenkov from "Russia's Choice" has two bills that have passed the first reading and two decrees to its credit. One law and 14 decrees have been "churned out" by the committee on the organization of the State Duma's work under Vladimir Bauer from "Russia's Choice." The performance of these six committees can be considered effective, or at least noticeable. As for the rest, they clearly do not bother themselves too much with lawmaking. Seven State Duma committees each have submitted for consideration only one bill in six months. They include the committee on agricultural matters (Aleksandr Nazarchuk, APR); on industry, energy, and transport (Vladimir Gusev, LDPR); on international affairs (Vladimir Lukin, "Yabloko"); on natural resources and nature use (Nikolay Astafyev, LDPR); on the affairs of women, family, and youth (Galina Klimantova, "Women of Russia"); on information policy and communications (Mikhail Poltoranin, "Russia's Choice"), and on geopolitics (Viktor Ustinov, LDPR). But even this is not the limit of the deputies' "zeal." Four State Duma committees have failed to propose a single bill or a draft decree, whereas the others limited their creative work to drafting one decree or two. Two "national" and all three "international" committees (on international affairs, the CIS, and geopolitics) have failed to find their legislative niche. Nor has the existence of three economic committees so far been justified by "prolific" lawmaking -- two of them (on economy and on privatization) have kept an extremely low profile. It seems that the overspecialization of parliamentary committees (that also have subcommittees inside) has only brought about an increase in offices and titles for the deputies. If we assess lawmaking from the point of view of party affiliation, the first striking feature is sluggish work by the Party for Russian Unity and Accord. Which is strange, because the faction has brought together many deputies from among civil servants who are objectively interested in making laws that would "fit their size." The contribution of "Russia's Choice" also falls short of the faction's numerical strength or its potential intellectual capabilities. The agrarian lobby is acting aggressively and competently, but only within the range of their professional problems. The communists' work in the parliament boils down primarily to good attendance of meetings, hearings, and other "events." The LDPR faction proceeds from the assumption that laws being passed by the current State Duma will not be adhered to all the same, so it exploits its presence in the State Duma only for political horse-trading. By the time of its recess (in July), the lower chamber plans to consider around 30 bills "of primary state importance." They include the draft laws "On the Ombudsman," "On the Counting Chamber," "On Workers Collectives," "On the State Privatization Program," and "On Civil Service." The preparation of the Labor Code will be delayed for an indefinite period along with the law on the guidelines of economic reform.
