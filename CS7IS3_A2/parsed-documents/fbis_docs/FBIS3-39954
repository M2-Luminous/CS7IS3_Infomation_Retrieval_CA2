Raquel Abecassis reports. [Abecassis] The Israeli prime minister said he did not want to speak to journalists, but ended up agreeing to a news conference later after, his meetings with the Portuguese prime minister and foreign minister. [Begin Rabin recording, in English] First, I am in Portugal as a guest of the prime minister. I am just now beginning my visit.
