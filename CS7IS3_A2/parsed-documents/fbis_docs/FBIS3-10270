Luis Donaldo Colosio, presidential candidate for the PRI, Institutional Revolutionary Party, visited Villa Hermoza on 22 February, capital of Tabasco State. Peasants briefed him on the agriculture and cattle-raising sectors. He said: "We must first admit what has not worked in order to make corrections. One of things that has not worked, and we have to correct it, is the federal government's relationship with Tabasco State." Colosio gathered a record crowd of 30,000 people. (Mexico City Radio ACIR Network in Spanish 0000 GMT 23 Feb 94) PRI candidate Colosio ended his Tabasco State campaign and began touring Campeche where he visited the Cuatro Caminos neighborhood, one of the poorest, and noted the peoples' demands. During a meeting with the Cambio 21 Foundation, he pledged to work for federalism to strengthen states and municipalities. On the subject of Campeche oil, he said: "Out of every $100 of crude exported, $65 originate from Campeche. We must do our best to ensure that this oil exploitation brings more benefit to the people of Campeche." Meanwhile, Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, presidential candidate for the PAN, National Action Party, received a call in Mexicali from Manuel Camacho Solis, Peace and Reconciliation Commission representative in Chiapas. Camacho Solis said talks with the Zapatist National Liberation Army are going well. Cevallos said: "I took the call while I was here at the University, and he said the talks are progressing well and that he hopes to have news for us soon...." Cevallos met with law students at the University of Baja California. He said the country's problems are political and already solved, others, like the economy and social problems will be solved gradually. In another report, Marcela Lombardo, presidential candidate for the PPS, Popular Socialist Party, campaigned in Mexico City and met with the Worldwide Association of Women Journalists and Writers. There, she spoke of her party's development project proposal and said in part: "...with regional planning, to take advantage of all the resources from each of the country's resources." Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, presidential candidate for the PRD, Party of the Democratic Revolution, campaigned in Guerrero State and spoke out against political bosses, authoritarianism, abandoning the Indians, and in favor of democracy. He said: "Right now, we are proposing changes to the electoral law and open elections." Lastly, the PT, Workers Party of Mexico, registered its political platform with Federal Electoral Institute, IFE, authorities. Presidential candidate Cecilia Soto headed the delegation and she handed the document to IFE General Director Arturo Nunez. She then held a news conference where she said in part: "...our proposals do not include constitutional reforms. It would be very difficult to reach an agreement on this." (Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0435 GMT 24 Feb) On 24 February, PRI and PARM, Authentic Party of the Mexican Revolution, parties delivered their political platforms to IFE authorities. IFE General Director Arturo Nunez said: "The electoral platforms highlight several ways to understand Mexico, to see its problems, and offer solutions from each party's view point." (Mexico City Canal 13 Television Azteca Network in Spanish 1300 GMT 25 Feb 94) PRI candidate Colosio ended his political tour to Merida and continued on to Quintana Roo State where he said the August elections must be exemplary to inspire confidence and added: "I want to be the president of Mexico to democratically change our country." PAN candidate Fernandez de Cevallos visited Sinaloa State and told businessmen his party had not made political agreements in the electoral processes. He said the PRD had received more benefits than his party in the preelectoral conflicts. He responded to Confederation of Mexican Workers, CTM, leader Fidel Velasquez' charges against him by saying: "The union sector is a progovernment, boss-controlled game preserve which does not accept democracy. This cannot continue." During her visit to Tlaxcala State, PPS candidate Lombardo Otero summoned interested parties and candidates to a meeting to discuss a different economic program that will satisfy the needs of the Mexicans and create more jobs. PRD candidate Cardenas initiated a three-day tour to Michoacan state to outline his political platform. Rafael Aguilar Talamante, Cardenist Front for National Reconstruction Party, PFCERN, presidential candidate, attended a political rally in Mexico City and said: "To prompt the changes the country requires, it is imperative we use the power of the vote instead of the destructive power of weapons, intolerance, or violence." He called for the reasoned vote to prevail over the retaliation vote. PPS and PRD parties registered their political platforms at IFE for the 21 August federal elections today. Counting these two parties, eight political parties have registered their platforms at IFE, only the PFCERN has not presented the corresponding document. (Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 26 Feb 94) At a meeting with the IFE General Council today, "the nine registered political parties approved important agreements to ensure clean and honest elections in August." The main agreements were: "1) To request the Criminal Law be revised so it clearly stipulates what electoral crimes are and increases the punishments." 2) Approval of electoral observers. They, however, "have to be Mexican citizens who agree to take a training course, are not registered in any political party, and have not run for any public office in the past three years. 3) Pending approval of the Attorney General's Office, a special Electoral Crimes Prosecutor's Office will be created." 4) The function of auditing the electoral register will be publicly auctioned. "5) The Federal Government will give political parties an additional 10 percent for political training, socioeconomic investigations, and expenses for editorial tasks. The parties will receive more than 19 million new pesos for those activities." Pablo Emilio Madero, presidential candidate of the National Opposition Union, UNO, campaigned in Nayarit State. He met with students and invited "all Mexicans to use their electoral card because it will allow them to make changes in the country." Jorge Gonzalez, presidential candidate of the Mexican Green Ecologist Party, toured Mexico State. He said "alternate technology is an ecological answer to resolving the lack of basic services such as drinking water." (Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0435 GMT 1 Mar 94 Manuel Camacho Solis, Commissioner for Peace and Reconciliation in Chiapas, has tried to stop persistent rumors about his aspirations to the Mexican presidency, and he told reporters: "I have nothing to add regarding personal issues. Right now, I am dedicated to my work. Once the peace agreements are signed, I will comment on what I expect to do next." Political and media speculations have noted that Camacho's political perspectives will increase if the conflict in Chiapas is resolved prior to 15 March, the deadline for political parties to register their candidates for the 21 August presidential elections. PRI has announced that its candidate, Luis Donaldo Colosio, will register on 4 March. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 0649 GMT 3 Mar 94) PPS candidate Lombardo campaigned in Yucatan and spoke out against foreign electoral observers at the August elections. She said "the political parties themselves have to guard the elections." PRD candidate Cardenas visited Mexico City Ibero-American University and spoke about the Chiapas agreements. He said: "It seems the government has started to respond to the demands." Cardenas was interrupted several times by students who protested because he had not attended a previous meeting. A Mexico City voters registration office official reported more than five million people in Mexico City already have the corresponding voter's card.
