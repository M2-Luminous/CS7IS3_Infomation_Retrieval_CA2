Newspapers assert that Lieutenant Colonel Hugo Chavez Frias, leader of the coup attempt in February 1992, has reported that ranking military officers are planning a coup d'etat. The report, published in an EL NACIONAL column, pointed out that the Caldera administration and the economic and political elite are perfectly aware of the situation and that they even have the name of a military leader who may be involved in the conspiracy. According to columnist Alfredo Pena, Armed Forces officers told Chavez Frias that a coup d'etat would be staged by high command members and that the Interior Ministry has been informed. This is the first rumor that Caldera's administration has had to deal with, added to which are the remarks of Defense Minister Rafael Montero, who said today that Venezuela is on the verge of a civil war. Although his remarks would seem to point to the armed attacks on policemen during a demonstration at a university campus, analysts have not dismissed the possibility that Montero's assertion had some other connotation. In the opinion of analyst Alfredo Pena, "it is all very confusing, and the government should remain alert. The economic, fiscal, and financial crises have caused widespread anger among the people, but an insurrection would not be justified. [no closing quotation mark as received] Pena added that the Executive has made serious mistakes in the handling of the crisis it inherited from the social democratic administrations of the past 10 years, but that does not justify the rejection of all attempts to resolve such a serious problem. Deputies from the opposition Radical Cause Party (CR) and the Movement Toward Socialism requested a thorough investigation to determine the veracity of Chavez's report and, in any event, to reveal the names of the people responsible for the plot. Alfredo Pena said that a military coup at this time would unleash a series of actions and reactions out of fear and that there would be a blood bath "because in Venezuela there is no chance of a plain coup." In contrast, Interior Minister Ramon Escovar Salom said that, despite the wave of student demonstrations that degenerated into riots and plunder during the week, for the time being there is no possibility of a coup d'etat. According to the EL NACIONAL columnist, "there are civilian instigators" who are taking advantage of the wave of marches, which are also to protest against the high cost of living and the lack of services.
