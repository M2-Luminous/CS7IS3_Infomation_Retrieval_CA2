Now, the times dictate the need for good relations with Russia for the implementation of Polish interests, and we confirmed in the course of the visit that Russia wants the same. There are no matters of dispute, there are no differences of view that could stand in the way or could be conditions incapable of being met, so that precisely these good Polish-Russian relations could come to fruition. We talked with all of the well-known Russian politicians. We spoke with left-wing forces and right-wing and centrist ones. Concerning economic affairs, Russia, just like Poland, sees the opportunity for significant growth in the dynamics of trade turnover and of our own new joint economic, capital, financial, and investment undertakings. This is what Poland needs, this is what can serve the improvement of the situation in Russia. We feel that this visit had a deep sense in political, economic, and state terms. And let no one seek in it something that was not there; let everyone find in it that which can serve Poland and Russia in thinking about Europe and its future, bilateral, and in thinking. [sentence as heard] [end recording] Bronislaw Geremek, who was a member of the delegation, evaluates the visit as being very important: [Begin Geremek recording] This is a visit that ought not to be measured in terms of what it was possible to achieve because this was not for executive power or for the signing of protocols. This was a political visit and, in my view, one of great significance because the Poles spoke the language of truth--various political groupings in various ways--but the hard language of truth. And the Russians replied to us in like fashion. We know at the moment where the differences of opinion lie. They relate to the issue of security, and they must relate to it. They relate to the issue of Polish participation in NATO, and they must relate to this. But, simultaneously, on the one side and on the other, there was a certain act of political will. It is worthwhile, for both Poland and Russia, to build normal relations. And, first, to start with the economy. There is business--Polish and Russian--to be done here, and it will show that there are no aggressive intentions on either side. In this sense, I judge that this was a successful visit.
