FBIS4-68173 "jptot021__l94039" JPRS-TOT-94-021-L JPRS Terrorism FOUO 11 May 1994 NEAR EAST/SOUTH ASIA LEBANON Hizballah's Qasim Denies Links With Foreign Hostages Hizballah's Qasim Denies Links With Foreign Hostages NC1805144994 Beirut AL-DIYAR in Arabic 11 May 94 p 4 NC1805144994 Beirut AL-DIYAR Arabic BFN [Interview with Hizballah Deputy Secretary General Shaykh Na'im Qasim by unidentified CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY correspondent; place, date not given] [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Correspondent: Some people say that lifting the international cover of the Lebanese Forces will also lead to lifting Hizballah's cover, particularly the Syrian and Iranian protection, because of the party's links to the foreign hostages issue. What is your reaction to that? Qasim: The circumstances that made eyes focus on the Lebanese Forces are unique to the Lebanese Forces, the only local Lebanese organization that rendered services to the Israeli enemy by engaging in domestic sedition. This does not apply to Hizballah, which seeks to liberate the land, drive the Israeli enemy out of the south and the western al-Biqa', spread peace among the people, and serve the community. Hizballah did not gain power in the Lebanese arena through dreadful acts; it got its status through its sincerity, major sacrifices, and the blood of innocent martyrs who served not only the Islamic cause, but also the Lebanese cause in the region and helped the free people in the Arab and Muslim worlds. [passage omitted] As for the foreign hostages, we repeated several times in the past that we have absolutely no connection with that file. There is no sense in reopening that file, because we settled the ramifications of that issue at the time. [passage omitted] As for Hizballah, we do not rely on any international cover for our local existence. You say that some people ask whether the cover will be lifted from Hizballah now that it has been lifted from the Lebanese Forces. The way the West deals with Samir Ja'ja' and what he stands for is generally different from the way they deal with Hizballah. We are fighters at the international level, because we do not tolerate the continued occupation of our lands. [passage omitted] Correspondent: Some believe that things will get worse if the domestic situation keeps on its current course. How does Hizballah view the need to close all domestic files? Qasim: We understand the meaning of balances of rights and duties and the need for mutual coexistance. But we do not understand this balance to mean taking the innocent with the guilty to achieve sectarian equality. Had the Sayyidat al-Najat Church crime been committed by Muslims, the same measures that were taken against the Lebanese Forces should have been taken against Muslims, if they were directly accused. That horrible act was committed by a team of Christians, so they have to pay the price for harming people, violating a place of worship, and terrorizing a sector of the Lebanese people. But opening files in every direction is not an objective measure; it ruins Lebanon. Whoever makes mistakes and undermines public peace must be punished. [passage omitted] The Christians' frustration has objective causes that have to do with the performance of Christian political leaders. The bloody conflicts that raged in the eastern area [of Beirut] as part of a power struggle and the way some Christian parties dealt with the grassroots level and with Christian citizens led to that development and created an atmosphere of frustration among Christians in general and the Maronites in particular. Those bloody confrontations could have been averted. We in Hizballah believe that rectifying that internal situation requires that all Lebanese citizens be dealt with on the basis of actual developments. These developments require an Islamic-Christian openness, free of tribal fanaticism.
