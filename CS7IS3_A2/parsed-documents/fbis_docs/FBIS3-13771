Undoubtedly, this massacre also saddened us greatly. It made some voices in the Arab world ask Egypt in particular to take violent measures in response to the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. This request is based on Egypt's status and importance in the Arab and Islamic worlds. Some went as far as asking that the negotiations between the Palestinians and Israelis be halted. However, we wish to calmly clarify to those who made these demands that by doing so, we would be serving the interests of Israel itself. It would be better for them to ask the Arabs and Muslims to exert greater efforts to rally the support of international public opinion for the Arab cause and put pressure on Israel to provide full protection for the defenseless Palestinian people and the sacred Muslim and Christian shrines in Palestine equally, especially in light of the Security Council's hesitation to pass a resolution condemning this massacre and confirming the need to protect the Palestinians. These voices would fare better if they realize that exploiting this massacre to thwart the peace process only serves to stir up emotions, incite the masses, and repeat those slogans that through experience have proven to lead to nothing except further losses for the Arab side in its struggle with Israel. We wish to confirm that Egypt and its political leadership are fully convinced of the usefulness and inevitability of peace and that ever since the peace process started, Israel has been trying to escape from the peace siege. Those who have been following the Egyptian stance since the state of Israel was created realize that the Egyptian stance is firm and that Egypt moves in all directions to retrieve Arab rights. Egypt has waged many long wars for this purpose, the last of which was the 1973 war. Egypt's efforts did not stop for one instant. For this purpose, Egypt participates in the other Arab efforts that move in the same direction, particularly since recent international developments have affirmed without a shadow of a doubt that usurped Arab rights cannot be retrieved except with solidarity and coordination among Arab capitals. Such solidarity and coordination has become an urgent need now, especially since Israel is trying to break free from the peace siege. Proof of this is the Israeli Government's stance on the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. Although some Israeli officials condemned this massacre, the essence of Israeli policy toward the settlers and settlements has not changed. Israel depends on two things to continue this policy. The first is that the international community is not yet ready to take decisive measures against Israel; the Security Council's stand is the prime example of this. The second is that the American stand encourages Israel to continue ignoring Arab rights; U.S. President Bill Clinton's statement provided the necessary evidence of this point. He declared his recognition of Jerusalem as the eternal capital of Israel at a time when the blood of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque martyrs had not yet dried. Egypt has proceeded to reject all measures taken by Israel on Jerusalem after June 1967. Egypt considers these measures null and void. Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa's statement that Jerusalem is part of the occupied territories was a response to the U.S. President's statement. He described President Clinton's statement as a political and tactical statement. In light of all this, the importance of proceeding with the peace process becomes clear. Inciting the people and provoking their feelings will not help resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict.
