This year is no exception. As early as 17 January, the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee [CPCCC] issued a circular to all units around the country, under the title "Suggestions on Recommending Newspapers and Journals for Study by Party Organizations." The fact that the party media have to be "recommended" to party organizations by the CPCCC Propaganda Department shows that the party's mouthpiece cannot get a foothold on the market and must be supported by an administrative order. Declining Circulations of Party Newspapers and Journals As revealed by the Information Office of the State Council, the circulations of party newspapers and journals have plummeted since last year when the State Council stipulated that personal subscriptions to such papers and journals be paid at personal expense. In general, the circulations of party and government journals at the central and local levels have fallen by 15 percent--in some cases, the drop has exceeded 50 percent. Statistic figures show that the annual loss suffered by newspapers and journals published by central and local government and party departments has totaled some 135 million yuan. The Chinese Communists once elatedly boasted that RENMIN RIBAO was the paper with the largest circulation in the world. In fact, the paper is financially supported by the state coffer. Organs like RENMIN RIBAO are synonymous with "public newspapers." Without doubt, the "subscription at personal expense" stipulation, which went into effect last year, has served as the best public opinion poll [about people's confidence in the party media]. The over 135 million yuan loss is by no means a small amount; it is sufficient to send the press magnate of any country into bankruptcy. To the CPC, which maintains a one-party rule in China, however, the concern is not the huge loss of money, but the loss of public confidence in the party media as indicated by the sharp drop in their circulations. Such being the case, it is no matter of surprise that the CPCCC Propaganda Department has come out to act as a "recommender" for the party media. The CPCCC Propaganda Department's circular requests that party organizations at all levels take it as the party's principal propaganda work to promote the study and reading of newspapers and journals so as to understand and get a grip on important domestic affairs and gain knowledge about major international events. According to the circular, party organizations should give periodical written tests to cadres with party membership to check their knowledge about major domestic and international events and use the test results as one of the criteria for their promotion or job assignment. Every member of the party organization, the circular urges, must subscribe to a party newspaper or journal. In remote areas, every village party organization and county propaganda department is responsible for subscribing a party newspaper and making arrangements for party members to study it on a regular basis. While the CPCCC Propaganda Department has issued numerous orders in the past to urge party organizations at all levels to give attention to political study, never before has it required that cadres with party membership take a "written test" on the contents of party newspapers and that the test results be used as one of the criteria for "promotion." There is, indeed, some reason for doing this, but it cannot be said openly. Real Situation of Circulations and Expenditures of the `Two Newspapers and One Journal' Besides the CPCCC Propaganda Department's circular, the Information Office of the State Council also issued on 24 January a circular entitled "On Seriously Promoting the Work of All Media-Distribution and Publication Departments." The Information Office is quite clear about the concrete statistics on the distribution and publication of the party media. In addition to the above-mentioned annual loss of some 135 million yuan, there are many more figures, which are considered as "state secrets." Following are the real situation of circulations and expenditures of the "two newspapers and one journal" at the central level: RENMIN RIBAO (Domestic Edition): The daily circulation in 1992 was about 2.3 million. In 1993, the circulation was only 1.65 million, down by 28 percent, and the excess expenditure amounted to some 8.3 million yuan. GUANGMING RIBAO: The daily circulation in 1992 was about 1.5 million. In 1993, this dropped to 850,000, down by 43 percent, and the excess expenditure was some 3.1 million yuan. QIUSHI magazine: In 1992, each issue had a circulation of about 1.5 million. In 1993, the figure dropped to 1.1 million, down by 27 percent, and the excess expenditure was more than 860,000 yuan. In comparison, the mainland's evening papers have a rather stable circulation because their contents are richer and more "liberal." A survey shows that the daily circulations of government and party newspapers and journals in the nation's 30 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have dropped 15 percent--in some cases more than 50 percent--with the exception of nine newspapers and journals including XINMIN WANBAO in Shanghai, YANGCHENG WANBAO in Guangdong, BEIJING WANBAO in Beijing, and CHENGDU WANBAO in Sichuan. More than 50 party organs at the provincial level have excess expenditures. On the average, the excess expenditure is as high as more than 60 percent. Circulation of CANKAO XIAOXI Plummets What is worth mentioning is that CANKAO XIAOXI, the largest circulation publication in the country, was once widely received by readers as the only "other information source" under the CPC's information-blockade policy. During the past decade, however, its circulation has nose-dived, from 25 million in 1982 to 16 million in 1988 and then to 8 million in 1993. The fall was 68 percent compared with the peak attained 11 years ago. The declined circulation has worsened the problem of excess expenditures. For example, the three news agencies XINHUA, ZHONGXIN, and ZHONGTONG have an average excess expenditure of more than 60 million yuan [figure as published]. This does not include the special funds that the State Council has allocated to them for the purchase of supplies and communications equipment and for various large-scale activities. Specific figures follow: Three Official News Agencies Have Excess Expenditure of 60 Million Yuan [as published] In 1993, the official XINHUA News Agency had an expenditure of 87 million yuan, showing an excess of some 13 million yuan. In 1993, ZHONGGUO XINWEN had an expenditure of 42 million yuan, showing an excess of some 8.6 million yuan. In 1993, ZHONGGUO TONGXUN had an expenditure of 60 million yuan, showing an excess of some 9.7 million yuan. Of the three news agencies, ZHONGXIN had the smallest excess expenditure. In addition to the above, there is a "record-breaking" figure: The Xinhua Bookstore's total sales of political and theoretical books throughout the country was 305,000 books in 1993 (excluding My Father--Deng Xiaoping and Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, Volume III), hitting a record low since the founding of the People's Republic. More than 1.8 million books on politics were sold in 1950. The highest record was registered in 1967, when 3.25 billion political and theoretical books were sold. A low circulation--a high expenditure; a decline in circulation--a still higher expenditure. It seems that the CPC mouthpiece can hardly get out of this difficulty at the moment. Even the measure of linking party newspapers to promotions and pay raises will not produce any result. This is a disastrous effect of separating economic reform from political reform. Just think: When people are enjoying every day the material life created by capitalism, how could they believe the party's stereotyped propaganda that "only socialism can save China"?
