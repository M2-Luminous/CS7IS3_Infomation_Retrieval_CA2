The trial was due to start yesterday but had to be postponed until today at the request of the defense lawyers to enable them to examine the bill of indictment. The request was granted by the presiding judge who gave the defense 24 hours to examine the file. Over to Bachir Hedibel who attended the opening of the trial: [Hedibel] The prosecutor general has just required the maximum sentence, namely the death penalty, for the defendant Layada Abdelhak who is appearing before the Algiers special judicial court. The trial of Layada Abdelhak began this morning after it was postponed for 24 hours at the request of his four lawyers. The presiding judge opened the session by reading the bill of indictment. The main charges brought against the defendant include harming the integrity of the national territory and the security of the state with a view to overthrowing the regime, leading armed groups, carrying out acts of sabotage against public interests, stealing weapons and ammunition, using violence, and committing premeditated murders and aggravated thefts. The bill of indictment includes 21 crimes. The defendant has confessed to all the crimes, according to the bill of indictment. He also knew about the other crimes committed at the time he belonged to the Armed [Islamic] Group and before he went to Morocco on 23 September 1993. He denied all this before the court today repeating every time that he was only the personal driver of Moh Leveilley [alias for Mohamed Allal, GIA member killed in clash with security forces in September 1992 in Tamezguida] and that he never took part in any assassination operation against members of the national security forces. He added that if operations were carried out when he was the driver, he had no prior knowledge of these operations. He further said that his orders were to drive the armed groups in his capacity as a driver. The defense lawyers concentrated on the bill of indictment which they regarded as being to the advantage of their client since there was no mention of Layada being commander [emir] of the group. Using this line of defense, the lawyers asked for a lighter sentence, especially as Layada did not deny his affiliation to the group. The trial is continuing at this very moment and given the long list of charges brought against the defendant and the numerous cases and names mentioned during the session, we will limit ourselves to this for the time being and promise our listeners further details in later reports.
