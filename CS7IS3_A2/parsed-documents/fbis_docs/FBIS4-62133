They have signed an economic agreement freezing prices on the goods and services that each produces. It is presumed that this measure will enable them to hold down the growth of expenditures on Magadan Oblast's basic end product -- gold. Kolyma gold may have become the most expensive in the world, and that means, not competitive. The governor of Magadan Oblast is convinced that other Far East territories, whose products cannot find a market either in Russia or abroad due to pricing distortions, should take similar steps. It is difficult to forecast the effectiveness of the Magadan agreement, because it is doubtful that order can be restored in one isolated oblast at a time of general economic anarchy and helplessness.
