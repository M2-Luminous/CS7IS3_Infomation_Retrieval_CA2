Tasanlar was removed from his position after the roughing up of demonstrators and SDPP Deputy Salman Kaya by the police during the May Day celebrations in Ankara. He was reinstated today as the investigation on him proved him to be not guilty. In a written statement Matkap said that the government agreement of the SHP and senior coalition partner True Path Party [TPP] had promised to remove all obstacles on democratization of the Turkish society. He recalled that civil servants and workers who sought their rights have been beaten up by the police over the last six months, while the shariah (Islamic law) supporters who stoned the U.S. Embassy and TPP headquarters were allowed to carry out their rallies in the streets without police retribution. `Most recently, press members and participants of the May Day celebrations were beaten up,' he said, adding that one deputy of their party was also beaten up the same day. `As a consequence of these unfavorable developments, the security director was removed from his post, was returned and it should be recalled that a number of deputies from our coalition partner had been opposed to his removal at that time,' he said. Meanwhile, a statement by the Ministry of the Interior said today that Police Chief Mehmet Okur, officers Mithad Budak and Suleyman Yalman will be tried on charges of police brutality for the beating of Kaya. If convicted, they will receive prison terms ranging between three months and three years and suspension of their civil servant status.
