The final straw was yesterday's takeover of the public building that houses the Federal Police headquarters in Brasilia. Strategic Affairs Secretary Mario Flores said that the Army was summoned because public disorder is unacceptable. The Army is using heavy weapons and equipment to discourage any resistance from the strikers, who were armed. Resistance might have serious consequences. A short time ago, the president of the National Federation of Federal Policemen said the strikers will return their arms to the government to prove the peaceful nature of the strike. The government claims the Army was summoned to guarantee constitutional rights and to prevent indiscipline, the taking over of public buildings, armed strikes, and to guarantee the right to work. President Franco is now meeting with Army Minister Zenildo Zoroastro de Lucena and with Flores to evaluate the situation and its developments.
