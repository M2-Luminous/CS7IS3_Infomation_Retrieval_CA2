This has been confirmed by LDPR leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy in response to an inquiry from a correspondent for the journal EKHO PLANETY [ECHO OF THE PLANET]. "We have invited anybody with whom we maintain relations -- people from Iraq, Serbia, North Korea, South Korea, and other countries. We have friends everywhere," he said. The sensational news that the president of Taiwan had also been invited to the congress and might turn up has not so far been confirmed. However, it has been reported from Paris that the first deputy leader of the French National Front will definitely come to Moscow for the LDPR congress. The head of the extreme right-wing German People's Union, Gerhard Frey, also intends to take part in it.
