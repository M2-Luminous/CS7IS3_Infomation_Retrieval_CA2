In this regard, he said the unequivocal task within the military organization is to work for Venezuela, adding that that is why there is no talk about military rebellion within the Armed Forces. Montero also indicated that those implicated in the 4 February and 27 November 1992 coup attempts were pardoned and some of them reinstated in the Armed Forces. Admitting that the country's situation is difficult, General Francisco Visconti, one of the leaders of the 27 November 1992 coup attempt, said that the conditions for a new coup in Venezuela do not exist. The high-ranking military officer, whose case was dismissed in exchange for his discharge from the Armed Forces, was received by President Caldera, whom he thanked for the peace process implemented in the military. Wearing the typical blue Air Force uniform with his brigadier general rank, Visconti asked the president to ensure that the aeronautics experience of the high-ranking officers who will retire 5 July be used in the most efficient and productive manner for the country. Admitting that the country's crisis is deep, the coupist military officer asked for a vote of confidence for the president, whom he described as a man with the morals and professionalism to lead Venezuela. He added that this task cannot be carried out by only one person, rather a highly qualified human team. [Begin Visconti recording] We have said that this is a very difficult task, which requires our cooperation. Consequently, the commitment is not to Dr. Caldera but to ourselves, Venezuelans, and our fatherland, which must overcome the existing crisis. [end recording] Although he thinks that commander Hugo Chavez Frias has the right to make proposals, Gen. Visconti said that he will not constantly criticize the administration as Chavez has been doing.
