FBIS4-52357 "dreas090_q_94011" FBIS-EAS-94-090 Daily Report 4 May 1994 AUSTRALASIA Australia White Paper on Employment, Trade Issued White Paper on Employment, Trade Issued BK0405091394 Melbourne Radio Australia in English 0630 GMT 4 May 94 BK0405091394 Melbourne Radio Australia English BFN [From the "International Report" program] [Text] The Australian Government has made a major statement on employment and economic growth, calling for Australia to cut its jobless rate by half by the year 2000. The White Paper presented to Parliament by the prime minister, Paul Keating, says Australia can bring its unemployment rate down to five percent by the turn of the century. To support the job strategy, Mr. Keating pledged to spend an extra Australian $6.5 billion over four years. From Canberra, Graeme Dobell reports: [Begin Dobell recording] In its first White Paper on employment in nearly 50 years, the Australian Government says it will make sweeping changes to the social security system and what it calls landmarking labor market programs. Much of the analysis is couched in the language of economic rationalism, arguing for jobs created by economic growth needing no government subsidies. It calls for continued low inflation, improved competitiveness, and productivity and further reforms of the Australian economy. But the White Paper says economic growth alone will not do enough for the long-term unemployed and truly disadvantaged. These are the 400,000 of Australia's one million unemployed who have been out of a job for more than 12 months. The response is what is to be known as the job compact -- a promise that anyone who has been drawing unemployment benefits for 18 months or more will be given a job. The government says it will provide training and support to give 6-12 months work, primarily in the private sector. The job compact promises some unemployed a training wage, so they can combine work with training. The government says that by the financial year starting in the middle of next year, this employment and training promise will cost an extra Australian $2 billion. But this will be partly offset by savings of $800 million in unemployment benefits. The government will be budgeting in next financial year for extra $280 million to support the income of the unemployed and low wage earners, $160 million for industry and trade schemes, and $50 million to help develop remote Australian regions where jobless rates are the highest. The trade policy repeats Australia's commitment to link into the dynamic economies of the Asia-Pacific and enhance the multilateral trading system to be based on the World Trade Organization. The paper notes that by 1996, Australia's general tariff rate will be a maximum of five percent -- the end point of a tariff cutting regime starting in the late 1980's. Recent Australian reports had suggested that tariff cuts could continue down to a maximum of three percent by the year 2000, but the government has backed off from that idea. Instead, it has announced that the general five percent rate will continue beyond 1996. Canberra says this is one of the lowest maximum tariff rates in the world and thus developing country preferences will be phased out for all but the poorest countries. In answer to many criticisms from Southeast Asia, Canberra has also pledged to amend its antidumping legislation, so it is closer to GATT standards. In conclusion, the White Paper says that Australia has the chance to get the balance right to achieve a dynamic economy but also offer every Australian the right to a job. The government statement says Australia's aim is to enter the next century with one of the world's most sophisticated and efficient economies underpinning one of the world's most equitable and cohesive societies.
