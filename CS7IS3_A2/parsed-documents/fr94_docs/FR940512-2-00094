FR940512-2-00094 FR940512-2-00055 Beaumont Area Pipefitters Joint Apprenticeship Committee (the Plan) Located in Beaumont, Texas; Proposed Exemption [Application No. L&hyph;9412] The Department is considering granting an exemption under the authority of section 408(a) of the Act and in accordance with the procedures set forth in 29 CFR part 2570, subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August 10, 1990). If the exemption is granted, the restrictions of sections 406(a) and 406(b) (1) and (2) of the Act shall not apply to the purchase of certain real property (the Property) by the Plan from Pipefitters Local 195 of the United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipefitting Industry (the Union), a party in interest with respect to the Plan, provided that the following conditions are met: 1. An independent fiduciary determines that the proposed transaction is in the best interests of the Plan; 2. The fair market value of the Property is established by an appraiser unrelated to the Plan or the Union; 3. The Plan pays no more than the lesser of $462,800 or the fair market value of the Property as determined at the time of purchase; 4. The purchase is a one-time transaction for cash; and 5. The Plan pays no fees or commissions in regard to the transaction. Summary of Facts and Representations 1. The Plan is an apprenticeship training plan established and administered pursuant to the provisions of section 302 of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947. As of January 31, 1994, the Plan had 580 participants and total assets of $1,248,499. On the same date, the number of employers contributing to the Plan totaled 21. 2. The Property consists of 2.74 acres of land and improvements located adjacent to property of the Union. The improvements include three one and two-story buildings, constructed by the Union in 1968 and 1978, designed for use as classroom and apprenticeship training facilities for the Plan and its participants. From 1968 to 1988 the Plan operated an apprenticeship program on the Property pursuant to a lease of the Property by the Union to the Plan. 1 In August 1988 the Union sold the Property to the Plan. The Plan partially financed this purchase by obtaining a loan from the Sabine Area Pipefitters Local 195 Pension Trust Fund (Local 195 Pension Plan). The Local 195 Pension Plan, which was later merged into the Plumbers and Pipefitters National Pension Fund, had interlocking trustees with the Plan and the Plan made some contributions to the Local 195 Pension Plan on behalf of its participants. The loan was repaid in June 1991. 1 Prohibited transaction exemption (PTE) 78&hyph;5 (43 FR 23024, May 30, 1978) permits, under certain conditions, the leasing of real property by an apprenticeship plan from a sponsoring employee organization. The Department expresses no opinion as to whether the above lease satisfied the conditions of PTE 78&hyph;5 nor is any relief provided herein. In September 1990 the Department commenced an investigation of the Plan regarding the sale of the Property by the Union to the Plan and the loan between the Plan and the Local 195 Pension Plan. 2 Also, an application for exemption for retroactive relief from the prohibited transaction provisions of the Act was submitted to the Department for these transactions. In a letter in January 1992, the Department cited as reasons for denying the exemption application, among other factors, the lack of the review and prior approval of the transactions by an independent fiduciary. Following this exemption denial, an agreement was reached with the Department which required that the Property be sold back by the Plan to the Union. Such sale occurred in December 1992. Since that date, the Plan has utilized the Property as a training facility without charge from the Union. However, the applicant represents that because of an economic downturn in the area, the Union considers it a hardship to continue this arrangement. 2 The above described transactions may have constituted prohibited transactions under section 406 of the Act. Such section prohibits, in part, a sale or exchange of property between a plan and a party in interest, a use of plan assets for the benefit of a party in interest, and the acting of a fiduciary in a plan transaction on behalf of a party whose interests are adverse to those of the plan or its participants.
