They confirmed that Brasilia is a new route for escaped Chinese citizens to enter the United States. In November, three other Chinese citizens were arrested by Federal Police in Acre State. They said they were trying to reach Brasilia to take a plane to the United States. Judge Pedro Paulo Castelo Branco questioned the four arrested Chinese citizens. They said that they purchased their forged passports from Cesar Bezerra Lin for $7,000. Federal Police believe Lin is one of the leaders of a gang that forges documents for Asians who want to travel to the United States. The gang is headquartered in Sao Paulo. It also forges visas and possibly identity cards. The Chinese citizens arrested in Brasilia confessed that they were aware that the documents were forged. Chen Gouxing, Huang Daiyuan, Chen Gongchin, and Dong Shirong arrived in Sao Paulo, where a man identified simply as Chou -- whom the police believe to be Cesar Lin -- helped them obtain the documents. The four traveled to Brasilia by bus. Chen Gongchin had a forged identity card for foreigners. Aged between 19 and 23, and without stable jobs in their country, the four university graduates fear being expelled from Brazil.
