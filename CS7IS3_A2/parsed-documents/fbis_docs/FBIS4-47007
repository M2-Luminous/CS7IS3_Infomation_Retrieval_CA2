An analysis of the package of presidential edicts, which was received for official distribution yesterday, shows that during the latest splash of the president's interest in economic policy his advisers demonstrated maximum inventiveness in the manipulation of the meager arsenal of economic regulation measures. Tax rates, quotas, export duties, and the infamous "restoration of the controllability of the state sector"--what else can be applied to the Russian economy without its lethal outcome? "On the other hand, what variations!" presidential experts will answer us. And they will be right here. New Stage: What To Do if There Is no Money in the Budget Despite the apparent heterogeneity, upon closer examination the new presidential edicts fully fit into a single logical scheme, which makes it possible to talk about a new stage in Russian macroeconomic policy. Recently, the need for innovations in this policy has been quite obvious, even if in connection with the debates on the annual budget and forthcoming negotiations with Western creditors. To put it bluntly, it was necessary to demonstrate new methods of budget stimulation of the economy under conditions of the financial crisis. These methods suggest themselves. If there is a shortage of money for direct budget support, the only thing left is "to help" enterprises through a reduction in the profit and added-value tax rate, at the same time, liberalizing raw-material export through an abolition of quotas. Despite the fact that individual elements of such a "new policy" also occurred earlier, essentially, in pure form they are first encountered in the new edicts "On Some Questions of Tax Policy" and "On the Abolition of Quotas and Licenses for Deliveries of Goods and Services for Export." The similarity of production stimulation through a tax cut with "Reaganomics" is evident immediately. Aleksandr Livshits, director of the group of economic advisers to the president, who was the ideologist of the new edicts, also drew these analogies with satisfaction. True, Russian state enterprises have some specific features. Most of them are so inefficient that tax indulgences and export liberalization are of purely symbolic significance for them. Therefore, some differentiation of state enterprises is quite logical. Public enterprises, which are not capable of managing state property independently and will be completely dependent on the government for support, are singled out among them in a separate edict. [Begin box] System of Criteria for Evaluating the Structure of the Balance of Insolvent Enterprises: --the coefficient of current liquidity: It characterizes the enterprise's general provision with circulating capital for the management of economic activity; --the coefficient of provision with internal capital: It characterizes the availability of the enterprise's own circulating capital necessary for its financial stability; --the coefficient of restoration (loss) of solvency: It characterizes the enterprise's real capability to restore or lose its solvency during a specific period. [End Box] Having announced the possibility of reducing some tax rates, authorities should find alternative sources of budget replenishment. Therefore, emphatic concern for a fuller collection of existing taxes contained in the new edicts is fully legitimate. In particular, such a measure is specified by the mentioned edict on the abolition of quotas, which, at the same time, presupposes the complete elimination of privileges with respect to the payment of export duties (according to Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin, another edict on the complete elimination, in general, of all foreign economic privileges is already ready for signing). Two edicts at once--on ensuring a full payment of taxes into the budget and on measures to strengthen payment discipline--presuppose the toughening of control over tax collection. Generally speaking, such measures do not contradict the idea of tax stimulation of production. For example, in the United States in the 1980's the policy of tax rate cuts completely agreed with the exceptionally tough control over a prompt tax payment. Finally, the consolidation of extrabudgetary funds in the budget--to which, in particular, the edict on the inclusion of the federal road fund in the budget attests--is a fully expected measure. [Begin box] What Will the Abolition of Customs Privileges Give the Budget --Existing legislation exempts main exporters--oil and natural gas producers--from the payment of export duties. --The share of oil and natural gas in the value volume of Russian export outside the former USSR makes up 35.7 percent. --The abolition of customs privileges will enable the federal budget to obtain 2.5 billion dollars from the export of oil and gas in the form of customs duties in the second half of 1994. --If customs duties on the export of oil and gas (as the government plans) are reduced to one-half before 1 July, currency budget revenues will total 1.25 billion dollars. [End box] Despite the fact that the scheme embodied in edicts is quite logical, it remains no more than a symbolic redistribution of budget indicators on paper. It is characteristic that Mr. Livshits, discussing real prospects for changes in tax policy, confined himself to the significant word "we will see." It is clear that attempts to develop a new economic policy under conditions of the budget crisis will continue in the very near future, as long as, in particular, the problem of finding funds for expanded budget support for the military-industrial complex is not solved. The issue of special "defense" bonds is the most obvious way out here. Livshits tends precisely toward this option. He is confident that banks will buy these bonds willingly. Quotas, Licenses, and Privileges, But Not Special Exporters, Are Eliminated With his edict "On the Abolition of Quotas and Licenses for Deliveries of Goods and Services for Export" the president renews the liberalization of foreign economic activity. At the same time, the president's decision, despite the sufficiently long preparation, clearly stunned government structures with its radicality. In accordance with the presidential edict the existing system of quotas and licenses for the export of goods is abolished as of 1 July. An exception was made only for export deliveries carried out in accordance with Russia's international obligations. In addition to quotas and licenses, the government is ordered to abolish as of 1 July 1994 all privileges with regard to the imposition of export customs duties on exported goods. This measure does not concern privileges granted by the laws "On Customs Tariff," "On the Added-Value Tax," and "On Excises," as well as by the Customs Code. According to the version of authors of the presidential edict, all the privileges directly named in the mentioned laws are abolished. However, the law "On Customs Tariff" also gives grounds for a less revolutionary interpretation. It specifies that the government has the right to grant tariff privileges. Consequently, the pause in the labor biography of privileges, most probably, will not be long. Nor are there grounds for putting the equality sign between the abolition of export quotas and the demise of nontariff regulation of export as such. As is well known, in the government decree "On Measures for the Liberalization of Foreign Economic Activity" of 2 November 1993 special exporters received a strong safety net, of which they can fully take advantage now. The November decree added another list to the list of goods, for which quotas were established: A list of goods, the export of which was monopolized by special exporters. The second list, having absorbed the first, naturally, was not limited to it and was longer. Thus, the abolition of quotas only strengthens the positions of special exporters. The results of the meeting held by the board of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations yesterday, following the publication of the presidential edict, which abolished export quotas and licenses, fully confirm this conclusion. In particular, the development of the currency control system as applied to special exporters was examined. In this sphere the ministry continues to increase its own activity. It would seem that special exporters have been tamed strongly by the ministry for a long time. They "voluntarily" undertake to give the ministry information on the movement of currency funds. In addition, the ministry's attempt to outline the range of authorized banks allowed to service special exporters has received wide publicity. New proposals are being put forward now, confirming the forecast expressed by KOMMERSANT-DAILY yesterday. First, the ministry tries to increase the gap between the two mentioned supplements to the November government decree on the liberalization of foreign economic activity. The list of goods assigned to special exporters is to be expanded. It can include not only individual commodity items, but also types of operations; in particular, the export of customer-supplied raw materials. Second, barter operations with energy carriers and a barter with the remaining goods falling under quotas, which provides for the import of goods subject to excise, are to be prohibited as a category. Third, instead of the deceased quotas, there is to be a mandatory registration of export transactions involving goods formerly subject to quotas, without which export is impossible. Thus, the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations again aspires to the first role in the currency control system. The justification boils down to the fact that the version of control of the Central Bank of Russia-the State Tariff Committee does not ensure price control. This argument is not very impressive if we take into account that the law reserves to the customhouse the right to determine the customs value. In essence, however, the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations clearly seeks to take a departmental revenge and to become firmly established under new conditions. Although the innovations of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations received the support of Sergey Tsyplakov, director of the government's Department for Foreign Economic Relations, who was present at the meeting, observers consider their realization in a full volume improbable. The quota-abolishing edict should have also had a point concerning tariff regulation. As Vice-Premier Aleksandr Shokhin announced yesterday, it was expected that the edict, simultaneously with the abolition of privileges, would also reduce to one-half the rates of export tariff on raw-material goods. At the last stage, however, it was removed. Nevertheless, Mr. Shokhin believes that this decision will take place. And so, following the abolition of quotas exporters may also expect other pleasant surprises. State and Enterprises: New Relations The edict "On Some Questions of Tax Policy" points to a change in the relations between the state and enterprises. Previously, Russian authorities quite consistently denied the possibility of a significant reduction in the general level of taxes on enterprises, confining themselves to the granting of individual tax privileges. The new document, on the contrary, specifies the submission of proposals for a 10- to 20-percent reduction in the level of profit and value-added tax rates by the government to the State Duma before 15 September of this year. At the same time, the government is instructed to introduce the mechanism of accelerated depreciation of fixed capital in "high technology sectors" within a 2-month period. Such indulgences officially are attributed to the need to weaken the tax pressure on commodity producers. Moreover, the edict provides for the exemption of the profit tax payment during 2 years by enterprises, in whose charter fund foreign investments make up no less than 30 percent (and no less than 10 million dollars). However, whereas for now a significant reduction in tax rates for Russian enterprises is postponed until the fall, the toughening of control over tax payment is being introduced right now. In accordance with the edicts "On the Implementation of Overall Measures for a Prompt and Full Payment of Taxes and Other Obligatory Payments Into the Budget" and "On Additional Measures for the Normalization of Settlements and Strengthening of Payment Discipline in the National Economy" every enterprise can have only one current and budget account in banks. Banks do not have the right to open accounts for enterprises if they are not registered in tax bodies. If within 10 calendar days an enterprise does not have ruble funds in its account, tax bodies are granted the right to collect by nonadversary procedure arrears in taxes and other obligatory payments from current currency accounts of enterprises. For state enterprises the change in mutual relations with the state is not confined to taxes alone. The edict "On Reform of State Enterprises" provides for a complete suspension of the establishment of new federal state enterprises, that is, formally independent enterprises, to which state property is transferred for complete economic management. Part of existing state enterprises are liquidated and public plants, factories, and farms fully subordinate in their activity to the government are established on their basis. A use of allocated federal funds not according to the specific purpose, a lack of profit on the basis of results in the last 2 years, or a violation of the rules of use of state real estate (for example, its lease or sale) can be the basis for the transformation of state enterprises into public ones. According to the intention of the edict's drafters, the transformation of enterprises into public ones should hinder the uncontrolled receipt of credits and machination with state real estate. From comments on the edict given by Mr. Livshits it follows that he considers such a transformation of enterprises unusual punishment. However, real sentiments among representatives of enterprises, as Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin's recent meeting with them indicates, are somewhat different. They rather tend to view the acquisition of the status of a public enterprise as the reason to obtain access to such desired budget support. President Said "b," Not Uttering "a" The loud public response, which Boris Yeltsin's signing of six "economic" edicts received, somewhat overshadowed the fact that this package was published in truncated form. Two announced edicts--"On the Sale of State Debtor Enterprises" and "On the Regulation of Funds Assigned for Consumption"--did not come out from the presidential office. The first, perhaps the most important of all the documents scheduled for signing, should determine the government strategy with regard to the fate of bankrupt enterprises. However, right now it can be said that, for all practical purposes, national industrial giants have nothing to worry about. By yesterday the government has already formulated the slogan, under which the fight against unpromising production facilities will be waged. As First Vice-Premier Oleg Soskovets thinks, "the prevention of bankruptcies themselves, not a mass conduct of bankruptcy show trials, is the chief thing." There is logic in such a maxim: The prospects for facing thousands of simultaneously conducted trials (by today only 70 such cases, including against state enterprises, have passed through the Russian court system), dozens of millions of unemployed workers, and, above all, hundreds of idle directors can frighten not only the Russian Government. The document prepared by the Federal Administration for Cases of Insolvency under the State Committee on the Administration of State Property indicates that such prospects are more than real. The government decree published yesterday establishes a system of criteria, by which this department will be guided when declaring a state enterprise insolvent (it is also a matter of joint-stock companies, the share of the state in which is more than 25 percent). When only one criterion--the coefficient of current liquidity--was used, 601 production associations got on the black list. The total number of enterprises with more than 1,000 workers is about 1,200. It is remarkable that 36 percent of them are enterprises of the military-industrial complex a priori considered high technology ones. More generalized indicators show that from 78 to 90 percent of the machine building enterprises are insolvent. At the same time, the government realizes that it does not have real resources--primarily financial--for the "prevention of bankruptcy." According to Igor Shurchkov, chairman of the State Committee on Industrial Production, all bankruptcy prevention procedures can be carried out in full volume only at 100 enterprises. In this connection the attempt to somehow divide all insolvent enterprises seems fully justified. In this case the watershed is a 25-percent share of the state in an enterprise. In other words, it objectively becomes profitable for enterprises to invite the state as a partner. Only in this case can they hope for state assistance (true, determined by formally tough criteria). However, a literal execution of legislation on bankruptcies awaits others.
