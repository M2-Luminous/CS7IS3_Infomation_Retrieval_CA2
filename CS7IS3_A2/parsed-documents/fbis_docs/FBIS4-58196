In an effort to find out more about the Palestinian security arrangements in Gaza and Jericho, and the mission of the Palestinian police, AL-MAJALLAH conducted this interview with Major General Nasr Yusuf, chief of the Palestinian Police Force, who also took part in the negotiations with the Israelis. [AL-MAJALLAH] What are the security arrangements being adopted by the Palestine Liberation Organization in Gaza and Jericho after the signing of the agreement? [Yusuf] For our part, all measures and all preparations have been made for complete control of security conditions. There is a precise plan, already adopted, to fill the security vacuum that will occur in the regions as soon as the Israeli forces withdraw, and to prevent any chaos or tension. The Palestinian deployment forces have been instructed to carry out their duties immediately. All that remains is that we be permitted to enter the areas. This is at the core of the present dispute in the negotiations with the Israelis. [AL-MAJALLAH] How many Palestinian policemen have you and the Israelis agreed to deploy to undertake law and order duties in Gaza and Jericho? [Yusuf] That step is still the subject of dispute between us and the Israelis. The Israelis have not set the final number. Every time they agree with us on specific numbers, they back away from that commitment. For our part, we attach importance only to the numbers that will be agreed upon inside the negotiation chambers. [AL-MAJALLAH] Have the Palestinian security cadres responsible for intelligence and the protection of senior Palestinian commanders in Gaza and Jericho--such as President Yasir 'Arafat and his top aides--now actually been formed? [Yusuf] Yes. This matter was concluded finally, and all the special forces for these objectives have been assembled. The security forces working with intelligence have been appointed and equipped. Their mission, the areas of their deployment, the format for their cooperation with intelligence--domestically and abroad, with the Arab and European states cooperating with the Palestinian autonomous authority--have all been defined. The same is the case with the forces that will guard and protect senior PLO commanders, the officials of the Palestinian authority in Jericho, and all the members of civil defense forces, the central security forces, bodyguards, and others. The areas of their deployment have already been set out on maps, and the mode of cooperation among them has been defined as well. All that remains is for them to be permitted to enter the Gaza and Jericho areas to take over their total responsibility on the ground. [AL-MAJALLAH] What about the agreement on protecting crossing points? Is it true that Israel will have complete control, while the Palestinians will merely be permitted to monitor from a distance inside rooms of their own? [Yusuf] I don't think this is true. We will not consent to any such arrangements; we will have a permanent and effective presence. We will have many specialized tasks and duties, just like the Israelis, only more. In any case, we won't be able to say anything about this issue until after the final signature of the agreement and the natural conclusion of the matter through the actual deployment at the crossing points. [AL-MAJALLAH] What about the agreement on the weapons the Palestinian police will use? [Yusuf] This question is linked to the first one. The Israelis say they will be light arms. We are asking to use the arms and equipment that any police force in the world would use, in order to enforce law and order in the areas subject to Palestinian control. [AL-MAJALLAH] Why was the dispatch of the first contingent of the Palestinian police force to Gaza and Jericho cancelled? [Yusuf] The delay was not from our side, of course, but the Israelis are being asked about it. After we made all the preparations, at the last minute we were told of the postponement of the sending of the first batch, which should have preceded the greater number of police forces. The same is true of the team of Palestinian observers. [AL-MAJALLAH] What will be the nature of the security cooperation between you and the Israeli security forces deployed in Gaza and Jericho to protect the Israeli settlements? [Yusuf] There should be a supreme coordinating committee between the two sides to oversee this. But so far this committee has not been formed, and we have not been informed of the names of the Israeli participants. We are still waiting for a solution to major issues pending between us and the other side.
