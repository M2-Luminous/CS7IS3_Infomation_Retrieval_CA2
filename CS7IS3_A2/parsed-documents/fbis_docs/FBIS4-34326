This is why the reforms are made within our political system without being associated with any transformation, said Carlos Lage, executive secretary of the Cuban Council of Ministers, during an interview published today in the Spanish daily EL PAIS. Lage indicated that it is possible to improve the Cuban political system, however, not through elections in a multiparty system. The Cuban leader explained that the Caribbean nation is being flexible in its economic model and is willing to make the necessary changes, but not by moving toward capitalism, rather by consolidating an efficient socialist economy. When questioned about groups of Cubans who are in the Belgium and German embassies and the Chilean consulate here in Havana, Carlos Lage said that occupying a diplomatic mission is not the way to leave Cuba because the country grants permits to whoever requests them. Moreover, he reiterated that the sole solution to the conflict is for those people to leave the buildings they are occupying with the government's guarantee that there will be no reprisals against them.
