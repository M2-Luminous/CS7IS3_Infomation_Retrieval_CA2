In his speech, P.M. [Prime Minister] Kiet said: `This visit of yours is the first official one to our country ever in history by a head of government of Singapore. It takes place only five months after the visit to Singapore by Secretary-General Do Muoi and four months after the second visit to Vietnam by his excellency Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew. This clearly proves that our friendly and cooperative relationship has been incessantly growing in an broadening scope and with a deepening and intensifying nature. `It gives me great pleasure to note that, since my last visit to Singapore in October 1991, in line with the agreements and arrangements which have been concluded to form a foundation for the cooperation between our two countries, the volume of two-way trade and particularly the investment in Vietnam by Singapore have been increasing considerably. Singapore friends have shared with us development experience, particularly in the key area of infrastructure in which Singapore has proven strength and Vietnam is interested. We greatly appreciate your valuable ideas and suggestions, and assistance in training Vietnamese personnel in various fields through the Indochina Assistance Fund. I strongly believe that, your present visit and the signing of the avoidance of double taxation agreement will help further enhance the sound cooperation between our two countries for the sake of prosperity of our respective countries and of the region. `In the recent years, the global and regional situation has been changing greatly and profoundly. In the panorama of mixed colours, the striking feature is the shared desire by nations for a peaceful and secure environment for development, and the growing trend of regional cooperation. Against this overall context, the trend of peace, cooperation and development in our region is all the more highlighted. Nowadays, Southeast Asia is in the most favourable condition ever since the end of the Second World War to lay down a foundation for cooperation in the interest of durable peace and prosperity of the entire region. Besides most encouraging achievements as a result of the correct policy of `Doi Moi', in overcoming the socio-economic crisis, in developing the economy and maintaining political stability, Vietnam has recorded new successes in pursuing the foreign policy of independence, sovereignty and openness in the direction diversification and multilateralization. Our primary interest is to further expand and strengthen cooperation with the countries in the region, both bilaterally and multilaterally. We stand ready to be hand in hand with the Southeast Asian peoples to proceed towards a future of peace, independence, prosperity and development. `It is my firm conviction that your visit will not only strengthen further the relations of friendship and cooperation between our two countries, but also contribute to peace, cooperation and development in Southeast Asia. Prime Minister Kiet went on: `We are indeed very satisfied with the results of the exchanges of views we have had today. Mutual understanding and confidence between us have been enhanced, areas of cooperation broadened and promise brilliant prospect. Your visit will therefore certainly mark a new development in the Vietnam-Singapore cooperation'. In his turn, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said `Your excellency's visit to Singapore in October 1991 opened a new chapter in our bilateral relationship. Since then, our relations have strengthened rapidly, with several exchange visits of top leaders. The Indochina Assistance Fund has been used to fund technical assistance programmes for your country. Singapore has also established the infrastructure task force to help Vietnam in its development. We are pleased to share our development experience with you and to help Vietnam plan and build its infrastructure. `Singapore is now Vietnam's largest trading partner and eighth largest investor. The Singapore private sector has demonstrated its confidence in Vietnam through its increasing investments. I hope that my visit here will pave the way for more trade and Singapore investments in Vietnam'. P.M. Goh Chok Tong continued: `Vietnam now has some experience working with foreign investors. It has already achieved good economic growth rates in the last two years. You are blessed with abundant natural resources and a hardworking, intelligent workforce. If Vietnam presses on with its `Doi Moi' and makes foreign investors feel welcome, it can be another dynamic east Asian economy. `We welcome your accession to the treaty of amity and cooperation in Southeast Asia. Your foreign minister is now a regular participant at the annual ASEAN ministerial meetings. Vietnam is also one of the charter-members of the ASEAN regional forum [ARF], which will meet again soon to discuss regional political and security cooperation issues. We hope that through both ASEAN and the ARF, our relationship will not only broaden but also deepen. Together, we can work to safeguard Southeast Asia's security'.
