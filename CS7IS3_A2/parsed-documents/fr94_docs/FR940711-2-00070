Deadlines Applications shall be considered as meeting an announced deadline if they are either: 1. received on or before the deadline date at a place specified in the program announcement, or 2. sent on or before the deadline date and received by the granting agency in time for the independent review under DHHS GAM Chapter 1&hyph;62. (Applicants must be cautioned to request a legibly edited U.S. Postal Service postmark or to obtain a legibly dated receipt from a commercial carrier or U.S. Postal Service. Private Metered postmarks shall not be acceptable as proof of timely mailing.) Late applications: Applications which do not meet the criteria in paragraph A of this section are considered late applications. The granting agency shall notify each late applicant that its application will not be considered in the current competition. Extension of deadlines: The granting agency may extend the deadline for all applicants because of acts of God such as floods, hurricanes, etc., or when there is a widespread disruption of the mails. However, if the granting agency does not extend the deadline for all applicants, it may not waive or extend the deadline for any applicants. F. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, Public Law 96&hyph;511, the Department is required to submit to OMB for review and approval any reporting and record keeping requirements in regulations, including program announcements. This program announcement does not contain information collection requirements beyond those approved for ACF grant applications under OMB Control Number 0348&hyph;0043. G. Executive Order 12372_Notification Process This program is covered under Executive Order 12372, ``Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs,'' and 45 CFR Part 100, ``Intergovernmental Review of Department of Health and Human Services Programs and Activities.'' Under Executive Order 12372, States may design their own processes for reviewing and commenting on proposed Federal assistance under covered programs. All States and territories except Alabama, Alaska, Connecticut, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Virginia, Washington, American Samoa, and Palau have elected to participate in the Executive Order process and have established Single Points of Contact (SPOCs). Applicants from these 19 jurisdictions areas need not take action regarding Executive Order 12372. Applications for projects to be administered by Federally-recognized Indian Tribes are exempt from the requirements of Executive Order 12372. Otherwise, applicants should contact their SPOC as soon as possible to alert them to the prospective application and to receive any necessary instructions. Applicants must submit any required material to the SPOC as early as possible so that the program office can obtain and review SPOC comments as part of the award process. It is imperative that the applicant submit all required materials, if any, to the SPOC and indicate the date of this submittal (or date of contact if no submittal is required) on the SF 424, item 16a. SPOCs have 30 days from the application deadline date to comment on applications submitted under this announcement. We are requesting a shortened period for SPOC review. SPOCs are encouraged to eliminate the submission of routine endorsements as official recommendations. Additionally, SPOCs are requested to clearly differentiate between mere advisory comments and those official State process recommendations which they intend to trigger the ``accommodate or explain'' rule. When comments are submitted directly to ACF, they should be addressed to: Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families, Division of Discretionary Grants, 370 L'Enfant Promenade, S.W., 6th floor, Aerospace Building, Washington, D.C. 20447. ACF will notify the State of any application received which has no indication that the State process has had an opportunity for review. A list of SPOCs for each State and territory is included at Appendix A at the end of this announcement. H. Effective Date
