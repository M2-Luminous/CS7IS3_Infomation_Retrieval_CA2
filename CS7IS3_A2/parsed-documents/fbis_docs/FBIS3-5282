The government officials said the decision was made during a 50- minute meeting between Hosokawa and Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura at Hosokawa's official residence Saturday evening. The ministerial session follows a U.S. decision to reinstate the Super 301 trade retaliation provision against countries deemed to engage in unfair trade practices. U.S. President Bill Clinton took the action after Japan-U.S. talks for a new framework for bilateral trade broke down last month. The ministerial meeting is timed to coincide with a visit to Japan by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who arrives on Wednesday for talks the next day with Hosokawa and other government leaders on trade and other issues. The officials said the Japanese Government plans to work out market-opening measures by the end of March. Japan has been under pressure from the United States and Europe to open its markets to reduce its growing current account and trade surpluses. The officials said Hosokawa hopes to convey Japan's market- opening package to Christopher at their meeting Thursday.
