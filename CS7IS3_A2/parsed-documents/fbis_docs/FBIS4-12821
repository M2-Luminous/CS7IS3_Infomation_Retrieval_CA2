Speaker Nuri also assured the Pakistani legislators of Iran's unstinted support to the Kashmiris right of self-determination. In this regard he called for a peaceful and just solution of the problem in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolutions. 'Pakistan can rely on Iran's principled stance on Kashmir,' he is reported to have declared, perhaps clarifying Iranian position which came under fire after Tehran along with Beijing asked Islamabad to withdraw its resolution pertaining to Kashmiris' human rights violations, in Geneva. It did come as a shock to an average Pakistani that Tehran had played a role in this context and drew a reaction which could not be called favourable, to say the least. Speaker Nuri's assertion on Monday should set at rest fears in this country that Tehran, in an attempt to cosy up to New Delhi primarily for economic reasons, might proportionately have distanced itself from Islamabad. Iran has been Pakistan's friend for long and if certain reports are to be believed, during Shah's period, Islamabad's primary source of information on Israel. Diplomacy is a dicey game and involves juxtaposing conflicting configuration of forces. Amidst everything, principles notwithstanding, the national interest reigns supreme. The kinds of pressures a country has to put up with in fine-tuning a policy often remains hidden from public view. Speaker Nuri was evidently voicing his country's policy when he castigated human rights violations in Indian-occupied Kashmir. Together, there is much that the two countries can achieve. Iran could benefit from Pakistan in the field of civil engineering and conversely, Pakistan could do with the Iranian expertise in setting up oil refineries. As founder members of the Regional Cooperation for Development (RCD), renamed ECO (Economic Cooperation Organisation), there are many areas in which the two countries can tap each other's potential. It is perhaps time that we recast our approach to diplomatic relations, purging it of the sentimentality one would normally attach to personal relations.
