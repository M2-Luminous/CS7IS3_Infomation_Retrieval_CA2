According to a senior official of the coalition parties, the original plan was to have only five economic ministers -- such as the finance minister, minister of international trade and industry, and labor minister -- participate in it in addition to the prime minister, but the organization turned into one of pancabinet members at the strong request of the prime minister. But people at the Labor Ministry are not necessarily happy about this. They are in fact cold about it and say: "That headquarters has been created for reasons of publicity. No concrete results can be expected from it." It was on 27 December that the coalition made a formal request to the prime minister concerning the establishment of the headquarters. Labor Ministry officials, however, on the same day were already telling coalition officials: "The Labor Ministry will lead it. Please scrap the plan to make the prime minister its head." Apparently, the establishment of the emergency measure headquarters displeased the labor bureaucrats who believe that "unemployment issues belong only to the Labor Ministry." Of course, the ministry is proud of itself. An official of the ministry's Employment Security Bureau said, "We think that we are doing everything that anyone could think of." The comprehensive unemployment countermeasures under the Total Program To Support Employment announced by the Labor Ministry in December are worth 326 billion yen in budgetary terms. Tetsuya Sakamoto, director of the ministry's Employment Policy Division, said, "That is about three times the size of the employment program implemented at the time of the high-yen-caused recession." The Labor Ministry for a long time has "upheld the high employment rate" as the employment security administration's royal banner. A typical example is the action taken to establish employment subsidies in 1985 -- shortly after the first [as published] oil crisis. It was a system aimed at assisting companies which had trouble continuing employment for their workers because the firms' production had fallen. Under the system, the government paid part of the cost of keeping employees on house leave (waiting at home), to provide job training, or to reassign employees to different areas. Its purpose was to prevent the companies from firing their employees or from encouraging them to resign, and the ministry has used this as a trump card to ride out unemployment problems during recessions. Rising Criticism of the Subsidies But now there are large amounts of criticism of the subsidies which insist that the subsidies are "pressuring companies into maintaining employment and thus are hurting the liquidity of labor. This system is becoming untenable for the mature Japanese economy." The plan for expanded employment assistance subsidies contained in the Total Program To Support Employment envisages raising the wage subsidies for those in job training from the current 75 percent to 80 percent [of wages received]. This is an unprecedentedly high rate. Some within the ministry complained, "The government's paying 80 percent of the pay makes the employees almost public servants. Is it necessary to go that far?" More recently, critical voices are conspicuous about the past labor administration policy of emphasizing only employment security. As for employment subsidies, some economists went so far as to declare that they "impede Japan's efforts to improve its economic structure." The rationale for the criticism is that while the industrial structure needs to be converted and improved without delay in preparation for the upcoming deregulation and market liberalization, the labor sector, which will form the basis for the structure, is not changing at all. The Labor Ministry by all means wants to adhere to its slogan of "job security," and it is desperately resisting any attempt to make it change that policy. [passage omitted on examples of the ministry's policy] Inability To Come Up With an Aggressive Concept In mentioning the Labor Ministry's reason for being negative about increasing employment liquidity, Noriomi Soya, director of the ministry's Secretariat, said, "We cannot yet see any specific evidence of new industries emerging which will create jobs." What he meant was that even though many people think that deregulation will create new businesses in the fields of communications, the environment, and social welfare, evidence of this possibility has not yet even started to appear. Thus, the ministry cannot agree to increased liquidity in jobs. This cautious stand by the Labor Ministry led Teruto Emoto, chairman of the Confederation of Japan Automobile Workers Unions, to say: "These people cannot escape their turf consciousness of the past. Many of the policies they come up with are ex post facto in nature." Labor Minister Chikara Sakaguchi himself complained: "Why can't the ministry come up with a daring vision on industrial employment before other people ask for it? The ministry is lacking in aggressive ideas." [passage omitted explaining the ministry's passivity] While criticism of the bureaucrats is growing, the Labor Ministry is being asked to restructure itself as well.
