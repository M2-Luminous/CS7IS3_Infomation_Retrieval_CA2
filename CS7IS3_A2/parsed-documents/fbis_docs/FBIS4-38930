Yusifov noted that the program in question provided for the conversion to joint-stock operation of large industrial facilities as well. The Ministry of Finance chief emphasized that he considers it necessary to privatize any unprofitable enterprise in any sector of industry, with the exception of those the state must control. To the question as to whether or not the major oil refineries of Baku were on the list of enterprises subject to privatization, F. Yusifov responded negatively, but added that it was entirely possible to do so. He also explained that the future law would permit changing the production structure of facilities converted to joint-stock operation, and that no obstacles to this were envisaged.
