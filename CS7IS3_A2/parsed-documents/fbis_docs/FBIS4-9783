During a news conference a few hours before his departure, Mushota described his visit as very positive and stressed that his meetings resulted in a mutual understanding on essential principles concerning health, education, the development of the sugar industry, sports, and international relations. The accords reached in these areas will be completed when Zambia's president visits Cuba. [Begin recording of Mushota, in English with passage-by-passage translation into Spanish] What I can tell you as result of our visit is that Zambia and Cuba have agreed, in principle, that by the time Zambia's president visits Cuba, we should be in a position to sign an agreement for developing the sugar industry and its by-products in Zambia, with Cuba providing technical assistance and Zambia financing all the operations. The details of this agreement will be made public when Zambia's president visits Cuba. That is my delegation's success story.

Zambia will also receive Cuban assistance in getting ready for the African games and future Olympic games.
