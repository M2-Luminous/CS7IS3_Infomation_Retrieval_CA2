[Fujimori] I have. [Amoretti] What is your opinion of him? [Fujimori] First of all he is a good communicator. He is an eloquent president who always raises original ideas at international forums. [Amoretti] Are you on good terms with him? [Fujimori] Yes. I would say communication with Lacalle is good. We talked at several international meetings, and on several occasions he called me from Montevideo. [Amoretti] And with Enrique Iglesias? [Fujimori] We have excellent relations. He was among the first who supported us, and even today he is one of the few who has always been on our side. We have a lot for which to thank him. [Amoretti] You ran in the 1990 elections as the leader of Change 90, a political group that no one thought would have good chances of winning the presidency. The victory of writer Mario Vargas Llosa, the leader of Fredemo [Democratic Front], was taken for granted all over the world, and also in Peru. Did you actually expect to win the elections? [Fujimori] Right, very few people thought I had good chances of reaching the presidency. To tell you the truth, only four people and I were expecting a victory. [Amoretti] And why do you think you won? Why did people choose an unknown person instead of a famous writer or the old APRA [American Popular Revolutionary Alliance]? [Fujimori] First of all, because of the people being fed up with the Peruvian political system. People were tired of a system that offered no solutions. Peru lived in democracy, but what did people get from that? Second, I believe people realized that we were proposing a government without any links whatsoever with the major political and economic interests that were binding Peru. The other candidates, however, clearly represented continuism, after 500 years of failure. [Amoretti] Did Vargas Llosa represent that continuism? [Fujimori] Perhaps he did; perhaps he didn't. But that is not the only reason why Vargas Llosa lost and we won. He represented the elite of Peruvian society, and this drove him away from the masses. That is why we won. [Amoretti] Vargas Llosa recently has criticized you and your government very harshly. What is your opinion of him? [Fujimori] I'd rather not give an opinion on Vargas Llosa because I believe his political opinions do not merit consideration. Like everyone else, however, I believe he is a good writer. [Amoretti] You like him as a writer, but not as a politician. [Fujimori] Right. (laughter) [Amoretti] You won the runoff election in 1990 and replaced APRA leader Alan Garcia. How was the country when you assumed power? [Fujimori] It was a disaster. The worst disaster I saw in the history of my country. As an example, I remind you that Peru had the world's highest inflation rate, it was isolated from all international financial organizations, it could get no credit, it was full of debts, and its economy was in true chaos. As if all that were not enough, terrorists were ruling all corners of the country. When I took over, there was no solution in sight for terrorism. Summarizing, I received a country in a state of disaster and with no solution in sight. [Amoretti] Do you think Alan Garcia's administration is the only one to blame for this "state of disaster"? [Fujimori] No, his administration is not the only one to blame. Peru's problem has been dragging on 500 years. These 500 years weigh heavily on our shoulders and have plunged us into this situation. [Amoretti] What is your evaluation of your predecessor's administration? While Vargas Llosa has been hard on you, one should acknowledge that you have not been any easier on Alan Garcia and his administration. [Fujimori] Look here, I think that Alan Garcia and his administration managed the economy to suit their personal interests and the economic circumstances prevalent at that time. Peru was isolated; it embarked on projects that were not the most cost-effective ones. Certain industrial sectors were strongly protected just to favor them. Governmental and legal instruments were used to benefit people close to the government. There was very little serious economic management in which national interests were not the government's overriding concern. [Amoretti] The Peruvian Congress currently is studying charges of bribery made against Alan Garcia and his party. They had allegedly accepted bribes from the Italian Government to build an electric train in Peru. According to the latest public opinion polls, more than 60 percent of Lima residents believe Garcia is guilty. Do you feel that the charges against the former president are serious? [Fujimori] I could not make a categorical statement on an issue under investigation. But the source that contends that the former president is implicated in bribery is precisely from Italy, where the case is already under investigation. This goes to prove that at least there is no manipulation of the case at the domestic level. [Amoretti] Following Alan Garcia's administration, the APRA was soundly defeated in 1990. At present it comes in last in all public opinion surveys conducted in Peru. Do you think the APRA is mortally wounded? [Fujimori] I think it does not stand a chance of coming to power with the current leaders it has. Nevertheless, I cannot overlook the fact that there are many card-carrying APRA members who still believe in the guidelines and teachings of their party founder, Victor Raul Haya de la Torre. These people cherish the hope that their party will change direction and find its course again. Meanwhile, the majority of its members is supporting the government. They are supporting my government. [Amoretti] Is that what the surveys that you handle show? [Fujimori] No, that is what the people in the Peruvian mountain range, forest, indeed in all of Peru, say. [Amoretti] You say that the people who follow Haya de la Torre's principles currently are aligned with your government. What do you think of Haya de la Torre? [Fujimori] I think he is a person who made history. He was important, a good counterbalance for the politicians who at the time were not very honest. I think he was a very honest politician. [Amoretti] You came to government in 1990 and, according to your own words, you received the country in a "state of disaster." When did you begin to think of the possibility of dissolving Congress? When did you begin to see that that would be the solution to the crisis? [Fujimori] I never revealed that, but to be sincere it was a process, an evolution. I realized the problem was not only Congress but the whole Peruvian political system. It was the whole political system that was not working as it should. [Amoretti] ... and Congress represented that political system that did not work. [Fujimori] Of course. I also began to see that the Judicial Branch did not work as it should and something had to be done so justice would fulfill its duties. I began understanding that. I realized that here we either defeat violence and establish order, or the country would crumble amid the "democracy" we were living in. [Amoretti] What was the determining factor that led you to take that step? [Fujimori] I had two options. One was to administer the violence and economic crisis, to carry on as best as possible, and leave government in 1995 as a democratic president. But the people did not elect me for that. Politicians must solve problems. That is why I took the other option. [Amoretti] Uruguayan President Juan Maria Bordaberry made a reasoning similar to yours in the 70's. He dissolved Congress and continued governing with the Armed Forces' support. Did you know anything about the Uruguayan experience when you decided to temporarily dissolve the Peruvian Congress? [Fujimori] I knew something about what happened in Uruguay, although not in depth. Anyway, I think there has been a great difference between the two processes since the administrative act. In Peru the process is being carried out by the people through the president of the Republic, who is not subject to military power. From what I know, that was not the case with Bordaberry. That is the difference. I am in command here. [Amoretti] Is the president still in charge here? [Fujimori] Of course; it is notoriously so. [Amoretti] Aren't there some military officers who demand old shares of power they enjoyed in the past? [Fujimori] There are some military officers who want to recover the power they once had over the political system. They are demanding the share they once had and no longer control. When General Salinas and his group attempted to overthrow me, they did so because they did not accept the political power over the military power. [Amoretti] Do the military officers who think in this manner represent a considerable group within the Peruvian Armed Forces? [Fujimori] There are 100,000 men in the Peruvian Armed Forces. There is place for all kinds of ideas among 100,000 men. But that is not the main issue. The main issue is that here there is a hierarchy and a command that are very strong and that they will have to respect. [Amoretti] I would like to return to the subject on your decision to temporarily dissolve Congress. Was it difficult for you, a president elected by the people, to make a decision of this kind? What internal conflicts does a president have when he makes a decision of this kind? [Fujimori] I did not have any kind of internal conflicts before making the decision. I was absolutely convinced of what I was doing. [Amoretti] Sometimes people wonder with whom the president consults before making a decision of this kind. In your case, who did you speak with? [Fujimori] In my case, I only consulted my conscience. I have documents that can prove my internal evolution of what I was doing until I reached that drastic decision. I made the decision on my own, and a few hours later I phoned a few people to inform them of my determination and the contents of the decrees I would release. [Amoretti] Didn't you consult the military chiefs? [Fujimori] A few hours before publicly announcing my decision I spoke with all the commanders. I simply gave them clear instructions. [Amoretti] Didn't you even consult or discuss the measure with some of the members of your family? [Fujimori] No. I did not speak with any member of my family. Nobody, nobody at all knew about my decision. The irrefutable evidence is that nobody knew about it and that it did not leak out. (laughter) [Amoretti] We just tried to point out similarities between the Uruguayan and Peruvian processes. Not long ago, Bordaberry said in an interview with EL OBSERVADOR that at the moment one decides to dissolve Congress, one is alone. Did you feel this way? [Fujimori] I did not feel alone. I felt broad support, and that was proven afterward in the streets. My decision was backed by the people. [Amoretti] Weren't the words "dictator" and "coupist," which were used afterward in many parts of the world to refer to you, resounding in your head? [Fujimori] I know what you mean. But I am not interested in adjectives. I am only interested in solutions. And the events speak in my favor. We currently have a much more efficient democracy; Congress is working; the Peruvian people have work and can travel happily and calmly anywhere because the threat of terrorism is being controlled. The country is beginning to rise up again. Adjectives are not important. [Amoretti] Some people maintain that "traditional liberal democracy" lacks enough authority to impose itself over violence. Do you think the weaknesses of that "traditional liberal democracy" are the ones that nourished the appearance and increase of terrorism in Peru? [Fujimori] But there was no democracy in Peru before 5 April 1992, because if there had been democracy there would have not been terrorism and the injustices that took place would have not happened. That is the evidence that democracy did not work. Simply because that was not a democracy. If a democratic system leads to terrorism, misery, injustice, and corruption, that system cannot be called democracy. [Amoretti] By what I see, a system is "democratic" for you as long as some human rights are respected, like the right to work, to private property, to life, to happiness, etc. [Fujimori] When I speak of human rights I speak not only of the human rights of the terrorists, because that was the trend in the last 12 years. Instead I am speaking of the human rights of 22 million Peruvians. The principle of respect for the human being must not make us forget that the social and human rights of the majority of the population must not be violated. Therefore, one must not be afraid to place human rights at risk in order to defeat terrorism. My government has the decisiveness and will to fight terrorism, but respecting human rights. I said: "Total respect for human rights," but first come the human rights of 22 million Peruvians. If someone violated human rights here it is the Shining Path, and I have done everything to defend the human rights of all the Peruvian people. You can tour not only the interior, but the outskirts of Lima and ask the people: "Where is your right to education, to an honorable life? Those rights cannot be seen and have not been seen for many years. We must now try to conquer those human rights for ourselves." [Amoretti] When you launched the offensive against the Shining Path and the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement [MRTA], very few people believed you could win that war. When the Armed Forces captured [top Shining Path leader] Abimael Guzman and other members of the Shining Path's leadership, everybody thought victory already had been won. Do you feel victory already has been won in this war? [Fujimori] Much remains to be done. We still must wipe out the last pockets of terrorism in Peru. You may rest assured that I am going to mop up or exterminate terrorists. I have set some goals for myself and I must confess that I have achieved them. I intended to mop up MRTA during 1993, and it had practically disappeared by the end of last year. There are only two leaders at large, but I am quite sure that sooner or later I am going to capture them. Meanwhile, with regard to the Shining Path, they have surrendered for all practical purposes, and this has brought about massive desertion. I hope the Shining Path will have been routed by 1995. [Amoretti] What role do you assign to the Peruvian Armed Forces in that war? [Fujimori] Well, the Peruvian Army is a victorious force. When I ascended to the presidency, I found that the Army's morale had been totally undermined, it lacked motivation, it was disoriented, on the defensive, and nearly defeated. The military had retreated to its barracks. Now things are different -- this is a new Army. People have changed their opinion about the Army. [Amoretti] Owing to the fight against guerrillas? [Fujimori] Not only on account of that, but also because the Army is driving tractors; it is collaborating with the population, opening roads and highways, repairing homes and schools razed by terrorists; it is engaged in community service. The Peruvian Army not only serves to combat violence, it also has been raised for times of peace. [Amoretti] Terrorism has left in its wake thousands of orphans who lack family values and the basic necessities of life. This is especially true in some regions of the country. What do you feel every time a citizen asks you to meet one of these children during your frequent trips to the interior? [Fujimori] It makes me feel indignant and sets me pondering about those children's human rights. Who ever spares a thought for children's human rights? [Amoretti] Do you still believe in the death penalty for terrorists? [Fujimori] Yes, I do. I think capital punishment ought to be meted out to those who murder others without a motive. [Amoretti] Isn't that, in a way, a return to the principle of "an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth"? [Fujimori] No, I do not think so. I am in favor of the death penalty for top leaders. Were a new Abimael Guzman to emerge as leader he would have to be eliminated at once. [Amoretti] Since you dissolved Congress, several international organizations have criticized you for making that decision. Much of the criticism has come from the United States, where economic aid to Peru has been time and again blocked because it is considered there that there is no unrestricted respect for human rights in your country. Would you admit to charges that excesses have been committed in the war against terrorism? [Fujimori] Yes, I admit to that. There have been isolated cases of excesses. Human rights are always violated in a war against terrorism. The war has been waged here with a great deal of intelligence and, naturally, with force. There have been isolated cases because human rights violations had preceded this war. The Army used to act in a certain way, and we can see that it continued to mechanically follow the same behavior in some isolated cases. [Amoretti] Well, are human rights being respected now? [Fujimori] There is unrestricted respect for human rights. [Amoretti] Then how would you justify a statement made by Alexander Watson -- a U.S. Government representative who came to Peru to inspect the progress made in human rights -- to the effect that although some progress has been made, much remains to be improved? [Fujimori] Look, Peru has been the target of disproportionate criticism. It has not been taken into account that terrorism has claimed the lives of 25,000 people in Peru. After hearing this figure, one may wonder: What would have happened in the United States had anyone killed 250,000 people? Would the U.S. Government have allowed the death of 250,000 people? [figures as published] Certainly not. It would have certainly adopted special measures. [Amoretti] Do you believe the United States is being unfair to Peru on the subject of human rights? [Fujimori] Human rights have been violated everywhere in the world in the fight against terrorism. These violations have not been limited to isolated cases, but rather have been systematic. Human rights also have been violated through the bombing of entire cities. [Amoretti] Your latest remark seems to be alluding directly to the U.S. policy of military intervention in the world. [Fujimori] What about the bombing of the Russian Parliament? How could a parliament building have been bombed? What would they have said had this happened in Peru? What about U.S. intervention in Vietnam, Iraq, and in many other places, shouldn't these actions be regarded as human rights violations? Look how damaging those wars were. [Amoretti] You are saying that the United States has a double standard for judging, for instance, what Washington does and what Peru does. [Fujimori] That is undoubtedly correct. [Amoretti] Today you visited the southern part of the country, which is the birthplace and stronghold of the Shining Path. Did you ask the U.S. representative to join you for this visit? [Fujimori] I did. I thought it would be useful for him, if he is going to report on human rights, to speak with many people whose rights have been violated by terrorists. Unfortunately, Mr. Watson preferred to stay in Lima and write his report from behind a desk. My government has a different approach: We deal with problems where they happen. [Amoretti] Have you received the support of presidents or representatives of international organizations? [Fujimori] I have. I keep receiving expressions of support out of recognition for what we have achieved here. I am sure that other peoples recognize our achievements in this area. What people of Latin America would have accepted a situation like that existing in Peru? What people of Latin America would reject a government that has eradicated terrorism in less than a year and a half? I feel supported. Which government of the United States, France, or Great Britain has fought terrorism as effectively as we have done here? Peru was like a Latin American Cambodia! That situation was overcome in less than one and a half years without major social costs. This is why I say that the U.S. criticism is disproportionate. [Amoretti] Today you emphasized that when you took over, the Peruvian economy was chaotic. What is the current situation? [Fujimori] It is recomposed and it is being put on a healthier footing. We have difficulties. We were at a critical point last year, but we immediately began to grow. We have not yet reached the levels of 1990, but from now on there will be steady growth. [Amoretti] How is the country doing from a macroeconomic point of view? [Fujimori] I think it is doing well. Inflation has been put under control and we expect it to remain below 25 percent in 1994. Foreign investment is growing, and the public deficit has become manageable. In this field we are doing well. [Amoretti] Those who know Peru are aware that there is no consolidated entrepreneurial spirit in the country. In this regard, a whole retrofitting process should be implemented in order to develop a pure liberal model. [Fujimori] We have drastically implemented industrial retrofitting, eliminating overprotection of vast sectors of the economy. Now everyone is compelled to invest more, risk more, and produce more and better. He who does not understand this has no future in the new Peru. [Amoretti] And what about banking and finance? [Fujimori] I would say this sector has not yet fully adapted itself to this process. But I am sure that the arrival of the international banking system in Peru will adjust the whole process. I hope the international banking system will in the short term arrive through privatization of various banks that are now being run by the state. [Amoretti] You say that the economy, even if gradually, has improved and the country is well from a macroeconomic point of view. But how is the current life of the average Peruvian? [Fujimori] Tight. People do have shortages, which does not mean that Peru has the type of poverty of some African or Asian countries. But people do live tightly. There is recession and growth, but the important thing is that the economy is now on the right course. [Amoretti] In recent years, there have been several successful economic experiences in South America, like that of Chile and then Bolivia and Argentina. Meanwhile, the Mexican process is to the north. What are the economic models in the region in which you are interested? [Fujimori] Look, I reiterate that the model we are implementing here is totally Peruvian. This is not a whim because when we took over we found some major problems that the economies you are mentioning did not have to confront. Here we worked and we will continue to work with pragmatism. [Amoretti] Shortly after you took over, you set in motion a vast program of deregulation and reduction of the state. Peru has privatized and continues to privatize many state companies. Do you know that in a referendum in Uruguay, 72 percent of the population voted against the privatization program of President Luis Alberto Lacalle's government? [Fujimori] I do. [Amoretti] And why would you tell the 72 percent of Uruguayans who voted against privatization that the right course is to privatize public enterprises? [Fujimori] I would tell them that the state apparatus should be as efficient as possible. At the present time the state cannot be a charitable organization that subsidizes jobs. We made a drastic reduction of the state here in Peru, and today our state is much more efficient. And to the people who lost their public jobs, we encouraged them to build their future in the private sector. And if we talk about public enterprises, you'll be surprised to know that Peru had an annual deficit of $2.5 billion. It was difficult to reduce this deficit. Very difficult. [Amoretti] At the beginning of your term, you said the majority of public enterprises could be run by the state. Why did you change your mind and decide to sell all public enterprises? [Fujimori] I changed my mind. I concluded that I had to sell everything because inefficiencies could not be corrected if they remained within the state. And I was not wrong because the enterprises that were privatized have increased their production, workers have kept their jobs, investment has grown, and their higher profits have yielded higher taxes. [Amoretti] What are the economic achievements you would like to attain in Peru? [Fujimori] I would like Peru to grow and overcome the backwardness of 500 years. [Amoretti] When a person like yourself leads a battle against terrorism, I would think that you are quite aware that you, yourself, may be an eventual target. Nevertheless, you continue to visit towns nationwide and you stop and talk to the people without much protection. Don't you fear an attempt on your life? [Fujimori] I fear for my children. I have and will continue to fear for their safety. Of course I have adopted some very specific precautions in this regard. I do not fear for my life. I am willing to take risks. I specifically go to those places where the Shining Path is present. I do not fear it. [Amoretti] What did you feel when TIME magazine named you "Man of the Year" in Latin America? [Fujimori] A great satisfaction, naturally. But if anyone has to take any credit it is the Peruvian people. This prize belongs to the people. It was the people who endured the burden of the measures that were implemented to push the country forward; therefore, it is their award. [Amoretti] The entire country is talking about the possibility that you may run for the next presidential term in 1995. Will you seek reelection? [Fujimori] I have not yet considered the issue. I continue to work and have no time to think about reelection yet. [Amoretti] When do you plan to make a decision in this regard? [Fujimori] I believe I will be making that decision and reporting it a few weeks before the registration deadline expires. Before the end of the year I will be deciding whether I will seek reelection or not. [Amoretti] Have you made any preliminary decisions yet? [Fujimori] (hesitates)... No, I have not. [Amoretti] Do you want to continue in government or are you tired? [Fujimori] I do not feel tired. Every time I talk with the people I feel more encouraged. I am not an office person. [Amoretti] If you decide to seek reelection, what political scenario do you foresee in 1995? [Fujimori] I believe that all the other political forces will form a coalition in 1995. Everyone against me. I am sure about that. (laughter) [Amoretti] If you run, that is... (laughter) [Fujimori] If I run... (laughter). [Amoretti] Today's world is managed on the basis of large economic blocs. Peru is a member of the Andean Pact, but it is also opening its economy to be able to join other pacts, such as NAFTA, comprising the United States, Mexico, and Canada; or Mercosur [Common Market of the South]. What will be Peru's short- and long-term position regarding these two blocs? [Fujimori] Peru is preparing itself to achieve an integration of this nature. We have eliminated almost all trade barriers and those still in force are to be eliminated. [Amoretti] Do you reject the idea of requesting your country's membership in NAFTA or Mercosur? [Fujimori] No. This is something we have been considering and for which we have been preparing ourselves. Peru is betting on integration. [Amoretti] Which one, Mercosur or NAFTA? [Fujimori] Time will tell which one we will join. As a government leader I will have to assess my country's interests, and particularly Latin American interests. We will make our decision on that basis.
