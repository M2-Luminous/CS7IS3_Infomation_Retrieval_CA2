Stolen high-speed powerboats are being used to transport drugs into Britain from offshore rendezvous. Police and marine loss adjusters also have evidence that stolen boats have been sent in containers to the Caribbean as a new method of "laundering" payment for drug consignments to this country. Thefts are not confined to coastal waters. One of the worst-hit areas is the Midlands, where boats and trailers are stolen from drives on suburban housing estates. Modern manufacturing techniques, in which fibreglass hulls are stamped out by the thousand, have brought recreational boating within the range of lower middle-class man. They have also made it very hard to identify stolen craft because so many look identical and registration is not compulsory. "Looking at rows of these boats lined up at marinas is like looking at a car park full of Ford Escorts," said one theft investigator. "They all look exactly the same. But whereas all the Escorts would be on the DVLC computer in Swansea, the boats may have little or no means of identification." As boat builders at Earls Court report new confidence in a reviving market, an expert in marine loss adjustment estimated that around 2,500 boats, worth an estimated £20 million, are stolen each year in Britain, and the figure is rising. Peter Clarke, head of C-Claims, leading investigators into small craft losses, said: "It is a steadily worsening trend. Every year sees an increase in the number of thefts. In the summer on any one day about 20 boats will be stolen around the country.'' "My experience over 20 years in this business is that the level of crime rises during a recession and levels out when recovery comes--but it never falls." Mr Clarke fears that increased links between boat thieves and drug traffickers could see an increasing element of violence attached to theft. In the Caribbean, families aboard expensive boats have been hijacked, thrown overboard and left to drown. "Substantial yachts costing £200,000 or more have been stolen and used for drug running," he said. "We came across a scam where containers stuffed with stolen speedboats, jet skis and four-wheel drive vehicles were to be despatched to Caribbean islands. There is no doubt this was meant as direct payment for drugs." Peter Cranstone, runs the Personal Watercraft Association, which represents the one-man craft better known as jet skis--the brand name for the Kawasaki model. These craft, because of their small size and popularity, have become a major target for organised crime. "They were being stolen and used to pay for drug consignments--a new way of laundering payments," he explained. But, thanks to an agreement with four of the biggest manufacturers, all new craft now carry two or three hidden electronic tags--transponders--which react to electronic scanners. According to Mr Cranstone the hidden transponders are already proving a deterrent. [passage omitted]
