The most recent figures come from the Interunion Department for Statistics and Socioeconomic Studies (DIEESE), which calculated that last year there was a 16.98 percent increase in the number of strikes in comparison with 1992, which results in an average of 60.83 stoppages a month involving about 432,800 strikers. "The successive declines that occurred in the unemployment rate in Brazil starting in May, and an upward trend in a wide variety of economic indicators made workers feel more secure and more willing to demand their rights," said Eduardo Matosinho, technical coordinator of DIEESE. In his view, workers were more worried about losing their jobs in 1992 and so avoided participating in strikes. According to DIEESE, in 1992 there was an average of 52 walkouts a month, involving 234,900 strikers.

For calculation purposes, a work day is considered to be eight hours for all categories. Matosinho said the public sector was the main arena for work stoppages and was responsible for the 84.22 percent increase in the average number of strikers last year, compared with the previous year. In May, we had the federal civil servant strike. Then in August, the Minas Gerais state employees struck, as did teachers in Sao Paulo State. This past December, the number of strikes fell by 3.70 percent and the number of strikers by 74.71 percent, if compared with the same month of the previous year. In all, there were 52 work stoppages involving 12,300 strikers, compared with the 54 strikes and 234,900 workers who walked out in December 1992. December, according to the technical director, is an atypical month because most of the strikes were organized to protest nonpayment of wages and worker entitlements. "In 1992, the recession was worse and more companies had trouble paying their employees the required `13th month' salary. Last year, however, the strikes were organized by companies and demanded payment of a `14th month.'" Matosinho thinks the number of strikes this year will probably be about the same as in 1993. "We will never see levels as high as in 1989 and 1990," he said. According to DIEESE figures, there was an average of 183 work stoppages a month in 1989, which dropped to 163 the following year.
