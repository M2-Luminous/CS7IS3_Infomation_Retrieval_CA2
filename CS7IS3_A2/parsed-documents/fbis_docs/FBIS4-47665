They hope for a repetition of the situation in 1990, when the same lies were used and gave France a pretext to come to their rescue. Sindikubwabo and his friends should know that we are no longer in 1990. We are now in 1994, when lies and pretexts are no longer reasons, nor are they easily accepted, since the Rwandan issue is already known. There is no need to try to regionalize the problem -- that is not the disease from which our country is suffering.
