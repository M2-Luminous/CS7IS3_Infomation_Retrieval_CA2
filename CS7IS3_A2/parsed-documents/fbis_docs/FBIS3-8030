Laszlo Papp, one of the five Hungarian participants in the meeting representing the local branch of the World Federation of Hungarians, told Hungarian Radio that President Clinton made it clear that his government continues to rely on their opinion, since it pays special attention to Eastern-Central Europe and the U.S. Government is clear about the interests of the region. Bill Clinton added that the two main American concerns when evaluating the various governments are the progress of privatization and the enforcement of democracy.
