The American President himself does not believe in what he presented to the Congress, because if Libya was like a threat, then America would not have been able to treat it in this inhuman way, but it seems that the American President is obliged to say this to Congress for several reasons: First: He himself is a victim of aggressive imperialist circles and because he is part of the their game and is under their pressure. Second: He thinks of America's regime as being dictatorial in accordance with the emergency law that allows the American President to rule in a completely dictatorial manner if America's interests abroad are threatened. This was the very pretext of Reagan when he wanted to shed the blood of Libyan children and when he wanted to rule America with absolute and autocratic rule for eight years -- this was in fact what he achieved. Third: Orders may have been issued from Tel Aviv to the White House to make the above statement, and this is the most probable. In all cases, the American President must prove this to the United Nations to whom Libya will necessarily have recourse for investigations into this serious accusation. Or is it congratulations from the American President to the Libyan people on the occasion of Ramadan? On a personal level, it might be a reply to the condolences that al-Qadhdhafi sent to him following the death of his mother, although most analysts believed that there was a typing mistake and the one intended was Japan and not Libya.
