According to estimations, the wheat crop could be at least at the level of 1993, with chances to top some six million tonnes, "which exceeds the domestic consumption needs," the Romanian minister said, referring to the "extremely good crops in Western Romania". Mentioning that the spring sowing programme has been fully completed, Minister Oancea considers that Romania can count finally on a cereal production of about 18 million tonnes. For the sugar beet crop, although sown on a smaller surface as initially foreseen, but however exceeding the past year's one by 50,000 hectares, during a normal agricultural year crops would actually cover the current domestic needs. As for the sunflower crop "it is looking very good, so we can count on a surplus of edible oil that could go on foreign markets," the minister said. Referring to the harvest campaign, Ioan Oancea said that the situation is extremely difficult, for agriculture is not equipped with enough farm machinery, for the necessary credits failed to be ensured for purchase of spares due to which repair works were delayed. To cover this deficit "we have in view cooperation actions with units in neighboring countries such as Hungary, Moldova, Bulgaria, that would provide services on a contract basis". According to Minister Oancea, priority in this period are the irrigation works. "At the beginning of this month, irrigation works were performed on less than 500,000 hectares," the minister said, as a result of indiscipline in administering farm equipment.
