The opposition members who had been angrily protesting Dunkel since yesterday agreed to listen to Commerce Minister Pranab Mukherji on condition that this issue will be discussed in the House with the prime minister present there. Mr. Pranab Mukherji said that the government had concluded after a lot of thinking that India will benefit more by the Uruguay agreement that will increase international trade. He said that India's export may increase by $1.5-$2 billion. Mr. Mukherji informed the House that the Uruguay talks were finished the night before. At the same time, agreement were made on intellectual property related to trade in the areas of services and products, investment means, and general agreement over garments and agricultural products. These will be approved by the governments of 117 nations that are taking part in these talks. He said that the government had clarified several times in the Parliament that India supports multi-party trade which profits all the member nations. Mr. Mukherji said that the agreement has made it clear that only 10 percent of the total agricultural product can be given in agricultural subsidies, and this is more than the present subsidies. Mr. Mukherji said that the agreement has also clarified that the assistance to the urban and rural poor does not come under this system. Thus, our public distribution system will continue without any problem. The commerce minister also said that the government will provide amble protection to farmers and researchers in the area of seeds. He said that the agreement does not call for patenting natural genes and genetic process. He made it clear that the changes the government is making in patent laws in two years will have no such provision. Discussing ways for investment in business, Mr. Mukherji said that the government has the right to decide what kind of foreign investment it should allow in the country. Discussing the agreement over cloth trade, he said that we are not satisfied with the desire of the importing nations to keep the present system for the next 10 years and increasing the import quotas. Mr. Mukherji said some industrialized nations tried to change the clothes agreement against us during the past phase of the talks, however, we successfully defended our stand. These countries said that India was taking advantage of the open trade arrangement and was competitive in garment trade, but still had closed its own market. Mr. Mukherji explained that the permanent committee of the commerce ministry had thoroughly discussed the Dunkel draft and had recommended that India should try to protect its interests in the areas of agriculture and intellectual property, and should participate in multi-sided trade structure so that India is not left alone. The commerce minister said that instead of following another option, our participation in this agreement will help us benefit from the international market.
