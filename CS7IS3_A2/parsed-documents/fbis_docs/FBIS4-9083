Our reporter Mariya Tsankova obtained this information from unofficial sources before the end of today's session of the DPS Central Council. According to information from within the BSP [Bulgarian Socialist Party], the Socialists are calling for the replacement of Ministers Karabashev, Bikov, and Valentin Aleksandrov [of trade, industry and defense]; the New Alliance for Democracy reportedly wanted one of their number appointed foreign minister. At today's Central Council meeting, Kadir Kadir proposed Khristo Totev for deputy prime minister if there is a cabinet reshuffle. The DPS maintained its view on the need for a major government reshuffle, but declares that if the cabinet falls it will join in the lottery for distributing candidates for cabinet posts between the parliamentary political forces. According to BTA, DPS leader Ahmed Dogan said after his meeting with Lyuben Berov that the prime minister was in excellent health. Professor Berov has still not reached a final decision on possible cabinet changes. Everything is at the stage of taking soundings in the parliamentary groups, but by the end of the week he will probably have formed a clear idea on structural changes, Dogan said.
