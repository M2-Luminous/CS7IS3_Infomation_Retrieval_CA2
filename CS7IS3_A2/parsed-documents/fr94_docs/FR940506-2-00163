FR940506-2-00163 FR940506-2-00087 Should a project whose construction is not expected to start until after the attainment date be eligible? (E) Project-Level Review The project-level review will focus on implementation of the CMAQ program in the 10 States with the worst ozone and carbon monoxide pollution. These States receive the largest apportionments under the CMAQ program, almost two-thirds of each year's total. The States and their share of apportionments are: ␣ 1␣ 1Percent California 14.8 Texas 9.9 New Jersey 5.8 Ohio 4.4 Maryland 3.1 New York 10.5 Pennsylvania 6.0 Illinois 4.9 Massachusetts 4.1 Florida 3.0 n,s Total 66.5 If time permits, the projects funded under the CMAQ program in one State in FHWA Regions 7, 8 and 10 will also be reviewed. Each State will be visited by FHWA, FTA and EPA representatives to conduct interviews with Federal, State, and MPO officials and other interested parties. A sample of each State's projects will be examined in detail in light of the policy considerations above, the program guidance, and other factors as they arise. A representative sample will be developed in keeping with standard review and statistical procedures. Sources of information on the CMAQ program as a whole will also be consulted. Such sources will include the States' annual reports on CMAQ program obligations, DOT fiscal and management reporting data, and reports on the program from government and nongovernment agencies. To determine the CMAQ program's impact on greenhouse gases, information will be taken from the States' annual reports on funded projects and other sources, and background information on carbon dioxide emissions from transportation sources. (F) Expected Schedule Site visits to the States mentioned above will be conducted in the spring and early summer of 1994. A final report providing findings and recommendations will be released later in the year, with additions or changes to the program guidance to follow, as necessary. The report will be available from the FHWA Office of Environment and Planning hotline at (202) 366&hyph;2069. Issued on: May 2, 1994. Rodney E. Slater, Federal Highway Administrator. Gordon J. Linton, Federal Transit Administrator. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;10898 Filed 5&hyph;5&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;22&hyph;P
