He claimed that a "malaise" has troubled the relationship for several years ever since German unification and Bonn's formulation of new ambitions and cited former Foreign Minister Roland Dumas as saying that "it is a euphemism to say today that things are not going well between the two countries." This "malaise" and the disagreement between the two countries stemming from the Bundesbank's interest rate policy has given rise to a "vaguely poisonous" climate. As an example of the difficulties in the bilateral relationship, Dauvergne cited Germany's ambition to have more deputies in the European Parliament to account for its greater population after unification. While the initiative was not "shocking," he questioned the way in which Bonn "literally imposed" East German observers on the Parliament immediately after unification. He also cited another German ambition, now openly advocated by Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, of obtaining a permament seat on the UN Security Council. Dauvergne maintained that such moves demonstrate that the Germans now feel "more muscular" and "speak louder" in an international context. Dauvergne remarked that Paris has reacted negatively to the change in Germany's foreign policy style but is at a loss as to how to respond to Bonn's ambition to take a more assertive role in international affairs. He maintained Bonn is assuming the leadership in Europe because Paris has remained silent. According to Dauvergne, since the difficult Maastricht referendum, the French, across the political spectrum, seem to be "on the defensive" and incapable of playing their traditional role of "inventors" of Europe. While expressing skepticism about Germany's intentions, Dauvergne recommended taking steps to escape the encroaching "malaise" in Franco-German relations. He commented favorably on Dumas' call for a "new bilateral start at all levels." Dauvergne said that such a process could begin at the Franco-German summit at the end of May, although it does not appear to be on the agenda. According to German Foreign Minister Kinkel, the summit will discuss enlargement of the EU to include East European states. According to Dauvergne, while the Germans insist they have no intention of "killing Europe," it remains to be seen whether their behavior may not lead to this very result. EU Expansion Potentially `Disastrous' In an interview with Dauvergne, the chairman of the Senate Committee on Economic Affairs, Jean Francois-Poncet, expressed the opinion that expansion of the EU without first undertaking institutional reorganization might have "disastrous" consequences for Europe. Francois-Poncet maintained that the EU will be a 16-member organization functioning with a system designed for six, with few chances of meeting future challenges. Asked the reason for the "formidable pressure" applied by Germany on behalf of adding members, he said it should not be concluded that Germany has suddenly become anti-European but that, after unification, Bonn thinks that the EU no longer matches Europe's political and economic configuration. He also argued that Germans feel strongly that with the addition of Greece, Portugal, and Spain, the EU became "very Mediterranean," a consequence that the French had underestimated. To avoid "increasing paralysis," he expressed the hope that a "hard nucleus" of member countries will emerge within the EU, a subject that should be debated during the 1996 EU conference aimed at reviewing the European institutional system. Francois-Poncet also commented on relations between France and Germany. He suggested that following the German parliamentary elections and the French presidential elections a Franco-German seminar be held to prepare for the 1996 EU conference and to begin planning for a revision of the Franco-German treaty. Eurodeputy Criticizes German `Arrogance' A commentary by Catherine Pegard criticized Germany's lobbying effort in the European Parliament on behalf of EU membership for the Scandinavian countries and Austria. Claiming that the German efforts were "unprecedented," she wrote that the "entire panoply of persuasion" was used, from telephone calls to financial "blackmail." Certain deputies such as centrist Francois Froment-Meurice--"not a foe of enlargement"--were "frankly surprised." According to Pegard, Froment-Meurice said he had a bad reaction "when pressure reaches this level of arrogance" and warned that "our German friends--indeed, our German brothers--should not forge that arrogance may sometimes be their worst enemy." EU Structural Problems Viewed A commentary by Alain Duhamel criticized the proposal to add four new members to the EU at a time when, he maintained, the Franco-German duo seems to be "short of ideas" and "rather devoid of energy." He warned that an increase in the number of member countries should not result in "diminished collective energy." Complaining that EU executive power is becoming increasingly "anemic," he claimed that the rotating six-month presidency of the European Council is devalued by imbalances that increase with every enlargement of EU membership. He insisted that these structural obstacles should be removed before the arrival of four new members. The 1996 conference that will attempt to tackle these issues will be four years too late, Duhamel maintained, adding that by then the EU's best defenders "will be writing their memoirs and growing the roses of retirement."
