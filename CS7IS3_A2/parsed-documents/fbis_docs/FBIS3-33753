The Qatari foreign minister's confirmation that his country is discussing with Israel the construction of a gas pipeline has ended the controversy which had been going on for over a month with press reports about the project and denials by officials, a familiar state of affairs considering the development of the region and the current direct contacts with Israel in the context of the peace negotiations. The Qatari gas pipeline project is not the only one. Press reports have been talking about another Egyptian-Israeli project although that is a different case because Cairo has full diplomatic relations with Israel. It is clear that the Arab official inclination, deduced from officials' statements and interviews with them, is to hold exploratory talks on joint projects with Israel provided their implementation is made conditional on progress in the peace negotiations and on prior conclusion of political agreements. That is the correct way because it would be improper to offer free prizes while the peace negotiations were stumbling. As a matter of principle, there ought to be no reservations regarding ideas and issues of that kind, for as long as we accept the principle of negotiations for a comprehensive peace, it follows that there will in the future be full relations including trade, investment, tourism, and so on. But there are some apprehensions which should be discussed frankly. Peace and normal relations would not mean harmony of interests nor would they mean the disappearance of contradictions. Peace in the general sense means that the parties to the conflict agree not to resort to arms in the settlement of their differences. Realistically, nobody even expects full normal relations overnight because the element of trust requires time and requires dealing for some time. That is why international strategists do not expect a flow of relations between the Arabs and Israel immediately after peace is achieved. They expect the two sides to take their time in exploring one another. In the view of these strategists, joint projects could, if concluded at regional level, speed up the elimination of suspicion and distrust and create common interests, although what is required at the same time is that such process, if useful, should be within a framework that would give priority to Arab market interests. Another concern is that there are some ideas that Israel will be the Arab economies' bridge to the international market. If a new regional economic system is going to emerge with Israel as part of it, the Arab side should have more say because it is the bigger part. The Israeli economy may be bigger and much more advanced than the Arab economies but, according to international studies, the general Arab economy is the one with great opportunities for growth, expansion, and progress. With the dense Arab populations, if the per capita income grows, the Arab markets will surpass what was achieved by the Asian tigers.
