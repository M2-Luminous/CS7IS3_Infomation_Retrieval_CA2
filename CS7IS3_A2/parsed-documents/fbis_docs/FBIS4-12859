In a statement to the MENA correspondent in Bonn, he said no agreement has been concluded with Israel on transporting gas through al-'Aqabah Port [name of port as transmitted], as German media have reported. Shaykh Hamad said the press has inflated this issue, which does not exist, indicating that any dealings between Qatar and Israel hinge on the termination of its occupation of all Arab territories occupied in 1967. He explained that the gas export agreement was concluded with an Italian firm, which then delayed its implementation. On Qatar's relations with Iraq, Shaykh Hamad said his country deals with peoples and not with regimes. He indicated that contacts between Doha and Baghdad depend on Iraq's implementation of the UN resolutions. He spoke about the importance of cooperation and resolving differences among the Arab states, indicating that the Arab world cannot bear any new differences at present. Shaykh Hamad said that in the event a Gulf state is threatened, help should come from the friendly Arab states before it comes from foreign countries. [passage omitted]
