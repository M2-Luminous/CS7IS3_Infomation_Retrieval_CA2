They will resume on Tuesday [18 January] instead of tomorrow. Hasan 'Asfur, the head of the Security Committee emanating from the Gaza-Jericho Committee, says the postponement is because Dr. Nabil Sha'th, Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat's political adviser, is in Tunis, where he is briefing the Palestinian leadership on the course of the negotiations and the obstacles facing them. 'Asfur added that the coming round of talks is expected to last until Friday. The discussion during the coming round, he added, will focus on issues that are the subject of differences between the two sides, primarily the area of Jericho, the control of the crossing points, and the control of the border points between Gaza and Egypt and between Jericho and the West Bank. At its last meeting, the Palestinian-Israeli Security Committee ran into difficulties due to differences in views over issues relating to Jericho, the security of the settlements, and the crossing points. As for the Civilian Committee, progress was made on the transfer of civilian powers to the Palestinians in the areas of services and infrastructure. Some points relating to water, archaeology, and town planning remain to be solved in the coming round.
