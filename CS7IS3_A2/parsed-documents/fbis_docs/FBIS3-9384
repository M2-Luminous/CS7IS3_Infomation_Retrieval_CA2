It did not elaborate. Two roads leading out of Sarajevo are due to re-open Wednesday: one leading to central Bosnia, one to the south. The bridge linking the city to the Serb-held suburb of Grbavica is also due to open, as is a road between two Serb-held suburbs, Lukavica et Ilidza. The routes were to be opened for limited civilian traffic. But UN Protection Force [United Nations Protection Force] spokesman Major Simon MacDowell said unspecified problems were threatening the moves. The "difficulties are coming from both sides," he said, giving no further details. The nearly two-year Serb siege of the city eased last month when the Serbs gave in to a NATO ultimatum and removed many heavy weapons that had been ringing Sarajevo. But on Monday, UN forces found Serb heavy weapons including tanks, anti-aircraft guns and mortars inside the NATO-imposed exclusion zone around Sarajevo. MacDowell said the find made by Canadian troops late Sunday was a "big violation" of the NATO demilitarization plan. MacDowell said Tuesday that civilian affairs representative Diyan Milov met Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic Tuesday evening, and subsequently travelled to Lukavica.
