Therefore, Germany supports Latvia's demand for the withdrawal of the troops. Holubek expressed the conviction that, thanks to international pressure, the Russian troops will be withdrawn from Latvia by 31 August this year. Another delaying factor in Latvia's integration into Europe, the envoy believes, is the problem of the Skrunda radar station.
