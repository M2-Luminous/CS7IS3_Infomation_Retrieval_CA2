The petitioner proposes to increase the maximum length of its trailing cables supplying shuttle cars, loading machines, and roof bolters to 900 feet from a nominal 480 volt, 3-phase alternating current system during longwall development; to have the cables for shuttle cars and loading machines not smaller than # 2 AWG with the maximum setting at 800 amps; to have the roof bolter cable not smaller than # 4 AWG with the maximum setting at 500 amps; and to have the trip settings of these circuit breakers sealed or otherwise fixed so that the unit settings cannot be set above the maximum allowable value. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternative method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard. 9. Gray Quarries, Inc.

Box 386, Hamilton, Illinois 62341 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 56.6131(a)(1) (location of explosive material storage facilities) to its Gray Quarries (I.D.
