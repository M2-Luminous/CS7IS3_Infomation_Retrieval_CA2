[Begin Lage recording] We can say that the harvest is going through a very difficult, tense situation. In Santiago de Cuba and other provinces as well, the harvest is behind schedule, perhaps because of rains and other factors. The conditions under which the harvest had to be prepared were very difficult. [end recording] For this reason it has been decided to continue the harvesting activities until May. We must get ready to conclude the harvest under the abnormal conditions of rain and humidity. After more than three months of harvesting, breakdowns are reasonably expected to increase, and so we must look for rapid solutions. However, notwithstanding the inclement weather or material failures, Lage trusts that the workers' spirit will not decline: [Begin Lage recording] The leaders and workers who are engaged in this harvest have not shown any sign of weariness, although some of these groups have been working for more than 140 days and still need to continue working through the month of April, and perhaps even some days in May. [end recording] Despite the difficulties, Santiago de Cuba seems to be determined to fullfill its objective. According to the latest assessment, the conditions are appropriate to achieve these objectives, but as in any endeavor to reach the final goal, a greater effort is demanded.
