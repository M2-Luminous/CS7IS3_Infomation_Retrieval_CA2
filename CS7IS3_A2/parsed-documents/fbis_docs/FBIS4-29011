Therefore, we cannot be responsible. This is a threatening remark repeatedly being made by the North Korean side. However, sanctions clearly attach a precondition that it forces a dialogue. Some people are buying large amounts of daily necessities, which is even all the more instigating anxiety. We will hear about the current situation from Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok. Hello, Prime Minister. [Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok] Hello. [Yi Yun-song] Even if war does not break out immediately, do we have to be prepared for even the slightest possibility? [Prime Minister Yi] Yes, we have to be prepared. There is a saying: Be prepared, and you will have no cause for regrets. I believe that we must be prepared for even the slightest possibility so that we can live in security. A civil defense exercise was carried out today. People are wondering if it was carried out because of the current troubled situation. That is not so. We are to hold civil defense exercises twice a year in June and September. I want to clearly say that today's exercise was no more than a scheduled exercise, it was not carried out because an unusual situation has taken place. [Yi Yun-song] The government is worrying about apathy by the people regarding security and also over the excessive apprehension and crisis awareness. People are even saying that they do not know what to think. What is the government's clear position? [Prime Minister Yi] I believe that we must differentiate between being aware of security and being apprehensive about security. Awareness of security means being prepared for the slightest possibility of a calamity so that there will be no regrets later. Being apprehensive about security is an unsound reaction stemming from ignorance over what the current situation is and how it will develop. The current situation is a situation in which we do not have to be worried. However, there exists our counterpart, North Korea. I emphasized the need to be aware of security even though we know that they will not dare provoke us again when viewing our strong preparations, but we must be prepared for the slightest possibility. Being apprehensive makes the people act abnormally, such as buying large amounts of daily necessaries, which may bring about social confusion. I believe North Korea is aiming at social confusion. Therefore, we must not react unsoundly without any solid ground over the current situation. [Yi Yun-song] From two to three days ago people living in well-to-do residential areas started buying large amounts of daily necessities. Fortunately most of the people are observing the situation and are restraining from impulse purchases. What is your view on this matter? [Prime Minister Yi] Since we are under a situation in which we are fully prepared, I would like to clearly say that war will not break out immediately and would like to ask the people not to be worried. I would like to ask the people to assume the attitude of always being prepared for the slightest possibility. [Yi Yun-song] Thank you. [Prime Minister Yi] Thank you.
