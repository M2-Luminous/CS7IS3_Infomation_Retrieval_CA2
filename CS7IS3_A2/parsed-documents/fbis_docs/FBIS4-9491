In comments to journalists on the Bosnian Serbs' apparent compliance with the NATO ultimatum, under threat of air strikes, the ambassador said: "We're very pleased, yes, but there is no gung- hoism in this alliance. We're firm but not gung-ho." The sequence of events showed that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization could make a contribution to the United Nations in Bosnia when required "and do it properly and effectively," Weston said. Asked about air strikes on other UN protected zones, he refused to spoeculate, adding: "I just hope the lesson has been learned. I think we're building on the valuable experience of Sarajevo. If it's working also in Gorazde, so much the better." "By 2:01 Brussels time (0001 GMT), when the deadline for the withdrawal of Bosnian Serbs' heavy weapons from the 20 kilometers (12-mile) exclusion zone around Gorazde expired, there was evidence of compliance with the NATO ultimatum," A NATO spokesman said early Wednesday. As a result of this evidence, NATO southern commander Admiral Leighton Smith and UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] "have agreed that airstrikes are not necessary for the moment," the spokesman added. "We will however remain vigilant and we reiterate our determination to conduct airstrikes in coordination with UNPROFOR if Gorazde and other safe areas in Bosnia are attacked or existing exclusion zones are violated".
