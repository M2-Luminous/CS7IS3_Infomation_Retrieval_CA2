The formidable military potential of the former Yugoslav People's Army [JNA] is what gave the Serbian conquest its main strength. However, the Serbs also had supremacy because of the military industry in areas under Serb control. On the other hand, after the outbreak of Croat-Muslim conflicts, parts of the military industry that remained under the control of the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army were scattered and dissociated, severed from sources of energy and raw materials. Just how much the Serbs fear the possibility of these potentials being linked into a unified technological process is evident from the fact that they, after the first hints of Croat-Muslim unification, carried out an air raid on the largest gun factory in the former Yugoslavia -- Bratstvo in Novi Travnik. Overhaul of Supersonic Aircraft At the same time, the Bosnian-Croatian agreement opens the possibility of launching an enviable military industry. Prior to the war, Croatia had almost no military industry with the exception of shipbuilding. Here we need to mention the Skorpik Repair Plant in Sibenik, the well-known large shipyards in Split, Rijeka, Pula, and the Shipbuilding Institute [Brodarski institut]. Although it will not be possible to manufacture a missile launcher or submarine in the near future, it will nevertheless be possible to manufacture smaller vessels. Although very little is known and virtually nothing is said in the public about this topic, it has nevertheless been announced that Croatia has long since mastered the manufacture of weapons in garages and workshops. According to officially published data, the manufacture of small arms includes the industrial manufacture of hand guns (PHP -- Prvi hrvatski pistolj [the first Croatian hand gun] similar to the Walther), sniper rifles (12.7 mm, 7.9 mm, and a third variant of NATO caliber), and machine guns, copies of the Israeli Uzi. The Pleter, Sokac, and Zagi were experimental projects. A superior variant of the Kalashnikov, similar to the Israeli 7.62 mm (?Ghalib), is also manufactured. Moreover, also in production are several types of mines and explosives, mortars of all calibers with the appropriate and even very advanced shells, recoilless guns and shells, as well as light portable antiaircraft systems. The achieved level of production guarantees the successful mastering of the manufacture of other infantry automatic and semi-automatic weapons. Hand grenades are also manufactured.... Infantry land mines [lezece mine] (20 types) are also being produced. The repair of supersonic aircraft and engines has been revived very quickly. The same applies to the repair of guns and howitzers. However, the largest, already installed and internationally renowned munitions plants of the possible future confederation are in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The HVO in Vitez controls perhaps the largest European plant manufacturing gunpowder, jet fuel [raketno gorivo], and explosives. The Osa project, for which the problem was jet fuel, has become a reality after the liberation of Vitez. The production of high-quality jet fuel for all types and calibers of multiple rocket launchers, gunpowder for all types of artillery, and all types of explosives can resume immediately in the untouched factory halls of the Vitez plant. Even prior to the Croat-Muslim conflicts, the production of gunpowder for infantry weapons had been mastered in Vitez.... The installation for the production of jet fuel for long-range Orkan missiles alone has the capacity of 2,000 pieces per year. A Plant Worth $1 Billion When the HVO took over the plant, some 4,000 finished missile charges, which should have been shipped to Iraq, were still in the warehouse! The value of the Vitez plant is estimated to be $1 billion. Moreover, conserved within the plant perimeter, as a war reserve, is a completely usable older version of a technology line for the production of gunpowder, which can be assembled quickly. It is certain that the Serbs will not be able to achieve the technological level of the Vitez plant for a very long time. The HVO also controls the former Soko aircraft plant in Mostar. Although the Serbs have rescued a part of the equipment, with certain investments the plant could be renewed, if not for the manufacture of whole aircraft, then for at least the manufacture of parts for large international companies and high-quality repair of aircraft. In addition to that, large amounts of parts from which aircraft could be assembled have remained in warehouses throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina (in Busovaca, near Tuzla....). Moreover, there is a significant amount of missiles in storage in Bosnia-Herzegovina that the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army could not use. They are air-to-surface missiles (Munja RZ-57). The largest plant for the manufacture of guns and multiple rocket launchers on the territory of the former Yugoslavia is in Novi Travnik, under the control of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army. The RAK-12, a copy of the Plamen, is manufactured in Croatia. Apart from repairs of all types of artillery, the Novi Travnik plant used to manufacture guns and howitzers of all calibers, from the 75-mm hill gun to the 155-mm howitzer. In preparation for the manufacture of Kolos, equipment was installed for the manufacture of 203-mm gun barrels. All types of mortars and mortar shells were also manufactured. It needs to be said that the manufacture of barrels is very important, since they are being mercilessly used, and it is known they become worn down through wear and tear. Mortars and mortar shells are manufactured in Sarajevo, Tuzla, and Tesanj. The Bosnia-Herzegovina Army also controls a large repair plant for infantry weapons. The Slavko Rodic plant from Bugojno, currently under Serb attack, manufactures all types of detonators, both for artillery and aircraft weaponry. Although the Serbs have also developed a plant for manufacturing detonators in Valjevo, they do not have the capacity for manufacturing the most modern radio detonators. Orkan missiles, which landed on Jastrebarsko [village in the vicinity of Zagreb], were equipped with the poorer variant of electronic detonators manufactured in Krusik in Valjevo, unlike the ones manufactured in Slavko Rodic in Bugojno. Ammunition for NATO In Konjic, in the vicinity of the underground command headquarters built for the former Presidency of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the JNA General Staff, dug deep into the ground is the Igman plant, which manufactures ammunition. The technology of the plant is superior to that of its twin, the Prvi Partizan Munitions Plant in Uzice, and it has the capacity to manufacture several million pieces per month. The fact that this plant used to manufacture ammunition for NATO speaks for its quality. It manufactures all types of ammunition up to 12.7-mm caliber. By using old shells, the ironworks in Zenica has begun manufacturing ammunition of 105-mm and 122-mm caliber.... There is a possibility that, by using barrels from the one-time JNA warehouses, the Muslims in Novi Travnik have managed to manufacture a Kalashnikov. In Gorazde, there is a plant that manufactures cartridges, the only significant segment of the military industry that did not have a twin in Serbia. In Vitkovici near Gorazde, there is a chemical plant that manufactures substances for the manufacture of explosives. If to this we add the former assembly line for assembling tanks in Slavonski Brod, the potential of the future confederal military industry will be enviable! The Zenica ironworks can manufacture tin for armor and can manufacture the cupola, while the engine can be bought. However, it is even more important that it can produce fast armored vehicles.... All the Plants in Serbia A significant amount of documents of the UNIS Institute for special purposes production has remained in Sarajevo under the control of the Bosniaks and Croats. Unfortunately, the Serbs completely destroyed the Zrak plant in Sarajevo, which specialized in the manufacture of sights. The military industry of the former JNA was designed in such a way that it could produce arms and all the material necessary for the "national defense," completely independently and in total isolation. Almost all the plants of the military industry were located in the central mountain areas of the former joint country. Such distribution was justified by the strategic needs of conducting a national defense war, but at the same time Serbia became completely independent and autonomous in manufacturing arms, whereas the other republics were put in a position of technological and productional dependence on each other. For example, plastic ramps for rocket launchers and engines were manufactured at Kamnik in Slovenia, the gunpowder came from Vitez, sights from Sarajevo, rockets from Vogosce.... The final assembly was done in Prilep in Macedonia. The explosives plant Slobodan Princip-Seljo in Vitez had developed a technology for manufacturing plastic explosives, but then the entire plant was trasferred to Ivangrad in Montenegro. Until 1992, its integral capacity exceeded the requirments of the rump "Yugoslavia" by four times. At the same time, the former federal army built parallel plants on the territory of Serbia and Montenegro wherever it was possible. For example, the "twin" of the Vitez Gunpowder and Explosives Plant was the Prva iskra plant in Barici in Serbia; the twin of the aircraft plant Soko in Mostar is Utva in Pancevo; the Slavko Rodic detonator plant in Bugojno has a twin in Krusik in Valjevo; the Konjic ammunition plant's twin is Prvi partizan in Uzice; the pyrotechnics plant in Gorazde has two twins: Krusik in Valjevo and Sloboda in Cacak. The FAMOS engine plant in Sarajevo also had two twins: the Engine Industry [Industrija motora] in Rakovica near Belgrade and FAP in Priboj. The Zrak plant in Sarajevo, which manufactured sights, had a twin in the Teleoptik plant in Belgrade. The Military Medical Academy [VMA] in Banjica [Belgrade district] dealt with all aspects of military medicine -- development of medical care, surgery in war, and protection from nuclear, chemical, and biological arms. All these institutions were equipped with the most sophisticated equipment and technology. The centrifuge at Batajnica [military airport near Belgrade], for studying pilots' behavior under extremely hard flight conditions, alone cost over $1 million. Prototypes manufactured under license, as well as those manufactured in industrial plants at home, and imported weapons, were also tested near Belgrade -- in the Air Force Center for Experiments [Vazduhoplovni opitni centar] in Batajnica, and the Infantry Center for Experiments [Opitni centar kopnene vojske] in Nikinci in Srijem. Moreover, there was a Technical Center for Experiments [Tehnicki opitni centar] on Prevlaka, from which the Serbs managed to withdraw the equipment and transfer it to the Montenegrin side. The Supersonic Aircraft -- Out of the Question! The restructuring of the military-industrial complex of the remainder of Yugoslavia began in the summer of 1992. However, despite being almost fully equipped in terms of technology, the Serbs still have not managed to renew the manufacture of all types of weaponry. The manufacture of the Orao [Eagle] aircraft has been cut short and is no longer mentioned. There can be no question of developing the new supersonic aircraft. That task proved to be too hard even for the entire military industry of the former Yugoslavia, and it is too hard for the present Serbian industry. The manufacture of Gazelle SA-341/24L helicopters also has not been revived, that used to be manufactured on French license in Mostar. Informed sources claim that the Serbs cannot even master the overhaul of a MiG-21, which used to be done in Velika Gorica, despite the fact that they have taken with them the greater part of the machinery and special tools, completed new assembly halls in Pancevo that measure three kilometers, and constructed a new runway adjacent to the plant.... Almost all of the internationally renowned engineers and craftsmen from Soko, who, apart from fulfilling the requirements of the former army also worked for major international aircraft corporations like Boeing, Airbus, Dornier.... have remained behind in Mostar. The same happened in the case of the Velika Gorica Repair Plant [Remontni zavod]. On the other hand, the greatest achievement of the Utva [Wild Duck] aircraft plant in Pancevo was the manufacture of light propeller planes Utva-75. The serial production of the propeller- powered Lasta [Swallow] training aircraft never even got off the ground in Pancevo. Moreover, there can be no talk of an independent serial production of jet planes for as long as the sanctions are in place. The Serbs did not even try to revive production for navy requirements. Even the existing vessels in Boka are under a thick layer of rust. Vessels Under Thick Layers of Rust In addition to the plants for infantry requirements that were already on their territory prior to the outbreak of war, the Serbs have managed to replace the plants they lost in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The majority of the Serbian military industry is located along the East and West Morava Rivers, and in Belgrade, while another part is in Bosnia under the control of Karadzic's forces. The Crvena Zastava Institute [Zavodi Crvena zastava] from Kragujevac is the strongest point of the Serbian military industry. All types of infantry weapons and antiaircraft guns up to 40-mm caliber are manufactured there. The latest of their products are the 9-mm hand gun (the production of which has been transferred to the SARID 13 plant in Smederevo), a 12.7-mm sniper rifle, and a 40-mm infantry grenade launcher. Also manufactured there is the Kragujevac automatic rifle, fashioned on license after the Russian AK-47, which the Croatian soldiers have named "ciganka" [gypsy]. Krusik from Valjevo manufactures all types of light armor-piercing missile systems, and the licensed guided armor-piercing missiles AT-2 and AT-3. They are also planning to manufacture an AT-4. Prior to the war, they also manufactured Strela-2M, a light portable antiaircraft system, and preparations were underway for the licensed production of the Igla, another light antiaircraft system. Moreover, guided 128 mm air-to-surface Munja missiles and 57-mm BR-1 missiles are manufactured in Valjevo. The Serbs Have Run Out of Money! According to unconfirmed information, rockets for the Plamen, Oganj, and Orkan multiple rocket launchers are also manufactured in Valjevo. All types of infantry ammunition is manufactured in the Prvi Partizan plant in Lucani near Cacak, while gunpowder for infantry ammunition is produced in the Milan Blagojevic plant. The main manufacturer of jet fuel is Prva Iskra from Baric. The strongest Serbian munitions plant in Bosnia is in the UNIS complex in Vogosca, where all types and calibers of artillery ammunition are produced. According to foreign sources, the Serbs have managed to revive the production and repair of 100-mm and 125-mm tank guns, and repair of all other types of artillery pieces. In a recent brief statement issued by the Supreme Council of National Defense, it was stated that the army would only finance priority projects that are of vital significance for the defense of the country, and salaries and pensions of officers. All investments and new projects will be discontinued. The recent strike of the workers from the Crvena zastava plant implies that Milosevic's promise that the Kragujevac plant would work, if need be, in three shifts, is going to be very difficult to fulfill. Toward the end of 1993, the entire Serbian industrial production dropped to some 30 percent of its pre-war level. Half of this production was military production for the purpose of keeping the conquered territories in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Pitiful salaries, insufficient for even bare survival, have led to a massive departure of the highly qualified cadres, who primarily moved overseas. The people with a technical education were joined by experts from numerous military technical institutes and plants. The second important point is a standstill in the development of almost finished projects, and an end of investments into new weapons' technology. Serbia simply no longer has any money for this. The substantial military-technical documentation, stored in Belgrade, will simply become outdated. The immense knowledge in the field of production of arms and military hardware, paid for with the money from all the republics of the former Yugoslavia, will become completely useless.
