Under the headline "Israel Commits Aggression, Receives Support," AL-BA'TH writes: Israel seeks deliberately to reshuffle cards whenever it feels the pressure of international appeals for peace to guarantee Middle East security. In line with the strategy of world Zionism, the Israeli leadership creates tension in the region to form a kind of pressure on the countries that support Israel and Zionist objectives. In this regard, the paper notes the ongoing Israeli aggression against Lebanon. If aggression is one form of tension, then the abduction of people from their homes is an act of piracy, a crime, and a new obstacle to the peace process that was launched in Madrid. AL-BA'TH says that when Israel receives a quarter of all U.S. aid to the world, then it will continue to have a tendency toward aggression and crime. When Europe lifts all forms of arms embargo on Israel and maintains this embargo against the Arabs, Israel receives direct support for its aggressive policy. The paper adds that Israel, which has challenged the United Nations for almost half a century, is once again challenging anything that could check its aggressive tendency. When Israel threatens those with whom it has signed agreements, it confirms that it does not want peace, not even in its very weakest forms, such as the Gaza-Jericho agreement. AL-BA'TH concludes: Israel is committing aggression and yet receiving support and backing. It claims that it is willing to make peace, but at the expense of the Arabs, their territory and dignity, and at the expense of international law, which it is still defying and rejecting.
