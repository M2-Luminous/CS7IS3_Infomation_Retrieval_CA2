This evening, in its community center with adjoining rathskeller, the general secretary of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) is speaking before 100 people. And Peter Hintze was lucky to be able to do so because the local CDU meeting faced stiff competition from the general membership meeting of the gun club. The residents of Neu Wulmstorf came nonetheless, though the average age of the audience must have been a good bit over 50--these days by no means an unusual phenomenon for CDU gatherings. Here he stands then, the 43-year-old general secretary who is, after all, still nine years older than Christian Wulff, the leading candidate of the Lower Saxony CDU, whose election campaign Hintze wants to help. One female visitor utters an involuntary sigh over his youth before Hintze begins to speak and attempts to break down the northern Germans' brittle reserve--a difficult problem for someone who does not want to phrase things too aggressively or in a recklessly exaggerated manner. At least the smile has disappeared from the corners of his mouth at the end of a long day of election campaigning, which gives the appearance of a little more credibility when the subject is unemployment or the war in Bosnia. The Game Behind the Game To put it briefly: All in all, the arguments were convincing, the appearance was a success though not an overwhelming one, the applause was friendly and brief. That is the way it is with Peter Hintze, and it would certainly be a plus for the credibility of politics if the man, like an itinerant preacher, were able to appear at thousands of these meetings and campaign for his cause in tenacious detail work. Pastor Hintze is, however, not an itinerant preacher but rather the general secretary of the CDU, which is why he cannot constantly travel about the country but really must be the big spokesman in Bonn--or, as a confidant puts it: "We do not need the light cavalry on the flank but the heavy artillery in the center." In the meantime, to be sure, the bombardment has begun and the general secretary has discovered that he himself, as military people say, has come under friendly fire--under fire from his own ranks. The difference, of course, is that Hintze has been purposely chosen as a target, as the whipping boy for a battered government, as a scapegoat for a party that has come down in the world. Displeasure over sobering public opinion figures, over lethargic and discouraged party loyalists, over the loss of the political leadership role, and over the lack of success is focused on Hintze. The CDU is seizing upon its general secretary in a prophylactic move, as it were, to explain the election defeat that appears to be evermore ominous. The general secretary, on the other hand, lacks the political weight and power to defend himself against the cannonade and to thwart the game behind the game. And it is for this reason that the case of Hintze is so typical of the condition of the CDU, riven as it is by internal conflict and where--if one only looks a bit more closely--a huge power struggle for the legacy of Helmut Kohl is beginning to break out and where any unanimity appears to be lost. What then is the situation with general secretary and the game behind the game? Peter Hintze was put into office at a time when the Union appeared to have a lightweight opponent in the Social Democrats. The Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) was providing its own headlines and its leadership team was more than preoccupied with itself. At the time--on 25 April 1992 to be exact, which is also Hintze's birthday--on that day then, Helmut Kohl invested State Secretary Peter Hintze with the office of the general secretary in a four-hour speech in Oggersheim. It is no secret that Hintze was not his first choice--Hans-Peter Repnik, state secretary in the Ministry for Economic Cooperation, and Juergen Ruettgers, secretary of the parliamentary caucus, had already declined. Hintze accepted because, as he himself says, he had the choice between a tranquil life in the Ministry for Women and Youth or the kamikaze job in the Adenauer House. Hintze took office under difficult circumstances: The CDU's opinion poll results were no better than today and the leadership team at party headquarters had been completely replaced. Only two years before the great election marathon, Hintze had to do without an experienced team and start all over again from the beginning with a young crew. Within the power structure, the Adenauer House increasingly declined in importance in relationship to the Chancellor's Office, the caucus, and the party because Hintze also had to put internal conditions in order during his first year and did not use the time to achieve greater importance for his house in its external relations. More important, however, was the fact that the Union caucus, with Wolfgang Schaeuble at its head, developed a powerful dynamism that literally bowled over the young general secretary and his even younger team. Hintze assumed the new office although he knew he lacked political prominence. All of his predecessors had a field of technical expertise in which they had been able to shine: Kurt Biedenkopf as an economics expert, Heiner Geissler as a specialist in social issues, and Volker Ruehe as a policy expert in foreign affairs and defense. Hintze, on the other hand, was aware of the fact that no laurels were to be won with the issues of women and youth, which were considered soft in Bonn, or even with his experience as expert for civilian service [for conscientious objectors]. He therefore concentrated on the CDU's renewal--an undertaking that, to be sure, succeeded in the Adenauer House, but failed miserably in the party. The CDU is, surveys show, unattractive to young people. The connection to voters under the age of 40 has been broken. Again and again Hintze tried to seize upon issues and promote them--thus far without success. It was more by accident that his initiative to liberalize business hours gained momentum during last summer's legislative break, yet the chancellor, who had apparently underestimated the dynamics of it, jumped from the train at the last minute and left Hintze in the lurch. Hintze's successes in containing the tax debate following the Duesseldorf party convention, for example, or in the coalition fight over the AWACS deployment, found no resonance with the public. Finally, the classic issue for a general secretary--reform of the party and making it more accessible, has long been taken over by Parliamentary Caucus Secretary Ruettgers. Hintze thus remained a strangely colorless figure and his initiatives turned out rather ridiculous--such as the demonstration he organized for nursing care insurance in front of SPD headquarters where, in the manner of a Young Union [CDU youth organization] project, he put up posters and allowed the event to be taken over by SPD National Secretary Verheugen. There is always something timid and immature about Hintze's public appearances which has gained him the reputation of an earnest schoolboy--not least of all because of his youthful appearance. He acts stiff and defensive before the cameras, with a mixture of studied aggressiveness and lecturing paternalism--both of which come across as disingenuous and artificial. His news conferences often go awry and his statements are characterized by toothless sarcasms. And now comes the astonishing aspect: There is also a different Peter Hintze. There is a perceptive analyst, a polished wordsmith, and an aggressive fighter. There is a general secretary with firm views on the condition of his party and precise plans for its recovery. There is an election campaign manager with a keen understanding of the modern media campaign, of the needs of the younger voter groups, and of the limitations and potential of using party VIP's. There is the CDU politician Peter Hintze who is thoroughly aware of his role, who keenly observes what is happening around him and to him, and who reports on the chaotic forces with which he has to struggle every day in order to keep the CDU juggernaut on track while at the same time having to contend with intrigues, feuds, and treacheries. And because the man can speak so objectively about himself, one very quickly comes to the second biggest problem that, in addition to his lack of political prominence, plays a role: the discrepancy between the public perception of Peter Hintze and his real personality. It is simply a case of Hintze having a serious problem of self-presentation, of him sharing with his party chairman a shyness in front of the camera, and of basically performing two roles. Now that the election campaign is drawing nearer, they are all jumping on him and demanding an aggressive and polemical general secretary. In the laender party associations, in the ministries, and even in the Chancellor's Office the call is heard for the big stick and for the bulldog--a role Heiner Geissler and Volker Ruehe once performed. "Ruehe certainly was considered a crude guy, but he was effective," says a member of the leadership rank. The party is thirsting for arguments, it is demanding guidelines for the campaign, and it wants to know how the CDU can once again tackle the job. For the time being, Hintze cannot provide an answer--but who can in a Union where resignation is everywhere rampant? Thus, they attack the general secretary's methods: the computer network he had installed to provide information to the kreis offices; the Adenauer House's work with the press; the lamentable appearances at podiums in front of colorful signs--all symbolism and not strategy, activity for the sake of activity instead of content. Last week the chancellor appointed journalist Peter Boenisch as special advisor for the election campaign as he has done in previous years as well, and although the man will not have any strategic assignment and his true role cannot yet be properly assessed, this is now being interpreted as a blow to Hintze. Like a Reed? Lost amid all this turmoil and carnage is the fact that Helmut Kohl knew perfectly well two years ago who he was bringing into the Adenauer House. He knew that Hintze prefers softer tones, that this general secretary would bring a new style--friendly, objective, and not polemic. Furthermore, if one assumes that Helmut Kohl continues to stand by Hintze, that a change of general secretary would damage the chancellor himself more than it would help him, and that a successor will also not be able to change the downward trend, then the question is raised as to the purpose of this crusade. Is someone--if it may be put this way--beating the sack instead of the donkey? Is the party's displeasure with its chairman being taken out on its general secretary? But the explanation is also reasonable--and one can hear it at many levels of the party--that a serious struggle has set in at the leadership level of the CDU to get the best starting position for the period after the election when Helmut Kohl's fate will be decided. Heiner Geissler has conceded that his successor has a good heart. That, as he knows, will not be enough for Hintze to survive the power struggle because the party traditionally shows little consideration for good hearts. For this reason he much prefers the analogy with the reed: Its toughness, he warns, should not be underestimated--and especially not the sharpness of its edges.
