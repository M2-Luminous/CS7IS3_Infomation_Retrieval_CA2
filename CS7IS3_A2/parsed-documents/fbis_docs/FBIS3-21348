His Excellency candidly answered all of our questions, which are being pondered by many businessmen and industrialists and gave precise replies dealing with a number of issues that are of concern to these sectors of the economy as well as to a large number of our citizens. He concluded by saying that Saudi Arabia's industries are marching in the direction of progress, guaranteeing the nation a bright future that will bring prosperity to our country and its citizens. [Al-Qaysi] First we would like to have Your Excellency review the developments that have taken place in the industrial and electrical sectors of this wealthy nation under the circumstances of the tremendous growth that it has experienced. [Al-Zamil] It is a pleasure for me to review with you some of the basic features of the development of industry and electricity in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. There is no doubt that Saudi Arabia has made great strides in the field of industry and electricity. I would like to begin by talking about industry and providing a brief introduction before mentioning the achievements of industrial development in Saudi Arabia. First I would like to point out that the basis for, and essential element of, industrial development in Saudi Arabia is the fact that Saudi Arabia totally adheres to the principles of Islamic law. The government of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques has taken upon itself to translate these principles into reality such that they guarantee complete freedom of action for Saudi Arabia's individuals and citizens. This freedom has provided investors with a feeling of security and thus unleashed all manner of intellectual capacities and given them all possible chances to seek different opportunities. Investors, whether citizens or non-citizens, have begun to feel a sense of responsibility, starting with the projects that they are concerned with. The role of the state has basically consisted of providing a suitable investment climate, basic arrangements and facilities, and some incentives. These arrangements, facilities, and incentives have created a suitable natural environment in which investors can operate and begin to carry out their activity. These arrangements and facilities consist of the creation of the industrial cities, the provision of land necessary for the industrial projects, and the necessary utilities for the establishment of these projects, in addition to the availability of the necessary loans for industry and customs exemptions for the equipment and raw materials necessary for these projects. These arrangements, facilities, and incentives, along with the principle of a free economy, constitute the foundation that has impelled businessmen to get moving and start seeking industrial projects. The result of this has been noticeable industrial growth, consisting of more than 2,036 industrial projects in various areas of Saudi Arabia in which 140 billion riyals [R] have been invested. They have produced products valued at more than R50 billion, including R10 billion of products that have been exported to other nations. All of these tangible results and achievements have come about as a result of the efforts of our citizens and investors operating in a climate of unlimited support provided by the state. These enterprises have not been merely a facade to boast about, but also have come about in order to satsify market demand and were set up in accordance with international specifications in order that they compete in the domestic market, which is an open market. Consequently, we expect a continuation of the natural growth of this industrial progress in the years to come. [Al-Qaysi] Saudi Arabia follows the principle of a free economy, and industry is the backbone of the economy of the advanced nations. Why, then, is industry not given free rein to develop more widely, by means of the unrestricted and unconditional granting of licenses? [Al-Zamil] I would not be exaggerating if I said that investors are complaining about the great degree of flexibility shown by the Ministry in granting industrial licenses. Many of the investors with whom I have met on numerous occasions in various areas of Saudi Arabia have had complaints about the high degree of flexibility shown by the Ministry of Industry and Electricity when it comes to giving out industrial licenses, and this means that there is lots of competition. Things have reached the point where as many as 15 competing enterprises are producing the same product. This is why they have demanded that the Ministry put a limit on these licenses. The Ministry's position in this matter is, to a large degree, in accordance with what I mentioned concerning the fact that there must be flexibility and an open-door policy, because the investors, to a great extent, know best what is in their own interest, especially if they have the capability of investing large amounts of money. But it is necessary for the Ministry to provide information to a given investor and to clarify it for him as well as to tell him that the product he wishes to manufacture is, for example, already being produced by 15 other enterprises, and that this production covers the needs of the nation. But such an investor might have a point of view that can persuade the Ministry to change its mind. In such a case his application is accepted if it is proved that he has a new brand that will have a market share or particular demand, or if he has information concerning domestic or foreign markets that the Ministry does not have. Perhaps the greatest proof of what I have said is the fact that, in addition to licenses for the currently existing 2,036 enterprises, the Ministry has issued a total of about 1,400 licenses for new, future industrial projects. [Al-Qaysi] To what extent has the Ministry completed the project to link electrical power networks throughout Saudi Arabia, and what alternative solutions are there in case of power failures such as the one that occurred recently in the power line between the eastern and central regions? [Al-Zamil] The state has spent large amounts on the electrical sector, and has provided electrical service in all areas of the country. At this point I would like to mention that the number of persons who received electricity by the end of last year totalled more than two milllion customers, and that we have covered all the main cities and villages. Electrical service now, praise be to God, has become a basic service, and the state is providing this service at rates that are quite a bit below actual cost. This is in keeping with King Fahd's directives to make life easier for our citizens. Our power linkage system is considered to be an advanced system that utilizes high technology. At this juncture I would like to point out that most of the technicians working in the electrical sector are Saudi personnel. As for the projects dealing with linking electrical power among the various regions, they have already begun to be implemented some time ago. The project for linking the eastern region is already finished, and work in all its areas is nearly over, with the exception of the power line between Dammam and Hafr al-Batin, which will be finished within four months. We have also finished the power network inside the central region, that is, the power line which links Riyadh to al-Qasim and Sudayr. And now there is a program to link Riyadh to al-Aflaj, and this will mean that the network in the central region will be all linked together except for Wadi al-Dawasir. We have also finished the power network inside the western region since Jeddah, Mecca, Medina, Yanbu', and al-Ta'if are now linked. Currently efforts are also being made to finish the power linkage projects inside the southern region, and, in fact, al-Bahah has been linked to Bishah and we are now working on the link between 'Asir and Najran. When the networks inside the regions have been completed, we will concentrate on linking the regions with each other. We have already begun the step of linking the eastern region to the central region, and they already exchange power loads. Also, Riyadh is linked to al-Qasim. Furthermore, a study has been made concerning linking al-Qasim to Medina, and this will result in the eastern, central, and western regions being all linked to each other. And in the future, God willing, there will be a link between the western and southern regions. At this point I would like to stress the importance of these linking networks. They have been operating with a high degree of efficiency. In spite of the incident that you mentioned, I assure you that this incident only serves to clearly show how rarely such incidents occur. We praise God that throughout the last ten years since the project was first put into operation the electrical power networks have operated at a high degree of efficiency and they have never been down. Many people have not realized that Riyadh gets its electricity from the eastern region and that Mecca receives its power from Rabigh. Here I would like to mention one important point, which is the fact that there is no system anywhere in the world that is totally immune from such power outages. This is something that is impossible. But there are systems that operate at high efficency. I don't think there is any system that can operate for 10 years without some incident happening and not be considered to be indeed an efficient system. So we are gradually putting our systems into operation, and we will continue to work on perfecting them. [Al-Qaysi] And what if such an incident does happen? [Al-Zamil] This is to be expected. There are additional solutions that might be costly, but sometimes it is important to use them. These solutions involve increasing the generating capacity in some of the regions so that power is transmitted at the lowest possible level. We have already taken this matter into consideration. We generate power in Mecca, Medina, and al-Ta'if. But we cannot, for example, generate all the power necessary for Mecca or even for the city of Riyadh, for which we are now planning to construct a ninth generator station. All the generator stations that are being put into operation are considered to be support for the current linking and network systems. [Al-Qaysi] Does the Ministry intend to establish an apparatus to finance and guarantee exports? [Al-Zamil] The Ministry is devoting a great deal of its attention to the matter of exports. As I have mentioned previously, industrial exports are experiencing noticeable growth. There is a table showing how this growth of exports is taking place. Petrochemical and fertilizer exports now total more than R6.5 billion. As for the other industries such as those which manufacture carpets, cables, electrical appliances, etc., their exports total R3.5 billion, and they are continuing to grow. There are two sources for the financing. The first one is the Islamic Bank program, and it is available to all Saudi plants and provides the necessary financing. The second source is the Arab Monetary Fund in which there are special amounts set aside for Saudi industry. There is also the possibility of increasing the sources of this financing, although it is abundant at the present time. As for the matter of guaranteeing exports, there exists a joint Arab authority whose job it is to do this. But its capital is limited and it does not meet the need. Actually there is a need to make a study concerning alternatives for this purpose. In our meeting with the authorities concerned with exports about a month and a half ago, I asked them to study various alternatives. In this regard, the commercial banks are prepared to provide financing for exports, and it is also possible for the banks to make special expertise available to exporters just as they do for importers. This matter, in fact, is of concern to the Ministry and the Ministry is keeping track of it. [Al-Qaysi] We notice that ministerial decisions are being issued concerning exempting some raw materials from customs fees, and then the investors are unexpectedly told by the Customs Administration that these exemptions are being denied. Does Your Excellency wish to comment on this? [Al-Zamil] The Ministry might, in some cases, have some points of view that differ from those of the Customs Administration. What I said is accurate. But this happens on a very limited scale, and these cases involve only 5 percent of the exemption decisions. [Al-Qaysi] Saudi Arabia is experiencing a high degree of advanced industrial progress, and hundreds of plants are being built every year. But the Saudi market is still absorbing foreign products, and this is having an effect on domestic production. How do you think this equation can be solved such that protection can be provided for domestic products and in order to enable them to develop so that they can compete with foreign goods? [Al-Zamil] We in Saudi Arabia do not follow the policy of central planning. There are nations who planned and prescribed their economic policy on the basis of replacing imported goods with domestic goods at any price. And the price was very high for these nations and their citizens. What was the result of this policy? The result was high-cost industries of poor quality that had to be endured by those nations' citizens. Then the time came when this reality had to be dealt with. This is what happened after the collapse of communism, and it also happened in the case of nations such as India and Brazil, whose industries were established on the basis of the imposition of high customs fees on imported products. When the hour of liberation from these policies arrived, all of these industries began to collapse and they began suffering because of the competition. The reason is that they were trying to pursue an unnatural existence, and their industrial development became something that was merely tantamount to slogans. There are those who said: "We will produce everything from safety pins to missiles." Statements like these might keep people quiet and satisfied for a while, but surely they will discover that they cannot be true and will not yield good results. On the basis of this fact, if I could not produce safety pins economically, then I should feel free to import safety pins from abroad. If I could produce other goods competitively, then I should concentrate on the industries that produce those goods. This also applies to other things. This being true, we should be realistic and not attempt to rely on slogans in the field of growth and development. Growth and development are the basis of reality, and reality is something that cannot be wiped out by any slogans. It is true that there are a lot of foreign products in the Saudi market. But there is a difference between what the situation used to be 15 years ago and what it is today. Domestic products are steadily increasing. The value in sales of these products 15 years ago was R10 million, but today this figure is R50 million. This is not something that happened in a vacuum. It was the result of tireless labor. At this point I would like to say that the Saudi economy is an enormous one and that petroleum is still an international commodity and will remain Saudi Arabia's main source of income. The basic point that I want to indicate is that for Saudi industry to remain vigorous, it has to develop on sound economic bases. And that is what is happening right now. This is why I do not hesitate to cancel any licensed project if it was not implemented. There is no emotional tie between me and a project. The proprietor of a project is the one who decides whether or not the project or enterprise is profitable. The result of this is that you will encounter new Saudi products in the future. If we visit industrial exhibits every year, we find that there are new Saudi products and that industry is continuously developing. Our basic task at the present time is to develop this industry. For example, when we found that we possessed an advantage in the chemical industry, we began undertaking it on a grand scale, and we became one of its chief exporters. The same applies to fertilizers and other products. Who would have expected that Saudi Arabia, which used to import 100 percent of its electrical cables, now exports about 30 percent percent of its electrical cable production? We will gradually set up more industries in order to reach the stage of self-sufficiency in a well-researched and scientific manner. [Al-Qaysi] Electricity still has not reached a number of villages in Saudi Arabia. How does Your Excellency explain this, especially in emergency cases? [Al-Zamil] Saudi Arabia lived through an emergency--the Gulf war--which could be considered to have been an extremely difficult circumstance. In that emergency, Saudi Arabia proved how strong its basic utilities were, whether electricity, telephones, or other utilities. Electricity was never cut off during the war, but rather was available wherever it was needed. As for the matter of providing electricity for all villages and agricultural settlements, the fact is that more than 92 percent of all of Saudi Arabia's cities, villages, and agricultural settlements have power. Right now we have a program called the "generator program." It is by means of this program that some remote agricultural settlements are borrowing electricity generators that belong to the Ministry. This program actually has to deal with great difficulties, because it is hard for the parties who borrow the generators to operate and maintain them, and this results in a lot of problems. Definite conditions are attached to obtaining the generators. Any agricultural settlement using a generator has to have at least 20 residences and some basic institutions such as schools or a mosque. These generators are distributed according to need and priorities, and not every request can be complied with in a short period of time. [Al-Qaysi] How has Saudi Arabia been able to maintain its strong economy in spite of the fact that it has had to deal with numerous crises, including such things as the brutal Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the sharp decline in oil prices, and in spite of the fact that the process of growth, development, and modernization is still going on and requires certain well-thought-out expenditures? [Al-Zamil] In fact, the Saudi economy has gone through various phases and has met with obstacles. We had, for example, the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the consequences of this brutal invasion. Saudi Arabia had very great commitments to contend with as a result of this invasion that called for total expenditures of billions of dollars. These commitments directly affected the nation's economy and budget. At the same time there was a sharp decline in oil prices. The wisdom and directives of King Fahd constituted the main guideline for overcoming these difficulties. They were tremendously effective in correctly steering the ship of Saudi Arabia's economy. I believe that this year's budget has quite clearly demonstrated to the world that King Fahd's government is determined to wipe out the negative effects of the situation as well as the consequences of the Iraqi invasion and the decline in oil prices. The budget has shown that the state itself is beginning to cut out unnecessary expenditures and concentrate on services that are important to our citizens. The budget has provided the world with a comprehensive indicator concerning Saudi Arabia's intention to reduce its deficit to the lowest possible level. This is a reflection of the decision made to have the budget be 20 percent lower than last year's budget. In his orientational speech on the occasion of the publication of the budget, King Fahd said that the exchange rate of the riyal would not be affected and that its value would not go down. These measures taken in accordance with King Fahd's guidance will strengthen our economic situation both domestically and abroad. [Al-Qaysi] Many factory owners are complaining about a lack of incentives provided to them by the state, for example, hooking up electrical service to the plants. This forces them to spend huge amounts of money to obtain such service, as in the case of the second industrial city in Riyadh. What are your comments about this? [Al-Zamil] The plants in the second industrial city in Riyadh really did have to deal with an electricity problem, since the city had only one transformer station. But due to the huge increase in demand by the industrialists, an urgent need arose to construct another transformer station. Actually agreement was reached to construct two stations--one of them during the second phase, and the other one during the third phase. Construction of the second phase's station will be completed in the upcoming month of Shawwal [April and May of this year]. Furthermore, the third phase's station will be put into operation four months after that. After these stations have been put into operation, the plants will no longer have an electricity problem. At this point I would like to indicate that the number of plants affected by the power problem do not total more than two or three. The other plants are still in the construction phase or else are just now being completed, and thus have not yet reached the production phase. God willing, the electricity problem will be solved before these plants reach the production phase. [Al-Qaysi] Industrial and economic analysts are of the opinion that Saudi Arabia has made great strides in the field of consumer industries and aspires to create industries involving inventions and discoveries. But there is no guidance in the field of investment industries such as the spare parts industry for vital enterprises like the desalinization plants and others which, if they ceased operations, would bring the country's economic activity to a halt. What are Your Excellency's comments about this? Does the Ministry have guidance to offer the investment industries? [Al-Zamil] In spite of the great efforts being made by the [industrial] exhibits, Saudi industries still are not sufficiently well known. There is no doubt that our industry is growing in normal fashion, and in accordance with the needs of the market. At first the orientation was toward consumer goods. We began producing them according to the same specifications found in imported goods. Many of the people who own enterprises that produce goods were originally importers who then became industrialists, and this is an encouraging trend. In the case of many products, our Saudi citizens believe that they are imported, and it is only after using them that they discover that they were made in Saudi Arabia. This enormous process took place gradually until it reached the point where we now have an industry that is on the highest of levels. This is something that earned the admiration of the Greek minister of industry when I accompanied him on a visit to the Isma'il Abu-Dawud plant, which makes disposable children's diapers in Jeddah and which is considered to be one of the world's four largest plants in this field. There is a clear trend in the direction of investment industries. This was clearly in evidence in Riyadh's first engineering industries exhibit that opened recently, displaying the products of many investment industries. For example, we have two very advanced plants in al-Jubayl and Yanbu', which were constructed via a Saudi-Italian partnership. These two plants produce many parts that go into the components of industrial plants. Here I would like to point out that [the components of] many of the SABIC [Saudi Arabian Basic Industries Corporation] plants and their expanded units were manufactured in Saudi Arabia. Also, the spare parts that used to be imported are now being manufactured domestically. At the present time there is a clear trend in the direction of manufacturing these semi-finished products. The Ministry is encouraging this trend, which saves our country huge amounts of money and also contributes toward transferring high technology to our nation. So there is an obvious effort being made to concentrate on beginning the process of constructing plants that will produce industrial spare parts in various fields. [Al-Qaysi] There are initial indications concerning the construction of a plant in the eastern region to manufacture tires for vehicles. As Your Excellency knows, the tire-producing industry requires big quantities of water. To what extent is such an enterprise useful to us in light of the fact that the Arabian Peninsula is experiencing a water shortage? [Al-Zamil] There is a study and a plan concerning the construction of a tire plant. God willing, I hope this project will become a reality, especially since SABIC, last month, began producing the raw materials, i.e., synthetic rubber. As for the consumption of water, the fact is that most of the consumption will be covered by the recycling method. In other words, the same water will be used again, and purified water will be used in the cooling process. This means that it will be possible to use purified sewage water in this process since it is not a manufacturing process, but is instead basically a cooling process. Riyadh and Jeddah both have complete sewage water purification plants, and this water is used in the cooling process. The result is that fresh drinking water is used only in the food and medicine industries. On the strength of this one can say that the tire industry uses purified water, via recycling, and thus does not consume large quantities of water. [Al-Qaysi] We see that Saudi industry has made great strides that have been first-class. But the industrialists and businessmen have been complaining a lot, even though they are earning lots of money without providing the nation with anything in return--such as training Saudi personnel and other activities that serve as an impetus for the wheel of progress. What is Your Excellency's opinion about this? [Al-Zamil] There is no doubt that the industrialists and others are constantly being asked to include the interest of our nation among their priorities. The basic issue is perhaps that an employee, whether he be in the industrial sector or some other sector, not forget that it is his job to serve his country, whether this be by making the jobs of [Saudi personnel] easier for them or by training them, in accordance with available capabilities. In all frankness I must tell you that the proportion of Saudis working in the industrial sector is higher than the proportion of Saudis in any other sector. Even so, I am not satisfied with what this proportion is. I hope that our industrialists will intensify and concentrate their efforts on attracting young Saudis and a Saudi work force. Actually this is a trend that has begun to take shape. The Ministry has begun to intensify its efforts, together with the various industrialists, to help Saudi citizens in various fields. Of course, the proportion of Saudis in the big plants is a high one. Most of the technical workers in SABIC are now Saudis. I remember when we began working with SABIC, the first thing we did was to hire 1,400 young secondary school graduates and persons who had completed qualification courses. We concentrated on giving them technical training inside Saudi Arabia, in cooperation with technical institutes. Then we sent them to the United States, Europe, and Japan for training in technical professions and vocations. When they returned, they proved their efficiency and capability, and they came to have a special status in al-Jubayl and Yanbu'. After that there was no need to send people abroad for training. The training and education is now done in Saudi Arabia. I believe that gradually--and we can benefit from the experience of SABIC in this realm--the time will come when we will see young Saudis occupying their place in all realms of industry. Of course the Ministry, constantly and on every occasion, is urging businessmen to open their doors to young Saudis to become affiliated with industry. [Al-Qaysi] Everything has both its positive and negative aspects, and three negative aspects concerning the Ministry of Industry are the following: 1. The foreign work force in our small industries constitutes 95 percent of the work force. Why are there no particular clauses that stipulate the granting of licenses, which require their recipients to hire a certain percentage of Saudi employees? 2. There are industrial projects for which licenses have been granted, but they have not been exploited and remain merely ink on paper. Why are such licenses not taken back and then given to other citizens who are capable of implementing such projects? 3. Plots of land in the industrial areas have been granted to investors for them to set up plants there, but some of them have then sold the land. What about this? [Al-Zamil] Concerning the first question, a job seeker naturally prefers that his job be in the large- and medium-sized industries, rather than in the small industries, because of the advantages that would be offered to him. The Ministry is encouraging such people to become affiliated with any industry. But they do have freedom of choice. The important thing is that there be a job opportunity. As for your second question, I would like to point out that the Ministry, after granting a license for any project, follows up on that project, and if the project is not implemented, it is very easily cancelled. And as for your third question, the sale of land in such cases is considered to be a violation and a punishable offense for anyone who commits this violation, whether he is a buyer or seller, because it is rented land and not allowed to be sold. Naturally there are exceptions, such as when the proprietor of the project has already built installations on the land, put equipment and machinery there, but, for some reason, was not lucky or successful with his project. In such a case he has the right to recover the amount paid for the buildings and equipment. But the actual sale of the land is a punishable offense.
