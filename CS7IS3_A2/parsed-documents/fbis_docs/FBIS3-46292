"These enterprises will become independent legal entities under the leadership of the boards of directors. They are required to be independent in economic operation, assume sole responsibility for their profits and losses and produce goods according to market demand goods," said Zhou Gulian, chairman of the provincial Commission for Economic Restructuring. Other enterprises are being encouraged to follow suit, Zhou noted. A survey showed that Anhui made some progress last year in reforming the enterprise system. A number of state enterprises have already tried out the share-holding system by combining the change of the enterprise operational system with the establishment of a modern enterprise system, thus enhancing their vitality and paving a way for the reform of this year. According to Wang Xiuzhi, deputy governor of the province, Anhui will strive this year to expand to 100 the number of key enterprises trying out the share-holding system. That would cover 20 percent of the province's total. It will encourage three to five key state enterprises to issue shares to the public and select one to compete for the national experiment in the modern enterprise system. The province plans to lease or sell medium-sized and small state enterprises with poor economic results.
