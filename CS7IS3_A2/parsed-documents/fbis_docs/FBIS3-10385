The Sosa Plan comprises five changes to the country's current tax collection system. These changes are: taxes on luxury and wholesale items, which will replace the VAT [Value Added Tax], and modification of laws covering fiscal stamps, tax code, income tax, and a temporary tax on bank debits. All of these will allow the president, according to the finance minister, to collect about 400 billion boliavares and reduce the fiscal deficit to 2 percent of the GNP. During his talks, Finance Minister Dr. Julio Sosa Rodriguez explained that the tax on bank deposits would be effective only up to 31 December and will yield 75 billion bolivares in six months. [Begin Sosa recording] It is a type of tax that one would not like to have permanently, but we have seen the results in other countries where it has been applied. Therefore, what we are going to propose is a figure, which I believe when applied for a limited amount of time will not adversely affect savings. [end recording] The finance minister also expressed satisfaction with the establishment of the fiscal police. According to the Comptroller General's Office, current tax evasion hovers around 70 percent. It is hoped that with this new organization, tax evasion will be reduced to at least 50 percent. The finance minister also mentioned he did not understand the Senate's objection to Carlos Tinoco's candidacy to head Fogade [Deposit Guarantee Fund] -- a candidacy proposed by the president; nevertheless, Sosa said he would heed the decision.
