The province's revenue growth resulted from developments in production. The suspension of tax reductions and exemptions was also an important factor causing the growth. Last year's financial expenditure throughout the province increased over the previous year. The main reason was that administrative institutions adjusted their wages beyond budgets and some city-level counties increased their spending for the construction of some basic facilities and transformation projects. In addition, as a result of lifting controls over grain prices, subsidies were provided to workers and staff members. This was also one of the reasons. In August last year, principal leaders of governments at all levels in various localities began to implement central macrocontrol and regulatory measures, thus strictly controlling tax reductions and exemptions, gradually alleviating fund shortages, and bringing about monthly growth in industrial and commercial taxes on the basis of speedy economic development. By the end of last year, 10 cities and counties including Nanyang, Ruzhou, Gongyi, Luyi, and Shangqiu topped 100 million yuan in revenue, fulfilling the provincial plan ahead of schedule. Eleven enterprises including the Anyang steel company, the Luoyang glass factory, the Pingdingshan [words indistinct] factory, and the Henan [words indistinct] factory topped 100 million yuan in taxes. The number of 100-million-yuan enterprises increased by seven over the previous year and 93 enterprises topped 10 million yuan in taxes, an increase of 13 over the previous year.
