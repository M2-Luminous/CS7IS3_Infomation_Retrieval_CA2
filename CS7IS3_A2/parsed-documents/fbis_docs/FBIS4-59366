In a meeting with a small number of Arab journalists, including AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT's, in Bayan Palace yesterday, Shaykh Sa'd said: What is happening in Yemen saddens every Arab. Kuwait will not rejoice to see a northerner taking up arms against his brother in the south, or vice versa, despite the position Yemen adopted during the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, namely its failure to condemn the aggression, keeping silent about and helping it, and cooperating with the Iraqi regime. He added that "Kuwait will not hesitate to issue a statement expressing Kuwait's -- the government's and people's -- condemnation of brothers taking up arms against one another." He pointed out that Kuwait supports any Gulf or Arab endeavor aimed at resolving the dispute. But as a result of Arab disunion, all endeavors have become weak and are unable to crystallize an executive formula to end Arab disputes. The Kuwaiti heir apparent stressed "the need to go back a little and learn from the lessons and wounds of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait." He said that "Yemeni citizens are suffering a great deal as a result of the conflict, which is unjustly shedding Arab blood. They need a real stand assuring them that everyone supports them against any aggression." He added: "As a Kuwaiti Arab, I had hoped I would hear such stands, telling us as Kuwaitis and Arabs: You are not alone...we support you...we are against aggression and for the return of legitimacy. I register here the courageous stands adopted by the brothers and friends, especially the position adopted by the custodian of the two holy mosques [King Fahd of Saudi Arabia], whose position was characterized by manhood, courage, and matching words with actions." Asked about the security situation in Kuwait, the Kuwaiti heir apparent said that "security has been among the government's top priorities since liberation. We will not allow anyone to carry out any action that endangers the homeland's and citizens' security or shakes confidence in the security services' capability under any justification." He also said that he "shares with the Kuwaitis their security concern over the situation represented in the existence of the Iraqi regime as a source of threat to Kuwaiti security and its unwillingness to implement Resolution 833 stipulating border demarcation between Kuwait and Iraq." He stressed that "the brothers' and friends' continued support for the just Kuwaiti demands and their insistence on implementing all UN resolutions reassures the Kuwaiti people and reduces the gravity of the Iraqi threat." On cooperation between the government and the Kuwaiti National Assembly, Shaykh Sa'd pointed out that "the new formation of the Kuwaiti Government embodies the government's determination to implement its strategy concerning Kuwait's future and to step up cooperation with the National Assembly." He said that "what is being debated in this connection does not reach the point of a dispute. It reflects differing views among the sons of one country. Those in charge of the executive authority and the legislative authority are passengers of one ship called Kuwait, and no one wishes to sink this ship. Everyone wants to lead it to the shore of safety." The Kuwaiti heir apparent said that his government's conditions for clearing the Arab atmosphere were mentioned in the government's statement, which includes the following: A. The emphasis on Iraq's implementation of the Security Council resolutions. B. The release of the POW's and those held by the Iraqi regime. He pointed out that "Kuwait is not setting impossible conditions to clear the atmosphere. But before starting to clear the atmosphere, the cause must be eliminated." He said that "Kuwait has begun steps in this connection represented in the tour of the Arab Maghreb states by the first deputy prime minister and foreign minister, during which he discussed Kuwaiti rights." Shaykh Sa'd emphasized that "Kuwait has learned numerous lessons from the Iraqi aggression. The scheme was not limited to Kuwait. It was a scenario for an expansionist plan, but God's will aborted it." He said that "we should remember before clearing the atmosphere that the Iraqi aggression still exists. And if the brothers in the Gulf believe -- even `25 percent' -- that Iraq has no expansionist ambitions, they are completely wrong. Because the Iraqi regime is still working to complete its forces in order to fragment and weaken the unity of the Gulf Cooperation Council and then implement its expansionist schemes. The brothers in the Gulf must realize this reality and apply lessons we have all learned from the invasion. The picture of the Kuwait aggression must be clear to all. And we must cooperate to avert danger by unifying our aim, uniting ranks, and joining forces." He declined to speculate about the Kuwaiti position if Iraq agrees to normalize relations with Israel in return for lifting the international blockade. He said "Kuwait will deal with new developments as its strategy and known fixed positions supportive of right and peace dictate."
