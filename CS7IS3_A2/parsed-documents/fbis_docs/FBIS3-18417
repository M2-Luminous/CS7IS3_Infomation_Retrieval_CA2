Mr Rifkind said the action against the aircraft was sad but the UN Security Council had given a clear warning that any use of fixed wing aircraft for aggressive purposes would result in that action. Asked if he was concerned at any Serbian response, he replied: "One has always been conscious of the fact that people might be tempted to make any retaliatory incidents. ``I think they should take into account that the United Nations forces in general, and the British forces in particular, have the means and military assets to defend themselves and would have the full support of the British Government and the UN as a whole if they needed to use them.'' Mr Rifkind was visiting the Royal Navy's weapons engineering shore training establishment, HMS Collingwood, at Fareham, Hampshire. Earlier, at the Portsmouth naval base, he met Admiral Sir John Kerr, Commander in Chief Naval Home Command, and other senior officers.
