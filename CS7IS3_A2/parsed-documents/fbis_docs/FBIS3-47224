Party Chairman Tomiichi Murayama made the remarks at a two-day party convention which started Tuesday. Hosokawa also addressed the convention as a guest. Hosokawa told the delegates that enacting political reform bills in the current parliament session is a mission of the ruling coalition. SDPJ sources said there is a strong dissatisfaction among party members with the party leadership, which is regarded as having compromised too much on crucial issues such as political reform and the partial lifting of the rice market. The 60th party convention, a continuation of a meeting held on September 25 last year, is scheduled to adopt an action program for this year advocating political reform. Some 400 delegates made up of SDPJ Diet members and local representatives from the country's 47 prefectures have registered to attend the meeting, party officials said. At the opening of the convention, Murayama said, "political reform bills aimed at stemming graft-ridden politics should be legislated during the current Diet session at any cost." The government-proposed political reform bills are currently in the House of Councillors for further deliberation after being passed by the more powerful House of Representatives in November last year. The bills call for replacing the multiseat electoral system for the lower house, which encourages lavish campaign spending, with a system combining single-seat constituencies and proportional representation, as well as tightening curbs on political fund-raising activities. Murayama reiterated the party stance to continue in the seven-party coalition government, saying, "if the SDPJ does not remain in the coalition, politics might be dominated by conservative forces." "An axis gathering broad-based liberal forces has to be formed as early as possible to square off with strong conservative groups," he said. The SDPJ is the biggest party in the coalition. On the dissolution of the lower house, Murayama said, "general elections which causes a two-month void in politics should not be held in the current harsh economic climate, but (I) cannot definitely say what kind of decision Hosokawa will make in the wake of political upheaval." Last month, Hosokawa gave up his initial target to get the political reform bills into law by the end of 1993 and set a new deadline of January 29, when the extended extraordinary Diet session ends. If the bills are not passed by then, there is a possibility that the government would resign or dissolve the lower house for an election, political commentators said. Murayama said the SDPJ has to win more than 100 seats in the next general election. In the last lower house general election held in July last year, the SDPJ suffered a historical setback, seeing its strength almost halved from 134 before the polls. The election, however, dislodged the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) from a 38-year-old grip on power, bringing about the coalition government.
