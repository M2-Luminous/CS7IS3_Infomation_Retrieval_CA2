FR940819-2-00147 FR940819-2-00085 Friday August 19, 1994 Part VI Department of the Interior Bureau of Indian Affairs Final Environmental Impact Statement for Renovation of Crow Creek Dam on Crow Creek Indian Reservation, South Dakota; Notice Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 160␣/␣Friday, August 19, 1994␣/␣Notices DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Bureau of Indian Affairs Notice of Availability of a Final Environmental Impact Statement for Renovation of Crow Creek Dam on Crow Creek Indian Reservation, South Dakota AGENCY: Bureau of Indian Affairs, Interior. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The Spillway at Crow Creek Dam is on the verge of failure. Failure of the spillway could lead to the catastrophic failure of the dam, endangering lives and property in the floodplain between the dam and Lake Francis Case on the Missouri River. During its 55-year life, the reservoir has trapped approximately 5,000 acre-feet of sediment which has reduced its water-storage capacity from 7,000 to 2,000 acre-feet. An Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) was necessary to address the impact of controlled or catastrophic release of the sediment. Six alternatives for renovation are considered in the document. This Notice is published in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulations found in Parts 1500&hyph;1508 of 40 CFR. DATES: The Notice of Intent to prepare an EIS was published in the Federal Register on September 21, 1992. Two scoping meetings were held on September 30, 1992. The draft EIS was released on December 31, 1993. A public hearing was held on April 13, 1994; and a tribal council informational meeting was held on April 14, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be addressed to Mr. Don Whitener, Acting Area Director, Bureau of Indian Affairs, 115 4th Avenue, S.W., Aberdeen, South Dakota 57401. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Leonard Alberts, Safety of Dams Coordinator, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Branch of Natural Resources, 115 4th Avenue, S.W., Aberdeen, South Dakota 57401. Telephone (605) 226&hyph;7621. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Crow Creek Sioux Tribe has a contract with the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) to perform Safety of Dams activities at Crow Creek Dam. The Tribe contracted the EIS work to Morrison-Maierle/CSSA of Helena, MT; a private engineering consultant. Six alternatives were considered, including No Action. The BIA has chosen Alternative 6 as a preferred alternative. Alternative 6 will breach the dam, drain the reservoir, naturally stabilize the reservoir sediments, and eventually return the reservoir area to a naturally vegetated condition. The existing concrete spillway will be removed and the reservoir will be lowered by excavation of the underlying material. A period of 5 years will be used to stage the breaching of the dam so that the amount of sediment released downstream will be minimized. The Crow Creek Sioux Tribe favors Alternative 6 as an interim remedy to relieve the existing safety hazard since funding for other alternatives is not available. The tribe prefers, as a permanent rehabilitation, Alternative 2 which involves rehabilitation of the dam with a design flood capacity of 55,000 cfs and operation to flush sediment. The five-year phased breaching of the dam will be performed in a manner that will allow pursuit of Alternative 2 if funds become available. Alternative 2 would include the construction of a new spillway, a new outlet works, and possibly installation of roller-compacted concrete overtopping protection for the dam embankment. The outlet works would have a greater capacity for flushing of sediment. While sediment flushing would prolong the life of the reservoir, it would make establishment of fish populations very difficult. Eventually the reservoir would fill with sediment and become wetlands and riparian habitat. The BIA has committed to monitoring sediment losses from the reservoir during the implementation period of Alternative 6. Appropriate mitigation will be developed if significant impacts occur during the staged breach. Dated: August 12, 1994. Ada E. Deer, Assistant Secretary_Indian Affairs.
