On the fifth of January, formations of nuclear-capable F-16 fighter-bombers, pursuit-assault planes and VTOL [vertical takeoff and landing] assault planes based in Japan and flying corps of the U.S. Airforce present in South Korea and the puppet airforce staged bombing exercises aimed at striking the strategic depths of the northern half of Korea in the skies above Yongwol, Wonju and Tokjok Islet under the command of an E-3 early warning plane. More 360 war planes of various types were flown in the manoeuvres. That day, KC-135 tankers refuelled scores of fighter-bombers in the aerial war exercises in the sky above the sea off Kunsan. On January 4 and 5, RV-1, RC-12, RF-4C, EH-60, and other types of spy planes committed an all-round aerial espionage on the coastal and frontline areas of the northern half of Korea in the skies above Tokjok Islet, Pochon, Inje and Kojin. Meanwhile, the South Korean puppets, instigated by the U.S. imperialists, staged war exercises against the North near the Demilitarized Zone of the Military Demarcation Line [MDL]. On January 4 and 5, ground units of the South Korean puppet army fired large-calibre machine guns and automatic rifles in night attack exercises aimed at a breakthrough on the MDL in Inje, Paju, Chorwon and Yonchon Counties and large-calibre artillery units fired 50 odd shells into areas near the Demilitarized Zone and formations of helicopter gunboats and helicopter transports staged exercises of support to ground attack units and air-lifting of war supplies. The U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets must act with discretion, clearly mindful of the possible consequences of their war manoeuvrings against the northern half of Korea.
