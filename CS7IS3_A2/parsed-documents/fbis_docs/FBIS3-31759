The conference is being held under the slogan: "Towards New Partnership." In his inaugural speech, Minister Olechowski put forward a new concept for cooperation with Russia, which he called "Partnership for Transformation." In his opinion such cooperation would lead to the achievement by the two states of "their proper place among the developed democratic countries." Olechowski emphasized that the essential feature of Polish-Russian partnership should be better use of traditional trade links in order to fill the gap that has arisen after the disappearance of the CEMA [Council for Mutual Economic Assistance]. The Polish foreign minister pointed out that Poland and Russia should support each other in creating a modern trade law compatible with international standardsm, and they should set up a system of preferential treatment for bilateral trade, as well as cooperate in developing banking and transport services. Olechowski said that Poland had already prepared a plan for an Eastern European Trade Initiative that would coordinate such cooperation. The minister added that it was necessary to create a data bank of information on investment capabilities of companies in the two countries and to organize investment promotions and set up capital links between the companies that in the past used to cooperate within the CEMA. Olechowski emphasized that the stabilization of the situation in Central and Eastern Europe would be a condition for joining the community of democratic countries. He expressed the hope that the participation of Poland and Russia in the Partnership for Peace program would facilitate the process. In his opinion, regional and bilateral cooperation in many areas, which should be conducted as two sovereign states, would also facilitate stabilization in the region. "We need partnership with Russia, Ukraine, and other neighbors in order to make an ambitious contribution to Europe -- Europe, which is both diversified and unified -- and with the aim of taking our proper place in it," Olechowski said.
