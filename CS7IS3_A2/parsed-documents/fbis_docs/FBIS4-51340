Useful and important, that is, for those who can afford to attend them. If you're not there, too bad. The views and information passed around in these meetings are often a closely guarded secret. Which is really unfortunate. There is a lot of good, solid information in company presentations at these events which help investors understand certain companies better, especially recently listed China-based companies. Take Credit Lyonnais Securities Asia's investors' forum which ended yesterday. It got together 240 fund managers from three continents, possessing among themselves a global pool of U.S.$3,000bn-3,500bn (about HK$23,400bn-27,300bn) under management, and 64 companies from Hong Kong, China and the region to exchange views in a four-day seminar and workshop. Attending fund managers said it was useful for the chance to meet so many company executives from different countries in a one-stop visit. The presentations, mixed in quality we were told, helped analysts write their reports and fund managers make their investment decisions. The company people said it gave them a good venue to market themselves to brokers and investors. Yet, the press was barred from covering the forum. The reason given was that the participants wanted to speak more freely without being placed under the spotlight. It's a reason cited increasingly frequently these days. We heard it before at a recent business conference in Beijing organised by the International Herald Tribune, a newspaper whose own journalists were not given full access. In a day and age when transparency is encouraged in public companies, it is disappointing to know that businessmen would say certain things to analysts and fund managers that they wouldn't to the press, and in turn, the general investor who, like the institutional investor, is an owner of the company. In fact, this veil of secrecy is adopted mainly for the benefit, or at the demand of Chinese companies and officials, who don't have a tradition of being open and honest about their businesses. Their desire to be as much insulated from public scrutiny as possible has unfortunately cowed most people who do business with them, including their brokers, to be equally evasive. It is for this reason that many brokerages, including Credit Lyonnais, refuse to share their research and their views on Chinese companies with the public. A pity really, for a house ranked tops for its China research. Some say they have no choice. If some of their reports got into the newspapers, a number of Chinese companies could see their prices collapse, and China might come down on the brokerage like a tonne of bricks. "They have long memories, you know. If you write something they don't like, they're going to remember it for a long time. It's one thing to give the information to your clients, it's another to see it all over newspapers," one Credit Lyonnais executive said. He is not alone in his paranoia, or should we say, caution. One person from Smith New Court recently got very worried when his views on China got published. We know China runs a blacklist of journalists. Maybe they're compiling one on analysts, as well.
