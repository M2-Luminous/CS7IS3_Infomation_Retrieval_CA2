But since then, there has been mounting criticism from civil rights groups, student bodies, and from individuals over the commission's membership. Some people think there should be a sovereign national conference instead. At the moment, the commission is inviting submissions from interested parties to work out an agenda. Later this week, the commission will be deciding on certain key issues, including fixing a date for the conference. In Lagos, Sola Odunfa went to see the commission's secretary, Debor Okandi, and he asked him if he would be passing on to the conference all the suggestions the commission receives. [Begin recording] [Okandi] No. You see, our commission is expected to collect the memoranda, sift through them and pull out the ideas the public would like to discuss, so we will not pass all the memoranda received to the conference. [Odunfa] Will that not be seen as the commission censoring the opinions put forward? [Okandi] No, that is not censoring, because what we are going to do is to look at all the points raised by the memoranda and to reduce the work of the conference in the sense that if you have got 10 memoranda repeating some items, it is better to collate them into one, instead of making the whole conference look at them all over again. So, we are not going to censor, we are going to ensure that all the different points raised are put into the agenda for the conference. [Odunfa] Let us assume that some Nigerians suggest that the country should break up and give reasons for this. Will you forward this to the conference? [Okandi] Definitely, you see the agenda for the conference will represent the views and the moods of the country. The mood of the country will be reflected in the agenda. You can take it from me that the members of the commission are aware that some members of the public are in fact saying that the starting point should be: Should the country remain one, or should it break up, or should it have clauses for secession, or you know, expelling any section of the country that becomes troublesome. Whatever the public want, we will formulate into the agenda. [Odunfa] At the end of the conference, will you simply forward the decisions taken to the Provisional Ruling Council, or will you insert your own comments by way of recommendations and so on? [Okandi] No, our recommendations will be put there and without trying to forecast the work of the commission. Whether the views as reached by the conference will be final or not will be determined by my commission when they formulate the agenda. [Odunfa] It is not sure yet that the views of the conference will be final? [Okandi] No, you see, I am speaking to you just as one member. The members have not got to that stage, but I am sure the members of the commission already know what the public want, and I can assure you, our work will reflect the mood and aspirations of Nigerians. [Odunfa] Will the conference appoint its own officers. [Okandi] The conference... [pauses] I daresay, that will be part of the recommendations the commission will make and we have not got to that stage yet. [end recording]
