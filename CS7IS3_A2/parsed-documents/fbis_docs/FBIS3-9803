During 1993 and 1994 the number of Albanians killed along the border with the Republic of the Former Yugoslavia amounts to 14 and eight have been injured; along the border with The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM] one has been killed and three injured; and along the border the Republic of Greece we note the latest case, dated 22 March 1994, which resulted in one person killed. Albanian official sources report that in the Greek village of Kostinec, 3 km into Greek territory, 21-year-old Fredi Abaz Muca, a resident of Bubullime village in Lushnje, was shot by an automatic rifle pointed at his chest. The Albanian Helsinki Committee asks the Greek authorities to take the necessary measures to investigate the incident that occurred and eventually convict in a court of law the person who caused the crime, on the basis of Greek laws currently in effect. The committee simultaneously requests that such cases be stopped and not repeated as they flagrantly violate human rights and create tension in the friendly relations that exist between the Greek and Albanian Republics.
