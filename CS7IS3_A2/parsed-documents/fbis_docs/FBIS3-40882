The consultant to Indonesia on PLTN construction concluded that economically a medium-sized PLTN would be very competitive and could be operational in the Java-Bali electric power network beginning in 2004. Of the three prospective sites on the Muria Peninsula of central Java, Cape Lemahabang would best accommodate a 7,000-megawatt PLTN, followed by Cape Grenggengan and Cape Watu. "I am confident that NewJec's recommendation will receive support from the government in its subsequent consideration of building a PLTN in Indonesia," Djali said when the reports were submitted. Djali also said that the government's approval is sufficient for this PLTN construction. Japan and Britain did not involve their parliaments, either. "NewJec's recommendation also did not state a need for opinion from the Indonesian public," he said. KOMPAS contacted several prominent community figures to ask their positions on the building of this PLTN. Abdurrahman Wahid, nicknamed Gus Dur, chairman of the NU [Muslim Scholars League: Are you referring to the plan to build a PLTN in the Muria Peninsula area of central Java? Muria, like the northern coastal area of the island of Java, from Karawang to Cirebon, to Kendal, to the eastern end of the island, and to Madura, is NU's base. I have an interest in taking part in discussion. If there should be an accident, NU members would be affected. From the beginning I have stressed that the risk of nuclear accident must be calculated before construction. Do not make just an abstract study: The mountain is safe, and such things. It must be concrete with quantitative data. To be 100-percent convincing, the risk of nuclear accident must be seriously calculated. There must be "full proof." Not even a hair's breadth can be missing. The Muria area is surrounded by water. There are mountains. The area is in danger of earthquakes. The arguments of the government and officials on the urgency of building a PLTN have not yet convinced me. The urgency is not yet great. Therefore, the government must consider a "public hearing." To say that government approval is sufficient for building a PLTN is arrogance and conceit on the part of bureaucrats. One group that absolutely should be heard from is environment lovers. They have "concerns" and have studied the PLTN. The government must bear humanitarian responsibility if an accident should occur, because the decision to build a PLTN is a political decision. I recommend that considerations should be based on caution. The NU always uses caution as a basis for its considerations. Let me give an example. If a judge has a little doubt about the death penalty, he must give jail punishment instead. In the case of building a PLTN, if there is still a little question about danger to people, construction of the PLTN must be canceled. Anyway, without a PLTN, Indonesia is not going to be 100 years behind. What will I do now? I am still studying the matter. The pouring of concrete is still a long way off. If construction takes place, I want to hold a fast there before concrete pouring is started. Muria is one of the NU's bases. I have an interest there. Y.B. Mangunwijaya, Catholic priest and cultural expert: The building of a PLTN in Indonesia cannot be viewed as good or bad, feasible or unfeasible, scientific or unscientific. The PLTN is a project that will be developed because of prestige and power. Therefore, looking at it and commenting on it must be through political glasses. In this case, I cannot comment as to power or prestige outside my area. I cannot take part in stating approval or disapproval of the construction of this PLTN. I am merely a member of the general public without any power. Furthermore, if we are talking about power, a community structure does not exist. The one with the right to speak is the "power owner," who will manage and maintain it and who possesses power. I do not have any voice. Because PLTN construction is a matter of power, the result of the feasibility study is certain to be "feasible." In fact, even before it was made, the study was already "feasible." The feasibility study was needed only for seeking credit and funds for building and financing it, and so on. Mochtar Lubis, reporter and cultural expert: The construction of the PLTN must be left to the people or to the DPR [Parliament], which represents them. Nuclear technology is very dangerous. It is not appropriate for merely one minister to decide on the building of a PLTN for a nation. Djali Ahimsa's answer and attitude demonstrates the arrogance of power, as though he knows best what this nation needs. I am anti-PLTN 200 percent, in fact, 1,000 percent. There is no further doubt about its danger. From the aspect of culture, I do not believe that the technological discipline of Indonesians is sufficient for handling PLTN technology. There is still human negligence even in France, the United States, and Russia, where there is discipline. I also do not believe Indonesians are able to handle modern technology. What I know is that Indonesian engineers can only connect cables and wires. I recommend that the people be the ones to decide the need, or lack of it, for PLTN construction. This should be done through a referendum. Whether the people approve or not is up to them. Aburizal Bakrie, businessman, president commissioner of the Bakrie Group: I have two contradictory views in reaction to the building of a PLTN. As general chairman of the Indonesian Association of Engineers, I agree. Nuclear power is a clean technology, and we have mastered the technology. The price, too, is reasonable. However, my question is, for what are we going to use the large coal assets in Kalimantan? As a businessman, I naturally prefer coal-fired PLTU's [steam-powered electric power plants]. The point is, I have a coal mining business. Ha, ha, ha. There are other concerns as to PLTN operation. The cheap electricity will interest industrialized countries in relocating their industries to Indonesia. Those industries that will be relocated reportedly will be those that pollute the environment. That can be overcome by environmental protection, however. Environmental protection can also be applied to coal-fired PLTU's. Why, then, not do it to coal-fired PLTU's? Besides being an abundant natural resource, it is readily available and does not need to be imported. Kwik Kian Gie, a director of the PDI [Indonesian Democratic Party] DPP [Central Executive Council]: "I have delegated discussion of the PLTN to Kwik. He represents me, as well as the PDI DPP," PDI DPP General Director Megawati Sukarnoputri told KOMPAS. Therefore, Kwik was the one to respond. With regard to the PLTN, the PDI DPP focuses attention on its safety. I am very doubtful. Just look at the case of the Cernobyl disaster. There has never been a detailed and open explanation about PLTN technical questions or economic aspects, either. Therefore, I am not able to make much comment. I can only express opinion as to the danger. Hamzah Haz, chairman of the DPR FPP [Development Unity Faction]: Is the PLTN to be built by 2004? Not feasible. The current account deficit and the national balance of payments are in a serious condition because development still depends on foreign loans. Also, our exports are not yet as we had hoped, particularly considering that our annual export growth target has to be about 18 percent. Although the condition of the APBN [National Budget] is improving, it will not change significantly by the year 2004. The PLTN can be classified as a "megaproject" requiring large funding from overseas. Do we want to repeat the action of cutting off half-completed megaprojects through tight-money policies in order to improve the APBN? If the government proceeds with its intention to build a PLTN megaproject, it should reestimate the prospects for national industry through the end of REPELITA VI [Sixth Five-Year Development Plan]. Will industry continue to expand and be all the more competitive, or not? Will construction of the PLTN have a direct impact on investment and our non-oil-and-gas exports, or not? If the answer is yes, the DPR perhaps should restudy the possibilities for construction. The decision to build a PLTN installation or not should be based on technoeconomic calculations and the desires of the people. The government should not make the people an "object" of development. Although it may be technoeconomically feasible to build PLTN, if the people then feel that it will interfere with social and environmental security, the project should merely be canceled. Krissantono, member of DPR Commission I from the FKP [Functional Group Faction]: From the aspect of financing as well as future consequences, the PLTN is a megaproject. Politically, several projects that were built in the public interest still have a negative impact. Examples are Kedungombo and Nipah. In such cases, the victim is always the community around the project. They become "objects" of development, despite the fact that the GBHN [Broad Outline of State Policy] clearly states that the Indonesian people must be the "subject" of development and not the "object." Cases like Kedungombo and Nipah must not be repeated. It is my understanding that the GBHN states that the people are the main players in development and the government merely encourages from the rear. What confuses me is that the statement by the BATAN director general is contradictory to the intent of the GBHN. The role of the people as the principal player in development is not seen in his statement, because the government wants to be in front. If that is the case, truth is only as seen through the glasses of the government. [passage omitted]
