"Depending on the sides' reaction to the proposal, Russia plans further steps aiming at termination of combat operations in Nagorno- Karabakh," said the diplomat. Bloody fighting around Nagorno-Karabakh has been on since the second half of December 1993. It has claimed the lives of several thousands of people and wounded another several thousands, mainly the attackers. "The new escalation of combat operations is even more senseless as heads of all the warring sides admit the conflict has no military solution and make statements favoring political settlement. The bloodshed recurrence hampers peace-making efforts of Russia and international organizations," stressed the Foreign Ministry spokesman.
