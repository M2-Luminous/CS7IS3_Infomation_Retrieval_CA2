Katsuya Ikeda, 56, a former House of Representatives legislator of Komeito, which is now in the ruling coalition, was questioned by his defense council and prosecutors at the Tokyo District Court about his alleged involvement in the scandal. He denied all the charges against him. In May 1989, prosecutors indicted Ikeda without arresting him, on charges of receiving 5,000 unlisted shares of Recruit Cosmos, a real estate company, and 7 million yen in cash from Hiromasa Ezoe, founder and then chairman of Recruit Co., a major publisher of job information magazines, in September 1986. The shares appreciated considerably after being listed. Ikeda is accused of taking the shares and the money in return for acting on the firm's behalf in the Diet in 1984 and 1985, when a "gentlemen's agreement" that companies fix the date to recruit university graduates was on the verge of becoming a titular accord. Ikeda said his Diet questioning was not done on behalf of the firm. In response to his defense council's questioning on the issue, Ikeda said he already had an interest in problems of job placement for university students before he was asked by Recruit to bring up the issue in the Diet as asserted by prosecutors. Ikeda said he began to have an interest in the job placement accord around 1977 just after becoming a member of the lower house and had a recognition the accord would be difficult to observe. Along with Ikeda, then Chief Cabinet Secretary Takao Fujinami of the then ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), was indicted in the influence-peddling scandal. Fujinami is being tried on charges of receiving Recruit Cosmos shares before their flotation as a bribe from Ezoe, 57, for similar favors to the firm. The stocks-for-favors scandal involved secretaries or relatives of LDP heavyweights such as former Premiers Yasuhiro Nakasone, Noboru Takeshita, Kiichi Miyazawa and former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe. Takeshita, then prime minister, and Miyazawa, then finance minister, were forced to resign because of the scandal.
