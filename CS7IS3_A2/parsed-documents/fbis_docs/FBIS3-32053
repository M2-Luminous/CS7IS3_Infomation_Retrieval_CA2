It was reported that after two days of discussions in Geneva, the GATT signatories said they will form a panel to debate U.S. protectionism for the tobacco market. The long dispute initiated by Brazil, Chile, Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Thailand, and Zimbabwe is aimed at modifying U.S. legislation regarding the use of imported tobacco by domestic industries. At this moment, 75 percent of the tobacco that is used for U.S. cigarette production comes from U.S. suppliers.
