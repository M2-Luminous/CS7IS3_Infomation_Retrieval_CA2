In the words of a senior Russian diplomat, the negotiations have been quite tough, although the sides have revealed some encouraging signs. Nonetheless, in his opinion, the achievement of an agreement within the next two-three days is hardly possible for political, military, and technical reasons. An accord must fix a disengagement line between the Serbs and the Moslems, a line which in their view, could be a frontier for a long time. The negotiators have been bargaining for virtually each mile of the mountain terrain. This does not portend a quick completion of the negotiating process, the diplomat said. However, he did not rule out that an accord could be signed already next week.
