Commenting on his nonattendance, a spokesman at Ozawa's office said: "He does not have any special plans. But he may be feeling a little fatigued." However, as Mr. Ozawa is not known for missing plenary Diet sessions, the rumor has started that his absence was a silent protest against the prime minister's failure to reshuffle the cabinet. Mr. Ozawa missed a meeting of the government and ruling party leaders held on the night of 2 March, at which the prime minister announced his decision to postpone a cabinet reshuffle. Since then, Mr. Ozawa has made no appearances at the Diet where he has previously appeared regularly. A senior Shinseito staff member said: "He is not exactly dissatisfied with the prime minister, but rather irritated by the fact the political outlook has become uncertain. Although he may not make an appearance for about a week, he will show up sooner or later."
