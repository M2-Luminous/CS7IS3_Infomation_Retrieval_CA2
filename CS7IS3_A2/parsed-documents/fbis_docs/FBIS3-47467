The provision stipulates retaliation against trading nations that refuse to liberalize their markets or discriminate against U.S. exports. Insisting that such action would go against the spirit of Japan- U.S. economic consultations, Takemura said he would urge prudence on part of the United States. [Begin Takemura recording] Our agreement is that we should maximize our efforts at dialogue. I think what they are proposing would go against the spirit of dialogue. I would like to ask that they be prudent as far as remarks on exercising the Super 301 provision are concerned. [end recording] Takemura's comments indicated the government would ask the United States to be cautious about reviving the Super 301 provisions.
