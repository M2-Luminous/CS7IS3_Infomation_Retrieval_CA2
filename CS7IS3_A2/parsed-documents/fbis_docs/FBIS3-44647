It has also decided to abolish some measures concerning tax reduction and exemption for imported automobiles. A spokesman with the General Administration of Customs of the People's Republic of China said the decision of the State Council to reduce tariffs on imported automobiles and adjust relevant measures concerning tax exemption would create conditions for conducting competition on an equal basis and preserving fair taxation, as well as promoting the development of China's auto industry and improving the country's investment environment. He explained that too many or loosely designed tax reduction and exemption measures would not be conducive to exercising control over imports of automobiles or suit the demands of building a socialist market economic structure. He believed that too many such measures would also seriously weaken macro-control over tariffs and give rise to smuggling and tariff evasion. According to him, all those importing automobiles must pay import duties and other related taxes at the local customs, except those organizations and personnel who may continue to enjoy tax reductions and exemptions in accordance with the international treaties to which China is a party or agreements signed between the Chinese and foreign governments. Foreign cars sent by international organizations and foreign governments as gifts will not be subject to full taxation either. Estimates from Chinese automobile trading firms show that about 400,000 foreign-made cars and vans entered the mainland market in 1993. In the meantime, the number of cars and vans smuggled into China last year was about 100,000, compared with 90,000 in 1992.
