The deadline, which was unilaterally established by the U.S. Government last May when actions were taken against Brazil in response to a request made by the U.S. Pharmaceutical Industry Association, is 28 February. Many talks have been held at various levels following the meeting between Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor here in Washington on 16 February. The implementation of commercial sanctions against Brazilian exports by the U.S. Government has not been averted. But it is no longer the only choice as it was before the visit of the foreign minister. If the negotiations go well in the next few days and lead to similar positions on the main points of disagreement, the U.S. trade representative could, for example, say that the understanding produced sufficient progress to justify the suspension of the action but that the U.S. Government reserves the right to resume the case and retaliate if Brazil does not honor its commmitments within a reasonable time. The terms of the Brazilian commitment are in the note that Brazilian Ambassador to Washington Paulo Tarso Flecha de Lima delivered to Kantor the day before the visit of the Brazilian foreign minister. In the note the Brazilian Government offered to submit amendments to the new industrial property code bill which is being debated in the Senate to make the Brazilian regulation for intellectual property protection compatible with the TRIPPS [Trade Related Intellectual Property Protection System] which was approved by the Uruguay Round of the GATT last December. The amendments to the code will reportedly resolve the differences between Brasilia and Washington on Article 27 of the TRIPPS which is the most important of the four differences that the U.S. Government considers to be "critical." Until recently the Brazilian Foreign Ministry argued that the demand for "domestic registration" of pharmaceutical patents which is in the industrial property code bill that was approved by the Chamber of Deputies last year was compatible with the TRIPPS which is reportedly "ambiguous" on that issue. The U.S. trade representative said, however, that the Brazilian interpretation is incompatible with the TRIPPS and that it would not resist a discussion in the GATT.
