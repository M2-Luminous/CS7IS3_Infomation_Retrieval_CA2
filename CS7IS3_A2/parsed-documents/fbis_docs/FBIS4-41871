An ITAR-TASS correspondent learned from trustworthy sources that the summit is planned for the first week in September. Andrey Kozyrev described the forthcoming summit as a "landmark" in Russo-Chinese relations which, in his words, are now developing in a stable manner. Qian Qichen agreed with this assessment. He noted, however, that "certain issues have arisen" in what is, on the whole, a dynamic trade exchange between the two countries, and overcoming these would make it possible to increase business ties more successfully. In the words of the Russian minister, the sides discussed the Korean nuclear problem in quite some detail. "We are agreed on ensuring the nonnuclear status of the Korean peninsula and on seeking political solutions," Andrey Kozyrev said. He added that the Russian proposal to hold a multilateral conference on the Korean issue still stands. Both China and Russia, Qian Qichen said, are very close neighbors of the Korean peninsula, and both countries want a settlement of the difficulties over Korea. As for the Russian initiative, China regards this proposal "with understanding." However, it believes that "the appropriate conditions are required" for it to be put into practice.
