He said Cambodia wanted to learn from Malaysia's experience in developing its rural areas which contributed to the elimination of the communist terrorists. The rural development policies of the Malaysian Government were also successful in maintaining national unity, he told reporters after a briefing at the Rural Development Ministry here. The briefing was given by the ministry's Planning and Coordination Division Head Zakaria Mohamed Taib. Sirivut, who is also minister of foreign affairs and international cooperation, said Cambodia needed to develop its rural areas to stop its people from supporting the communists' armed struggle. For example, if they get water supply, rural industries, jobs and so on, the need to fight would no longer exist, he said. He said Cambodians could live and work peacefully once they put their trust in the government to implement rural development programmes. Sirivut commended Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed for playing a major role in Malaysia's success and also invited Rural Development Minister Annuar Musa to visit Cambodia. The Cambodian deputy premier arrived Sunday with a 10-member delegation for a three-day official visit. He will meet Dr. Mahathir Tuesday.
