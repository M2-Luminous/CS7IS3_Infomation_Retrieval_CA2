"We were relieved when the inspections finally took place, so we can't but feel concern over the current situation," Hata told a press conference after a cabinet meeting. Hata was referring to reports that the IAEA inspectors were barred from certain activities in inspecting North Korea's nuclear facilities. On Monday, an IAEA source said the North Koreans placed some restrictions on the activities of the seven-member team, though the agency's spokesman declined to comment on the details of the inspection. Also, in Monday's edition of the CHUNGANG ILBO, a major South Korean newspaper, an unidentified government official was quoted as saying the team was barred from removing samples of nuclear materials from one facility for laboratory tests. If such restrictions took place, or if it is confirmed that nuclear materials have been diverted for military purposes, the IAEA will convene a special meeting to consider referring the matter to the U.N. Security Council for further action. An IAEA spokesman said a decision on whether such a meeting is called could be made within this week, depending on the content of the inspection team's report. The spokesman said the IAEA team had concluded its schedule of inspections of North Korea's seven declared nuclear facilities. The IAEA inspections, which began March 3, were the first allowed by North Korea in about a year. The team is scheduled to depart for Vienna via Beijing on Tuesday.
