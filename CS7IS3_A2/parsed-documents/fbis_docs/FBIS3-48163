The conference listened to 19 opinions expressed by delegates of different sectors, localities, and the armed forces. The opinions were almost totally in agreement with the political report on the achievements scored in the last two years, the four challenging dangers, and the main duties in the coming period. Most of the opinions concentrated on the analysis of the four challenging dangers. They emphasized the possibility that our country might be left behind at a great distance by regional and other countries. They said that economic lagging also has political meaning because it is the manifestation of a backward general policy and not a practical economic policy. Regarding the danger of peaceful evolution against socialism from enemies, the delegates held that it is not only an external danger but an internal danger as well. The reality of the situation is that many reactionary groups have returned from foreign countries to oppose and sabotage our country. This danger, if we are not vigilant, it will become a reality. With respect to corruption, the opinions held that corruption is not only practiced by a few people, but it resembles an organization which operates from a system existing in state organs. Corruption it not only tied to a conception of morality, it also carries political meaning. Therefore, in order to stop this danger, uniform measures must be applied. The first of these measures is the education of cadres and party members. In the implementation of a market mechanism and door-open policy to the outside world, we need to further strengthen the consolidation of our armed forces and the maintenance of social security and order. Through analysis, most of the delegates held that the basic nature of these four dangers is the class struggle and who will triumph over whom. As for future duties, the delegates discussed the definitions of the terms of transferring economic structures and developing industry with regard to the modernization of the national economy. They said the transfer of economic structures creates great values for key leading industries on the basis of exploiting national potential and intelligence. Therefore, we must continue to pay attention to economic development and investment for mountainous and Central Highland areas. In industrial development, we have to strengthen processing industries and improve tree planting structures in agricultural areas. By doing so, these areas can provide raw materials for different industrial sectors. We must increase our exports and encourage the use of our locally made products. Tomorrow, 23 January, the MNPC delegates will continue to work at the conference hall.
