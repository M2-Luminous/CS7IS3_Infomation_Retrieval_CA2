(President, Kosaku Inaba) has disclosed that they have been negotiating with a major French space engine manufacturer, Societe Europeene Propulsione (SEP, HQS in Le Ariane) Company, for export of the bearing cage used for the H-2 rocket engine's liquid hydrogen turbopump. The H-2 was launched successfully by Japan. At SEP's request, IHI has already shipped samples at cost. At present, SEP is conducting its technical evaluation. If this deal is successful, it will constitute Japan's first home-developed export in the field of space rocket components. The bearing cage is the heart of the rocket engine supply system, which plays a supporting role in light-weight, high-horsepower, high-thrust turbo engines. The cage was developed by IHI in cooperation with the National Space Development Agency (NASDA) and the National Aerospace Laboratory (NAL). Its value was verified during the successful H-2 rocket launch. It proved extremely durable and strong under the most severe environments, and demonstrated lubricity at temperatures even 250 degrees C below 0. The life span of the cage can be lengthened by using glass fiber reinforced composite material for the base material. The glass fiber on the surface was removed to an appropriate depth through melting in order to bring the steel ball and lubricating material into smoother contact. SEP, which is in charge of a portion of production of the large ``Ariane'' rocket run by the European Union (EU), had maintained contact with IHI and showed special interest in the processing technology for the bearing cage since its R&D stage. IHI held discussions with the Ministry of International Trade and Industry to be sure the cage will be limited to peaceful purposes, and concluded that its export will create no problems. Based on specifications and drawing prepared by SEP, IHI produced and delivered 20 sample bearing cages with the property test reports. SEP paid approximately Â¥20 million to cover the cost. SEP is currently in the process of re-examining the samples based on these test reports. If this business deal goes through, 100 units per order, depending on European rocket launch schedules, are expected to be made. If the samples are acceptable for use, SEP is expected to install them aboard the ``Ariane-5'' which is scheduled for launch beginning in 1996.
