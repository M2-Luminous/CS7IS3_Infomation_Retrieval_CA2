[Council members] I do. [Caldera] If so, may God and the fatherland honor you; if not, may they hold you accountable. [Unidentified announcer] Members will now sign the minutes. [passage omitted] [Caldera] This will be the organization in charge of promoting and coordinating the various economic, political, cultural, ethnic, ecological, and other activities about which all Venezuelans should be concerned, as well as about the people who live in these most remote areas of our country. The National Border Council is not tasked with demarcation. Such matters are the concern of the Foreign Ministry, under the direction of the president of the Republic. They are, as I said, responsible for promoting, coordinating, and directing the various activities that deal with the human presence along our country's borders, the people's development in bordering towns. This is not simply a demographic and statistical effort but also entails a number of issues regarding the concept of sustainable development and the need to affirm national sovereignty all across the fatherland. I must thank State Minister Pompeyo Marquez for having accepted this mission, perhaps the most important assignment I have entrusted upon him as a state minister. I must also thank the members who will accompany the state ministers as advisers on border issues. Among these people are Monsignor Ignacio Velasco, the Bishop of Ayacucho, who has extensive experience in such areas and who is a proven patriotic spirit; the mayors of Gran Sabana and Caroni Municipality, who represent the human presence in the region. They are a symbol of municipal participation, the basic nucleus of the political community in this effort that we intend to pursue vigorously. The Venezuelan border is extensive and varied. Certain portions are highly populated, such as the border region between Venezuela's Tachira State and Norte Santander in Colombia; many other portions have been neglected, and certain portions are marked by geographical lines, others by the course of rivers and streams. More than the limits or our sovereignty, certain areas frequently become corridors for incursions that are not always the most convenient for our countries. Many times these incursions bring disturbances, even crimes. This extensive border covers very different landscapes. From Piedra del Cocuy, where our border with Brazil begins, to Santa Elena de Uairen, the border separates two countries that have lived with their backs to each other for many years. Now they are seriously concerned with uniting their initiatives and coordinating their possibilities, to the benefit of the communities living on either side of the border. There are, then, many problems regarding this issue, including our insular domains, which have often been neglected by geographers throughout history. The potential here is enormous, and the possibilities are many for the future economic and social development of the Venezuelan nation. Promoting interest among Venezuelans to know, occupy, and defend their borders is a task that must not be delayed; this is why we have given this ceremony such special importance. In recalling the founding of this institution, which we are reactivating today, I feel obligated to mention a leading collaborator, an outstanding Venezuelan foreign minister whose name was Aristides Calvani. Aristides Calvani, the foreign minister during my first administration, played a significantly important and admirable role in matters of state, with a passion for the fatherland and an overwhelming interest and desire to serve. At this time, as is just, I would like to express my recognition and gratitude to such a statesman. I thank all those present here today for accompanying us. I hope your presence here is a demonstration of your commitment; it is, however, a reciprocal commitment. The government's commitment is to address seriously the problems facing the National Border Council. The commitment of all sectors and levels of the civilian and political community is not to look upon Venezuela's responsibility regarding its border regions with indifference. Border development problems are not only the government's responsibility; they are everyone's problem, just like so many other issues that frequently frustrate and annoy us so much. To find a final solution, then, the government needs the constant help of all Venezuelans. I reaffirm my gratitude for those accompanying us today. I also reaffirm my conviction toward this and other essential issues, that are so often looked upon with little concern or interest, and that will make Venezuela recognize the need to present itself proud and aware of its possibilities toward the 21st century.
