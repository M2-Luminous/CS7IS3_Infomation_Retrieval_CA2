Enrile To Become Chief of Staff Editorial on Enrile as New Chief BK1904093894 Manila THE MANILA CHRONICLE in English 6 Apr 94 p 4 BK1904093894 Manila THE MANILA CHRONICLE English BFN [Editorial: "Enrile A Good Choice"] [Text] By appointing Lt. Gen. Arturo Enrile over more senior nominees as Armed Forces chief of staff, President Ramos reaffirmed his policy of not appointing any officer to key positions in the uniformed service if they are retiring within six months of their appointment. The policy was earlier upheld when the president reappointed Superintendent Umberto Rodriguez as director-general of the Philippine National Police (PNP). The new appointment has been generally welcomed by various sectors. It helps that General Enrile is popular and well-liked in the defense and military establishment. This early, it is easy to see that Enrile's appointment will breeze through the Commission on Appointments and public opinion circles, unlike the Rodriguez appointment which has been hounded by controversy since the start not because of the PNP chief's qualifications but of the overall problematic state of the police. It also helps that General Enrile has more or less been groomed for the post. The new chief of staff was catapulted into national prominence when as superintendent of the Philippine Military Academy, he negotiated the surrender of army mutineers in the 1989 coup attempt against [former President] Corazon C. Aquino. He was a possible successor to Renato de Villa when the latter retired as chief of staff in 1991; Mrs. Aquino, however, chose Lisandro Abadia and named Enrile army chief President Ramos chose General Enrile as the new chief of staff over more senior officers without risking a backlash from the military establishment. Such would have been inconceivable three years ago when the air was charged with recrimination and suspicion over appointments to the military service, a hangover from the martial-law years when the military controlled the political life of the nation. In fact, Mrs. Aquino suffered the indignity of having to justify her choice of Abadia when the deputy chief of staff at that time, Alexander Aguirre, protested that he had been bypassed and charged that the appointment was politically motivated. It is to the credit of Abadia that he had stayed non-partisan during his stint, thereby proving Aguirre wrong. During the 1992 synchronized elections, the military under Abadia tried to stay above politics and ensured a democratic and peaceful turnover of power. Minus his unfortunate indiscreet and rather arrogant remarks on how he refused businessmen's offers to lead a coup against Mrs. Aquino before the 1992 election, Abadia was a good chief of staff who was successful in disciplining and professionalizing the Armed Forces. It is hoped that Enrile would continue with Abadia's reforms. There is another dimension to the Enrile appointment. The naming of another Army man as chief of staff and not, say, Vice Chief of Staff Mariano Dumancas who is a Navy man, shows that despite the dwindling fortunes of the various insurgencies, the military will still play a prominent, though diminishing, role in counter-insurgency. Earlier, the deadline for the PNP to take over the counter-insurgency operations from the military was extended for another two years. It is expected that by 1996, the insurgencies would have abated as to allow the military to turn over the offensive against rebels to the police. By that time, the military would be able to concentrate fully on its essential role: defending the country against external aggression and other threats to its national security. To speed up the transition, it would do well for Congress to finally pass the bill modernizing the Armed Forces and keeping our defense capability at par with that of our neighbors in the region who have embarked on an alarming arms build-up. The modernization bill has been held by bureaucratic incompetence; apparently the military and the Executive could only provide ballpark figures on the costs of modernization that are much like those aimless growth and fiscal targets churned out regularly by our economic planners. The senators doubt the veracity of the figures. There is support for the bill in Congress, especially the Senate, but the Armed Forces and the Executive must get their act together.
