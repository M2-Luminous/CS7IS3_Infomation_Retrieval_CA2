One the one hand they said his move was not fair play with respect to his colleague [former council chairman] Misu Negritoiu, while on the other they said that Cosea's gesture had been made out of his loyalty to reform. Was it vanity and his wish to climb up the ladder, or rather taking on a burden he could not avoid? The various opinions were identical merely in two points, namely that Cosea's appointment will be beneficial for the party [the PDSR], and that the process initiated by Negritoiu will continue, as Cosea is the sole trully reform-oriented member of the Vacaroiu government. His predecessor's role as the father of the theory of reform and as a "decorative object" to cultivate the West's delight seemed to be concluded. Before accepting his appointment, Cosea asked, and they promised, that they would grant him, full decision-making power. Today, five months later, Cosea is only allowed to decide upon who should be hired as cleaning personnel in his ministry. In all other issues he solely "involves" himself. Although he acted as a rebel during cabinet meetings, he still managed to be on good terms with Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu and with the other members of the cabinet, without being vehemently opposed, the way his predecessor, Negritoiu, was. However, recently he still found himself in a similar situation: They threatened to have him deposed. His position as the second man in the government seems to be too important and craved for by others. Thus, Cosea was the first case to which the National Romanian Unity Party's [PUNR's] demands referred to: All ministers should be party members. The first compromise step was followed by a second [reference to the fact that Cosea recently joined the PSDR]. What was it this time? Was it feebleness, opportunism, or rather wisdom and readiness to assume the risks? Of course, he must have agreed with a certain reluctance and only after negotiations regarding, among other things, the leadership of State Property Fund [FPS]. But one should always watch out for the Trojan horse! One should always watch out for the PDSR, even if promised something. Cosea thought that, being inside that party, he could impose his point of view and forgot about the other side of the coin, namely about the party discipline that is valid for all party members, and which should be obeyed particularly by the "greenhorns" and the "ordinary" members who hold no party office. He is allowed to express his opinions about economic issues while in Davos, Switzerland, but forbidden to express political views in Bucharest, Romania. His party boss, [PDSR Executive Chairman] Adrian Nastase, considers that [PDSR Deputy Chairman Ioan] Manzatu, for instance, is a far more authorized and experienced person to make such statements. Anyway, in the future it may be interesting to see just how far Cosea will go and how far the PDSR is prepared to go along with him. "My Joining the Party Cannot Be Interpreted As an Adherence Coming From My Heart and Soul" [Lazar] You have repeatedly stated that you were and would always be a politically independent person. However, recently you enrolled in the ruling party, saying that otherwise you could not put up with so much pressure. Do you think that you will be more powerful acting from within that party? [Cosea] Yes, I believe that I will be more powerful acting from within the party, but I will not use it for personal purposes, but rather for the implementation of the action in which I have involved myself so much, namely the implementation of the accord concluded with IMF [International Monetary Fund]. That accord would eliminate the lag between Romanian reform and those in the neighboring countries, because that is the major discrepancy, not the one between the development stages of our economies. The balance of power in our parliament is very fragile. This spirit of revenge and the continuous political strife are quite tiresome for us, all those who are working on our economy. It has become an obsession that our reform is being blocked by either one of the opponent parties, and my position as a politically independent person has been looked upon with suspicion by the political groupings that do not seem to comprehend that, in the current stage of Romania's development, economy should be a unique issue for all political parties. That is why I reached the conclusion that I need very substantial political support, not merely to keep the reform going on while it is still hot, but also for me to achieve more strength for the struggle I wage in my relations with various structures. My joining the party cannot be interpreted as an adherence coming from my heart and soul. I am far too rational a person and too tired of this transition period to believe in enthusiasm and swaggering adhesion statements. [Lazar] Did they request you to join the PDSR to keep your ministerial office? [Cosea] The PDSR had lured me to join the government without naming any terms at that time, but rather by accepting the program and the ideas I was circulating publicly, as well as my whole activity, which did contest certain structures. Perhaps, the surprise some people experienced when I joined that party might have been attenuated had they considered the fact that the latest measures, goals, economic forecasts, and even the short-term programs advanced recently by the PDSR are considerably different compared to those it proposed during the [1992] electoral campaign. The recent ones are much closer to what one could term "the spirit of reform," regardless of whether one wishes to admit it or not. [Lazar] Did your keeping the office of chairman of the Reform Council weigh more in the balance than remaining a politically independent economist? [Cosea] As you have already noted, after my experience with the Communist Party, I did assert that I would remain an independent person, although, to tell you frankly, none of the parties of today's Romania has a clear-cut ideology. On the other hand, very many intellectuals fully engaged in the implementation of reform feel the need to unite their efforts under a certain guardianship. The attempts to unite us within special professional groups, I am talking about the Romanian Society of Economy, have not satisfied that need, because we need political support in our struggle. Well, it seems that, today, our parties will only grant such support to their members. It is a pity that the main issue seems to be one's party membership rather than the fact that one is a promoter of reform. "If They Do Not Sign the Accord With the IMF, My Offer To Resign Remains Valid" [Lazar] A daily printed on yellow paper [reference to the daily CRONICA ROMANA] recently claimed that you might fall victim to the cabinet reshuffle because you threatened to resign too often. After the political move you have made [by joining the ruling party] the cabinet reshuffle will not affect you personally. However, is your assertion still valid, namely that you would resign if the accord concluded with the IMF is not signed by Romania? [Cosea] Of course it remains valid and it can even be extended over other elements. You see, I am not just any government member, I am the chairman of the Reform Council. My whole concept related to the reform of Romania's economy is based on two principles: foreign financing and internal restructuring. This means that without foreign financing I would be unable to implement the reform and therefore, certainly, my offer to resign remains valid. [Lazar] Our accord with the IMF could have become effective as early as December last year, or January, had the interests of our political parties not prevailed. Have you assessed the costs of those delays for Romania's economy? [Cosea] I hoped very much that the accord would become effective rapidly. December might have been a utopia, but it ought to have been January. The reform is currently blocked owing to the lack of foreign assistance. Whether we like it or not, whether we so wish or not, the IMF represents the sole chance we have of making any changes this year. It is impossible to evaluate the costs you mentioned, how much and so on. However, the delays can be measured. These delays mean great difficulty in the adjusting of our foreign currency policy, of our foreign currency reserve, and especially -- this is a very grave thing -- no funds are available from the World Bank. [Lazar] How much money did we miss from the World Bank? [Cosea] This year, the World Bank was to finance extremely important programs, such as the educational and agricultural programs, those intended to revive our oil industry, and so on. If one considers the losses caused by the blocking of the modernization of particular branches, an evaluation can be done and its results are certainly very serious. However, I would like to avoid being too pessimistic and I do not want to dishearten your readers either. Not all time has been wasted yet. If we can resort to foreign financing by the middle of March, at the latest, we will still have real chances of implementing those programs. However, this presupposes that, before that, all political interests and relations should be cleared up among the parties and that parliament passes the [IMF] memorandum. Under such circumstances, I think I have made it quite obvious that the political involvement of the persons who negotiated the document is extremely important. "The Memorandum Is the Basis of the Government Program" [Lazar] Might the memorandum be considered as an equivalent of the government program, at least in this year, when the government is expected to explicitly assume responsibility for it? [Cosea] The memorandum is the basis of the government program. However, those two documents cannot be identical, because there is a great many details and particular elements that ought to be taken into consideration. Aside from that, I fully agree with you that the memorandum represents the basis, the basic structure, the skeleton of the government program. [Lazar] Why does the PDSR fear that the opposition will vote against the memorandum, considering that many of the principles of that document also occur in the programs of the opposition parties? [Cosea] As I stated when I returned from Washington, I am personally convinced that the opposition, judging from everything it has declared and done so far, will prove to be open to the idea of foreign financing, and especially that it will favor all methods intended to speed up reform. Their [the PDSR's] fear comes from the specific nature of Romanian parliamentary and political life, with its constant ambushes and guerrilla warfare. They are afraid that the balance of political forces might be altered in parliament, which is quite possible if the memorandum is submitted to a vote. Although I do not wish to be a Dutch uncle, I would still like to suggest that the issue of the memorandum should be taken out of the category of politically opportune issues, because it is far too important for that and I do not think that any of our parties could afford to sacrifice 23 million people for the sake of a few more seats in parliament. [Lazar] I think we should clear up certain things. Who requested that the memorandum should be passed by parliament? As far as I know, is was the wish of the Romanian Government, rather than that of the IMF, as was being claimed today. [Cosea] You can find the answer to that in something that happened more recently. Previously, the memorandum was presented to parliament by [former Prime Minister Theodor] Stolojan. It was the premier's wish to be fully open about what he was doing. He did that because they criticized the way in which the previous memorandum had been concluded. Stolojan presented the memorandum, but he did not have it submitted to a vote. However, one can say that this tradition served as a basis for the way things were conceived for this year. The IMF suggested that the memorandum should be presented to parliament. However, during our difficult and quite lengthy negotiations, they repeatedly resorted to the argument that the Romanian party lacks credibility. [Lazar] What were the causes of that lack of credibility? [Cosea] Above all it was the fact that the stipulations of the previous accords had not been fully carried out. Second, the continuous political fighting in parliament created the impression abroad, and I am sure that this impression still exists, that the government alone does not have the ability to vouch for the implementation of the document. All this led to the idea that the memorandum should be presented and submitted to the vote of parliament. By this, the IMF tried to ensure that the opposition knows the stipulations included in the memorandum and consents to those terms. [Lazar] Don't you think that this has made things even more complicated? [Cosea] Of course we made things more complicated for ourselves, because we could have bypassed parliament. However, I still think that its endorsement is very necessary and, therefore, in my opinion, this tradition should be maintained for future negotiations as well. As you said, the IMF accord represents an important part of Romania's government program. The IMF accord gives that government program precisely the things it lacked initially: concreteness and a practical aspect. "What Romania Needs Now Is a Coalition Government Including All Opposition Parties" [Lazar] Besides the communist background of our current rulers, social instability, labor actions, and ethnic problems, foreign political analysts assess that the nationalist-extremist political groupings also represent an element of risk for Romania. What is the point in having the IMF memorandum passed if, meanwhile, the ruling party sets up a coalition government with the National Romanian Unity Party [PUNR] or the extreme left-wing parties? [Cosea] The [PDSR's] alliance with the PUNR, for instance, is greatly disadvantageous. Abroad, they consider the PUNR an extremist party. Thus it is quite obvious that great difficulties will emerge again in Romania's international relations. This is something that worries me very much, because I lived through the period following the miners' incursion [in 1991 in Bucharest] and I know what it means to have to kneel, trying to justify and explain things and make promises all the time. [Lazar] What would be, in your opinion, the ideal government formula that could create a favorable image of Romania abroad? [Cosea] What Romania needs now is a coalition government including all opposition parties, that is, those that do not represent the current majority in parliament. Of course, this would also have a reverse side, namely that the parties of the current majority in parliament would also have to be included, and this practically means the setting up of a national union government. However, considering the incompatibility existing among certain parties, such a government is hardly achievable. [Lazar] How could they reach a convenient formula? [Cosea] I suppose that if they had held longer and more flexible negotiations, they could have managed to set up a party including all principal elements of the opposition. Such a thing would have resulted in two major advantages: First, Romania's image would have been different, and second -- this would have been fantastic -- political aversion would have been bypassed, as they would have set out from the idea that there are reformers in all camps. Reform is not the prerogative of the government party, or only that of the opposition. Another advantage is that they would have found an easier way to negotiate with the trade unions. "Oscillations Between the Limits Imposed by the Memorandum and the Limits of the Administration" [Lazar] The memorandum contains a number of stipulations that are already outdated or will soon be outdated, and therefore they will not be implemented (the draft budget has not been forwarded to parliament yet; the Restructuring Agency is not under the authority of the State Property Fund; the financial unblocking of companies is being done selectively, and so on). Do you not think that the government is using this period until the document becomes effective to pay off old scores instead of using it to promote the memorandum? [Cosea] I do not think the government has any old scores to pay off, and even if it did, it would not be able to do so. You know very well that the government does not have any power [to implement the reform]. It is like a horseman riding a rocking- horse. The real power lies with the State Property Fund. However, the problem you mentioned does exist, and it consists of the fact that certain particular and yet important elements display an oscillation between the various factors characterizing the memorandum [sentence as published]. The reason is quite simple: Whereas the memorandum is a document with extremely clear-cut technical features, Romania's economy, unfortunately, does not display a similarly clarity. [Lazar] In other words, the memorandum cannot be implemented? [Cosea] Can we afford to implement it, for instance, by not paying salaries in companies that are in financial blockage? Can we afford to renounce certain elements ensuring the survival of our economy in order to observe some technical stipulations? The answer is not just yes, we can afford it, but also that this is what we should do. If not, we will be taking half measures and following the policy of fait accompli again, and then we will be amazed again that so many things went wrong, although I am sure that, on the following day, we would be justifying our failure by various theories and nice-sounding declarations. [Lazar] Are such oscillations not dangerous? [Cosea] If the foreign financing would have been available at the end of December last year, the way I had hoped, very many problems related to the limits imposed by the memorandum and the limits of the administration would have been solved by now. [Lazar] Still, under such circumstances, the figures established by the memorandum seem to be unrealistic. [Cosea] For the time being, I can still assert that everything included in the memorandum is realistic. I would like to emphasize again that the memorandum is a strictly economic and very technical document, although its success depends 90 percent on the political climate. No well-conceived monetary measure and no fiscal or budgetary technical measure can have positive effects if the relationship among owners and users, between property and production is not regulated adequately. "Privatization Presupposes Political Will" [Lazar] But such regulations actually mean privatization. [Cosea] That is right, this is the great problem of privatization, which, by the way, I do not consider an issue that should be regarded as a performance criteria. [It is unimportant] whether in 1994 we privatize 2,000 or rather 4,000 companies. It is unimportant whether the [privatization] project is ambitious or not. If we do not manage to turn this capital of 2,000 companies into private property, we will fail in solving the most important problem of Romania's economy: the under-capitalization of our companies. All Romanian enterprises have been conceived in such a way so as to be under-capitalized. You know, formerly, loans used to be very cheap and they were a means of keeping the economy under political control. [Lazar] That may be the case today as well. [Cosea] Current capitalization is immense. However this merely refers to the fixed capital. The floating capital, that is, the cash flow, are still at a very low level. No Romanian company can avoid financial blockage because as long as its owner is the state, it will never have sufficient floating capital. This problem could be solved if the constant part of the capital would be sold, transferred to the private circuit. [Lazar] You have to admit that such a move presupposes political will. [Cosea] Yes, that is what it takes, political will. And the State Property Fund should become what is actually should be, namely a factor promoting privatization. In that respect, things are not very clear yet and therefore not really favorable for the implementation of the memorandum. [Lazar] Relations between the Reform Council and the State Property Fund have become increasingly tense. Is that not also blocking privatization? [Cosea] The relations between the Council and the State Property Fund have obviously become increasingly complex, because, after all, the word contradiction is one way of interpreting that complexity. At the Council, we are Currently preparing a government decision, which could also be turned into a legislative initiative, that does not intend to alter the bill on privatization, but rather to speed up that process. This does not mean that it is enough if we speed up the selling of shares, because, in Romania, privatization has stopped owing to the inflation, lack of capital, too high taxes, customs regulations that do not support production, and owing to the impossibility for people to sell or buy land and other real estate assets. Somehow the false idea was created that privatization means that a large number of private companies should emerge overnight, but we did not ponder enough what we will do with them in the long run. The situation is similar to the fairy tale of the mother eagle that has to eat up its chicks as soon as they first see daylight in order to make place for the next eggs in the nest. "I Have No Idea What Color the PDSR Is" [Lazar] When you took over office you stated that you wish to obtain decision-making power for the Council. The decision that was recently taken by the government [establishing the competence of the Reform Council] contains dozens of phrases such as "it approves," "drafts," "elaborates," or "proposes," but -- except for the hiring its own personnel -- it does not contain any "it decides." What things were you able to decide upon before that government decision came, what decisions can you take currently, and what decisions will you be able to take in the future, considering that now you have a political color? [Cosea] I am not very sure that I really look like an Easter egg, being politically colored. That would not bring me any advantages and I do not like to color myself either. I have no idea what color the PDSR is. The discussions that preceded the government decision referring to the competence of the Council were very long and complicated. It was established that I cannot take decisions affecting the activity of ministries. However, owing to the fact that we are supposed to approve the decisions taken by ministries, we can still block their activity if it contradicts reform. [Lazar] That is not very much, is it? [Cosea] The fact that I can directly intervene in all activities regarding the legislative and organizational aspects gives me a large maneuvering space and great satisfaction. The most important activities in which we are also involved are the restructuring of whole branches according to the drafts elaborated by ministries and the large-scale privatization actions. The Council has the right to regulate the economic restructuring actions. In this way, actually, the whole activity of the ministries is under our control. [Lazar] That resembles centralism very much. [Cosea] That is a control over the strategy and the general orientation [of the ministries], and does not refer to the budgetary and personnel aspects or to day-by-day activities. We involve ourselves directly in concrete actions designed to privatize large companies, such as Tarom [national air company] or the mineral water sector. We are even trying to elaborate a methodology of the privatization of successful companies, that is, those that foreign investors would obviously be glad to buy and that therefore can be easily sold. [Lazar] "Involvement" or "intervention" still does not mean "decision." [Cosea] Everybody expected that the Reform Council would issue decisions appointing or firing people, or other such decisions. Unfortunately, we are not empowered to take such decisions. [Lazar] You said that the coming six months will be decisive. Do you think that the government, after a reshuffle, will survive over the next half-year? [Cosea] For the time being I cannot answer that question, because I do not have all the information I would need for that. I know, however, that, over the next months, Romania needs a government much more than early elections. The country's political stability has to be maintained, no matter what the risks are or what compromise has to be reached. It is true, holding general elections now could result in the clearing up of the political situation, so one of the problems would be solved, but on the other hand such elections could ruin other things. Among those other things I would mention the one that, today, is most the most important for the nation: the settlement and the balancing of our economy. I think that achieving the same things in our political life can still wait. Over the next six months, the cabinet might be reshuffled quite often. I hope, and this is a personal wish of mine, that over the coming six months a coalition government will be set up with the representatives of the opposition.
