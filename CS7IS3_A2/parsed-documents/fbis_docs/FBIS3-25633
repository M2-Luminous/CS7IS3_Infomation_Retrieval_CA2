These war planes carried technicians and military advisers contracted as mercenaries to fight the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]. UNITA condemns this action which endorses the warmongering and criminal speech made by Lucio Lara in Paris recently, endangering the Lusaka peace talks. Thus, UNITA will present a protest to the United Nations, because it wants to know whether it is worthwhile to negotiate peace while Luanda wants war.
