The spokesman concluded: Therefore, the way the issues are handled following this evaluation will have consequences that might even extend the status quo. Kasoulidhis stressed that the government will not let the issue dominate efforts to solve the Cyprus problem. He said: One year is more than enough. Answering questions, the spokesman reiterated that the Greek Cypriot side insists on the 21 March UN document on the confidence-building measures.. He added that yesterday's meeting between President Glavkos Kliridhis and Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's alternate special representative in Cyprus, does not fall within the framework of proximity talks but is part of customary meetings.
