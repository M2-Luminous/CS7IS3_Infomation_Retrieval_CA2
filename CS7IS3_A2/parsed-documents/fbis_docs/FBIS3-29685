The Seoul city government said Monday that the number of registered residents, including foreigners, in the metropolis stood at 10,889,972 at last year's end, according to a tentative tally. The number is down 0.7 percent or 79,890 from 10,969,862 at the end of 1992, city officials said. The officials attributed the population drop mainly to government projects which have created sizable "bedroom" towns on the outskirts of Seoul. An official said, "a lot of people have moved from Seoul to the bedroom towns including Pundang, Ilsan and Sanbon since an enormous number of apartments were constructed there in a government project to ease Seoul's housing shortage. "In addition, many workers who formerly lived in the industrial complex in Kuro-ku have moved to other cities, looking for cleaner and easier jobs. Rural people are not coming to Seoul for jobs anymore." The population in Kuro-ku, where several factories are clustered, fell by 14,684 to 724,230 at last year's end from a year earlier.
