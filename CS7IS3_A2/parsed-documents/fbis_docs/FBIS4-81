We are joined now by gentlemen from the two organizations, new political organizations so to speak, as well as the old federations. Gentlemen, good evening to you and welcome. Perhaps if I may start with the gentleman from the Workers List Party, Sallim Valli. Tell me what was the need for the party to be formed, and to claim that it's looking after the interests of the workers so to speak. [Valli] Well, for us in the Workers List Party, we are not a new party in the sense that 80 to 90 percent of our members have been involved for many years in trade unions, civic movements, youth movements, women's movements. And that we feel that the time for an independent political expression of the working class and mass workers party -- the idea for a mass workers party has come. It's not a new call, in 1982 the general secretary of FOSATU [Federation of South Africa Trade Unions], before the formation of COSATU [Congress of South African Trade Unions], made that call. We believe that the interest of workers against retrenchment for a living wage, a 35-hour week, self-defense of working people, the right to work enshrined in the constitution. The established political organizations are working within the capitalist framework, and we believe that those changes can only come about, that fundamental change can only come about through the formation of such a political expression, and the point is that we want real change, not a new flag, more black faces in Parliament, that is not real change. [Mazibuko] Let me just hold you there and see how Leon Caesar differs from you in this aspect. Do you differ from him in any way? [Caesar] Well, let me start off by saying why we in the Workers International feel it is necessary to stay in this election. You see the Nationalist [National] Party [NP] and the Democratic Party [DP], they are the parties of the capitalist class. Now the workers do not have a class that is, or, the working class does not have a party that is really fighting in the immediate and long-term interest, and we believe that the parties that used to fight for the oppressed, foremost the ANC [African National Congress] and the SACP [South African Communist Party], we feel that they have now forsaken the working class, and they are rather trying to prop up the capitalists system, and we feel that the PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] is also going in that direction. So we feel that workers in the [word indistinct] need their own party, but it must be a party that is committed to socialism, to the overthrow of, the revolutionary overthrow of capitalism, to internationalism. So that is why we have decided to come out now and to stay in this election, to put across.... [Mazibuko, interrupting] Let me see what divides you with them, because I'm seeing similarities? [Valli] If I can answer that: I think that we in the Workers List Party acknowledge the sacrifices made by tens of thousands of people who support the ANC, PAC, Azapo [Azanian People's Organization], etc. We don't think that we have the Holy Grail, we are not a vanguard party in that sense. We put forward the need for a mass workers party so that even people in those organizations, who have sacrificed much, can join hands with us, so that together, we will form a movement for a mass workers party. We don't believe we are the workers' party. [Morobe] If I'm to come in here, what you're just speaking about, isn't it the duties of the unions. Neil, isn't it what you are supposed to be doing? What is different that they'll do that you fail to do now? [Coleman] Well, the question is, Reggie, who has the capacity to implement a program which will improve the lives of ordinary people, the lives or workers in this country, and we believe, yes it is the trade unions, it is the civic movements and so on, we also believe that the organization like the African National Congress have a track record, they have a history, they have a program, a reconstruction and development program, which would enable them to improve the lives of ordinary people. So we're not against anyone forming a political party, even soccer clubs have formed a party, but the question is who is going to really change the lives of people. [Valli] And that is the point because if you look at the reconstruction and development program. If you look at the apartmeid debt, the apartheid regime has got a debt of 186 billion rand, and interest on that debt is about 3 billion rands. The future state, the ANC, regardless of their good intentions cannot use the money for social spending, because they are trapped in the debt... [Morobe, interrupting] Cunningham, you could come in here. He is talking about the debts and from the manifesto they say they will not even repay the IMF monies and the World Bank monies. Isn't this a disaster for the workers? [Ngcukana] Let me explain. As Nactu [National Council of Trade Unions], we recognize that we are living within a particular social, economic, and international order. There is no way that we can operate an economy in isolation. International trade has linked many countries. I do have sympathy for the views that they are expressing, but the reality on the ground is a different thing. Recently, we have had Daniel Ortega having to step down because of international economic pressure to be able to get a loan, to ensure that Nicaragua survives. Now, the reality of the international loans, we would live with it. However, the question will be: How would a future democratic government use those loans? That is the fundamental question. There is no way you can say that we will not be able to repay debts. It is simply -- South Africa will be cut off and will not function, and even that government that says so, that is about not repaying international loans, will not even survive a day because of the international reality. [Morobe] But I am seeing here four organizations and all their base line is workers. Can't we have one formation, one federation? [Ngcukana] No, they are a political party trying to raise pertinent issues on a political level. We are a trade union operating on a day-to-day basis defending the working people. The question of them coming up, I must say that yes, everybody has got a democratic right to form his or her own organization, but what we have to understand is in the class sense whatever is happening in this country it is the realization of what has been called a bourgeois revolution. It is coming to an end of its cycle. Given those realities and the realities of the economic situation in the country, we would need to hold each others' hands and work together and to make the country work, to ensure that our people have jobs, to ensure that people have got housing. Yes, it is important to have dreams and hopes. [Morobe] Let me come in there. Workers International, are you not using this as another band wagon to come into power? [Caesar] No, no, no. Not at all. We believe also that there is a place in society for the trade unions as well as a place for political parties and that they should exist separately. But what differs us, the Workers International, from the Workers List Party: In our manifestos there are two points which are really very different. We lay very strong emphasis on the reactionarm role of Stalinism and the need to expose and combat Stalinism. The Workers List Party does not even mention Stalinism within their manifesto. Secondly, we emphasize that we can only achieve socialism by means of a revolutionary overthrow of capitalism, and the Workers List Party also doesn't refer to the need of a revolutionary overthrow. I would like to just pose something... [Morobe, interrupting] We do not have much time. Can I let you bring in, maybe sum it up. Is this doing the workers, the future workers, any good? [Coleman] Well, democracy is good for workers, conflicting ideas, but workers don't eat ideology. We have to improve their living conditions, we have to improve their wages, we have to put in place a political system and an economic system which is in their interest. We believe that the Reconstruction and Development Program of the ANC and the tripartite alliance attempts to do that in a systematic way. That is why COSATU is calling not only on our own members, but on all working people in these elections to vote for the ANC. [Mazibuko] Let me go back to the gentlemen representing trade unions. One would read in this set up a whole issue of deficiencies within the two federations to a point that people believe they now have to get on the band wagon, form up their own political parties and go to parliament and to represent themselves. And what do you tell me? [Ngcukana] No, they are not deficiencies, Xoli. Our position as NACTU is simple. Given the present conditions, we are saying to the workers let them go and vote for the parties that have historically fought oppression and to vote against the oppressor. We are not saying which political party they should vote for because our members come from different backgrounds. It does not mean that in future we will not consider a position regarding the interests of the working people. We are saying let the working people go and vote and vote against the oppressors, and vote for those who have historically fought for freedom. [Mazibuko] Come in, Neil. What do you think? Are you [words indistinct]? [Coleman] Yeah. I think the reality is that the vast majority of our members support the ANC. In a survey which we did two years ago, we discovered that 96 percent of our shop stewards were going to vote for the ANC. This is a reality. The majority of ANC supporters are workers and workers's families. [passage omiteed] [Mazibuko] Do you see in this gentleman wishful thinking? [Coleman] To a certain extent, yes, there is an element of wishful thinking, but let them speak for themselves. [Valli] Can I say that wishful thinking is the Reconstruction and Development Program, although the basic objectives are laudable -- housing, employment, etc. -- it cannot be achieved under capitalism. In the workers charter, which we spent over a year developing and a quarter of a million rands, where are those demands? Nationalization without compensation, which the biggest affiliate of COSATU made? The IMF-World Bank loans? I think the problem is that throughout the world, through the structural adjustments policies of the IMF-World Bank they have impoverished economies. THE FINANCIAL MAIL has projected in the year 2003 South Africa would owe, its debt would be 119 billion rand. The state.... [Mazibuko, interrupting] Okay, let's (?put aside) the economic jargon tonight. Let me bring you back to reality, the people are reading situations here like, we have seen people climbing on the band wagon of Christianity. We are now seeing people climbing on the band wagon of workers parties? [Valli] Xoli, our members have fought to build the trade union movement. We have many of our members who spent years on Robben Island. We haven't just come into the struggle today. We have been around in the union movement, in the civic movement. I need to say that what we are talking about is eminently realistic. [Mazibuko] Let me bring Leon in on this issue. How long will it take to address some of these issues, to build a socialistic economy to build an economy that will look after the interests of workers? [Caesar] The time to do it isn't really a question. The question now is that we have to build a strong revolutionary workers party to overthrow the capitalist system, to begin that socialist reconstruction. But I would like to address something that you mentioned about parties jumping on the band wagon. Our party has been around for about two or three years. We have worked underground for a few years, and we have got a number of members that are working within the trade union, within unaffiliated organizations. Now, I would like to pose something to the COSATU person. The comrade said that they recognize the right of parties like ours to exist, but the reality is that many of our members within the unions, that are in COSATU, they are being harassed. Why? Because they said, look, it is my right to vote for any party, and they said they are members of the Workers International. So some of them are actually getting some pressure, and I would like COSATU to make a very unambiguous statement around this issue. [Coleman] Sure. We would say that the comrades have the right to operate, but on the other hand he said they are operating underground. Now, organizations have been unbanned since 1990 and we think this sort of tactic of entering into organizations secretly and so on, the trade union is an open organization. There should be no need to operate underground. So I think that is an important point to note. [Valli] Our views have always been open. Comrade Neil, Comrade Cunningham knows us. We have stood for our views in the trade unions. We have always fought alongside those workers in COSATU. Most of our members come from COSATU, Nactu, and affiliated unions. [Mazibuko] Gentlemen? I am afraid we have run out of time. My producer is breathing down my neck, and I need to close shop. Thank you very much for coming through.
