Political analyst Prof Lawrence Schlemmer said a quarter of blacks in Johannesburg might alter their votes because of constraints or perceived constraints. Only 54 per cent of blacks were confident their votes would not be known by the community. The survey, conducted in February, asked respondents about factors constraining freedom of choice. In kwaZulu/Natal 44 per cent believed that there was fear among those who did not support the area's dominant party. Forty-nine per cent of blacks said they lived in areas where only one party was dominant. "These results...provide strong evidence that community pressures and the fear of violence and intimidation will mean that many voters may cast a ballot which is less than fully free and fair."
