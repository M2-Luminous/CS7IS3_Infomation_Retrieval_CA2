But if South Korea and the United States do detect any sign of aggression, they "are prepared to react decisively," Gary Luck, commander of the UN Command, said before the Senate Armed Services Committee. Asked about deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea, Luck answered that preparations have been completed to make the action possible at any time. But Seoul is unlikely to approve the Patriots' deployment unless the United Nations first imposes sanctions on Pyongyang. Luck, also commander of the South Korea-U.S. Combined Forces Command, said he had recommended the Patriots be deployed at last year's end. But the plan was suspended due to South Korean concerns that it might provoke North Korea. "Even its very name, the 'Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea,' is a great lie," said Luck in describing the Stalinist state. "North Korea is certainly not remotely democratic nor is it a republic by any generally held definition." While Pyongyang continues to "make all manner of bellicose verbal threats," there is no sign of pending attack, according to the commander. "And you can be sure I am looking long and hard, with some of the best surveillance and warning systems and most skilled military analysts in the world." Despite its deteriorating economy and years of poor havests, North Korea continues to mechanize its huge ground forces, expand its already massive artillery formations, enhance its special operations forces and upgrade its ballistic missile arsenal. The biggest danger of war lies in "a serious miscalculation" by North Korean leaders. Only the "aging dictator" Kim Il-song knows whether an attempt will be made to reunite the peninsula under his control. "We cannot risk a miscalculation by the North," Luck told the Senate committee. "Their leaders must always know in their hearts and minds that they could never win a war on the peninsula or even be sure that their regime would remain in power after a war."
