Amamou, who is now in Algiers to participate in the meetings of the follow-up committee, said in an interview with MENA that both leaders had their own circumstances and engagements that kept them from attending the summit. He noted that Morocco and Libya were represented at a high level and that the five member states participated in the summit with the leaders' approval. He said the full commitment of the heads of state to the idea of a great Arab Maghreb and to serious work to consolidate progress and implement what has been agreed on in the context of the AMU was clearly evident at the Arab Maghreb summit. In response to a question on the AMU's role in the Libyan crisis in which Libya has been accused by Western nations of involvement in the Lockerbie issue, Amamou said the AMU is continuing to do all it can to find a fair and honorable solution to this crisis that will guarantee security and stability in the region and prevent any harm being done to all peoples of the region, not just the Libyan people. He pointed out that this crisis has had far-reaching effects on all peoples of the region, even Egypt. He stressed that the Arab Maghreb countries and Egypt are concerting their efforts along with the Arab league to solve this problem. He noted that Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd al-Majid entrusted the Arab foreign ministers at their latest meeting to follow up on this issue until a fair and honorable solution is found.
