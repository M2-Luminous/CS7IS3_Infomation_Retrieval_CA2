On April 1, 1993, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 a proposed rule change to permit various types of hedge orders to attain spread priority. On November 17, 1994, the Phlx submitted Amendment Number 1 (``Amendment No. 1'') to the proposal to clarify, among other things, that the proposed priority principles in the original filing will only apply to hedge orders and to remove synthetic option orders from the definition of hedge order. 3 On November 23, 1994, the Phlx filed Amendment No. 2 (``Amendment No. 2'') to the proposal to clarify the definition of multi-spread transaction in Commentary .02 to Rule 1066 and amend Options Floor Procedure Advice F&hyph;14 to reference the procedures for the execution of synthetic orders. 4 1 15 U.S.C. ยง78s(b)(1) (1982). 2 17 CFR ยง240.19b&hyph;4 (1991). 3 See Letter from Gerald D.

Notice of the proposed rule change was published for comment and appeared in the Federal Register on November 17, 1993. 5 No comments were received on the proposal. This order approves the proposal, as amended. 5 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33179 (November 10, 1993), 58 FR 60715. I. Description of the Proposal The Phlx proposes to permit certain types of hedge orders to attain spread priority, i.e. , to be executed as a single transaction, with priority over certain existing bids or offers for each leg of the transaction. Under the proposal, the Exchange is amending Rule 1066 to define the types of hedge orders that would be eligible for spread priority. Specifically, paragraph (f) of Rule 1066 would be amended to define the term hedge order to include spread orders, straddle orders, and combination orders for the same account. 6 Additionally, Rule 1066(g) would be amended to define a synthetic option order as an order to buy or sell a stated number of option contracts and buy or sell the underlying stock in an amount that would offset (on a one-for-one basis) the option position. This proposed definition would include buy-writes, synthetic calls, and synthetic puts. As with hedge orders, synthetic options may be quoted at a net debit or credit. 7 6 A combination order under proposed Rule 1066(f)(3) would include conversions (generally, a transaction involving buying the underlying stock, buying a put, and selling call) and reversals (generally, a transaction involving selling the underlying stock, selling a put, and buying a call). See Amendment No. 1 and Securities Exchange Act Release No. 22373 (Aug. 29, 1985), 50 FR 36686 (Sept. 9, 1985). 7 See Amendment No. 1. Currently, Phlx Rule 1033(d) affords priority to certain spread transactions. Under this provision, an eligible spread is executable as a single transaction at a total net credit/debit against one other member that represents all legs of the trade provided that net credit/debit improves the established market for the spread as measured by the aggregate price of the respective legs, if executed individually. The new proposed language to Rule 1033(d) would clarify that in order to establish whether a spread transaction has improved the established market, at least one option leg must be executed at a better price than the established market for the option and no option leg can be executed outside of the established market. 8 Pursuant to this proposed rule change, all of the types of hedge orders defined in proposed Rule 1066(f) would be eligible for spread priority. 9 Rule 1033(e) would clarify the priority principles applicable to synthetic options, 10 and Rule 1033 would also be amended to add headings to each paragraph for quick reference to the appropriate topic. 8 See Amendment No. 2. 9 Amendment No. 1 clarifies that synthetic options will not be eligible for hedge order priority. 10 Because spread priority principles will not apply, the option leg of a synthetic option order will have to be executed at a price better than the established market in order to be eligible for net debit/credit quoting and execution. The option leg of a synthetic option order, in that instance, will receive price priority under the normal priority principles ( i.e. , it must better the existing market to receive priority.) See Amendment No. 1 and Rule 1014.
