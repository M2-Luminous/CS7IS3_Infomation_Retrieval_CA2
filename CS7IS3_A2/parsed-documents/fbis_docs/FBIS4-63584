This was announced at today's briefing by Grigoriy Karasin, director of the Russian Foreign Ministry Information and Press Department. The Russian diplomat stressed that differences between Kiev and Simferopol are "purely an internal affair of Ukraine." However, he said that some Ukrainian politicians are trying to put the blame for this on "external forces", unambiguously implying that they mean Russia. "As for our position with regard to the sovereign Republic of Crimea, which is an integral part of Ukraine, this position has not changed and is well known to the Ukrainian leadership," the Foreign Minister spokesman said. "Like the Ukrainian side, we too are naturally concerned about possible tensions in Russo-Ukrainian relations over Crimea," he noted. "We agree that such CSCE principles of international law as territorial integrity and inviolability of existing borders should be observed universally. But no less important is respect for the sovereign will of the peoples' show of restraint and the need to rule out the use or the threat to use any strong-arm methods in solving political problems." G. Karasin stressed that in the opinion of the Russian Foreign Ministry, "the situation in Crimea is further proof that key questions of Russo-Ukrainian relations should be solved promptly." According to the Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman, it is these problems and not the situation in Crimea that are being discussed at the Russian-Ukrainian talks at the level of heads of governments, which began in Moscow yesterday and which are continuing today.
