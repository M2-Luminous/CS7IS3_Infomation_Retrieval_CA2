So They Say of the New Laser Equipment and Technology Institute Recently Appearing on the Scientific Map of the Ukraine''; the first four paragraphs are an introduction] [Text] In actuality, scientists already long ago called this department of the university in the capital an ``institute.'' Indeed, it was difficult for them to visualize that the personnel of the laser technologies laboratory of the KPI were by themselves capable of reaching the world level of development work and that the results of its activity would draw the closest attention in many countries. And indeed, the former laboratory director, now the director of the new institute, professor Vladimir Kovalenko, is acknowledged to be one of the world's leading specialists in the modern technologies field. Accordingly, he was one of the first in the former USSR to be elected an academician of the New York Academy of Sciences and has become a member of the most prestigious international organizations of laser specialists, the coauthor and coeditor of many ultramodern scientific publications and catalogues. The new scientific research institute is a structural subdivision of the Kiev Polytechnic Institute, intended to bring together the efforts of scientists at the university and many research institutes for solving problems in the scientific branch. This will assist considerably in regeneration of the Ukrainian economy. At the KPI research in the field of laser equipment and technology has already been in progress for more than 30 years. The university laboratory, headed by Professor Kovalenko, has been transformed into a singular interbranch instructional, methodological and scientific center. His students have proposed to practical workers more than a few new methods for large-scale working of objects from metal, their hardening and local alloying, using laser radiation. Control points have been established at many enterprises where KPI representatives are helping to introduce modern technological processes. ``Many feel that the establishment of new scientific institutes at the height of a very serious crisis is Utopian. After all, you are in no position to receive the most necessary material resources. How do you dare take the risk?'' I say in addressing the director. ``On the other hand, we have a primary resource -- intellectual,'' responds Vladimir Sergeyevich Kovalenko. ``Only several years ago the former USSR accounted for more than 32% of the world's engineers and scientists, with the Ukraine accounting for about 7%. This is an enormous potential on which our young country rests its hopes. With respect to the technologies which we have developed, it is precisely they which it is desirable be used extensively in our complex times. They are easily applied in small shops and laboratories and in commercial service facilities where they can be used successfully in cutting, joining and marking metals and other materials and filling a great many other orders. And saturate the market with products produced without gigantic production sites and unwieldy equipment. Why are many academic institutes on the rocks? They are in the stage of introduction of innovations into industry for organizing new experimental lines of production (when considerable sums have still not been earned) and have no relatively inexpensive work force. We, adhering to the experience of the leading, well-developed countries, intend to rely on young people, students, who have energy, enthusiasm, assertiveness and ambition. They have their entire lives before them and therefore they do not fear to take a risk. And still another circumstance. I became aware of it during my foreign trips, especially the last, when over the course of several months I lectured at one of the largest universities in the United States, located at the center of the state of Ohio.'' ``I see here: in the documents which the Americans gave you were called a `Distinguished Visiting Professor'...'' ``It appears that they have such an official title. But let me finish my thought. Abroad they regard our work with extreme respect, they intend to cooperate with us, carry out joint research experiments and exchange students. And representatives of the Ukrainian diaspora are even interested in having their children receive a higher education in the Ukraine. This will mean additional income for the KPI.'' The cessation of the activity of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (SEV) and the disappearance from the map of such a country as the GDR for only a short time stopped the scientific and creative contacts between the two largest universities in Europe -- Kiev Polytechnic Institute and the ``Friedrich Schiller'' University at Jena. Now it is not ideological compatibility, but the significance of the research conducted at the KPI which has again attracted the attention of German scientists and has forced renewal of the joint work on developing new laser technologies and diagnostic systems which was interrupted for a year (this work was carried out earlier within the framework of the Complex Program of the Member Countries of the SEV, intended to run to the year 2000). ``As a result of cessation of SEV activity, the funding of our joint work also ceased,'' continues Professor Kovalenko. ``For some time we knew nothing about the future fate of our joint research. But then a letter was received from Germany in which they proposed a new program to run until 1995. It is ensured funding by the Association of Rectors of German Universities and makes provision for activation of the exchange of specialists and intensification of scientific research in the field of laser technologies and equipment.'' For a long time Professor Kovalenko presented lectures to students and specialists in China, Japan and many other countries, also including countries of the former socialist camp, with which mutually advantageous agreements also have been concluded. The distant island of Taiwan, with which the Ukraine has no diplomatic relations and where we have no trade or cultural representatives, opened its formerly tightly sealed doors to the scientists of the Ukraine. The first among them to be invited was Vladimir Kovalenko. Over the course of three weeks he presented lectures and consulted with Taiwanese colleagues on new technologies. The principal organizer and sponsor of the visit of Vladimir Sergeyevich to the island was the general director of one of the largest international companies in the world engaged in the fabrication and application of computer systems, which is located there. It specializes in deliveries of very complex equipment to the countries of East Europe. ``Recent events have made possible a new look at the problem of using the latest advances in science and technology in different economic branches,'' says the scientist in ending our conservation. ``We can and must develop fundamentally new aspects of increase in the quality of production, find many-sided approaches to the introduction of highly efficient technologies under conditions of a developing market. The former mechanisms of innovative processes are hopelessly outdated. Despite the crisis we have succeeded in acquiring a solid material base: laser apparatus, computers and other equipment. The Laser Technology Center, which includes the new institute and the department at the KPI, will provide strong encouragement for the development of a high-priority field and will enable Ukrainian scientists rightfully to enter the world laser community.''
