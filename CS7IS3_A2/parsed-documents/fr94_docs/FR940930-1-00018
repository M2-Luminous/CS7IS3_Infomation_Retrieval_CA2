FR940930-1-00018 FR940930-1-00007 Small Entities Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq .), The Coast Guard must consider whether this rule will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). Because it expects the impact of this proposal to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Collection of Information This rule contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ). Federalism The Coast Guard has analyzed this rule under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has determined that this rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Environment The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this rule and concluded that, under section 2.B.2 of Commandant Instruction M16475.1 (series), this proposal is categorically excluded form further environmental documentation. An ``Categorical Exclusion Determination'' is available in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under `` ADDRESSES .'' List of Subjects in 33 CFR Part 117 Bridges. Proposed Regulations In consideration of the foregoing, the Coast Guard proposes to amend Part 117 of Title 33, code of Federal Regulations, as follows: PART 117_DRAWBRIDGE OPERATION REGULATIONS 1. The authority citation for part 117 continues to read as follows: Authority: 33 U.S.C. 499; 49 CFR 1.46; 33 CFR 1.05&hyph;1(g). 2.
