The official's statement was reported on semi-official radio in Taiwan, but neither the official's name or rank was given. A reporter asked the Reverend (Hsu Ying-fa), the secretary general of the Catholic Bishop's Office in the ROC [Republic of China], to comment on the report. (Hsu) said: The Vatican has plans to establish formal ties with the People's Republic, but the Vatican Parliament has also promised the Bishop's Office in Taiwan that it would not cut its ties with any country, including Taiwan. (Hsu's) office was not surprised when it heard of the news. (Hsu) said the ROC Government should not worry too much about the Vatican's decision. However, it was possible that the Vatican would assign an ambassador to Mainland China and a representative to Taiwan for future contact.
