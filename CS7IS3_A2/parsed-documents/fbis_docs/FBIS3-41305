This [word indistinct] organization has been acting parallel to the FELCN for approximately the last four years. This organization had its own informers and its own clandestine barracks. Three of the organization's informers were arrested. Among them are a former policeman and a former FELCN member who had detailed knowledge of the drug traffickers' activities. Those arrested have been identified as (Roger Gandarillas), (Felix Flores Aldin), and (Walter Orellana). (Roger Gandarillas) is reportedly the leader of the organization which allegedly was able to swindle about $3 million from the drug traffickers. This gang, organized after the Colombian drug mafias, was made up of people who had detailed knowledge of all drug trafficking activities. They had identified all persons involved in drug trafficking activities, and their movements. The organization seized drugs but instead of delivering them to the proper government organizations, it kept the seized cargo for itself and later distributed it. FELCN officials, who added that the investigations continue, yesterday invited reporters to one of the properties that was seized from this organization. The property is located on Francisco Mora Avenue.
