[Drzycimski] Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. [Woyciechowski] What is new at the Belvedere? [Drzycimski] I think it is raining outside. [Woyciechowski] Yes, that is unusual for this time of year. The press has been writing a lot for the past few days--actually, for the past few weeks, but, in the past few days, more has been written about it, as it were, and in a more nervous manner--about the issue of appointing deputy ministers in the so-called presidential ministries--that is, the Defense Ministry [MON], the Internal Affairs Ministry [MSW], and the Foreign Ministry. The press reports today that Kwasniewski is supposed to meet Pawlak, who will make a decision on whether to appoint the deputy ministers. Meanwhile, press commentaries speak of the president being absolutely opposed to having coalition candidates appointed as deputy ministers. Would you... [Drzycimski] If I could just make a minor comment here. The president has spoken out on the issue many times already, so let me just remind you of what the president has already said, and he upholds all that: The president is absolutely against making the three ministries political. What does it mean? It means that, as it were ex officio, or that we... [Drzycimski changes thought] It means that we adopt the principle that coalition representatives are included in the three ministries [as heard]--that is, because he says that would lead to absurd situations, even in the current form, where the coalition has just two ingredients. What if we were to have.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] You mean like six or seven more joining in? [Drzycimski] No, but even if we were to see just two more ingredients joining the coalition. After all, the coalition can possibly widen its scope. So, in that case, we would have in these three ministries, which are key to the state's functioning, at least four, five, six, or even eight.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Mr. Minister, but is that opposition by the president absolute? Is this opposition to the principle or [words indistinct] [Drzycimski] Yes, it is his opposition to the principle that the coalition kind of automatically introduces.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Introduces their own men? Could one therefore.... [Drzycimski, interrupting] And why is that? It is because those ministries that determine the state's efficient functioning would immediately be made political, and even the most minor type of conflict within the coalition--that has to be said out loud--would immediately have an impact on those ministries that must be of a very stable nature. They have to be characterized by a high level of peacefulness. They have to work for the long term. We cannot have those ministries working for immediate goals only. Our experience so far in these three or four years.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] These are not very good experiences, especially with regard to MON and the MSW. [Drzycimski] These are not very good experiences, and that is even more reason for the president to.... [pauses] But he also adds immediately what he always says: That does not mean that we are against anyone who is in fact an expert or who has this or that kind of professional expertise or license, or who belongs to this or that kind of [word indistinct].... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Do I understand it correctly? Could one understand what you are saying to mean that the president would not mind having deputy ministers who would just happen to be members of the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] or the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD], as long as the president approves of their appointments? Is this whole issue about his approval? [Drzycimski] No, it is not. This is not about the president insisting on approving anyone. The president avoids speaking out on... [Drzycimski changes thought] What he means is the principle itself. He will be supporting the ministries' chiefs in their efforts to maintain the principle. That is because it is a kind of principle that must be clearly defined, or else we will be constantly having a situation of a very unstable process of cabinet formation--that is one issue. Another is that decisions regarding personnel appointments in a ministry are not made by the president but by the individual ministry's chief.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] That is to say the prime minister--I am sorry, I mean the minister--after consulting the prime minister? [Drzycimski] Exactly. The president just means the principle that he wants to see observed. [Woyciechowski] Does it mean that the prime minister cannot make that decision on his own without the consent of [word indistinct] minister? [Drzycimski] In theory, he can appoint a minister, but I do not think that would be an example to be followed. That would rather tend to indicate some kind of tension occurring. [Woyciechowski] From what we know at this stage, [Defense] Minister Kolodziejczyk threatens in definite terms that he will resign in that situation, but [Internal Affairs] Minister Milczanowski says he could possibly agree. We all know that the post of deputy minister responsible for the Fire Guard is vacant in the MSW. [Drzycimski] There is also a vacancy in MON, and, as far as I know, Minister Kolodziejczyk is currently looking for the right man, who would like to take up this very important ministry. As far as I can recall, someone there is about to retire, and there will be a vacancy, except that.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] But is he looking for a candidate within the PSL and the SLD, or in other places? [Drzycimski] No, he is just looking for the right man, who would take upon himself issues that are important in terms of being in charge of MON, and that is an open issue. [Woyciechowski] And what about [Foreign] Minister Olechowski? [Drzycimski] I am not aware of his making any changes whatsoever. As far as I know, there are more important issues on the agenda right now.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] In a word--NATO? [Drzycimski] Yes. [Woyciechowski] What will happen during the NATO summit on Monday [10 January]? Is there any chance whatsoever of NATO changing its position on Poland and of opening itself up more? Could that possibly happen during these next few days? [Drzycimski] I think anything could happen, even though I am sure some fundamental decisions have already been made. Despite that, there were some measures and statements made by Western and also U.S. politicians. These are proof of efforts being made right now to come up with a [hesitating] safety valve of some kind, for the purpose of possible future solutions. A sudden trip that is scheduled to take place in the next few days by some high-ranking representatives of the U.S. administration is also proof of that, as well as some statements made by German politicians and also the recent visit by [Foreign] Minister Olechowski to Germany. After all, that was the first visit to Germany in the New Year, and it is no accident that the German foreign minister decided to invite Minister Olechowski and not someone else. The purpose was to discuss precisely those issues. The president keeps speaking. Some of his recent statements are very characteristic here. They are quite widely heard. I think that also has an effect in terms of providing information. Too often, we have been examining these issues from the standpoint of: We do not mean anything. But, in fact, we do. Let us not hide ourselves. We are a nation of 40 million people or so. We are a European country of medium size, but we are a very important stabilizing factor in Europe and the kind of factor where the Central European transformations are advanced the furthest and where they resulted in some victories, but also, naturally, in all kinds of slipups. That is unavoidable. Still, we are heading down a path where nobody can accuse us of deviating from the main path even a centimeter--I mean the main path of striving to achieve democracy, to establish democratic structures, and to create a complete basis for a democratic country, and also the fact that we have been trying very persistently to establish a market economy, which, in the long run, creates chances for our becoming a country that is capable of joining Europe's normal economic arrangements--I mean Europe as a whole. And, on that issue, the president has been saying in very outright terms that the views that are being voiced by us from Warsaw are full of anxiety: Let us not allow a repetition of what happened in the not-very- distant past. Let us not forget that.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] The president used very ominous comparisons in his interview for the BBC yesterday when he made analogies to 1939. Is that really the situation now? Is it really dangerous? [Drzycimski] By the way, the president has spoken out on this many times. Let me remind you of the interviews for LA STAMPA and THE WASHINGTON POST, yesterday's interview for the BBC--I mean, for BBC Television--and also his talks with politicians. It is not an issue that occurred this month; it occurred much earlier than that. That is because he can see that, in the course of this great revolution that was accomplished bloodlessly, we managed to break one of the cruelest systems the human race ever created. It happened without a war and in a way I would describe as outright marvelous. And the Western world, which was incredibly interested in the process, the whole world was watching attentively to what was happening; one could say, metaphorically speaking, that the Berlin Wall was being demolished from both sides: On our side and on the West's side. And then the Wall crumbled. But we failed to create anything new in its place, except one thing: We built a united Germany. But there was no structure or vision of the future created or suggestions made. What is the result of that? There are established what politicians call gray areas or empty fields. So we are now, as it were, between two.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Between a united Germany, on the one hand, and Zhirinovskiy on the other? [Drzycimski] Not just a united Germany; I would say Europe as a whole, which decided to take a standstill position that is quite comfortable for them, waiting for an outcome of the battle. It is not the case that the battle will result in an outcome all by itself, or that it will be fought only at a roundtable, at which one can conduct debates. In fact, the battle will be fought through all kinds of choices that will be made and through decisions that the individual nations will make. These decisions can vary a great deal; even the Russian election results are proof of that. And that is why the president says: Let us not repeat the mistake. Moreover, it is also a warning addressed to the West against, through its avoidance of inconvenience, making the same mistake as the politicians of the period between the two World Wars made, as well as during World War II--namely, that they were willing to come to agreement with one another. [Woyciechowski] In other words, sacrifice Poland, even though it may sound cruel? [Drzycimski] That is right. This is why the president uses such strong words; it is a warning--a warning that cannot be underestimated. Then no one will be able to tell us that we said nothing and that we withdrew, as it were. I would like to add one more thing: Please note that these words of the president are very easily understood in the West. Now, look at our mass media; we are now talking about it a few days before the event. This is not a problem that arose today. Do we see any serious texts in the Polish press, in the Polish mass media, such as television or the radio, that are concerned with this problem? Everyone, as it were.... [pauses] When the president discusses this, in Poland.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Everyone is silent, whereas the West quotes the president. Mr. Minister, why do you think the West is blocking Poland's access to NATO so strongly? Has the change of the governing coalition affected this in any way? Or perhaps it was the election in Russia and Zhirinovskiy? Or was it something else? [Drzycimski] No, no. I mean, the Polish elections probably affected this the least. After these few months we can.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] We can see that nothing has changed? [Drzycimski] The world became convinced that we are still proceeding on this tough road. Incidentally, the president said that there would be no changes in the two [word indistinct]: The road to democracy and the road to a market economy. The rest may be discussed: Should we go more to the right or more to the left? The Polish elections also convinced the West that we are on the right road and that it is a normal process: Sometimes you are closer to this side, sometimes closer to the other side. Of course, we also have our own peculiarities. However, generally, when someone is observing Poland from the outside.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Did, then, the Russian elections and Zhirinovskiy.... [pauses] Did Zhirinovskiy scare the West? [Drzycimski] No, the West is simply a little selfish. What was achieved in Warsaw during the talks between the two presidents, Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Polish President Lech Walesa, this famous signature under the declaration of both presidents, whereby Russia stated that it could see no reason that Poland and other countries should not enter NATO.... [pauses] In other words, the artificial hindrance was taken away.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] However, Yeltsin changed his mind later on. [Drzycimski] Yes, he did. Why did he do that? That is very simple: Would you not do the same if you felt someone's weak spot? Just as in the Leninist rule: Push until you meet some resistance. This is the element that appeared; that is, the West yielded, as it were, and it decided that Russia could submit its conditions. Now, we are asking: To whom is it submitting its conditions? To us? We are not afraid. We realize that, for Russia, Poland is perhaps one of the elements. The West, being richer, is definitely more interesting to Russia. There lies the problem that Russia would have to tackle. Thus, the ball has been thrown not on our ground but on the ground of the West. It is the West and NATO that must answer whether they want it or not. If the West answers that it is ready to listen to Russia's demands, it means that the 16 states that make up NATO accept the dictate that is imposed upon them. Apart from that, if we are talking about partnership, about the U.S. "Partnership for Peace" project, which is good, interesting, and important, we are prepared to accept it--on one condition, however: on the condition that it is followed by concrete solutions and that it is not a nebula that we are being offered now. This decision must be made independently by the NATO states. The decisions, which also seem to be suggested by statements of NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner.... [pauses] That this pact realizes the historic moment we have found ourselves in. The future of Europe will be decided here: whether we will strive to recreate the confrontative system or attempt to construct a new, open, and uniting Europe. This is the question: divisions, the bipolar system, a policy of calling up the demons from the past, even the demons of the various -isms that Europe has already gone through, such as Stalinism, Hitlerism--the former, ice-cold Siberian camps, the latter, crematories. These are certain signs that we must not forget. We can argue whether history repeats itself. I am a historian, and I can tell you that there are certain trends. However, in such moments as the present one, it is a moment that is a warning, a challenge, and it forces us to answer the following question: What Europe do we want to have--a bipolar Europe or a common Europe? We would like a common Europe, a Europe that is open, not characterized by enmity, not against Russia, and interested in the future as the greatest challenge. This is what we are going to bring up in all of the talks, and what President Walesa will perhaps discuss with President Clinton in Prague. [Woyciechowski] Do commentators wonder whether President Walesa will receive on Friday [7 January] Ms. Albright, a special envoy of President Clinton, and General Shalikashvili? Will he receive them? [Drzycimski] If they arrive in Poland, I believe he.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] If they come to Poland, he will receive them. Mr. Minister, can we say now that the most important issue for Poland today, for the next few months or maybe longer, is the issue of Poland's admittance to NATO? Is it a fundamental issue? [Drzycimski] Well, we must explain a few things fully. We are talking about Poland's admission to NATO. This admission will not be automatic. It will be a certain process. It will consist of certain stages.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] You mean political decisions that.... [Drzycimski, interrupting] Political decisions. I mean a decision that we are in Europe, in Western Europe. This is what we want. [Woyciechowski] These are fundamental decisions? [Drzycimski] Yes, these are fundamental decisions. [Woyciechowski] Let us change the subject for a while. Does President Walesa know the name of his future rival in the presidential elections? Can he guess who it will be? [Drzycimski] President Walesa has not made the decision yet.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Whether he himself will run? [Drzycimski] Yes, whether he himself will run. I can say that he does not know the name of a possible candidate because he is not interested in this issue at the moment. He believes that something else is important: If this functioning democratic system starts to defend itself, if it begins to be efficient, then he, as a man of breakthroughs, will complete his mission. [Woyciechowski] And what will he do? Go fishing? [Drzycimski] Yes, he will go fishing. However, if it does not function, if there appear smaller or greater inefficiencies.... [pauses] We do not lack only a constitution; we also do not have a fully developed system of the functioning of the state. We have created two poles: the legislative pole and the executive pole. The Small Constitution resolves these problems. However, we still do not have the judiciary pole; this is a basis for every democratic state. Even the latest presidential bill on the Constitutional Tribunal--that is, on the superiority of the tribunal in all decisions.... [pauses] As we know, when both parties were in opposition, the bill was supported by them wholeheartedly. Now that they.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] What do they want? [Drzycimski] They want to postpone it. There are many such elements. These are the fundamental issues, and this is what the president focuses his attention on: on building a structural system of the state. He wants to resolve the following problem: Are we going to build a state of a parliamentary-cabinet nature, which we have experienced, and the experiences were not always very pleasant? Or are we going to support the idea of stronger executive authorities? The president proposes a presidential-parliamentary system, with full democratic protection mechanisms. This must be clear. The president believes that, in such a difficult moment, a difficult moment of changing the systems, we will need a strong decisionmaking center for a long time. This center must be able to make important decisions--not in a peaceful situation. We must look at constitutional solutions in the following way: If something bad happens, then what? Who will make the decision? In the past three years, we have already seen a few situations that required some decisions. I would like to see the decisions made in the configuration that we have had so far. I fear that there would have been enormous difficulties. Therefore, Poland is seen as a stable country, in the external sense. Within Poland, we have our own internal misgivings: We want this or that to be better. This is a very good point; it means that we have not stopped. However, Poland is seen as a stable country also because it has a center that makes key decisions for the state. We may argue, discuss, tackle all subjects; however, when a decision needs to be made, we are among those who make it, and we do it courageously. [Drzycimski] There is always someone, Mr. Minister, who can recall the prime minister and dissolve the parliament? [Woyciechowski] Well, but I also meant the present situation. I meant the discussion on the future of NATO. It was the president who started this huge debate for Europe, in August of this year [as heard]. It was the president who forced the West to answer the question of what direction we would go in. It is the president who now forces others to answer the following question: What kind of Europe do we want to have--a bipolar Europe or an open Europe? These are the fundamental controversies that perhaps right now seem quite remote and too complicated to an ordinary citizen. However, this also entails another problem: Will foreign capital come to Poland? If we have those political protection mechanisms provided by NATO, we will have the guarantee that capital, new technologies, and cultural goods will come more readily. An entirely new platform would then open up before us. This is the strategy that the president has adopted. It is not a strategy for a year or two. Some people say that the president is losing popularity. It is not popularity like that of Miss Polonia contests. I apologize to my colleagues who.... [Drzycimski, interrupting] To your colleague, the prime minister's spokesperson? [Woyciechowski] No, that is not what I meant. I meant those who deal with these problems. Well, now, we do not participate in any contests. The president looks at a strategy that does not include just a year or two; it is a long-term strategy. In those three years that the president has been in office, we could not find any elements that were evident mistakes of the president. Even his greatest adversaries could not say that he violated the law or that he destroyed the state. They are simply not able to say anything like this. They can speak about other matters but not these. This proves that, if President Lech Walesa decides to run for the office of president again, he has some experience, and he can say: This is what I have done. If you want, you can accept me. If you do not want to do that, without any apparent cause, this will be a decision of the people, just like the September elections were a decision of the people. This is the ultimate decision. The president, as a man who builds the rules of democracy, believes that everyone must submit to such a decision, no matter whether he agrees or not. This is a decision made in the elections. I only hope that we will all respect such rules. [Drzycimski] Thank you, Mr. Minister, for the interview. [Woyciechowski] Thank you very much.
