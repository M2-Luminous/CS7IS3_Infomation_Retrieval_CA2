A number of persons were arrested and are being interrogated for referral to the judiciary. Today's issue of the London-based AL-HAYAH newspaper cites an official source as saying that storming operations were not exclusive to Kasrawan but covered all the areas, including Beirut and its suburbs. The source affirmed that the Lebanese security agencies and intelligence apparatus have a complete file on various security incidents, including the Sayyidat al-Najat [church] explosion. This file gives us clear clues to the culprits in these incidents, he said. However, he added, clues are not sufficient in a country like Lebanon, because there is a difference between evidence that convinces the security organs and that which will convince the judiciary. Responding to a question, the official source said that the arrest campaigns dealt with more than 13 persons--explosives experts and suspects, or people wanted in certain cases involving deliberate attempts to mar the atmosphere and spread panic among the public. Replying to another question, the official source said that the conduct of Lebanese Forces commander Samir Ja'ja' after the explosion in the Sayyidat al-Najat church was not a political move so much as a security move which he wanted to use to show that others were being unjust to him or to forestall the security forces from trying to uncover the culprits and thus ease the worries of persons connected to him. The investigation will entail interrogations of these persons for information the investigators need, the source remarked. He added: They leaked the story that the Army had stationed soldiers at the entrances to the headquarters of Ja'ja' in Ghidras and that the troops had tried to go in one of the entrances but had retreated after an argument with the headquarters guards. This is not true, the source said, adding: The Army does not retreat before the guards of any headquarters. The days when headquarters guards could do that are over; it is no longer possible for any party to use force to prevent the Army from entering any place or to light the fuse on a certain front or instigate a battle. The Army is capable of settling any military or security situation, he affirmed, adding: To put it simply, the Army had no orders to enter this particular headquarters. Explaining the reason for the reinforcement of Army troops in Ghidras, the source said: As part of the storming operations that started on Thursday, two of the Lebanese Forces' members are wanted for interrogation; their leadership knows this. When we demanded that these persons be turned over, they stirred up that commotion in order to harm the military institution as part of a coordinated campaign that started with the church explosion. Some people have grudges against the military institution, the source said. He added that some persons in the Lebanese Forces headquarters are wanted. Warrants have been issued for some of them and some have been sentenced in absentia, including Raji 'Abduh, who is wanted in connection with the assassination attempt against the president of the republic in 1991. Others are wanted for interrogation and to testify in the case of the church explosion. These people must be turned over, he said. Some of these persons played a certain role or have information about certain persons, he explained. The official source told AL-HAYAH that the security file the authorities are handling, in close coordination, includes investigations into the explosion at the Phalangist Party central headquarters and other incidents. More important in this connection is that the Israeli network that the security agencies discovered, some of whose suspected members have been referred to the judiciary, has branches in the occupied border strip and other areas. One of the major suspects in this network has not yet been arrested, but he is known to be in a certain area, which we will not reveal. This area is known to us and to others, the source said. The source believes that the Lebanese Forces are blowing the case out of proportion in order to close the file and reach a settlement with the state concerning their wanted members.
