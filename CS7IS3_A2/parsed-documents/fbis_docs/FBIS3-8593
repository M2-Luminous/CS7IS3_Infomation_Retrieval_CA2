The RILINDJA commentary says that this action is indicative of the FYROM decision to eliminate the Albanian language from the mass media. In keeping with this policy, the Macedonian police recently confiscated 200 copies of SHKENDIA magazine published in Kosova at the border point between Kosova and the FYROM, in the vicinity of Jazhice. The confiscation was explained by saying that the educational nature of the magazine made it subject to censorship. According to the chief of the customs house, this magazine "must be read" before its sale can be permitted.
