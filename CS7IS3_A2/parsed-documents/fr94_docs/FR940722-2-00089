FR940722-2-00089 FR940722-2-00058 WL's laboratory has adequate floor space for testing and evaluation and an adequate number of technical and professional personnel to accomplish the services required for the present workload in the areas of recognition it seeks. Environmental conditions in the laboratory are adequately controlled for the type of testing performed in the laboratory. OSHA has determined that Wyle Laboratories has appropriate written test procedures, and calibration and quality control programs to enable it to adequately perform appropriate testing. Creditable Reports/Complaint Handling Section 1910.7(b)(4) provides that an OSHA recognized NRTL must maintain effective procedures for producing creditable findings and reports that are objective and without bias. The laboratory, in order to be recognized, must also maintain effective procedures for handling complaints under a fair and reasonable system. Wyle Laboratories meets these criteria. WL's application as well as the on-site review report indicate that WL does maintain effective procedures for producing creditable findings and reports that are objective. The laboratory maintains a system for identifying product samples submitted for testing to ensure that there is no confusion regarding the identity of the samples or the results of the measurement. Wyle Laboratories' Standard Operating Procedure documents the investigation and testing for product safety investigations. These standard operating procedures specify the records that are to be maintained for the investigation, list the general steps of the investigation in chronological order, specify the personnel responsible for conducting each stage of the investigation, and require the investigators to verify that the latest edition of the standards are used. Wyle Laboratories has a written Appeals Procedure which provides an unbiased review of questions or protests regarding the results or process of Wyle Laboratories' Product Safety Certification Program by a client or any interested third party. Type of Testing The standard contemplates that testing done by NRTLs fall into one of two categories: testing to determine conformance with appropriate test standards, or experimental testing where there might not be one specific test standard covering the new product or material. WL has applied for recognition in the first category. Follow-Up Procedures Section 1910.7(b)(2) requires that the NRTL provide certain follow-up procedures, to the extent necessary, for the particular equipment or material to be listed, labeled, or accepted. These include implementation of control procedures for identifying the listed or labeled equipment or materials, inspecting the production run at factories to assure conformance with test standards, and conducting field inspections to monitor and assure the proper use of the label. Wyle Laboratories performs inspections of factory production runs to assure conformance with the appropriate product safety standard and WL's Certification Report. The adequacy of the manufacturer's Quality Control Program will be reviewed on the initial inspection. WL's Follow-Up Services Agreement requires that it will have access, unannounced and unrestricted, to all facilities where products may be fabricated, processed, or stored. Such inspections will be conducted at approximately three-month intervals from the date of the initial inspection, (four times per year), depending upon production schedules. The inspection is to assure that the product on the production line is identical to the product tested and approved for labeling. The procedure states that unresolved discrepancies found during the follow-up inspections could result in forfeiture of the right to apply the label, removal of the already affixed labels, and the recall of products sold with the label. WL will retain the right to notify vendors, authorities, potential users, and others of the improper, or unauthorized, use of its mark. WL will conduct field inspections to monitor and assure the proper use of its certification mark after the products are delivered. Independence Section 1910.7(b)(3) requires that an NRTL be completely independent of employers subject to the tested equipment requirements and of any manufacturer or vendors of equipment or materials being tested. The applicant stated in it application that it is in complete compliance with this requirement. OSHA believes, based upon an examination of the application with particular reference to the statements in Exhibit 2A(1), Section 3, pages 12 and 13, and the response (Ex. 4) to questions raised by the Office of the Solicitor, that Wyle Laboratories is independent within the meaning of section 1910.7(b)(3). Test Standards Section 1910.7 requires that an NRTL use ``appropriate test standards'', which are defined, in part, to include any standard that is currently designated as an American National Standards Institute (ANSI) safety designated product standard or an American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) test standard used for evaluation of products or materials. As to the non-ANSI UL test standards for which WL has applied to test products to, OSHA previously had examined the status of the Underwriters Laboratories Inc. (UL) Standards for Safety and, in particular, the method of their development, revision and implementation, and had determined that they are appropriate test standards under the criteria described in 29 CFR 1910.7(c) (1), (2), and (3). That is, these standards specify the safety requirements for specific equipment or classes of equipment and are recognized in the United States as safety standards providing adequate levels of safety; they are compatible and remain current with periodic revisions of applicable national codes and installation standards; and they are developed by a standards developing organization under a method providing for input and consideration of views of industry groups, experts, users, consumers, governmental authorities, and others having broad experience in the safety fields involved.
