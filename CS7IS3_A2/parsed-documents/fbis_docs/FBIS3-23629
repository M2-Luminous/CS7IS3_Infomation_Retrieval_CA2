"Having nationalized" the troops located on its territory, Kiev destroyed the once unified defense complex but it didn't manage to properly utilize what it obtained as an inheritance. Today, the Ukrainian National Army (UNA) is that same mirage that it was two years ago. Ukraine always played a key role in the Union's defense system. The Soviet General Staff proceeded from the concept that the primary threat to the country's security emanates from the West and therefore Moscow did not begrudge the resources to strengthen the western borders. The newest military equipment and the most effective weapons were first and foremost supplied to the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany and also to the Carpathian and Odessa military districts. Ukrainian military-industrial complex enterprises, which composed 30% of the USSR's defense potential, received enormous investments from the center. Ukraine obtained a truly luxurious inheritance from the Soviet Armed Forces. Besides 176 RS-18 (SS-19) and RS-22 (SS-24) intercontinental ballistic missiles, 1,280 warheads and more than 40 Tu-95MS and Tu-160 strategic bombers with 600 air-based cruise missiles, Ukraine "privatized" second strategic echelon regiments and divisions -- the most combat capable military units. This is 20 motorized-rifle and tank divisions, coastal defense forces, several airborne assault formations, three high-powered artillery divisions, and hundreds of special purpose units and subunits. Add to that four air armies armed with 230 fighter aviation aircraft and 620 ground attack aircraft. And, furthermore, Ukraine obtained 330 strike helicopters; units and formations of an independent PVO [air defense] army; missile attack warning system, intelligence, and communications facilities and so on. Taking into account the personnel of all military structures, the strength of the units and formations totaled approximately 700,000 men. This enormous quantity of troops had a powerful technical base at that time. Its inventory consisted of new T-64 and T-72 tanks; BMP-1, BMP-2, BTR-70, BTR-80, and BRM-1K armored vehicles; 2A65, 2S19, BM-21, and 9P140 -- artillery and missile systems; "Tochka" tactical missile systems; S-200 and S-300 air defense missile systems; Mi-6, Mi-8, Mi-9 and Mi-24 helicopters; and, MiG-25, MiG-29, Su-24, Su-25 and Su-27 aircraft. However, in the final analysis this mighty military potential did a disservice to Ukraine, having hung heavy weights on its economy and budget. According to the experts, when it began creating its own army, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense initially permitted several elementary errors. First of all, it did not assess the actual expenditures associated with the maintenance and storage of weapons. Second, it did not resolve a fundamental issue: What is reasonable sufficiency of military equipment and personnel, taking into account the capabilities of the economy and the state budget. Third, it did not become involved with the immediate sale of excess equipment to the national economy and excess weapons and military vehicles -- abroad. As a result, today all of the military equipment is in such a deplorable state that it can be sold only for scrap. Reform According to Morozov In 1992, Ukrainian Minister of Defense General Morozov announced that he was beginning a four-stage military reform. The mechanisms for command and control of the troops would be established in the first stage (1992-1993), a strategic plan for the employment of the armed forces would be developed in the second stage (1993-1994) and, a mobilized deployment and reserve training system would be developed in the third (1995). By that time, they assumed the strength of the Ukrainian National Army would be reduced to 400,000-450,000 servicemen and to 200,000-250,000 servicemen by the year 2000 (the fourth stage). At that time, it was announced that the Ukrainian armed forces would consist of three types of troops -- ground troops, the air force and the navy. They proposed creating two operational commands -- Western and Southern -- based upon the military districts. In Morozov's words, 1993 was to have become the key year, during the course of which they would have to "resolve the primary group of issues associated with the qualitative transformations of the army". Alas, this year turned out to be "key" only for the minister of defense who was forced into retirement. General Vitaliy Radetskiy, who replaced Morozov, openly announced at an 18 January press conference that "the armed forces still do not have a unified command and control system and mastery of military terminology is an important problem". In other words, the new minister of defense admitted that he will have to begin military reform practically from the beginning. According to observers, the fact that the former minister of defense was too dependent on the political situation was the primary reason for the failure of "reform according to Morozov". This may have been explained in part by the fact that the "Russian general" at the head of the military department was immediately perceived by certain circles as a potential "traitor of Ukrainian national interests". Therefore, from the first day in the minister's post, Morozov was compelled to be less involved with the organizational development of the army and more involved with maneuvering among the president, parliament, the government, nationalists, communists, and Democrats... The aspiration to immediately please all political forces did not leave any chances to achieve any definite concept of military reform. And essentially all innovations were reduced to the fact that the commanders began to appoint those who had "Ukrainian" written on their military identity cards and knowledge of the Ukrainian language became the main criterion of professional training. "A regimental commander told us frankly: Henceforth the main thing for us is not to fly well but to issue commands and to conduct radio exchanges in the Ukrainian language", says Military Pilot Aleksandr Serdyuk. "As they say, we got the message and began to master Ukrainian. And no one really knows military terms, other terms simply do not exist in the Ukrainian language, and therefore we communicate primarily in obscene international slang..." "The most horrible thing is that from the beginning the Ukrainian Army began to be built on the most loathsome Soviet principles," says former Ukrainian Ministry of Defense Central Staff Associate Colonel Vasiliy Osipenko. "Total window dressing, eye wash, corruption and absolute indifference to the actual state of combat readiness of units and subunits. The chain reaction of deception began with Morozov's optimistic reports to the president in which it was argued that the difficulties in the army were temporary." Characterizing the state of the army, one highly-placed Ukrainian Ministry of Defense bureaucrat pointed out that the level of combat readiness had been reduced by more than 70%. In his words, pilots who do not at all know how to fly as a pilot in command are being graduated from military flying schools. "Taking into account the extremely unfavorable situation with nuclear weapons storage and the critical social tension in the troops, the Ukrainian armed forces are dangerous first and foremost for their own country." ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |The Deployment of the USSR Armed Forces in the Republics | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Republic |Divisions |Aircraft |Intercontinen-|Heavy Bombers | | | | |tal Missiles | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Russia |71 |2,380 |1,035 |70 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ukraine |20 |850 |176 |43 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Belarus |10 |470 |72 |-- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Kazakhstan |4 |340 |104 |-- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Uzbekistan |1 |290 |-- |-- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Turkmeniya |4 |160 |-- |-- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Kyrgyzstan |1 |-- |-- |-- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Armenia |3 |-- |-- |-- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Azerbaijan |4 |130 |-- |-- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Georgia |4 |240 |-- |-- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Moldova |1 |-- |-- |-- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Estonia |1 |110 |-- |-- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Latvia |1 |180 |-- |-- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Lithuania |4 |70 |-- |-- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Numerical Composition of the Strategic Forces on the Territories of Be-| |larus, Kazakhstan, Russia and Ukraine | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Intercontinent-|SLBM's [submar-|Heavy bombers |Total | | |al missiles |ine-launched b-| | | | | |allistic missi-| | | | | |les] | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Countr-|Platfo-|Warhea-|Platfo-|Warhea-|Platfo-|Warhea-|Platfo-|Warhea-| |ies |rms |ds |rms |ds |rms |ds |rms |ds | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Belarus|81 |81 |-- |-- |-- |-- |81 |81 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Kazakh-|98 |980 |-- |-- |40 |240 |138 |1,220 | |stan | | | | | | | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Russia |912 |3,970 |788 |2,652 |79 |271 |1,779 |6,893 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ukraine|176 |1,240 |-- |-- |43 |372 |219 |1,612 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Total |1,267 |6,271 |788 |2,652 |162 |883 |2,217 |9,806 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- An Army of Turncoats? Having an inadequate number of its own skilled command cadres, Ukraine at one time attempted to entice them from the CIS countries. Already in 1991, the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers adopted a decree on increasing staff salaries by a factor of 2.5 and rank salaries by a factor of 1.5. At that time, officer salaries in Ukraine significantly exceeded the salaries of their colleagues in the near abroad. The widely advertised law "On Pension Support of Servicemen and Command and Rank and File Individuals of the Internal Affairs Organs" played its role. Officers, army and naval warrant officers, and extended service military personnel who agreed to take the Ukrainian oath were promised: For 20 years service, a pension -- 50 percent of the salary and, those released due to illness -- 55 percent plus three percent of that sum for each year of service over 20 years. Currently, all of these benefits have worked out so that the salary of the Ukrainian minister of defense in coupons is equivalent to the salary of a Russian major in rubles. But at that time many officers were bought by the generous promises and rushed to be transferred to serve in Ukraine. Today, the situation has drastically changed; of ten military academy students, only one agrees to go serve in the Ukrainian National Army. But then again, the reverse process is gaining momentum before our very eyes. "Recently, officers are running from Ukraine to Russia nearly in entire subunits," asserts Reserve Colonel of Justice Sergey Borisenko. "Previously, it was as if they sought a plausible pretext to change their duty location. Now they drive to Moscow without notice and knock on every door of the Russian Ministry of Defense." This is the sad result of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense leaders' reliance on officer-turncoats. This is entirely legitimate since a serviceman who has once betrayed the oath for the sake of a higher salary is entirely capable of betraying it ten more times for that same reason. Noting the decline of morale and the moral potential of the Ukrainian Army, psychologists think that the enormous gap between the promised material benefits and the beggarly (in real life) state is the reason for that. The situation is worsened by the fact that the officers and generals who took the Ukrainian oath in exchange for the promised material welfare (and they are 63% of the Ukrainian National Army) are least of all concerned about Ukraine's national interests or the ideology of national revival. They were prepared to serve here for good money. But there is no money and there is no obligation. Those are the rules of the game that the Ukrainian authorities themselves set. The Half-Life The fact that the military equipment that the Ukrainian National Army obtained is rusting and being destroyed is not so terrible. The moral "corrosion" of the personnel is far more terrible. "If I lived on the salary that I earn in the army, I would have long ago lived by begging," says Military Pilot Senior Lieutenant Yaroslav Fedoseyev. "All the more so that they delay payment of the paltry sum of this salary to us for 2-3 months. Therefore, I run a business in my off-duty time (and we "serve" from 0900 to 1300 -- there's nothing to fly in). Previously, my wife and I rushed to Poland to buy things. Today, I am involved in smuggling gasoline from Russia." And here is the revelation of Junior Aircraft Technician Senior Lieutenant A.R.: "The most widespread business among junior officers is narcotics trafficking. All officer dormitories are overflowing with "grass". Commanders prefer to sell materiel, fuel, and construction materials. Everything that enjoys the slightest demand is being sold. Our regimental commander contrived to purchase two automobiles and to build three garages during the three summer months." The pilots of an air base in the city of Artsiz told us about a noteworthy incident. In the middle of the night, they reported to the unit duty officer that the entire guard detail was drunk. While the officer went up to the guard room on foot, the drunken soldiers grabbed assault rifles and cartridges and left in a motor vehicle to go see some girls. The duty officer and several other officers rushed off in pursuit in their Zhigulis (there were no other serviceable vehicles in the regiment). They caught up with the soldiers. And... the situation drastically changed. Now the already armed soldiers began to pursue the officers. Rushing back to the garrison, the duty officer and his assistants barricaded themselves in the duty office. The soldiers attempted to take the building by storm but they couldn't pull it off because of their drunken state. Then they shot up the Zhigulis. This emergency situation ended with the punishment of the duty officer for... having driven to work in his own vehicle. Of course, there are enough similar stories in the Russian Army. The shortage of soldiers is worsening the situation both in Russia and in Ukraine. In a recent interview in SHCHIT I MECH newspaper, Military Procurator Major-General of Justice Vasiliy Melnichuk said: "No more than 12 out of every 100 young men are serving in Ukraine... The number of evasions of service in the army is 35% of all military crimes in the western region of the republic." Military analysts think that only urgent military reform can stop the decline of the Ukrainian Army that has not yet been born. But it must take into account not only the aspiration for independence but also the state of the economy. Otherwise, the question will arise already tomorrow, who will die earlier: The army or the economy?
