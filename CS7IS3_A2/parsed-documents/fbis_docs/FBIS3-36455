Uglyov had announced his attention to reveal this information in his address to Russian President Boris Yeltsin on January 22, if the latter failed to discuss with him issues related to the destruction of chemical weapons. The chemist explained his decision by the fact that he saw hope that the authorities could hear his voice after his recent meeting with the presidential advisor for national security, Yuriy Baturin. In addition, Uglyov said he feared that revealing the formula and other specific features of the new chemical weapons could enable some countries to launch its uncontrolled production. Uglyov also said he held hope for a favorable end of "Mirzayanov's fanned case." He said the scientist's intention to reveal the formula was the reason for launching legal proceedings against him. The press conference was also attended by another former chemist, now disabled Vladimir Petrenko, who became victim of chemical weapons tests conducted in the institute over a decade ago.
