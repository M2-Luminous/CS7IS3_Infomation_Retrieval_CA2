Over the past 6 months or so, people have seen through the media that a succession of measures aimed at combating corruption and promoting honesty were promulgated, major cases of corruption were brought to light one after another, and corrupt elements were punished by party or administrative sanctions one after another. According to information released by the discipline inspection and supervision authorities, since the second plenary session of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection which was held last August, some 470,000 party and government organs at and above the county (division) level across the nation -- including nearly 19,000 cadres at the provincial level -- have conducted self-examination and self-rectification in line with the five-point regulations for observing clean standards and self-discipline set by the Central Committee. Compared to the corresponding period in 1992, the number of major bribery cases involving over 10,000 yuan that were investigated nationwide from September to December last year rose 2.1 times, and the number of cases involving economic offenses by cadres at the county (division) level rose 6.8 times. Relevant central departments and local authorities at various levels have abolished 5,370 illegal fees. The localities and departments have stopped some 1,600 unqualified groups from taking tours abroad. The people -- after seeing the Central Committee's determination to combat corruption, improve discipline, and promote clean and honest government and the results that have been made -- have increased their confidence. A poll by relevant authorities shows that nearly 67 percent of the pollees believed that the negative and corrupt manifestations "have been contained somewhat" since the anticorruption drive was launched; 69 percent believed that there have been "some improvements" in regard to observing clean standards and self-discipline in party and government organs; nearly 59 percent said that are "satisfied or somewhat satisfied" with the progress in the investigations of major cases; 50 percent believed the unhealthy practices of illegal fees and government-funded sightseeing tours abroad have been "by and large halted." Reports from various quarters and sectors indicate a strong momentum in the anticorruption drive, which has produced the expected results of halting the spread of the negative and corrupt manifestations and has fully asserted the correctness of the Central Committee's game plan for combating corruption. Meanwhile, we must be soberly aware that although we have so far achieved some progress in the anticorruption drive, corruption remains serious and many deep-rooted problems remain unsolved; what has been achieved so far still falls short the requirements set by the Central Committee and the expectations of the masses. Moreover, it is impossible to root out corruption -- a problem left over by history -- overnight. Combating corruption and promoting honesty is a long-term task. We must not, in the slightest degree, lower our guard; rather, we should attend to it perseveringly. It is necessary to focus, in a given period, our resources and build up the momentum to quickly halt some corrupt manifestations and unhealthy practices about which the masses are most dissatisfied. However, if we do not remove, once and for all, the soil that breeds corruption, it will resurface -- or become even more aggravated -- after each attempt at rectification. Therefore, to implement the anticorruption drive in a deep-going and sustained manner, we must treat both the symptoms as well as the root cause; we should start with the sources of corruption and tackle the deep- seated problems in terms of the structure, rules and regulations, and administration. In addition to putting a stop to irregularities and rectifying discipline, we should also formulate new rules and regulations, introduce and amplify step by step norms and standards governing the conduct of party members and public servants as well as supervision and restraining mechanisms for fighting corruption and promoting honesty, step up efforts in formulating rules for party discipline and supervision, and bring this work within the jurisdiction of law step by step. As development of the socialist market economic system picks up pace and reform measures are promulgated one after another in the new year, there will certainly be new conditions, new problems, and new contradictions. In the changeover from the old structure to the new, inadequacies and shortcomings in the structure and mechanisms will emerge, inevitably creating opportunities for some people to take advantage of. Therefore, the anticorruption drive and the efforts to improve party workstyle and administrative honesty must evolve closely around and safeguard the general interests of reform, development, and stability; around the central task of economic development; and focus on critical problems that hamper and affect reform, development, and stability; there must also be clearly defined tasks and goals for the various phases of the drive. We must step up law enforcement and supervision; see to it that all policies and orders are implemented to the letter; safeguard the seriousness of political discipline; facilitate and ensure that the series of major policies and measures adopted by the CPC Central Committee and State Council for deepening reform, developing the economy, and safeguarding stability are fully implemented; and create a good environment for the defense of political stability, the establishment of a socialist market economic system, and the sustained, rapid, and healthy growth [chi xu kuai su jian kang fa zhan 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660 4099 1455] of the economy. An ancient poem puts it this way: "All nations and families past tell this story: diligence leads to prosperity and extravagance to disaster." Looking squarely at corruption and combating it with a firm and clear-cut stand -- this is the CPC's, the ruling party, answer on how to get out of the "historical cycle." It is also an indication of the party's strength and confidence. So long as we persist in Comrade Deng Xiaoping's strategic policy of "attaching equal importance to both and being careful not to emphasize one and neglect the other," the long-tested CPC will -- by relying on its own strength and the people's support -- certainly be able to root out corruption and, together with people of all nationalities and in a new pose, help one another like passengers in the same boat, work vigorously to make the country prosperous, and jointly build a modern socialist country with Chinese characteristics.
