The statement came in reaction to press commentaries criticizing the Presidential Office's announcement that it would not mediate Havel's interviews for news agencies. The statement was reported on April 8 by REUTERS and CTK. "There are no changes in dealing with requests for interviews," Spacek wrote. Turning to the REUTERS information that Havel would shun interviews with news agencies because his office could not control the published text, Spacek wrote: "In my personal discussion with the REUTERS correspondent...I said that we preferred papers to agencies, but no 'strict' ban was mentioned." This is at variance not only with the REUTERS report, but also with the written statement which Spacek gave CTK on March 25 after it requested an interview with Havel. "On principle we provide interviews only to media about which we are sure when, where, and in what shape the interview will appear. With agencies we do not have the opportunity to approve the final shape of the information in which it reaches the reader." Nevertheless, Spacek allowed for the question to be left open. On March 25 Spacek said that an interview given to an agency involved "risks due to which we have not granted any interview to any agency since the president assumed his post (in January 1993)." But in his statement yesterday Spacek said that REUTERS had been given answers to its questions three months ago. Spacek also wrote yesterday that as Czech President Havel had granted a total of 149 interviews to the media from 21 countries. He also wrote it was not true that Havel would not grant an interview before the April 15-16 meeting of seven Central European presidents in Litomysl, East Bohemia. According to Spacek, Havel gave one interview yesterday, and another will be granted today. But Havel's health condition and busy schedule did not allow him to grant an interview to REUTERS immediately after it was requested. Spacek did not mention CTK's request for an interview. The originally announced attitude of the Presidential Office to agencies was criticized by the Czech independent daily MLADA FRONTA DNES yesterday. It said that the statement that the president would not grant interviews because the Presidential Office could not control the published text created the impression that the Castle (seat of the president) wanted to assume the right to control the independent press. The paper also wrote that "the decision seems to have come more from the minds of the ruling Castle bureaucrats than from the president's."
