It is the largest international comprehensive games held in China in this century after the 11th Asian Games and also the first international games for the disabled hosted by China. Preparations for the games are in full swing. We warmly welcome disabled athletes from various countries and areas in this region to gather in Beijing during the games to talk about their friendship, win good results in the games, display the special styles of the sports of the disabled, and, seizing this opportunity, promote the "10-year Asia-Pacific disabled persons" activities and bring about the progress and development of the undertakings for the disabled. Deng Pufang held: Holding the Sixth Far East and South Pacific Games successfully will enable disabled persons to display their unremitting efforts in self-improvement, their indomitable spirit, and their ability for all-round participation in social life and, in the meantime, will promote the understanding and friendship of the disabled persons and the peoples of the various countries of the Far East and South Pacific, facilitate the coordinated economic and social development of the region, and help raise the awareness of the public in helping the disabled and develop the humanitarian spirit.
