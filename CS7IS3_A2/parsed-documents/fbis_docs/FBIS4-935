An NPKF spokesman said the defense force had not assumed the role of the peacekeeping troops. The area is reported to be quiet today after yesterday's fierce gun battles between hostel dwellers and self- defense units. Five people were killed and about 40 wounded. Earlier the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] repeated its demand that the peacekeeping force should be replaced by the Internal Stability Unit as soon as possible. Meanwhile, the police are investigating reports that NPKF troops fired on police officers in Thokoza.
