FR940712-1-00038 FR940712-1-00011 Of the 140 individual responses (some signed by more than one individual), 135 opposed reclassification or delisting in some or all areas of the lower 48 States; of the 23 citizen group responses, 19 opposed reclassification or delisting in some or all areas of the lower 48 States. Individuals and citizen groups suggested that it would be inappropriate to delist or reclassify the bald eagle to threatened while direct and indirect impacts such as contaminants and development on non-Federal lands remain a threat. The Service recognizes that habitat loss is a major challenge to the recovery of the bald eagle. The Service also recognizes that non-Federal, as well as Federal, habitat must be protected from contaminants, disturbance, and development or the secure population size will be diminished. However, reclassification to threatened would not reduce present Federal legal protection on non-Federal land nor would it allow habitat loss that could not otherwise occur. A concern expressed by 62 individuals and 11 citizen groups was that bald eagle populations were below the higher levels of America's pre-settlement days or other former era, or that populations did not meet the abundance, distribution, or productivity goals for delisting or reclassification contained in the bald eagle recovery plans. The Act's designations of endangered and threatened are based on the present or foreseeable threat of extinction of the species, not historical levels. Recovery plan goals for reclassification have been met at this time. One individual suggested that the Service conduct a population viability analysis (PVA) of the bald eagle, including a determination of the minimum viable population (MVP). The Service recognizes PVA and MVP as analytical tools and has funded and participated in the production of PVA's for several endangered species. For the present reclassification decision, however, it is unnecessary because the bald eagles of the Chesapeake, Northern, Southeastern, and Pacific Recovery Regions have reached the recovery plans' reclassification goals. Those goals are conservative and meet the Act's definition of threatened. The appearance of a lowered level of Federal legal protection was a concern in 26 individual responses and in one citizen group response. The prohibitions of section 9 of the Act are the same for threatened and endangered species, with the exception that with reclassification to threatened, the Service could issue permits for limited exhibition and educational purposes, for selected research work not directly related to the conservation of the species, and for other special purposes consistent with the Act (50 CFR 17.32, 17.41). All requirements of the Act under section 7 still apply. No changes in other protective provisions of the Act would result, nor would any other Federal law protecting bald eagles be affected. Thirteen of the 135 individuals and 2 of the 19 citizen groups recommending against reclassification or delisting were concerned that the Service's own efforts for bald eagle recovery, habitat management, habitat protection, and law enforcement might be diminished. The Service's obligations to protect bald eagles under the Endangered Species Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, the Bald Eagle Protection Act, and all other applicable laws will remain undiminished by the proposed reclassification. Seven individuals and one citizen group recommending against reclassification or delisting suggested that the Service might be either collaborating with or yielding to economic interests who want development restrictions relaxed in areas presently used by bald eagles. The proposed reclassification eases no restrictions on the development of bald eagle habitat because the Act and regulations adopted under it make no distinction in the protection given to habitats of threatened and endangered species. Seven individual and two citizen group respondents suggested that the Service might be delisting or reclassifying the bald eagle to enhance its reputation or for other self-serving purposes. This proposal to reclassify the bald eagle from endangered to threatened is undertaken in fulfillment of section 4(c) of the Act, which requires the Service to periodically review each listed species and to change classifications when appropriate, to maintain the integrity of the Act's endangered and threatened categories. Since the bald eagle has met its recovery plan goals, the Service is now taking this action.
