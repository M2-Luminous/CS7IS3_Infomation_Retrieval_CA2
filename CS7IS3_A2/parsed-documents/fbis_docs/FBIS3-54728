Soon the clock on the Kremlin's Spasskaya Tower will chime midnight and we will see off 1993. Whatever it was like it will remain in our memories, in our history. In this difficult year, civil war almost singed our homes and crossed the threshold of our Fatherland. I hope that the politicians and citizens of our country will learn the lesson of these bitter events. There were also important acquisitions in the past year. The new Russian Constitution, adopted at a nationwide referendum, came into force. It gives a firm foundation for the construction of a democratic state and free society. We held honest and free elections, and I hope that the people who were elected to the Federal Assembly will always listen to their people and think about the good of Russia. Now, in the midst of winter, we can say with confidence: Russia has bread and staple foodstuffs, and our houses will be warm. In the Commonwealth of Independent States we have at last virtually reached the understanding that we need to be together. We are so indissolubly linked by history, economics and a single destiny that it is simply not possible for us to live apart. Our people will not allow this, anyway. Dear friends! Now, in keeping with a long tradition, the majority of you are at home with your family, with children, with your nearest and dearest. Many are celebrating this holiday with friends. I wish you happiness in the time you spend with each other. May your friends be with you not only in times of happiness but also at difficult moments. This is the custom in Russia, and it is good that this tradition is alive. Not everyone is celebrating the New Year at a festive table. Let us remember them on this New Year's Eve. Let us remember those who are guarding our peace, those who are guaranteeing the country's normal life, and of course, thanks to those who keep our television screens and radios on the air throughout the night. On this New Year's Eve I would like to address in particular those Russians who are outside Russia's borders. Dear compatriots! You are inseparable from us and we are inseparable from you. We were and will be together. On the basis of law and solidarity, we defend and will defend your and our common interests. In the new year, 1994, we will do this with greater energy and greater resoluteness. I hope for you all, dear people of Russia, that the coming year is, above all else, peaceful. Preserving peace in Russia is my main task as president, but I know that it will be incredibly hard to do so without your support. I am counting on you in this most important endeavor. I hope that the New Year brings your families more good things and more peace of mind. We must be closer to one another. Only together will we be able to conquer need; only together will we be able to defend our peace of mind; only together will we open up a future for our children. May the coming year, 1994, be a year of coming together, a year of harmony, a year of reason. Dear fellow countrymen, I hope that in the coming year, 1994, that your family will not want for anything. As the president, I will spare no efforts to that end. May your secret dreams come true and may the ideas that you have not yet managed to put into effect be realized in the coming year. May those who are young find their love, and may that love be a long and happy one. I hope for people of my generation that their children and grandchildren will be good and loving. May we rejoice in their successes. And may we meet our children as often as possible. Dear friends! There are only a few seconds left before the New Year comes in. Once again I wish you a Happy New Year. I wish you happiness, good health and prosperity!
