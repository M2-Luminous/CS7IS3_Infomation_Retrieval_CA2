In a recent interview with station correspondent Li Xiaoqi, Zhou Nan, member of the National People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee and director of XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Hong Kong Branch, specially spoke about Comrade Deng Xiaoping's farsightedness and great insight as regards the Hong Kong issue. Zhou Nan said: [begin recording] With his farsightedness and great insight, Comrade Xiaoping long ago said we are not worried about the future of Hong Kong after 1997, because the Chinese people and their government will honor their words after 1997. What we are worried about is the transitional period. As of (?1984) there were still more than a dozen years before the transitional period came to an end. He was worried that problems might occur during this time. Some might try to create disturbances. He particularly mentioned that these disturbances could be created chiefly by the British. Further, he also issued certain warnings to the British, asking them not to engage in certain acts such as removing all money reserves or wasting money in a flagrant manner. At the same time, he also warned them not to attempt to put together a ruling apparatus to impose on the special autonomous region. It turned out these are the very things the British are doing. Everything Comrade Xiaoping warned them about doing at the time has been done by them. [end recording]
