It has called on the Spanish, French, and U.S. Governments, and all democratic governments not to receive the delegation which the Equatorial Guinean president sent out on a lengthy tour of Western capitals yesterday. It also called on them not to trust the demagogic speeches of the delegation as President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo continues to stifle the democratic process and daily violates human rights. The opposition cited the closure two weeks ago of all opposition party offices, the multiple arrests and torture of opposition activists and members, and last week's assassination of Gendarmerie Corporal Eliza Ngomove Abata. Furthermore, UDDS appealed to the international community and Amnesty International for urgent intervention in Equatorial Guinea on behalf of political prisoners and for the respect of human rights.
