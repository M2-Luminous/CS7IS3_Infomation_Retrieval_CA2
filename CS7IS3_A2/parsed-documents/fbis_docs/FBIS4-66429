By simply placing it outdoors, the sheet draws out of the air contaminants such as oxides of nitrogen (NO[.sub]x[/]) and oxides of sulfur (SO[.sub]x[/]). Without any human intervention or the addition of any artificial energy, the action of sunlight hitting the sheet gives rise to a photochemical reaction on the sheet's surface. Even if the effectiveness of the catalyst drops, the sheet's functionality is restored by washing the surface. The National Institute for Resources and Environment thinks the sheet is suited for use on the outer walls of buildings and in preventing noise near freeways. The sheet uses titanium oxide, a catalyst that reacts with NO[.sub]x[/] and sulfur dioxide (SO[.sub]2[/]). NO[.sub]x[/] can be recovered in the form of nitric acid. To prevent the production of nitrogen dioxide during the reaction process, the sheet is formed from titanium oxide and activated carbon, an absorbent, in which a porous fluororesin is dispersed. The ratios of catalyst, activated carbon, and fluororesin by weight were 3:1:6. The catalyst can decompose NO[.sub]x[/] if near-infrared light hits the sheet with about the same strength of sunlight on a cloudy winter day (0.1 mW/cm[.sup]2[/]). The sheet is effective for NO[.sub]x[/] concentrations ranging from the usual 0.05 PPM in the air to high concentrations near tunnels. The sheet's NO[.sub]x[/] removal rate drops to about half after 150 hours of use because nitric acid accumulates on the sheet's surface. However, a trial-produced sheet was restored back to its original effectiveness by washing it with water, and the sheet was all right after dozens of washings. Although trace quantities of nitric acid are present in the water after washing, it can be detoxified by putting some lime in the path of the runoff wash water. As for the titanium oxide, even if it is blown around in a strong wind it will not be damaged. The research group roughly estimated that the sheet can reduce amounts of NO[.sub]x[/] by about 20% when used in the spaces between buildings in the center of a city. In the future, the group will research methods of combining materials in forms other than sheets, e.g., paints and tiles.
