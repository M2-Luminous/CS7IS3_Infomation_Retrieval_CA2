FR940810-0-00106 FR940810-0-00021 NIOSH described an evaluation of airborne asbestos fibers during the tear-off of an old asbestos shingle roof from a residential building (HETA 84&hyph;321&hyph;1590, Ex. 44). Seventeen personal breathing-zone samples were collected for approximately two hours. For 5 tear-off workers the fiber concentrations ranged from 0.04 to 0.16 f/cc, arithmetic mean 0.09 f/cc; for two clean-up workers the fiber concentrations ranged from 0.13 to 0.16 f/cc, arithmetic mean 0.14 f/cc; and, for the 5 workers applying new shingles the concentration ranged from 0.03 to 0.08 f/cc with a mean of 0.05 f/cc. In this evaluation, NIOSH concluded that there was a hazard from exposure to airborne asbestos fibers during the tear-off of an asbestos shingle roof and recommended several practices to reduce worker exposure. OSHA notes that in some cases, the author of the above studies recommend more rigorous controls than the final standards require. Largely, this was based on evaluations of roofing removal exposure potential based on small numbers of TEM measurements. As stated elsewhere in this document, OSHA has based its risk assessment, and relative exposure profiles on the results of many studies which relied on PCM values. OSHA considered TEM in the 1986 standard and concluded that it was quite expensive and not fully validated. More importantly, OSHA believes that the roofing studies submitted show the relatively low levels of asbestos fibers emitted during removal work when proper controls are used. The small number of exceedances which occurred reflect poor work practices and ``uncharacterized and aged material.'' The purpose of the regulated area in the asbestos standards is to prevent asbestos contamination of other parts of the workplace and to limit exposure to only those specially trained employees who need to work in the area. While OSHA does not want to shut down the entire building when asbestos work is done on the roof, asbestos entering the ventilation system during roofing work is clearly unacceptable. OSHA expects good judgment to be used by the competent person in striving to achieve the intent of the standard. OSHA requires that roof level heating and ventilation air intake sources must be isolated. The employer would also have the option to shut down the ventilation system and seal it with plastic. Only necessary work should be done on the roof while asbestos materials are being removed, and the locations of the work should be selected to minimize exposures, such as upwind of the asbestos work. OSHA agrees that the 20 foot barrier approach recommended by Mr. Collins (Ex. 7&hyph;52) has merit, but believes the exact determination should be made on site, and could vary depending upon working conditions. OSHA concludes that removal of roofing material containing asbestos requires the use of controls to reduce significant risk. Simple procedures will reduce exposure levels substantially and, for the most part, will reduce levels below the PELs. OSHA believes that it is appropriate to require specification work practices for removal of asbestos-containing roofing material, regardless of measure exposure levels. As discussed above, these controls were recommended by rulemaking participants, although there was some disagreement regarding the need for some of the controls. The final standard requires the use of wet methods and continuously misting cutting machines during use and loose dust left by the sawing operation is to be HEPA vacuumed immediately. Some commenters were concerned that water could create safety hazards, so the standard reflects that the competent person could determine that misting the cutting machine, or other wet methods, should not be used. If wet methods are not used the respiratory protection provision of this standard, paragraph (h) requires that respirators be used regardless of exposure level. This provision is based upon OSHA's finding that dry disturbance or removal of asbestos containing material has large potential to expose workers and is in accordance with that of EPA NESHAP. Other controls include removing the roofing material in an intact state to the extent feasible, immediately lower unbagged or unwrapped roofing material to the ground via dust-tight chute, crane or hoist, or wrapping the roofing material in plastic sheeting and lowering it to the ground, transferring materials immediately to a closed receptacle in a manner so as to preclude the dispersion of dust, and sealing off air intakes to the building prior to doing any roofing removal. OSHA concludes from the studies that exposures can go over the PEL and create significant risk in circumstances when appropriate precautions are not take. Consequently, they support OSHA requirement for some specific work practices in all circumstances. Methods of Compliance for Class III Asbestos Work The newly revised construction and shipyard employment standards continue to regulate exposure to employees engaged in repairing and maintaining building components which contain previously installed asbestos containing material. In the 1986 construction standard, most of these jobs were called ``small-scale, short-duration operations,'' but, as discussed above, OSHA was instructed by the Court of Appeals to clarify the cut-offs for that designation. Now, OSHA has determined that separate regulatory treatment of repair and maintenance operations will not be limited by arbitrary duration and amount-of-material-disturbed criteria. Instead, they are called ``Class III operations,'' and are defined as ``repair and maintenance operations which may involve intentional disturbance of ACM, including PACM'' (see Green Book, Ex. 1&hyph;183). The major difference between the newly revised repair and maintenance definitions, is that the amount of material and/or the time the operation takes are no longer the criteria for inclusion in the class.
