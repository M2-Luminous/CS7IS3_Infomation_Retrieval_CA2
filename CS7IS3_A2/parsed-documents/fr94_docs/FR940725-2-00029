FR940725-2-00029 FR940725-2-00019 [Project No. 7745&hyph;003 California] Jerry Kaufman; Surrender of Exemption July 19, 1994. Take notice that Jerry Kaufman, exemptee for the Garden Bar Power Plant Project No. 7745&hyph;003 on Camp Far West Ditch, near Lincoln, Placer County, California, requested that his exemption from licensing be terminated. The exemption was issued on March 30, 1984. The exemptee states that no construction has been done on this project. Mr. Kaufman intends to remove the power plant; the turbines are old and the cost of putting the plant back into operation is too prohibitive. The liability of having the plant sit is also unacceptable. The exemptee filed the request on November 17, 1993, and the exemption shall remain in effect through the thirtieth day after issuance of this notice unless that day is a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday as described in 18 CFR 385.007, in which case the exemption shall remain in effect through the first business day following that day. New applications involving this project site, to the extent provided under 18 CFR Part 4, may be filed on the next business day. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
