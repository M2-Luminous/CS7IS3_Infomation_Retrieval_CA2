The PLO declared that the cabinet's decisions were insufficient, failed to meet the Palestinians' minimum demands, and disappointing. We spoke with Dr. Ahmad al-Tibi, PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat's adviser, a short while ago. Dr. al-Tibi commented on the steps slated to be taken against the Kakh activists, including their disarmament. Al-Tibi said we are not dealing with a small group of people and asserted that a large number of settlers should be disarmed. Ahmad al-Tibi called for an immediate solution to the problem of the Jewish settlements, especially those located in the heart of Arab population centers. Al-Tibi said: A new era has ensued in the wake of the massacre in Hebron and the Israeli Government decisions do not meet its demands. In short, Ahmad al-Tibi described today's cabinet decisions as disappointing.
