This makes integrated control possible not only for systems in the cabin like the air conditioner, but for drive systems like the engine. Since vehicle functions will expand in the future, this technology will have a position in the communication infrastructure. Three communication LSIs were developed in this project. However, when they will be installed in mass-produced vehicles remains undecided. Today, high-speed, large capacity networks that can't be used now are being constructed and made ready to meet future demand. This is the groundwork for creating an infrastructure typified by the information superhighway in the United States. Advanced PALMNET developed by Mazda and Furukawa Electric is a multiplex communication system (automotive LAN) to provide a communication infrastructure inside vehicles. The introduction of 1-Mb/s LAN inside vehicles will enable integrated control of not only electronic devices in the cabin like the air conditioner, but will extend control to devices in the drive system like the engine and suspension. (See Figure 1 which appeared in Nikkei Electronics, 14 March 1994, p. 9.)[.sup]1[/] In line with this objective, three communication LSIs were developed (Table 1). Figure 1. Example System Configuration of the LAN Developed for Vehicles. The two configurations are a low-and medium-speed LAN with its 125 kb/s transmission speed and a high-speed LAN with its 1 Mb/s transmission speed. Three communication LSIs were developed. The low- and medium-speed LAN has the Basic-IC as its core 8-bit microprocessor for control and the I/O-IC that integrates only data transmission and reception functions. The high-speed Hi-IC is a communication LSI that is connected to an existing control microprocessor. <annot> Key: 1. Air conditioner; 2. CPU core; 3. Meter related (navigation); 4. Headlights; 5.

The standard access method is carrier-sensing multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD). Preparing for the Next Generation The time frame for installing this system in mass-produced vehicles is still undecided. The 20-kb/s PALMNET developed by both companies in 1989 was installed in Eunos Cosmo, a mass-produced car. Its goals were to control cabin systems, like air conditioning, and fault diagnosis.[.sup]2[/] Rather than being a product for the immediate future, Mazda considers Advanced PALMNET to be a part of the communication infrastructure provided for the next generation of vehicles that will be safely driven under electronic control and will use the Vehicle Information and Communication System (VICS) for navigation. According to Furukawa Electric, the three communication LSIs developed here are practical devices that can be installed in mass-produced vehicles (Figure 2). <graphic> <capt> Figure 2. Evaluation Board. The three communication LSIs developed here are finished products that can be installed in mass-production vehicles.</graphic> First, installation will begin with luxury cars in which the number of wire harnesses (electrical lines for connections) exceeds 1,000 lines. This is associated with a 10% decrease in costs. In addition, space efficiency will improve. For example, a theft prevention system uses multiple sensors. Thus, if an LAN is installed in a car, new wires do not have to be pulled again from each part of the car to install the system. When audio equipment is added on later, it can correspond to a dealer's option and not a manufacturer's option. Compatibility with Communication Path Faults in ISO Proposals The two LAN systems developed here for vehicles are a high-speed 1-Mb/s LAN and a low- and medium-speed 125-kb/s LAN. The high-speed LAN uses shielded twisted-pair wiring; the low- and medium-speed version uses unshielded twisted-pair wiring. A feature of the high-speed protocol is the Simultaneous Data Gathering (SDG) function. In one transmission frame, data can be simultaneously collected from multiple nodes. This enables concurrent processing of multiple sensor data as in 4-wheel anti-skid brakes (4ASB) and 4-wheel steering (4WS). In the high-speed LSI (Hi-IC), the innovation of a driver/receiver is built in. So even when faults like short or open circuits occur in the transmission line, communication is possible. ISO (International Organization for Standardization) proposes that transmission be possible in the presence of nine types of faults. This LSI handles all of them. When a fault occurs in either signal line of the twisted-pair wires, the shielded wire is used for transmission (Figure 3). Usually, balanced transmission takes place in the twisted-pair wires. In this case, this shielded wire is set to +2.5 V. When a fault occurs in signal line A, the voltage level of the shielded wire is set to +5 V and unbalanced transmission takes place in signal line B and the shielded wire. When a fault occurs in signal line B, the shielded wire becomes 0 V. Figure 3. Transmission during Fault Generation in the High-Speed LAN. In the high-speed LAN, there is a switching function for the transmission system to use the shielded wire as the signal line when a fault like wire disconnection occurs. This function is incorporated into the driver/receiver of Hi-IC. (a) Normal operation: Balanced transmission uses signal lines A and B. (b) Fault generated in signal line A: Unbalanced transmission uses signal line B and the shield wire. (c) Fault generated in signal line B: Unbalanced transmission uses signal line A and the shield wire. <annot> Key: 1. (a) Normal operation; 2. Signal Line A; 3. Shield; 4. Signal Line B; 5.
