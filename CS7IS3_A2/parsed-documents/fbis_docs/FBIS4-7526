FBIS4-7526 "dreeu063_k_94017" FBIS-EEU-94-063 Daily Report 1 Apr 1994 CROATIA _O_Notes From the Press _O_Notes From the Press 94P20594A 94P20594A CSO [Editorial Report] Vukovar Officials Visit Exiles in Croatia Vukovar Mayor Dr. Jure Kolak, Deputy Mayor Grgo Plenkovic, and secretary of the Croatian Democratic Community [HDZ] city council Petar Mlinaric reportedly visited Vukovar exiles in the Makarska littoral region of Croatia to examine housing accommodations and problems. According to the 13 March Split daily SLOBODNA DALMACIJA, the exiles were "increasingly disappointed with empty promises," and "felt abandoned." They complained about "food, health services, and various types of harassment." The major topic of conversation in the Alga Hotel, where most of the Vukovar exiles are housed, was an impending transfer of 170 exiles from Vukovar and about 90 from Slavonia and Drnis in order to prepare the hotel for the tourist season. However, the Vukovar exiles have already been moved as many as six times and are refusing to consider another transfer, the paper states. They also refuse to be moved into weekend houses belonging to Serbs or into other facilities on the coast, insisting on remaining in the Alga Hotel. The paper cites Mayor Kolak as promising the exiles that no one would force them to leave the hotel and that he would insist that the Croatian Government improve their standard of living. The members of the Vukovar leadership found "an even worse situation" among 180 sick and elderly Vukovar exiles housed in the Djuro Salaj resort center in Grac. The delegation from Vukovar was also received by Makarska Mayor Ivan Ivanda and other local officials. During that meeting, Kolak expressed his gratitude to the city of Makarska for taking such good care of the Vukovar exiles, SLOBODNA DALMACIJA reports. Possible Violation of Sanctions Against Serbia In an article titled "Is Western Bosnia a Banana Republic of the Voce [Fruit] Enterprise?" the Zagreb weekly GLOBUS on 10 March reports that Fikret Abdic, president of the so-called autonomous province of western Bosnia, and Croatian President Franjo Tudjman held a "regular" meeting at the presidential palace in Zagreb on 7 March, immediately after which Abdic, in "his Mercedes with Vienna tags, accompanied by police vehicles, drove to the main office of the Voce Import-Export enterprise, which is today his most important, and perhaps only, business partner." GLOBUS explains that Voce, based in Zagreb, "in just a few months," had dispatched 30 million German marks' worth of goods in the direction of Velika Kladusa in the autonomous province of western Bosnia. The weekly maintains that the goods were transported in about 100 convoys of trucks belonging to Agrokomerc, a large agricultural and industrial firm located in Velika Kladusa and headed by Abdic. Each of the convoys transported about 400 metric tons of goods, GLOBUS reports, and, in the last four months, tanker trucks had been transporting about 200 tons of crude oil each. Voce bought the goods from the Zagreb-based petroleum processor INA, other Croatian firms, and "a few" Slovene firms, reselling them to the local government in Velika Kladusa. All the convoys passed through Serb-held Croatian territory, from Turanj, a suburb of Karlovac, via Vojnici to Velika Kladusa. Since the quantity of goods transported would be sufficient for a population three times that of western Bosnia, "it is clear that Fikret Abdic is buying the free passage of his convoys by reserving a portion of the goods for Serbs in the occupied Croatian territories," GLOBUS asserts. The weekly states that since all the goods sent to Velika Kladusa came from Voce, the following questions should be asked: "Has the firm violated the embargo against Serbia by helping Fikret Abdic, whom the Government of Bosnia-Herzegovina in Sarajevo has declared a traitor because of his trade with the Serbs? Has Voce, with the blessing of the Croatian Government, been selling the goods to Fikret Abdic...? Has Voce, once the largest export firm in the former Yugoslavia, which lost the majority of its partners after the disintegration of that former state, created, in the autonomous province of western Bosnia, an indispensable market for the sale of its goods?" GLOBUS cites Jure Klaric, director of Voce, as admitting that "even today, we are using the contacts that Fikret Abdic has established with the Serbs." HDZ Conflicts Linked To Cement Factory Deal Herceg-Bosna is not the only controversial topic among leading Croatian politicians, says the 25 February GLOBUS. The weekly comments that the case of the unsuccessful attempt in 1991 to sell the Split Dalmacijacement cement factory to the Italian firm Calcestruzzi shows that the most intense political conflicts in the Croatian Democratic Community are linked to important economic issues. In the case of Dalmacijacement, the weekly notes, a grave conflict emerged between the present chief of the intelligence service, Hrvoje Sarinic, who was the head of the Office of the President in 1991, and current Minister of Trade Nadan Vidosevic, who was director of Dalmacijacement at that time. GLOBUS publishes the minutes of a heated quarrel in 1991 between Sarinic and Vidosevic on the issue of the sale of Dalmacijacement, commenting that the minutes, in addition to revealing the extent of the previously unknown conflicts in the HDZ leadership, also indicate how business decisions are made in Croatia: "The minutes from Sarinic's office plainly show that even today the main decisions in Croatia are made just as they were during the communist regime.... The office of the president tried to make the decision on a business deal worth hundreds of millions of German marks [DM], against the will of the Dalmacijacement management! Hrvoje Sarinic tried two-and-a-half years ago to persuade, at all costs, the director of Dalmacijacement to sell the enterprise to the Italians as quickly as possible." Another significant issue, GLOBUS states, is an alleged commission of $12.5 million, which, according to the director of Calcestruzzi, was paid in 1991. The weekly adds that it is believed in Croatian political circles that the money was spent for government needs. Denationalization of Housing The Croatian Government has drafted a proposal for the return of apartments and houses that the communist government confiscated and nationalized after World War II, reports the 10 March GLOBUS. The owners, however, would be able to take possession of them only after a period of three to 10 years. GLOBUS points out that Croatian and foreign citizens who participated in the "aggression against the Republic of Croatia" would not have the right to retake possession of their properties. About 43,000 apartments will have to be returned to the owners from whom they were confiscated, and 150,000 current occupants will therefore be looking for new homes, GLOBUS states. Apartments for Government Workers The 15 March edition of the Zagreb weekly DANAS reports that the Croatian Government, as part of its housing reform program, plans to build 8,600 apartments for government workers in the next 10 years. The construction cost of the apartments will amount to DM670,800,000. Hotel Shares Sold The sale of shares of the Solitudo tourist hotel enterprise on the Adriatic island of Lastovo has been completed, says the 13 March SLOBODNA DALMACIJA. According to a decision by the Croatian Privatization Fund, the enterprise has become a shareholding company. The value of the enterprise has been assessed at 25,557,873,600 Croatian dinars, or DM6,811,800. The shareholders have bought 11 percent of the enterprise, paying a total of DM758,600. Of the 44 shareholders, 20 are from Lastovo and the remainder from other parts of Croatia. DM1 Million for Zadar Enterprise At a 17 March public auction at the Zagreb stock market, 1,139 shares in three enterprises were sold for a total of DM1,062,000, or 3.884 billion Croatian dinars. The report in the 18 March SLOBODNA DALMACIJA says that the largest number of shares traded at this auction, the year's eleventh, was for the Mehanizacija firm. The Croatia Bank purchased 999 shares of this Zadar enterprise for approximately DM999,000. Ten shares of Zagrebgradnja [Zagreb Construction] were sold to the Investco brokerage company for DM50,000, while the Rijeka Bank bought 130 shares of the Rijeka Usluga [Services] enterprise for DM13,000. Shares of Solta Island Firm Sold The 15 March issue of SLOBODNA DALMACIJA reports that the entire offering of 51,325 shares, priced at DM100 each, in the largest HTP [Hotel-Tourist Enterprise] firm on the Adriatic island of Solta was sold in the last few days. The shares sold represent half the enterprise's value. Shares constituting the other half will be transferred to the Croatian Privatization Fund, which will retain 10,400 of them, with a value of DM1,040,000, for possible owner restitution and offer the rest--40,925 shares--for public sale in the next 30 to 40 days.
