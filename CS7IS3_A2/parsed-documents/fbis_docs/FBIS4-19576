What do you think the chances are for such an operation to be carried out? Do you have any information about that? [Cetin] As you might remember, after the bombing of the Sarajevo market place at the beginning of February, NATO waited for a UN request to act. The request was made on 6 February. On 9 February, NATO gave the Serbs an ultimatum and delineated a 20 km wide security belt around Sarajevo. It placed the weapons in that area under its own control. Had this not been done, it threatened to carry out air raids. At the time Turkey argued that since the UN Security Council had declared six safe havens on 6 May 1993, NATO must do the same in all the six regions, not only in Sarajevo. That did not happen, however. Now, a decision has been reached under which the UN secretary general has the right to exercise his authority. This is the right decision but it is too late. In a letter to the NATO secretary general this morning, the UN secretary general asked him to decide to destroy, through air raids, the mortar, guns, and tanks in and around the five additional regions, that is Gorazde, (?Zepce), Srebrenica, Tuzla, and Bihac. This is a significant development. It has come too late but it is the right decision. I want to differentiate between two things. NATO cannot intervene directly because it is not its area of duty. It can only intervene if the UN secretary general asks it to. NATO can carry out two kinds of mission there. One is close air support. That has been going on very weakly during the past few days. The commander in the area has to ask for this support each time. The second mission is an air attack. Now, if it starts with an air attack, NATO does not have to wait for the request of the UN Security Council or for the UN officials in Bosnia-Herzegovina each time it carries out this mission. It can continue with the air raids until it gets results. Now, the request has been made to NATO. The NATO Council will convene in Brussels tomorrow to discuss this request. The Council is composed of the ambassadors to NATO. After a decision is reached, NATO will tell Butrus-Ghali that it is ready to carry out the mission. The minute Butrus-Ghali says go ahead, NATO can start to act, and after that, as I said, NATO has the initiative. This is an important development, but there should not have been so much suffering for this development to take place. I hope and wish... [changes thought] NATO has 16 members. The decision to carry air raids can only be made if it is unanimous. Efforts were made today to ensure this unanimity. [Alkas] There is also the Russian issue. Russian President Yeltsin has blamed the Serbs for the increased tension. Foreign Minister Kozyrev accused the Serbs of trying the limits of the world's patience. Russia announced that it will officially end its mediator role in the talks with the Serbs. What is happening in the Russian front, Mr. Cetin? [Cetin] What the Russian officials are saying is not new. Russia thought that this problem could be solved through diplomacy, through negotiations. The United States also asked Russia to try this path. However, if you look back to the past two years, you see that the Serbs only tried to gain time. We said both in Brussels and in New York that the Serbs were taking part in the negotiations only to gain time, because they needed time to achieve their aim in Gorazde. That is indeed what happened. And while doing that, the Serbs deceived the Russians. They promised that they would leave Gorazde to positions 3 km away, and that they would not occupy Gorazde. This is not the first time. We have been living through that for the past two years. In this way, the Serbs both gained time and prevented the United Nations and NATO from reaching a decision earlier. [Alkas] Do you think that a common approach to the problem is beginning to take shape between the United States and Russia? [Cetin] We also talked to the Russians about this issue. I met with Kozyrev a couple of times. I told him that to solve this problem in the Balkans, Russia must contribute, that we must act together. It is a fact that especially due to their common orthodox religion, Russia and the Serbs have close relations, Russia has influence over them. The whole world wanted to take advantage of this, especially the United States. However, the world later realized that the Belgrade officials, the Serbs, understand only one language: a determined threat to intervene. Otherwise, the negotiations mean nothing for them. The Russians realized this too now. I believe that they can now contribute more easily at the UN Security Council, if their policy continues along these lines. [Alkas] Thank you.
