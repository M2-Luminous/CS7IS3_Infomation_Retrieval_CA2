In Port-au-Prince, Cap-Haitian, and Jeremie, the opposite is being demonstrated, with military parades and marches expressing support for General Cedras and against a possible intervention in Haiti. On 15 June, Haitian Army battalions marched in Port-au-Prince and in other cities, including Jeremie and Cap-Haitian, with fanfare and flags. The military are reportedly parading as a show of support for the Army commander in chief. Civilians accompanying the Army took the opportunity to chant anti-Aristide slogans on 15 June in Port-au-Prince. In Cap-Haitian, the military also marched through the city's streets before placing a spray of flowers at the foot of the statue honoring the heroes of Haitian independence. Our correspondent, Joseph Claude Larouse, in Cap-Haitian filed a report: [Begin unidentified correspondent recording] In Cap-Haitian, several hundred military soldiers from the Haitian Armed Forces paraded this morning through the streets of the city. They marched to Vertieres, where they placed a spray of flowers at the monument to the heroes of the War of Independence. The military advised that this gesture was to ask the heroes for the strength and courage to resist to the end the difficult situation the country is facing, especially the threat of intervention. Colonel Josaphat stated, however, that it was just the usual parade. This parade nonetheless was held after U.S. officials made statements such as -- and I quote: We do not exclude any possibilities, including armed military intervention, to resolve the crisis in Haiti. Unquote. Several grassroots organizations condemned those statements, including the National Cooperative Action Movement and the Committee for Patriotic Action and Citizens' Defense, rejecting all plans for intervention in Haiti and asking that the sanctions against the country be immediately lifted. On the other hand, groups supporting President Aristide ask that Gen. Raoul Cedras and Colonel Michel Francois resign from the Army. They also ask for the immediate return of President Aristide to stop the suffering of the people. Meanwhile, since the new sanctions went into effect in the country, activities have slowed to 80 percent in the Cap-Haitian harbor and airport. For instance, flights between Cap-Haitian and Miami have been reduced to one. The situation is almost the same in the harbor.
