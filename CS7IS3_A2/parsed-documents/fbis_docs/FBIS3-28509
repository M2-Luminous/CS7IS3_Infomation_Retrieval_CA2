In the first five days of this month the Sunchon and Anju District coal mining complexes increased coal output respectively 11 and 8 percent as against the like period of the previous month. The Tokchon District coal mining complex is carrying out its daily plans at more than 130 percent by introducing new blasting methods and improving the operation rate of cutting faces. The Kangso District general coal mining enterprise which had hit the January coal target over ten days ahead of schedule is now producing daily several hundred more tons of coal than planned this month by giving precedence to tunneling and well managing coal-cutting faces. The Kangdong, Pukchang and Myongchon District coal mining complexes have lifted the daily coal output 20 percent above that in the corresponding period of last month by scrupulously organizing and directing production.
