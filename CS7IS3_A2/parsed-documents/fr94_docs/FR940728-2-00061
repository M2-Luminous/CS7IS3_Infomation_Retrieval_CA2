FR940728-2-00061 FR940728-2-00045 The EPA will hold two public hearings on its tentative decision. Comments can be submitted orally at the hearing or in writing at the time of the hearing. The public may also submit written comments on EPA's tentative determination to the location indicated in the ADDRESSES section of this notice such that they are received by the close of business on September 13, 1994. Copies of New York's state application are available for inspection and copying at the locations indicated in the ADDRESSES section of this notice. EPA will consider all public comments on its tentative determination received during the public comment period and during each public hearing. Issues raised by those comments may be the basis for a determination of inadequacy for New York's state program. EPA expects to make a final decision on whether or not to approve New York's state program by November 1, 1994, and will give notice of it in the Federal Register . The notice will include a summary of the reasons for the final determination and responses to all major comments. Section 4005(a) of RCRA provides that citizens may use the citizen suit provisions of Section 7002 of RCRA to enforce the Federal MSWLF criteria in 40 CFR Part 258 independent of any State/Tribal enforcement program. As EPA explained in the preamble to the final MSWLF criteria, EPA expects that any owner or operator complying with provisions in a State/Tribal program approved by EPA will be considered to be in compliance with Federal Criteria. See 56 FR 50978, 50995 (October 9, 1991). Compliance With Executive Order 12866 The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this notice from the requirement of Section 6 of Executive Order 12866. Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this approval will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This notice, therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.
