At Sochi airport he said that he had had a good holiday. Asked by our correspondent about his immediate working plans, the president replied: [Begin Yeltsin recording] What is waiting in Moscow? Well, first we need to complete the mechanism for implementing the presidential message to the Federal Assembly. I have been working on this here and a group has also been at work on it in Moscow. We will now amalgamate our work somehow and we will accordingly, so to speak, and in conjunction with the Federal Assembly, discuss this implementation mechanism. Second, there is the agreement on civil accord. I attach very great importance to this and have been engaged on this matter here as well. We also agreed that a working group would work on it in Moscow, and work has continued over the past two weeks. It also, so to speak, has its own material. Of course, we would like, I personally would like us to sign this agreement -- all parties, public associations and groups, factions, power bodies -- I mean, the Federation Council and the State Duma, the government, and the president. I think this would create a more favorable and calm situation in the whole of Russia, and not only in Russia. [end recording] [video shows Yeltsin outside airport building surrounded by journalists]
