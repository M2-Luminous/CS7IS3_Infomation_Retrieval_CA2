The council continues to insist on conducting in 1994 truly democratic elections to the deputy corps, combining the voting with a poll of the population concerning confidence in the mayor of St. Petersburg. It is worth noting that the petition was signed not only by those who lost but also by the "City We Love" movement, whose candidates won in five districts, and also the "Our City--Our Home" and "Unity for Progress" movements, which also achieved a certain amount of success. As we know, Aleksandr Shelkanov has not changed his opinion about the illegality of the elections. But the representatives of "Democratic Unity," "Business St. Petersburg," and "All St. Petersburg" still hold the opposite viewpoint. Incidentally, the leaders of "Democratic Unity" are now in Moscow--the question of the elections in our city is expected to be discussed at today's session of the State Duma.
