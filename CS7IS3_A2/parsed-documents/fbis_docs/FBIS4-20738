He said that the UAE was able to cope with the crisis caused by the drop in oil prices in 1993 because of its strong economy, which enabled it to absorb the shocks of the crisis and to adapt to changes in the world oil market. He stressed that 1993 will have seen a budget surplus, similar to that achieved in 1992, due to a drop in allocations for security, continued spending control, and an increase in government sources. The Planning Ministry said yesterday in press statements that the 1993 budget will achieve a surplus due to a drop in security expenditures following the end of the Gulf war, continued spending control, the combatting of waste, and the speed with which efforts were made to renew and increase governmental sources. The expected budget deficit for 1993 of 1.7 billion dirham [UD] failed to materialize, because state expenditures were less than the approximately UD17.6 billion estimated in the 1993 budget, and less than state revenues, which totaled UD15.9 billion. Financial sources expect this situation to continue in 1994, when expenditures and revenues are expected to total about $17.6 billion and $16.3 billion respectively. The government stresses, in the 1994 draft budget announced last week, that the deficit fell by about UD1.3 billion, and that the ministries' revenues from fees increased by UD500 million. The approximately UD1.3 billion 1994 estimated budget deficit will also be imaginary. The 1994 budget is also expected to realize a surplus, because the allocations provided in it are not all expected to be implemented. Unspent allocations generally pertain to investment projects that are not implemented at the designated time. The planning minister stressed that the UAE's economy will experience a discernible recovery, and that the expansion that began in 1992/1993 will continue in 1994 due to: the government's promotion of new investments in different areas; tangible development in private-sector activity, especially production activity; and the trend toward regional stability. The region is expected to see extensive trading activity in which the UAE is expected to play a key role based on the commercial and financial position it enjoys. He said, "These expectations are based on the continued remediation of the economic problems that have faced the UAE. This remediation has resulted in a surplus in the general budget, the development of the non-oil sectors in the economy, the achievement of greater cooperation with the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council, the encouragement of investment between the Gulf countries, the establishment of a securities market, the establishment of unified customs, and the opening of Gulf markets to each other, which will help achieve positive growth." He added that expectations of growth in the UAE are also based on: the ability of the UAE's economy to absorb the effect of the drop in oil prices; the UAE's joining of the GATT agreement that will begin to be implemented in 1995; and the achievement of greater cooperation with Gulf, Arab, and developing countries. He stressed that the UAE made a number of economic decisions this year that have enabled it to cope with and surmount many circumstances and to generate balanced development. He said, "The UAE saw a tangible improvement in 1993. It began to move beyond the effects of the Gulf crisis." He pointed to a clear improvement in the gross product, current surplus, and balance of payments, and to an increase in total fixed capital formation. He said, "Many factors have helped improve performance, including the recovery in the non-oil sectors, the realization of a surplus in the general budget, and a drop in the volume of transfers abroad, which had the greatest effect on the balance of payments." Shaykh Humayyid Bin-Ahmad al-Mu'alla stressed that the government of the UAE was able in 1993 to overcome the obstacles in its path, the most salient being the budget deficit that had emerged in previous years. Due to the government's efforts, he added, a surplus was realized in the 1992 budget. He expects this surplus to continue in 1993 based on the emergence of encouraging factors, e.g., a reduction in defense spending, continued spending control, and an increase in government sources.
