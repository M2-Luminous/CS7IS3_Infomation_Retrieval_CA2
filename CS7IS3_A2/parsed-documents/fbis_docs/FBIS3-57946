They said as much--in spectacular fashion--on the FIGARO MAGAZINE-SOFRES [French Opinion Polling Company] barometer in December by their vote on the performance of Interior Minister Charles Pasqua, who gained 15 points, with 59 percent wishing to see him play a major role in the future compared to 44 percent the previous month. The raid carried out on the premises of the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front]; the expulsion of the Turkish imam of Nantua; the police operation against the Kurds of the PKK [Workers' Party of Kurdistan]; and Pasqua's statement (made over TF-1 [French Television-Channel 1] on 21 November during the "Seven on Seven" program) to the effect that "France will no longer allow, on its soil, activities likely to harm its interests," constituted a veritable "Pasqua festival" and fulfilled the wishes of the very large segment of the public that voted massively for the right last March. The French people are also praising this cabinet minister for having acquired the constitutional means for ending the abuse of the right to asylum. At the political level, Charles Pasqua is seeing his influence grow. As one of the trio who heads the honors list of the leading figures of the right, he is closing fast behind Edouard Balladur and is within one point of Simone Veil. His actions contradict those--both within the majority and on the left--who criticize the government's policy on grounds that it is not bold enough. These actions also tend over time to marginalize the National Front by taking away one of its principal electoral arguments. The intensity of the pro-public safety sentiment is also confirmed by Pierre Mehaignerie's six-point rise in the poll. The French people approve of the keeper of the seals [justice minister], who dared to brave the hostility of the legal profession by introducing a bill that prescribes life imprisonment for rapists who murder their child victims. Most of the leading figures of the right are not lagging behind. The prime minister continues to rise in the poll, scoring a gain of five points: 65 percent of those polled have confidence in him, compared to 31 percent who do not. This score places him out of range of the criticism of an evanescent left. As for the impatience of certain individuals in his majority coalition, it is echoed less in public opinion than in political circles. The conditions of the new cohabitation have changed radically from what they were in 1986. Whereas the rating for the prime minister has remained at the highest level, that of the head of state is dropping. Francois Mitterrand has lost 10 points: only 38 percent now have confidence in him, compared to the 59 percent who do not. This decline is all the more unexpected in that it has taken place since his participation in the "Hour of Truth." Political analyses often set Edouard Balladur over against Jacques Chirac. They are viewed as potential rivals for the presidency. The prime minister's popularity has nonetheless not overshadowed that of the RPR [Rally for the Republic] president, who achieved a gain of six points. This almost general improvement in the ratings of the leaders of the majority indicates that the left has not regained the French people's confidence. Michel Rocard, the left's principal leader was severely penalized with a loss of five points in the poll. His presidential ambitions appear to be in jeopardy. His famous big bang [preceding two words in English]--which was to signal the start of the Socialist renewal--appears to have been just one more illusion. As for the approval ratings for the political parties, that of the Socialist Party remained very negative, whereas that of the RPR gained 5 percent and the UDF [Union for French Democracy] 4 percent. This barometer shows the price the left is having to pay for persisting in a culture of political parties that ignores the French people's need for public safety.
