[passage omitted] This afternoon he had talks with the president of the Polish National Bank and then he met with journalists. Our correspondent Michal Michalcik was present at the news conference: [Michalcik] [passage omitted] One of the questions was why no Polish-Slovak agreements were signed during this visit. President Kovac admitted that there were plans to sign two agreements. Last Tuesday, however, the Slovak Government neither approved them nor was in a position to approve them: they were still not ready. [passage omitted] Another question was why [Slovak] Economy Minister Ducky did not come to Warsaw Michal Kovac said on this topic: [Begin Kovac recording] Naturally, I am upset by the fact that the government has not agreed to Mr. Ducky's participation, but this changes nothing about the importance and the nature of my visit, because whether these agreements are signed during my visit or Prime Minister Pawlak's visit to the Slovak Republic, or on a different occasion, is not so important, in my opinion. I do not think that there is poor communication with regard to the preparation of the president's foreign visits. It is possible that the prime minister was not properly informed that coordination was taking place between the Foreign Ministry and the president's office--specifically, its foreign policy department. Coordination usually does not take the form of the president and the prime minister meeting the foreign minister and saying: When are we going, where, and how? This is prepared usually by institutions on the basis of various invitations we have received or made. In my opinion, with regard to this visit, coordination was as it should have been. It might not have been good between the Foreign Ministry and the government office--views were not united, or proper information was not released on which agreements would and would not be prepared. [end recording] One of the questions was, naturally, about Milan Panic's letter. President Kovac said on this topic that this is a gross provocation against Slovakia. He showed journalists a statement the president's office sent to the Slovak press agency, TASR. [passage omitted]
