Cavallo has said that those provinces which do not join the pact will lose investments and employment compared to those that join the pact. The minister issued a memorandum that will be released tomorrow at the cabinet meeting in which he states that whatever happens in the rebel provinces "will be their responsibility." His offensive takes place amid increasing complaints from state unions in the interior. Yesterday President Menem called the UCR [Radical Civic Union] "demagogic" because of its criticism of the economic plan. The provinces that do not join the pact will have no investments, will not create new employment opportunities, but will on the contrary see current employment vanish because of the higher costs in the productive area compared to their sister provinces that join that commitment. This is the idea that Domingo Cavallo wants to push through tomorrow at the national cabinet meeting. The minister intends to increase the pressure on the indolent provinces (the main one being Cordoba, the minister's birthplace, where all negotiations to include it have failed). The minister issued a memorandum, to which CLARIN had access, which he intends to distribute tomorrow among his counterparts. In it Cavallo stresses the importance of the transfer to the provinces of the heavy decisionmaking powers concerning the economic policy. The pact authorizes the provincial governments to make decisions of strategic economic nature. The idea of the economic team is clear: "What happens in the provinces that do not sign the pact will be the responsibility of the provincial governments," according to an official close to the minister's office. Cavallo's offensive is based on the unstable socioeconomic situation affecting several provinces. The situation in the interior of the country became evident amid violent social incidents that took place in Santiago del Estero two weeks ago and which included the burning of Government House, the Legislative Assembly, and the Court buildings. Starting with that social outbreak, state unions from different provinces strengthened their demands against the adjustment plans, demands which continue without a solution. Cavallo will propose tomorrow at the cabinet meeting, among other things, that relations between the provincial public sector and the productive area must be strengthened so that tax policy measures may be directly related to the proposed objectives. In this manner, the memorandum adds, decisions on provincial public policies concerning taxes, infrastructure investments, and essential public services such as education, health, security, justice or social assistance will have a new framework based on production. According to the Finance Ministry theory, 17 provinces and the federal capital will be favored in the productive levels that represent 28,166,659 inhabitants, while other six jurisdictions will see their economic activities hampered and their prospects for growth and employment for 4,442,028 people tarnished. The document proposes that "tax decisions will no longer simply imply the stabilization of public accounts. From now on, in the provinces that signed the pact, the provincial governments will guide the productive level and will be able to use the most adequate instruments to favor those sectors that promise to increase the level of employment and production, because the measures included in the pact seek to favor competition by cutting costs considerably." Last week Cavallo signed a detailed report on the accounts situations of all provinces, a document which he intends to use should his interpolation in the Chamber of Deputies be confirmed. In that report, which CLARIN published in an exclusive manner, Cavallo said the provincial deficits are the result of the 3 October electoral promises. The following provinces have not yet signed the fiscal pact: Catamarca, Cordoba, and Chubut, while Neuquen, Santa Cruz, and Rio Negro have already announced their adherence. But the economy minister's intention to influence private businessmen is also clear: "The many businessmen who wish to program higher levels of investments will be unable to invest in those provinces where tax and labor costs will be considerably higher." The minister will discuss further those differences, stressing that in the provinces that sign the pact there will be reductions in employers contributions on payrolls, which currently oscillate between 30 and 80 percent. This reduction is tied by the pact to the exemption of tax on gross income, the scope of which is between 1 and 1.5 percent.
