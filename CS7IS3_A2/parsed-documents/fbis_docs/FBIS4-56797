This session of the National Assembly is submerged in confusion and uncertainty. This session, which should close the seventh session of the 45th Legislature, has not yet begun. On the contrary, consultations are being held by the political blocs in the Chamber of Deputies, the president of which, Frantz Robert Monde, is meeting right now with the president of the regular Senate, Firmin Jean-Louis. [Jean] The meeting between the president of the regular Senate, Firmin Jean-Louis, and the president of the Chamber of Deputies has just ended. It is still not known what they discussed or what decisions were made on holding of this National Assembly. Frantz Robert Monde has just come out of this meeting and invited the deputies to meet with him immediately in the Diplomatic Room for an important communication. Right now, consultations continue within the political blocs. The socialist bloc is consulting with its members in camera. The Parliamentary Bloc-National Front for Change and Democracy deputies and senators are dispersed. They are not being consulted. The senators led by Bernard Sansaricq, however, are also consulting with one another. Preparations continue for this National Assembly, and the question remains: Will this seventh session be closed because of the insignificant number of deputies -- about 30 at the moment. Thus, there is no quorum; the roll has not been called. Meanwhile, reporters are there, waiting for the show to begin.
