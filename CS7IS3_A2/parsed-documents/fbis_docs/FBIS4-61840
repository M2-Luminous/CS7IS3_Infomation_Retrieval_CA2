Vladimir Kazimirov, Russia's ambassador-at-large, told journalists in Baku that a cease-fire and disengagement of the warring sides are envisaged under the first stage, which would last six days. A withdrawal from all occupied territories, except for the towns of Shusha and Lachin, must take place during the second stage, which would last 34 days. During this stage there would also be an exchange of POW's and refugees, who must return to their homes. Withdrawal from Shusha and Lachin will be tackled separately. Finally, the status of Nagorno-Karabakh will be examined during the third stage of the settlement.
