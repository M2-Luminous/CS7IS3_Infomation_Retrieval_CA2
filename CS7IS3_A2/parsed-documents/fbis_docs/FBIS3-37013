This was stated in a press conference in Moscow on Thursday by Vladimir Lukin, chief of the State Duma international affairs committee, and Vladimir Podoprigora, chairman of a similar Federation Council committee, who both visited the border area the day before. According to Mr. Lukin, the Estonian side, as it refers to the borders established by the 1920 Tartu Peace treaty between the RSFSR and the Estonian Republic, considers this rayon of Russia to be its own territory, which is reflected in its constitution.
