FR940112-0-00070 FR940112-0-00020 Based on our interpretation of the law, we will implement phases two and three of the 3-Day Payment Window provision set forth in section 1886(a)(4) of the Act and section 4003(b) of Public Law 101&hyph;508 by revising regulations concerning payment to PPS hospitals (§412.2) and non-PPS hospitals (§413.40) for inpatient hospital services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries. (We are not amending the regulations with respect to phase one since, as discussed previously, the Conference Report language indicates that this phase simply embodies our existing policy and requires no further administrative action to implement.) Specifically, we are adding paragraph (c)(5) to §412.2 and revising §413.40(c). We will specify that payment for inpatient operating costs for both PPS and non-PPS hospitals will include certain preadmission services furnished by the hospital or by an entity wholly owned or operated by the hospital to the patient during the 3 days immediately preceding the date of the patient's admission. We are interpreting the phrase ``wholly'' owned or operated to include any entity for which the hospital itself is the sole owner; for purposes of consistency, we are also including in this term any entity for which the hospital is the sole operator. We note that a hospital need not exercise administrative control over a facility in order to operate it. An operator implements facility policies, but does not necessarily make the policies; operating a facility simply involves conducting the facility's day-to-day activities, as opposed to ``control,'' which involves the power to direct the facility's operations toward specific objectives. Thus, §§412.2 and 413.40 will specify that payment for inpatient operating costs for both PPS and non-PPS hospitals will include the following services (other than ambulance services): •Diagnostic services (including clinical diagnostic laboratory tests) furnished on or after January 1, 1991. •Other services related to the admission furnished on or after October 1, 1991. We will define other services related to the admission to include those non-diagnostic services furnished in connection with the principal diagnosis that requires the beneficiary to be admitted as an inpatient. We invite comments on our use of this definition to identify admission-related services. We also invite comments on the feasibility of prescribing more detailed operational procedures in the regulations. For example, one possible approach might be simply to presume that certain specific types of preadmission services (such as chronic maintenance dialysis) are never related to the subsequent admission, or to presume that all preadmission services (other than certain specified exceptions) are admission-related. Another alternative might be to develop an inclusive list of procedures which are medically related, against which all claims could be electronically screened. Still another approach could be to define as related to the principal diagnosis any services that fall within the same major diagnostic category (MDC) as used under PPS. In establishing a degree of medical relatedness, the MDC approach would have the advantage of administrative simplicity for hospitals, contractors, and the government, as it would use a patient classification system that is already in place for hospital services under PPS. We invite comments on the feasibility of prescribing these or other implementation procedures in the regulations, as well as the relative administrative burden that each type of approach would impose on the program to develop and implement and on the facilities to comply. In response to the changes made by section 4003 of Public Law 101&hyph;508, instructions were published in the Medicare Intermediary Manual, Part 3 (HCFA Pub. 13&hyph;3), ``Claims Process'' in March 1992 (Transmittal No. 1565) and in the Medicare Hospital Manual (HCFA Pub. 10), in March 1992 (Transmittal No. 633). We note that we are making some conforming technical changes to §§412.2 (c)(3) and (c)(4), 412.73(c)(1), 412.98(b), and 413.40 (a)(3) and (i)(3). IV. Other Required Information A. Effective Dates The effective date of this interim final rule with comment period is January 12, 1994. As discussed previously, the Conference Report language indicates that the changes made by section 4003(b)(1) of Public Law 101&hyph;508 (which are effective from November 5, 1990, through September 30, 1991) simply embody our existing policy and require no further administrative action to implement; thus, we are not amending the regulations with respect to this aspect of the provision. Changes made by section 4003(b)(2) of Public Law 101&hyph;508 that include as inpatient hospital services those diagnostic services that are furnished during the 3 days immediately preceding the date of admission are applicable for services furnished on or after January 1, 1991. Changes made by section 4003(b)(3) of Public Law 101&hyph;508 that include as inpatient hospital services any other services related to the admission furnished during the 3 days immediately preceding the date of admission are applicable for services furnished on or after October 1, 1991. B. Waiver of Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and 30&hyph;Day Delay in the Effective Date We ordinarily publish a notice of proposed rulemaking for a regulation to provide a period for public comment. However we may waive that procedure if we find good cause that prior notice and comment are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to public interest. In addition, section 1871(b)(2)(A) of the Act provides that the notice of proposed rulemaking is not required if a statute specifically permits a regulation to be issued in interim final form. Section 4003(c) of Public Law 101&hyph;508 permits the Secretary to publish the regulations, which will implement the 3-Day Payment Window provision, on an interim final basis. Therefore, we are implementing this interim final rule with comment period without first issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking. Nonetheless, we are providing a 60-day period for public comment, as indicated at the beginning of this interim final rule.
