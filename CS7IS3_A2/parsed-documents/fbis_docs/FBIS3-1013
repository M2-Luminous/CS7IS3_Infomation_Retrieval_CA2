Doonan] [Text] Ulundi March 17 SAPA -- Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] President Mangosuthu Buthelezi has warned of unparalleled resistance should action be taken against opposition to the April election. "If the current election does actually run its course, and is finally declared a free and fair election, it will be because democratic opposition has been stifled by the might of the state," he said at the opening of the kwaZulu legislative assembly [KLA] in Ulundi on Thursday [17 March] morning. Mr Buthelezi said opposition to the interim constitution and the elections which met with "draconian or Bophuthatswana-type action" would spawn a struggle for liberation from African National Congress [ANC]/National Party oppression, "which will have no parallel in Africa". There would no peace or democratic settlement until there was a settlement of kwaZulu issues. Mr Buthelezi said it appeared to him that a free and fair election under the current circumstances was impossible. Speaking as kwaZulu's chief minister, Mr Buthelezi said the SA Government and the ANC were producing a highly explosive situation in the territory. He warned of an "uncontrolled and unorchestrated internal political spontaneous combustion" in kwaZulu. "I'm talking about a Bophuthatswana-type explosion, but unlike it as a result that it has not been orchestrated." He charged the SA Government was party to the violence which ousted Bophuthatswana President Lucas Mangope, and questioned whether it was the government's intention to do the same in kwaZulu. Mr Buthelezi said the country was poised "on the very brink of disaster...Let us join hands to ensure international mediation runs its course as soon as possible in the interests of peace, stability and justice". He repeated that the IFP and kwaZulu government would participate in the April poll if: mediation could take place swiftly; certain amendments could to be made to the constitution; and the party registration deadline and election date could be reconsidered. Mr Buthelezi reiterated that his constitutional demands remained those proposed in the Freedom Alliance's yellow paper of December last year.
