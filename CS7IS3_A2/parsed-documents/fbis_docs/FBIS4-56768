The participating governments committed themselves here to implementing, by way of a new action plan, the recommendations contained in the Agenda 21. The document adopts the goals outlined in the Agenda 21 of Rio de Janeiro '92 in the paragraph dedicated to small islands on specific policies, actions, and measures to be carried out at the national, regional, and international levels in favor of sustained development in these territories. The declaration says the survival of small islands is threatened, as well as their human and natural resources and cultural heritage. It adds that plans for sustained development should continue, giving full attention to the special needs of women, children, youth, and indigenous peoples. It reaffirms the sovereignty of island states over their natural resources and their responsibility in preserving their sea and coastal resources, as well as their biodiversity and national ecosystems, through international cooperation. The document stresses the special role to be played by nongovernmental organizations and the importance of their cooperation with governments to implement the Agenda 21 and action plans at the national, regional, and international levels. It notes that because of their size, small islands have particularly vulnerable economies that depend on scarce resources and world trade, without any means of influencing the latter. Based on these considerations, the 17 heads of state and governments committed themselves to formulating and implementing policies for sustained development that will include social progress, health, and environmental protection, mobilizing all resources available for improving the quality of life. They agreed to promote regional and subregional cooperation among the small islands and the international community. They also agreed that the international community should cooperate in the implementation of the action plan to provide new and additional funds in accordance with the [words indistinct] facilitating the transfer of technology, protecting intellectual property in developing countries, and promoting commercial agreements that will not be discriminatory against them. The Barbados Declaration makes the international community responsible for the protection of small islands to minimize the negative effects of natural disasters on their frail ecosystems through multilateral cooperation. In the document, the small islands commit themselves to eliminating or reducing negative patterns of consumption and production and to promoting adequate policies for democratic development. Rosa Elena Simeon, Cuban minister of science, technology, and environment and member of the delegation accompanying Cuban President Fidel Castro, described the Barbados Declaration and the joint action plan as positive, specific, and of great social content.
