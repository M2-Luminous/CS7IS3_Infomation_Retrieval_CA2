The metallocene catalysts introduced at the end of the 80s made possible the "custom-made" synthesis of rubber-elastic, heat-resistant and other interesting plastics. In addition, the new plastics are lighter, reprocessable and accordingly more environmentally friendly than the standard first-generation plastics. As Rolf M�uhlhaupt of Freiburg emphasizes, it has become possible by choosing the catalyst to synthesize polyolefins having desired properties. The mechanical, optical, morphological and processing properties of the plastics can be altered selectively by means of the new high-tech catalysts. Above all, the discovery of single-site catalysts has opened up entirely new capabilities for the synthesis of polyolefins. M�uhlhaupt writes in the journal NACHRICHTEN AUS CHEMIE, TECHNIK UND LABORATORIUM (Vol 41, p 1341) that examples of this are copolymers in which, as in the case of a polypropylene/polyamide blend, one kind of polymer is compatibly grafted onto others, and filled polymers. In addition, with alicyclic polyolefins--ethene tetracyclododecene, for example--plastics are available that can be used in engineering as high-grade structural materials and special plastics. The new polyolefins can be produced with less energy consumption than can the typical high-pressure polymers and are halogen-free in addition, they say.
