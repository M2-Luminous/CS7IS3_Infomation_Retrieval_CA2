Human Resources Minister Arjun Singh is not satisfied with his own government over the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT). He wrote a letter to Commerce Minister Pranab Mukherji about a week ago. He expressed his concerns over GATT in this letter. This letter was not circulated. However, he was not ready to respond to the opposition's allegations although he was the chairman of the cabinet sub-committee on GATT. Yesterday, Janata Dal's Nitish Kumar took a shot at him for his failure to speak on behalf of the government. It is believed that there is very little possibility of this issue being discussed in the 4 April Congress Working Committee meeting. According to some sources, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Vidyacharan Shukla wrote a letter to some senior cabinet members asking them to give a time and date to present the government's side on GATT. Arjun Singh did not think it necessary to respond to this letter. Secondly, he was in the Lok Sabha for a long time during the first day of discussion on 29th March. However, he was missing the next day. Since the Congress Party had not issued a whip on this debate, there is not basis for a disciplinary action against Arjun Singh. Also, he was asked to speak for the government, but was not ordered to do so. Those close to Arjun Singh call it their leader's opposition on principle. They argue that half of the Congress legislators were not present during the debate. They consider their absence as a disagreement with GATT and agreement with Arjun Singh. As for the letter written to Pranab Mukherji, Arjun Singh had supported making the government's stand transparent on GATT. This letter also mentioned the decision of the cabinet sub-committee. The sub-committee had talked with the representatives from different areas including trade and business about their reactions to GATT. It suggested having detailed discussion on various proposals included in GATT. Arjun Singh had asked in this letter to invite opposition leaders and discuss this with them. Arjun Singh says that efforts should be made to get the political parties and the nation in confidence on this issue. However, despite repeated requests, the government did have detailed discussions on it in the Parliament. These lines written by Arjun Singh can be seen as a part of the incident related to George Fernandes, the leader of anti-GATT group. Fernandes had a long talk with Arjun Singh on 14 February expressing his concerns over GATT. In this talk held at Arjun Singh's residence, George Fernandes had informed him of all the dangers. According to George Fernandes, Arjun Singh had not said any thing, but his expression showed agreement with him. Fernandes suggested that the effect of this conversation did not allow his conscience to defend the government. The issue of one-person-one-position and Arjun Singh writing several letters to the Party President Narasimha Rao over the Ayodhya and the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] issues are considered his challenging for leadership. However, the vidhan sabha elections in the six states stopped this exchange of letters. Now the opposition appears to be united in opposition to GATT as it never was during the Rao administration. The BJP and the non-BJP parties had divided over the Ayodhya issue. However, the whole opposition has risen against the government over the GATT issue. Perhaps, that is why Arjun Singh is encouraged. However, the Rao camp does not appear to be in a mood to give much attention to his letter. Mr. Rao's supporters say that a person who is in the government and is playing the role of opposition cannot be taken seriously. If Arjun Singh had such strong feelings then he should have first resigned from the cabinet. Secondly, there is a danger in the way Arjun Singh had put a question mark on Narasimha Rao's leadership by writing letters repeatedly over the Ayodhya issue. The whole opposition is accusing the government of selling the country and mortgaging the nation's sovereignty. The government and the ruling party want to counter the opposition's propaganda by holding rallies, meetings, and debates. However, when a senior leader of the government and ruling party makes his fears public over the GATT issue, the opposition definitely will gain strength. How much support will Arjun Singh get within the Congress Party? This is a matter for conjecture.
