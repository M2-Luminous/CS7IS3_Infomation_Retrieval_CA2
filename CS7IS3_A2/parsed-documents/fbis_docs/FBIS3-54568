This exposes the climate of suspicion prevailing in relations between the authorities and the opposition. Nonetheless, the Mauritanian Government says it is determined to organize the elections in an open manner. As an indication of its goodwill, the lists of polling station heads and assessors have been published. Here is Salem Meshbour Salem with a report from Nouakchott. [Begin Salem recording] Polling station heads and their assessors have been appointed nationwide. The governors of the 13 provinces that compose Mauritania have been asked by the government to organize introductory seminars on the administrative, technical, and legal procedures for the municipal elections. To this end, a training workshop is currently being held in Nouakchott for all the senior government officials selected to supervise the 28 January municipal elections. [passage omitted] Despite the training and preparation of government officials charged with ensuring the regularity of the polls, the country's opposition parties do not seem to be convinced in any way. They have condemned the mobilization of 2,000 nonresident soldiers to vote for the candidate of President Ould Taya's Democratic and Social Republican Party in the Nouakchott Arafat district. Among these soldiers, the opposition has mentioned the names and ranks of the National Army and Gendarmerie chiefs of staff. However, the law stipulates that members of the Armed Forces can only vote in their places of residence or work. [end recording]
