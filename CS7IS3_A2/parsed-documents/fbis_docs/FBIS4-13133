The source explained that the Hamas representatives are Jordanian nationals and enjoy freedom of speech. Consequently, their statements are within the framework of this freedom of speech. The source also explained that Hamas operations are planned and carried out by the leadership of this movement in the occupied territories and not by its political representatives in Jordan. After mentioning that the activities of the Hamas representatives are confined to only the political dimension and do not violate regulations and laws, the source emphasized that compelling them to leave the Kingdom is in violation of the Constitution. Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin had said that Israel cannot tolerate the Hamas Movement, the declared enemy of the peace process, enjoying a safe haven in Jordan.
