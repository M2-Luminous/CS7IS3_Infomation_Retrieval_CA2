However, now that dependence on the U.S. market has reached the limit, Japanese companies should manage their own risks and develop the Chinese frontier. There are no returns without risks. "Neophyte Group to Virgin Market"--Uniden Corp. Depends on Youngsters in Thirties Direct investment by Japan in China during the past year totaled $2.1 billion, surpassing the aggregate amount of the previous 13 years. The underlying factor is the increase of smaller enterprises planning to make inroads into China because of deteriorating profitability of domestic production with the rapid yen appreciation but views are being raised that "the time is gradually approaching to reassess making entries as stopgap measures" (Akiko Mase, deputy chief of Joint Venture Consulting Office, Japan-China Association on Economy and Trade). However, among Japanese firms, there are some which are promoting business with China with a clear vision and long-range strategy. Though by no means in the industrial mainstream in Japan, these companies, which have begun to occupy important positions ranking with Overseas Chinese and U.S.-European capital in the new territory called China, are showing the frontier spirit which big corporations have begun to lose. Xinyou S&T Development Co., Ltd.--a joint venture of communications equipment manufacturer Uniden Corp. and Chinese state-operated investment company CITIC (China International Trust and Investment Corp.)--which sells Uniden products, opened its fourth domestic branch office in Wuhan in mid-September. Mariko Osato (30 years old) assumed the position of chief representative of the new resident employees' office. Osato was interviewed when she returned to Beijing to attend an electronics show. She said nonchalantly, "Last week, I went alone to Wuhan and selected the office location. I will be residing in Wuhan from next week and I'll be alone for the time being. However, there's no need to worry. I have many things to do." Osato joined Uniden only a year ago. After graduating from Tokyo University, she worked at Japan IBM. Subsequently, she enrolled at Northwestern University and earned an MBA degree. While in the United States, she was recruited by Uniden and soon after returning and joining the company, she was sent to Beijing. She is by no means an expert on China and she began to study Chinese after her assignment there, so she is a neophyte. "Looking at barefooted persons, you can think what a terrible place you came to or you can think of all the shoes you can sell here, so there are two ways of thinking for a person and a company. China is a frontier." That is the way Osato thinks. At present, Uniden has eight resident employees in China, including Hong Kong. Nobuya Sada, chief representative in Hong Kong, formerly served in the subsidiary, Uniden 21, and is 30 years old. He had an outstanding record in the company's foreign sales of crystal oscillators and was handpicked by the parent company. Isao Sakai, chief representative of the Shenzhen office, is also 30 years old. Akira Fukushima, chief representative of the Shanghai office, is 28 years old. Both were unequaled top salesmen in Tokyo. All of the employees are young and each is competing in the huge Chinese market as the chief of his own sector. Eyeing the potential of the Chinese market, Uniden started consignment production of portable telephones in Shenzhen in April 1989 and started joint production at an adjoining new plant in October 1989. Chairman Yoshio Fujimoto's pet theory is: "With one-fourth of the world's population, China is certain to surpass U.S.-European markets. In the near future, China will account for one-half of this company's sales." Uniden's strengths are its young, highly efficient force as well as the selection of a powerful partner, CITIC. CITIC is a type of conglomerate with a wide range of activities, including trade and finances, in addition to investment operations, and has a big pipeline to the core of the government. In June 1993, Uniden received approval for a type of portable telephone for China only two months after application, a procedure that normally requires from half to one year, thanks to CITIC's support. The challenge now to Uniden is to break the domination of the U.S. giant, Motorola, which holds approximately 80 percent of the portable telephone market in China. In 1993, Uniden hopes to acquire a 20-percent share of the market, estimated at about 500,000 units, and rise to the position next to Motorola. Takuya Kumagaya, who is serving as the general manager of Xinyou S&T Development Co., says: "In China, companies with marketing strengths in their home countries do not necessarily win. Since this is a virgin market, you can devise operations through your own means. China's attraction is that neophyte groups, without preconceived ideas, have a better chance of displaying their strengths." Kumagaya, a former Sony technician, is another member of the group that studied in the United States and is only 39 years old. Resident employees are staying in the same hotel in Beijing, where the main office is located, and gather almost nightly to drink and encourage each other. The vigor forgotten by Japanese companies that had passed the growth stage is alive here. Rapidly Consolidating Production, Distribution, and Retailing--Yaohan Is Taking Advantage of Being First In state-owned department stores, 7 percent of the merchandise is stolen by employees and others, goods are carelessly thrust to customers, employees do not greet customers, employees litter the floor, etc. That is China, but Yaohan is trying to implant the Japanese-style customer-first retail service. As the first store in China, the Saide shopping center (Beijing Yaohan) was opened last fall. Four times a day, Masahiro Kurosugi, the general manager, stands behind the cash register clerk and checks on the customer service of sales personnel. He checks to see if product names and prices are being read aloud as the cash register is punched, whether customers are being greeted sincerely, etc.; at first, employees resented his close guidance. Kurosugi says: "There is still a misunderstanding in China that capitalism means moneymaking. I want to convey to the Chinese people the cultural aspect that service is the heart of capitalism and that, if one pleases the customer, one will benefit in the future." Yaohan Japan's investment ratio in this store is 19 percent. The Chinese subscriber, CVIC (China New Technology Creation Investment Co., Ltd.) has the authority over finances, merchandise stocking, and price setting; Yaohan only has the right to act as business adviser under the contract. At first, the Chinese placed illegal prices of 100 yuan (approximately 2,000 yen) on a package of sashimi for two or three persons, allegedly because the main customers of foodstuffs were Japanese who were rich, and asked to sell teakettles next to the cosmetics corner near the first-floor main entrance because "they sell well." Kurosugi painstakingly explained why each of these actions was wrong. At times, he let the counterparts do as they please and waited patiently until they realized their own mistakes. His efforts paid off and Kurosugi says, "In less than a year, the employees certainly changed. Personally, I'm beginning to think that the idea of service is taking root unexpectedly fast in Chinese minds." Chairman Kazuo Wada of Yaohan states: "In Japan, we cannot compete with our major predecessors like Daiei, Inc. and Ito-Yokado Co. However, Asia and China are unopened new territory." The aggressive inroad into China is based on Wada's thinking which stresses the importance of garnering markets first. Starting with construction of the distribution center in Beijing and building of production bases for its own products, such as the ham factory in Shenzhen, Yaohan's large-scale plans to consolidate production, distribution, and retailing are advancing rapidly. Ahead are plans to establish 1,000 stores in China with the year 2010 as the target. The Beijing store and the Shanghai Pudong department store, scheduled to open next year, are the first steps. "If we can quickly nurture personnel with accumulated know-how, becoming the leading store in China will not be a dream" (Kurosugi). Yaohan is receiving tie-up offers from 40 to 50 Japanese cosmetics, toiletries, and candy manufacturers, covering operations from production to sales in China. There is the expectation that "a retail-oriented distribution pattern, which is impossible in Japan where the manufacturers' domination is firm, is attainable in China" (Masaichi Tajima, Yaohan vice president). Yamaha Undertakes Joint Venture Promptly--Aiming for Joint Production With Future Rival Traveling 30 minutes by car along the northern bank of the Yangzi River from Chongqing City in Sichuan Province, one begins to see on the left side a section along which a concrete wall stretches for a distance. The area behind the wall is the property of the state munitions manufacturer, Chongqing Construction Industry (Group) Co. In a joint venture with the Construction Industry Co., Yamaha Motor Co. is building a two-wheeled vehicle factory at this site. Plans are to produce 60,000 vehicles annually in FY94, at the start of operations, and 200,000 units annually in FY97. Shozo Arai, Yamaha director in charge of the China project headquarters, gives the following explanation for the decision on the joint venture: "China produced approximately 2 million two-wheeled vehicles in 1992 and is already one of the world's largest producers. The growth of China's two-wheeled vehicle industry will inevitably continue. In the near future, it will surely become Japan's tough rival. Therefore, assuming the risks, cooperative relations must be established with China using our technological superiority as the trump card." The strategy is to get close to China voluntarily and find the way for joint survival instead of competing as rivals. China's annual production of two-wheeled vehicles was 3 million this year and is expected to reach 5 million in several years. In contrast, Japan's domestic production was approximately 3 million vehicles in 1992 but production is leveling off. It is certain that China will become the big producer of two-wheeled vehicles, leaving Japan far behind. Two-wheeled vehicles account for 50 percent of Yamaha's sales. Of the four domestic two-wheeled vehicle manufacturers, Yamaha depends most heavily on two-wheeled vehicles. The appearance of a powerful rival will have a big impact. Therefore, it joined forces before the future rival can become competitive. For that reason, business with China was started early. In December 1979, soon after the reform and liberalization line was adopted, Yamaha held a product show independently in Guangzhou. Subsequently, the company provided technical guidance to motocross riders in Guangdong Province and established service centers in Guangzhou and Beijing. In 1983, the company concluded a technological assistance contract with Chongqing Construction Machinery Plant, the predecessor of Construction Industry Co., which is the present joint venture partner. Daihatsu Ranks Next to Volkswagen--Failure To Make Inroad into United States Was Fortuitous Yamaha's sincere cooperation with the Chinese side helped win the trust of the Chongqing City government. Moreover, Chen Zisheng, president and general manager of Construction Industry Co., is a deputy of the National People's Congress elected from Chongqing City. He has a pipeline to key personages. There are 21 technicians from Japan stationed at the joint-venture company, "Yamaha Construction." The biggest future task is the nurture of affiliated parts manufacturers. The success of local operations depends on whether high-quality parts can be procured stably. For this reason, for three months from March 1993, machinery manufacturers in Sichuan Province were personally inspected. In Chongqing, a leading industrial city in China, production bases are still scattered in mountainous areas for national defense reasons. Just to visit one company requires a jolting 10-hour one-way car ride. Once a trip is undertaken, it is not possible to return to Chongqing for one or two months. However, the support of the Construction Industry Co. was of big help on this occasion. They took care of various matters from selecting which parts manufacturers to visit and obtaining permission to thoroughly inspect manufacturing processes. Main parts manufacturers have already been narrowed down to about 30 companies. Of the 500 parts to be procured outside of the company, trial manufacture of 100 parts was consigned and the parts began to arrive from around August. "Initially, we had thought that it would be a success if the acceptance rate were about 20 percent, but 80 percent of the parts passed inspection. We will continue technical training on a three-year plan, henceforth, and hope to raise the domestic production rate from the 55 percent set when operations started to 80 percent." So stated Tsutomu Akusawa, assistant general manager, who was surprised at the unexpectedly fast improvement of China's production technology capability. For the time being, Yamaha plans to retain the profits of the joint venture instead of allotting them to the main company. Rather than making immediate distribution of profits for the sake of Japan's main office, Yamaha opted to sustain growth in China. Of the Japanese firms succeeding in China, many are not major companies in Japan. For example, Kentaro Shimizu, director in charge of the overseas business division of Daihatsu Motor Co., says: "When major companies were making inroads into the United States, our company wanted to enter, but couldn't. For that reason, we concentrated our efforts on Asia but strategically, that was fortunate for us." Daihatsu is presently producing 50,000 vehicles a year locally and estimates it can expand production to 150,000 in 1997. Of course, it is the leader among Japanese firms and, even including U.S.-European companies, it ranks second after Volkswagen. Limit Reached in Low-Risk Business Dependent on United States--Self-Reform Needed To Attain Growth After World War II, Japanese companies sold surplus industrial products to the United States and continued to grow using that as a leverage. Simply put, under such circumstances, businesses could be run profitably by only watching U.S. trends. Risk factors, such as market selection and timing and scale of investment, did not have to be considered carefully as long as firms were under the U.S. umbrella. Japanese companies, which were given a stable export market and the opportunity to operate at low risk, were able to manage somehow if they did not neglect efforts to move ahead. However, it has become impossible to run on the track laid by the United States. Japanese companies can no longer depend on the U.S. market. Putting aside firms that are determined to survive only in the saturated domestic market, many Japanese firms, which think that "enterprises must seek growth," will probably be forced to enter the Chinese market, willy-nilly. China is a high-risk market that is totally different from the United States. There are many risks that are different in nature from past risks, such as inadequate legal systems and business methods that are totally unlike capitalistic countries, defective financial systems, bottlenecks in distribution, energy, and communications infrastructure, etc. However, it is difficult for Japanese companies to escape from the current confined environment unless they enter China. The strength is needed to risk entry into the huge Chinese market and survive without being swallowed up. Wang Songnian, director of the Tokyo Overseas Chinese Association and chairman of Ashu Kogyo (Asian Industrial Promotion) Co., a consulting firm for investments in China, points out that Japanese companies entering China fail because "those in charge do not think on the local level." In Japanese firms, responsibilities are shared so it is difficult for a person to make decisions independently and few responsible officials can speak Chinese. Persons who make decisions might go on short visits, but do not take the trouble to learn the actual situation firsthand by living there. He says that it is important to undertake the task with the intent to be personally involved instead of making judgments based simply on desktop feasibilities studies. As for these Japanese firms in the effluent stream, so to speak, whether they view their ventures to achieve success through their own means as "making inroads into China because they cannot succeed in Japan" or "because Japanese society is so rigid that new businesses cannot be accepted" will determine the dynamism of their future development. Japanese-style management, which is strong on joint sharing of information based on bottom-up collective operations and internal group control, is suitable for moving rapidly in a specified direction, but is likely to be slow in making judgments when the direction must be changed expediently in response to risks. Developing the frontier called China is a challenge to Japanese corporations to undertake self-reform. To be tested is the Japanese-style management which was nurtured in a hothouse.
