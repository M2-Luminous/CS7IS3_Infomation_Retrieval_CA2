This statement was made by Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou during an interview with a private television station. The interview was on national issues, for which Papandreou said there is a direction. He clarified: I think our positions and stance reflect the needs of our times. The prime minister also said that Greece's policy toward Albania is a policy of open doors, and clarified that we want to have good relations with Albania--on condition, of course, that the rights of the Greeks in Albania not be violated. He stressed that we plan to be very strict in this regard. The prime minister also clarified that representations have been made while the ambassadors of the European Union countries as well as Security Council members, especially Russia and the United States, were informed. The prime minister concluded: We are ready to proceed with other measures if Berisha insists on his unreasonable tactics. Responding to a question on the issue of Skopje's [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] name, Papandreou clarified once again that our country will not recognize this ministate if its name includes the term Macedonia or any its derivatives. This is very clear, he said, adding: We have not budged from our positions. Papandreou concluded by saying that the negotiations and dialogue with UN Special Envoy Cyrus Vance continue. [passage omitted] Responding to another question by the interviewer on whether he plans to succeed President Konstandinos Karamanlis in the presidency, Papandreou said: I am in active politics. That is what I know; and in my intentions and plans, active politics always come first. This is my answer: I have not changed. Finally, referring to the issue of his succession at PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement], the prime minister said that he will not personally choose his successor. The party is organized, it has a constitution, a congress and it will make the decision, he said. I may express my views, he concluded, but I will not choose my successor.
