FR940228-1-00021 FR940228-1-00003 Implementation The Commission intends to have different implementation dates for particular requirements of this proposed rule. The proposed requirements would become effective 90 days after publication of the final rule in the Federal Register . For the proposed requirements in ยง34.41 to use, as a minimum, a two-person crew for radiographic operations not conducted in a permanent facility, licensees would have 1 year from the effective date of the rule to comply. Licensees would be required to affirm that all radiographers have met the certification requirements of 34.43(a)(1) within 2 years from the effective date of the rule. This would allow radiography licensees operating in NRC jurisdiction 2 years to obtain certification for their employees who act as radiographers. This requirement would include radiographers employed by Agreement State licensees operating in non-Agreement States under reciprocity pursuant to 10 CFR 150.20. The Commission notes that the State of Texas currently provides a 90-day grace period for non-Texas licensees operating in that State under reciprocity (TRC 31.90). However, because this proposed rule will be a matter of compatibility, the requirement for mandatory certification would apply to radiography licensees nationwide. Licensees would have one year from the effective date of the rule to comply with the additional training requirements specified in ยง34.43(b). Licensees could consider combining this training with the annual safety review. For the proposed revision to ยง34.47(g) that would require alarm ratemeters be capable of alerting the wearer regardless of environmental conditions, licensees would have 1 year to obtain or modify a sufficient number of additional alarm ratemeters to meet anticipated needs. For use/storage locations not previously identified on the license (e.g., field stations, permanent radiographic installations, and temporary jobsites exceeding 180 days) licensees must request amendments or notify the NRC, as appropriate, by the effective date of the rule. Few amendment requests are anticipated. All current RSOs would be granted a two-year extension to meet the proposed additional RSO training requirements specified in ยง34.42(a). The Commission requests that persons commenting on this proposed rulemaking particularly address any hardships that would result if the proposed rule were adopted and also address any hardships that would result if the proposed implementation schedule were adopted. The NRC is particularly interested in suggestions for alternative implementation schedules. Finding of No Significant Environmental Impact: Availability The Commission has determined under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, and the Commission's regulations in subpart A of 10 CFR part 51, that the rule, if adopted, would not be a major Federal action; therefore, an impact statement is not required. The revision of 10 CFR part 34 should have no environmentally significant impact because radiography only involves the use of sealed sources, and no environmental impact will be involved. The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact on which this determination is based are available for inspection at the NRC Public Document Room at 2120 L Street, NW. (Lower Level), Washington DC. Paperwork Reduction Act Statement This proposed rule amends information collection requirements that are subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). This rule has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review and approval of the information collection requirements. The public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 108 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to the Information and Records Management Branch (MNBB&hyph;7714), U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555; and to the Desk Officer, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, NEOB&hyph;3019, (3150&hyph;0007 and 3150&hyph;0120), Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503. Regulatory Analysis The Commission has prepared a draft regulatory analysis on this proposed regulation. The analysis examines the costs and benefits of the alternatives considered by the Commission. The draft analysis is available for inspection in the NRC Public Document Room at 2120 L Street NW. (Lower Level), Washington, DC. Regulatory Flexibility Analysis The NRC has prepared an initial regulatory analysis of the impact of this proposed rule on small entities. A summary of this analysis appears as Appendix A to this document. A copy of the analysis is available for inspection in the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW. (Lower Level), Washington, DC. Single copies of the analysis may be obtained from Donald O. Nellis or Mary L. Thomas, Division of Regulatory Application, Office of Research, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555. Telephone (301)&hyph;492&hyph;3785. The NRC is seeking public comment on the initial regulatory flexibility analysis. The NRC is particularly seeking comment from small entities (i.e., small businesses, small organizations, and small jurisdictions under the Regulatory Flexibility Act) as to how the regulations will affect them and how the regulations may be tiered or otherwise modified to impose less stringent requirements on small entities while still adequately protecting the public health and safety. Those small entities which offer comments on how the regulations could be modified to take into account the differing needs of small entities should specifically discuss the following items: (a) The size of their business and how the proposed regulations would result in a significant economic burden upon them as compared to larger organizations in the same business community.
