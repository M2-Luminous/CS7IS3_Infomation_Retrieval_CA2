Yeltsin has sent letters to State Duma and Federation Council deputies explaining the motives behind the presidential initiative in the economic sphere. The president points out to the deputies that his actions arise both out of actual constitutional prerogatives and out of the Treaty on Social Accord. In his letter B.N. Yeltsin informs the deputies that, acting in the spirit of civil accord, immediately after signing the package of economic edicts he instructed the government to submit draft laws based on the edicts to the deputies for their consideration. So the edicts, insofar as they impinge on the jurisdiction of the Federal Assembly, will remain valid until the relevant federal laws are adopted. Moreover, on 24 May the president proposed that V.S. Chernomyrdin, I.P. Rybkin, V.F. Shumeyko, and B.N. Topornin, chairman of the Public Chamber under the president, immediately set up a working group representing a wide range of public and social interests in order to stimulate the speediest adoption of amendments to tax legislation. [signed] Vyacheslav Kostikov, Russian president's press secretary.
