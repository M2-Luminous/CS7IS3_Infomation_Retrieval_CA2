The talks were conducted by Hasan Muratovic, Bosnia-Herzegovina minister without portfolio, who came from the airport a few minutes ago and made the following statement for Bosnia-Herzegovina Radio: [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. Muratovic, two days ago you had a meeting at which you agreed to resume the talks today. What was agreed today? [Muratovic] Today we agreed something that we could not do last time. In brief, we agreed to sign an agreement by Tuesday. The details of it, according to our guidelines and minutes from the meeting, will be worked out by UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces]. The details include maps showing roads. We have agreed to open up the Butmir-Dobrinja road--which will run across the airport runway--for our use, and the Lukavica-Ilidza road--which will also run across the airport runway--for use by the Serbian side. The roads will cut across each other at one point. We have also agreed to open up the Sarajevo-Visoko road via Vogosca, and to open the Grbavica bridge for civilians. All this will be opened up simultaneously on Saturday, 18 March, if the agreement is signed, which I no longer doubt will happen. Only UNPROFOR can now make some problems in this respect, as the roads run across the airport runway. [end recording] [passage omitted]
