They will have to be held again in one of the 21 electoral districts. That is the quantitative aspect, as they say. As for the qualitative aspect, here there are only enigmas. After all, today no one here can answer a seemingly simple question like who, what political force, will call the tune in the oblast duma? The actual ban on running on party lists and the considerably simpler registration procedure for independent deputies than for deputies from political parties and associations (the former had to submit a protocol from a voters' meeting in which at least 30 people took part!) have led to the point where all elected deputies will represent themselves. Nor have the bureaucrats had any luck. Even Kaliningrad Mayor V. Shipov lost his round to the doctor G. Petrachenko. Indifference was the dominant feeling among the Kaliningrad people. That is borne out by the number of those who came to vote -- two-thirds of the voters registered on the lists stayed at home that day.
