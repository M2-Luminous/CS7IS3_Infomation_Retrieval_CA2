FR941104-2-00097 FR941104-2-00057 NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION [Docket No. 70&hyph;364] Information Meeting on the Remediation of Babcock and Wilcox's Parks Township Shallow Land Disposal Area in Armstrong County, PA AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission. ACTION: Notice of Meeting. SUMMARY: This notice is to inform the public of a meeting to share information concerning the decommissioning of Babcock and Wilcox's Shallow Land Disposal Area (SLDA) located on the Parks Township Facility in Armstrong County, Pennsylvania. The SLDA is an area which was used by B&W in the 1960's and 1970's to dispose of radioactively contaminated materials in accordance with the regulations found in the now rescinded 10 CFR Section 20.304. On September 28, 1994, B&W submitted to the NRC a remediation proposal for the remediation of the SLDA. Interested individuals are invited to observe a meeting between the NRC, Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources (PADER), B&W, Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO), local officials, and citizen groups to share information concerning the remediation proposal and future actions related to the remediation of the SLDA. Background The Parks Township site is located in Armstrong county, approximately 20 miles northeast of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, along the Kiskiminetas River and Route 66. The former owners of the Parks Township site (NUMEC) disposed of radioactive (primarily uranium and thorium) and non-radioactive waste in the SLDA during the 1960's and early 1970's. In 1967, the Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO) purchased stock in NUMEC and sold the stock to B&W in 1971. The materials placed in the trenches by NUMEC, consisted of process wastes, scrap, and trash from the nearby Apollo nuclear fuel fabrication facility. This material contained enriched, depleted and natural uranium and lesser quantities of thorium. At the time, disposals were authorized under 10 CFR 20.304. This provision has since been rescinded and at least some of the waste is known to exceed NRC's existing radiological criteria for decommissioning. Therefore, NRC is requiring the licensee to remediate the SLDA to met the NRC's decommissioning criteria, as described in the Site Decommissioning Management Plan Action Plan (April 16, 1994, 57 FR 3389). The current owners, B&W and ARCO have performed characterization activities for the SLDA and submitted a Site Characterization Report (SCR) for the SLDA, dated October 1993. The NRC reviewed and commented on the SCR by letter dated March 24, 1994 and received a response to those comments from B&W by letter dated September 28, 1994. B&W also submitted for NRC review a proposed method for remediating the SLDA which involves capping and stabilizing the waste disposal area. The NRC is currently reviewing this proposal. Conduct of Meeting The NRC will conduct the first in a series of meetings on November 10, 1994 in the Leechburg Area High School Cafeteria, 215 First Street, Leechburg, PA. The meeting will begin at 7 p.m. and will end at 10 p.m. The meeting will be facilitated by F. X. Cameron, Special Counsel for Public Liaison at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The purpose of this meeting is to share, with representative stakeholders and the public, information concerning the status of current actions at the Parks Township Shallow Land Disposal Area, projected schedules and plans for the remediation of the site, and the responsibilities of the NRC and other regulatory Agencies in the remediation of the site. The meeting will involve invited representatives from the following groups: NRC, PADER, the Licensee, state and local officials, and local citizen groups. These representatives will participate in a facilitated round-table discussion and will present information and views on upcoming actions concerning the remediation of the SLDA. An agenda for each meeting will be prepared and distributed to all invited representatives, as well as placed in the local public document room in advance of the meeting. The public will be present during the meeting, and time will be provided for public comment at the end of the meetings. Comments and questions will be limited to the remediation of the SLDA. An agenda for the meeting follows. Future Information Meetings will be held periodically concerning other issues of the remediation of the SLDA.
