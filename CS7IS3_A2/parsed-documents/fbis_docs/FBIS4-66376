The city, rich in geothermal energy sources, has reserves of underground hot water estimated at 7.876 billion cubic metres, said an official from the municipal government at a recent conference. Baodi County, north of Tianjin, has the city's biggest reserves of subterranean hot water, which cover a total area of 8,700 square kilometres. Ten of these heat fields, encompassing 3,074 square kilometres, are especially rich. Tianjin's underground hot water, with temperatures between 25 and 150�C, is widely used in timber manufacturing, home heating, greenhouses, heated swimming pools, and scientific research. The Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources has invested tens of millions of yuan in exploring the city's underground heat resources. The United Nations Development Programme has also invested $5 million. Tianjin has tapped more than 250 underground hot water reservoirs. The deepest required drilling to a depth of 3,654 metres, and the hottest is 98�C. The city uses about 38 million cubic metres of underground hot water annually, with thermal energy equal to that produced by 2.5 million tons of coal. Tianjin is one of the country's biggest underground heat energy centres. More than 140 overseas experts have visited the city to consult on the exploration of underground heat resources. Businesses from the United States, Iceland, France, Italy, New Zealand and Japan have expressed interest in investing in the development of the subterranean heat resources. A contract was signed over the weekend between three Chinese companies and a Hong Kong firm to set up a joint venture to build a power station in Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province. The total investment for the project will be 1.84 billion yuan ($212 million). The four companies--the State Energy Investment Corporation, Jiangsu Investment Corporation, Xuzhou Investment Corporation, and the Hong Kong-based China Resources (Group) Company Limited--hold 30, 20, 15 and 35 percent of the stake, respectively. The signing converts the Pengcheng Power Plant from a solely-domestic joint venture into a China-Hong Kong venture. The limited-liability contract has a term of 20 years. The designed capacity of the power plant is 1.2 million kilowatts. The first phase of the East China project includes two units of coal-fired 300,000-kilowatt generators. The first unit is expected to be put into operation in September 1996.
