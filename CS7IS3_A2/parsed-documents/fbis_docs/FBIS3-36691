The need for such tours has been occasioned by several circumstances. There is, above all, the pressing need to verify locally the possibility of the practical implementation of the military doctrine's new ideas. In addition, the defense minister and the generals and officers accompanying him will get a good opportunity to familiarize themselves with the organization and course of combat training under the present far from simple conditions and to gain a clearer idea of the prospects for the organizational development of Russia's highly mobile Armed Forces. Such tours will also provide an opportunity for personal talks with the administration heads of the oblasts, krays, cities, and rayons where Army units and combined units are stationed -- which will undoubtedly contribute to resolving the existing social problems in practice locally. Army General Pavel Grachev cited familiarization with the organization and course of combat training and with the provision of facilities for the personnel of the tank army withdrawn from Germany and the airborne division withdrawn from the Transcaucasus as the priority area of his work in the Volga Military District. It was no coincidence that right after arriving in Samara 7 February the representatives of the Ministry of Defense listened to what the district command's had to say about these problems. As the defense minister pointed out, on the whole the tasks set the district in terms of combat and mobilization readiness, operational and combat training, and strengthening military discipline are being fulfilled. Today the district's troops are capable of fulfilling the tasks facing them. Pavel Grachev emphasized, however, that in the very near future it will be necessary to improve considerably the quality of the combat training of individual units and combined units, a list of which, incidentally, has been drawn up separately and which will become, as the new military doctrine requires, airmobile and capable of being moved great distances very quickly and fulfilling the set combat tasks under very complex conditions. In the course of the hearing the question of the urgent need to go over to a territorial system of troop control was also raised. It is abnormal when the commander of a particular military district is not the sole master of, let us assume, the units of central subordination stationed on this district's territory. As Army General Pavel Grachev pointed out, the elimination of this gap is a task for the very near future. When speaking today of enhancing combat readiness, the problem of the troops' undermanning cannot be overlooked. This, in particular, was discussed at the defense minister's meeting with officers of Samara Garrison, which was held in the District Officers' House. For the first time in two years the latest draft into the Army proceeded in an organized manner. As the result of joint efforts by all the structures involved, the military commissariats were able to ensure that the Armed Forces today are almost 60-percent manned. If you compare this figure with the indicators for the fall of 1993, when manning stood at just 42.8 percent, it is clear that things are on the mend. As for the Volga Military District, here the plan for the draft was fulfilled by 95 percent. This indicator in itself is quite high. Something else is of concern. Whereas some military commissariats managed to cope excellently with the task of the draft (the Bashkir Republic Military Commissariat achieved a 100-percent draft, and the Perm and Orenburg Oblast Military Commissariats had indicators just a little lower), the defense minister called the work of the Tatar Republic Military Commissariat and the Samara and Kirov Oblast Military Commissariats unsatisfactory. The draft for service under contract does not arouse concern. In the Middle Volga Region it stood at 125 percent of the planned level. The Army's further reduction was also discussed at the meeting with officers. According to a statement by Army General Pavel Grachev, by 1 January 1995 the organization and establishment and the actual strength of the Armed Forces are to be comparable and stand at 2 million men. Colonel General Anatoliy Sergeyev, commander of the Volga Military District, reported that not one officer or ensign without an apartment will be discharged in the district. But if this does happen, that person will retain his place in the line to obtain housing in the unit where he completed his service. During the meeting the defense minister presented valuable gifts to the district's officers who had distinguished themselves. Late in the evening of 7 February Army General Pavel Grachev had talks with representatives of the Samara Oblast Administration.
