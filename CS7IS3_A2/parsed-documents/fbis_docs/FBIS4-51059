To further solve the problem of poverty in rural areas so as to narrow the gap between regions in east China and those in west China, and to achieve the goal of common prosperity, the State Council decided to concentrate manpower plus material and financial resources by mobilizing the forces from all walks of life from 1994 to 2000, and to strive to basically solve the problem of food and clothing for the 80 million people living in poverty in rural areas across the country in about seven years. This is a very arduous fortifications-storming battle. To this end, the State Council drew up a "National Fortifications-Storming Plan for Supporting 80 Million Impoverished People Over the Next Seven Years." It is a program for the work to be carried out nationwide over the next seven years to help poor areas achieve development, and constitutes an important integral part of our program for national economic and social development. 1. The Situation and Tasks It has been a consistent policy of the party Central Committee and the State Council to support the impoverished areas to change their face of poverty and backwardness as quickly as possible. Especially since the mid-1980's, the state has carried out large-scale, organized work to support the impoverished areas across the country in a planned way. The state increased input by a big margin to support the impoverished areas, formulated a series of help-the-poor policies and, furthermore, carried out fundamental reform and adjustment of the help-the-poor work done in the earlier period, thereby bringing about a change from the delivery of relief to the offer of support to poor areas in achieving development. After strenuous efforts by the state for years, the problem of poverty in rural areas across the country has been noticeably eased and the number of impoverished people whose problem of food and clothing remains yet to be completely and steadily solved has decreased to 80 million. It was a tremendous historical achievement and proved that the help-the-poor principle and policy formulated by the party Central Committee and the State Council were correct and fully demonstrated the superiority of the socialist system. Though the number of people living in poverty does not represent a large percentage of the rural areas' total population across the country, the tasks to help poor areas achieve development are very arduous. These people mainly concentrate in the impoverished counties which the state focuses its attention on supporting. These counties are scattered over remote mountain areas, rocky mountain areas, deserts, high mountains where it is very cold, loess plateau areas, areas with a high incidence of endemic diseases, and dam areas. Their common characteristics are remoteness, inconvenient transportation, lack of proper care for ecological environment, sluggish economic development, shortage of potable water supply to people and livestock, and extremely bad production and living conditions. These are the main fields for our fortifications- storming battle to support the impoverished areas. The establishment of a socialist market economic system has brought unprecedented opportunities and broader prospects for poor areas' development. Paying close attention to helping poor areas achieve development to solve the problem of food and clothing for the masses in these areas as quickly as possible, to change their situation of economic backwardness, and to ease and eradicate poverty is a great undertaking that has important and profound economic and political significance under the new situation. Therefore, governments at all levels must uphold Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, adhere to the principle "while giving top priority to efficiency, we must pay attention to fairness at the same time," and further improve the work of helping poor areas achieve development. 2. The Goals After Which We Strive The standards for solving the problem of food and clothing for the impoverished population by the end of the century: -- We must attain a comparatively greater increase in the per capita net annual income of the overwhelming majority of impoverished households. -- We must support impoverished households to create basic conditions for steadily solving their food and clothing problems. In areas where conditions permit, half to one mu of basic farmland with steady, high yield must be cultivated by one person on the average; one mu of orchard or farmland for cash crops must be cultivated by one household on the average; one worker per household must be transferred to a village and town enterprise or to a developed area; and, on the average, one household must be engaged in one agricultural project or other sideline production. In pastoral areas, on the average, every household must have a plot of fenced grassland or an "enclosure of grassland." Meanwhile, efforts must be made to consolidate and expand the achievements scored in helping poor areas promote development so far, and to reduce the number of people who relapse into poverty. We must carry out construction of more infrastructure projects. We must basically solve the problem of shortage of potable water supply to people and livestock. We must build highways to reach the overwhelming majority of impoverished townships and towns as well as the localities that produce commodities and have rural fairs. We must make electricity available to all counties and to the overwhelming majority of impoverished townships. We must change the situation of backward education, culture, and public health. Efforts must be made to basically popularize elementary education; to vigorously wipe out illiteracy among youngsters; to conduct adult education, vocational education, and technical training in a bid to enable most of our young workers to familiarize themselves with one or two practical skills; to improve conditions for medical treatment and public health in order that we may prevent, treat, and reduce endemic diseases and prevent deformities; and to strictly implement family planning in a bid to bring the natural growth rate of the population under control and within the limit set by the state. 3. The Guiding Principle and Measures Continuing to adhere to the guiding principle of supporting the poor through development: It is necessary to encourage large numbers of cadres and people in impoverished areas to work hard and self-reliantly and, under the state's support and by relying on advanced science and technology, exploit and utilize local resources to develop the production of commodities in market demand, thereby solving the problem of food and clothing, shaking off poverty, and becoming well off. Basic measures for helping the poor in development: -- Giving priority to projects for developing crop-planting, fish-breeding, and related processing and transportation industries that require small investments but can yield quick and good returns, cover broad areas, and directly contribute to the solution of the problem of food and clothing. -- Actively developing resource-exploiting and labor-intensive village and township enterprises that can bring into full play the advantage of local resources while providing ample job opportunities to impoverished households. -- Expediting the development and utilization of wasteland, barren mountains, uncultivated slopes, and undeveloped beaches and waters through the compensated lease of land or transfer of the land use right. -- Developing the supply of labor service to developed areas in a planned and organized way to actively facilitate a rational and orderly flow of laborers from poor areas. -- Helping poor areas develop by resettling a small number of villages and farm households with extraordinary difficulties in subsistence and development conditions. Main forms for supporting the poor through development: -- Exploiting local resources to develop the production of competitive famous-brand, special, rare, and quality goods in accordance with market demands. A legion of households in the whole area should be organized under unified planning to engage in the development of specialized production and to gradually establish large-scale commodity production bases or regional pillar industries. -- Persisting in setting up support-the-poor economic entities, which combine trade, industry, and agriculture and which integrate production, processing, and marketing to contract developmental projects. Maintaining ties with both outside markets and local farm households, these economic entities should provide serialized services to farmers before, during, and after productive seasons; and should help the masses cast off poverty and become well off. -- Guiding poor areas having no condition for setting up enterprises to bring capital and labor to invest, on a voluntary basis, in the development of secondary and tertiary industries in selected rural towns and small industrial zones having a better investment environment. -- Expanding the exchange of cadres and economic and technical cooperation between poor and developed areas. -- Helping poor counties set up backbone enterprises to overcome financial difficulties of counties and build up their capability for self-development, while giving priority to solving the problem of food and clothing. -- Helping poverty-stricken disabled people with rehabilitation programs. 4. The Management and Use of Funds To ensure the implementation of this plan, the state's various budgetary funds and credits will be continued until the year 2000. The time limit for the funds for providing work as a form of relief and the special funds for the construction of the "sanxi" areas [the three poorest areas -- Gansu's Dingxi and Hexi, and Ningxia's Xijie-Haiyuan-Guyuan sector] will remain unchanged. The time limit for using support-the-poor credits for projects requiring long-term development will be extended as deemed necessary. The State Council has decided to increase, from 1994 through 2000, the funds for providing work as a form of relief and support-the-poor loans with discount interest rates. Along with the growth of financial revenues, the state will continue to increase funds to support the poor. Local governments at various levels should, based on the work to help the poor, increase their support-the-poor funds year after year so as to ensure the realization of this plan. It is necessary to readjust the regional structure of investing state funds to support the poor. The central government's credits to support the poor should be concentrated on the severely poverty-stricken central and western provinces and regions. All provinces and regions concerned should make necessary readjustment of investing funds to support the poor based on this principle. Central appropriations, credits, and funds for implementing the policy of providing relief in exchange for work should be spent mainly on poverty-stricken counties on the state priority list. Funds of relevant provincial and regional governments and central departments should be used in coordination with these funds, with impoverished villages in counties designated as poverty-stricken being the target areas of such funds and projects. Funds for scattered impoverished villages or rural households in counties not designated as poverty-stricken should be arranged by local governments. Bank loans for helping the poor should be given to development projects that promise good economic returns and are capable of repaying the loans. Poverty alleviation funds from the treasury should be used mainly on projects that yield good social benefits. Additional appropriations for relief in exchange for work should be used on building and mending roads and on solving drinking water shortages. Priority should be given to roads linking up villages with commodity producing areas, rural fairs, and to roads built as support facilities for poverty-alleviation development projects. The three types of funds should be used in a well-coordinated manner to improve overall efficiency of fund utilization. It is necessary to reform the way poverty-alleviation funds are used and managed by introducing a mechanism of self-regulation and incentive, and by tightening the fund auditing system. It is strictly forbidden to misappropriate poverty-alleviation funds; violators will be called to account. 5. Policy Guarantees -- Take the actual conditions into account in granting poverty-alleviation credits to impoverished households or economic entities set up to alleviate poverty. Conditions for loans may be appropriately eased for projects that yield good economic returns and can guarantee loan repayment. -- State-owned commercial banks should set aside a certain amount of funds to help selected projects in poverty-stricken areas that yield good economic returns and are capable of repaying the loans. -- More financial assistance and commercial credits should be given to poverty-stricken counties in the six coastal provinces -- Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Shandong, and Liaoning -- and to counties in other provinces and regions that only recently cast off the label of being poverty-stricken. The amount of such input should, as a general rule, not be lower than the support these counties used to receive from the state. -- Newly established enterprises in areas designated by the state as "old revolutionary base areas, areas inhabited by minority nationalities, frontier areas, and poverty-stricken areas" should have all or part of their income tax returned to them in the first three years of operations. -- Governments at all levels should list poverty-alleviation funds in their budgets and see to it that these funds are spent on help-the-poor development projects. -- To alleviate the increased burden of peasants in poverty-stricken areas brought about by the lifting of price controls over capital goods and by rising grain prices, the provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities may use local grain risk funds to appropriately subsidize the impoverished households living off grain resold to them by the state. -- In deciding on centrally or locally-funded development projects, favorable consideration should be given to poverty-stricken areas well-endowed in resources. When establishing large and medium-sized enterprises in a poverty-stricken area, central, provincial or regional governments should take into full account local interests and properly balance local and state interests. -- When formulating and implementing industrial policy, the state should take into account the special characteristics of poverty-stricken areas and give them support and help accordingly. -- We should, pursuant to the principle of preferential treatment, give priority to the development of import and export trade in poverty-stricken areas by incorporating it into the government plans. 6. Tasks of Government Departments Government planning, foreign and internal trade, agricultural, forestry, water conservancy, science, education, industrial, communications, labor, civil affairs, nationalities, cultural, public health, family planning, finance, banking, industrial and commercial administrations, and customs departments should -- in line with the general requirements of this plan -- formulate their own poverty-alleviation plans for the period of the Eighth Five-Year Plan. They should fully utilize their respective strengths and implement a policy of favorably tilting toward poverty-stricken areas in terms of funding, material, and technological support. They should implement positive measures to help poverty-stricken areas develop the economy pursuant to the requirements of poverty-alleviation development and their respective functions. 7. Mobilization of Society Central and local party and government organizations, as well as enterprises and institutions where conditions permit, should actively commit themselves to helping certain selected poor counties, and their commitment should remain unchanged for several years until the recipients of their assistance get rid of poverty. All democratic parties and the federations of industry and commerce should take advantage of their abundant manpower and technological resources, and their wide connections to further help poor regions in scientific and technological application, and in the development of intellectual resources. They should help poor regions in personnel training, popularization of technologies, acquisition of information, and promotion of economic and technological cooperation. Trade unions, Communist Youth League organizations, women's federations, science and technology associations, and federations for the disabled at all levels should actively take part in the help-the-poor development work. It is necessary to give full play to the role of the China Fund for Helping Poor Areas and other non-governmental organizations for helping poor areas. Big cities such as Beijing, Tianjin and Shanghai, and more developed coastal provinces such as Guangdong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, Liaoning, and Fujian should each help one or two western provinces and regions in economic development. Large and medium-sized enterprises should be mobilized to take advantage of their superiority in technology, manpower, marketing, information, and materials to enter into mutually beneficial cooperation with poor regions; and the cooperation may be in various forms, such as economic cooperation, technological service, use of labor service, distribution of products, and exchange of cadres. If someone plans to set up an enterprise of a developmental nature in a poor region, local help-the-poor funds may be used in an appropriate way in support of the plan, and joint efforts should be made for the development. Universities, colleges, and scientific research organizations should take full advantage of their strength in specialized personnel and technology to cooperate directly with poor regions. The cooperation, designed to raise the level of science and technology in poor regions, may be in such forms as signing of science and technology contracts, popularization of technologies, and selection of candidates for the posts of deputy heads in charge of science and technology of counties and townships. The People's Liberation Army and the Armed Police Force should continue to carry forward the glorious traditions of supporting the government and cherishing the people, and help local people solve the problem of food and clothing and become well-off. 8. International Cooperation It is necessary to actively promote international exchanges and expand and develop cooperation with the international community in helping poor areas. Efforts should be made to improve the investment environment in poor regions, and to attract, with abundance of natural resources and preferential policies, investors from abroad to come to run enterprises of a developmental nature in poor regions so as to promote economic development there. 9. Organization and Leadership The central departments concerned and all provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities shall be organized in a unified way by the State Council Leading Group for Economic Development of Impoverished Areas to implement this plan. While all levels, particularly the provincial level, should assume responsibility, we should persistently practice the system of the provincial governor (autonomous regional chairman, municipal mayor) assuming full responsibility for accomplishing the tasks set in this plan within the prescribed time. All poor counties should deem it their central task to undertake developmental projects and solve the problem of food and clothing for the people, and they should seriously concentrate on implementing the plan for tackling tough poverty problems. The Provincial (regional), prefectural (autonomous prefectural), and city authorities should fill and strengthen the leading bodies of poor counties with selected capable cadres who can endure hardship and have contacts with the people; they should keep the county leading bodies relatively stable; and they should regard the results in implementing the plan and solving the problem of food and clothing for the people as the major criterion for appraising the job performance of the leading cadres of poor counties, and for promoting those cadres. At the same time, efforts should be made to strengthen the grass-roots organizations of poor townships and poor villages, so that their leading bodies are capable of leading the people in achieving prosperity. The cadres of poor regions should, as always, display the spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle and of sharing wealth and woe with the people. Before their people's basic needs in food and clothing are met, poor counties are prohibited from buying automobiles or building guesthouses, luxurious hostels or new office buildings, and they are not permitted to upgrade themselves into cities. It is necessary to strengthen the organizations for development of poor areas at various levels and provide them with the necessary working conditions. Their job specifications and organization should match local help-the-poor development tasks.
