"The advent of demand for repurchases of durable consumer goods is expected," Fujii said in a fiscal policy address explaining economic issues and the fiscal 1994 budget package to a plenary session of the House of Representatives. He added that phrase to an otherwise similar economic assessment to that made in his fiscal address to the House of Councillors in mid-February. The latest statistics, led by the Bank of Japan's quarterly "Tankan" business sentiment survey, have pointed to recovering consumption in such durable goods as refrigerators and washing machines. Fujii reiterated that the economy remains "tough in personal consumption and capital investment." But "the time is steadily ripening for a recovery," he repeated, citing the new bright signs along with "progressing inventory and capital stock adjustments amid support from public investment and housing construction." Fujii said the government has launched a record 15.25 trillion yen stimulus package, including 6 trillion yen in tax cuts, to "swell those recovery buds and move the economy toward full-fledged recovery as soon as possible in fiscal 1994 and ensure a stable growth in and after fiscal 1995." He reiterated his "confidence" that the package, along with the recently enacted third fiscal 1993 supplementary budget and the fiscal 1994 budget submitted to the lower house, would "greatly contribute to a full-fledged recovery by clearing uncertainties ahead and encouraging a pick-up in domestic demand led by personal consumption." On the monetary side, Fujii did not spell out any need for further policy measures, saying he hopes the effects of past policy measures will "spread further." "Various interest rates have declined sharply...as a result of the latest round of official discount rate cuts" to a record low 1.75 percent, Fujii added. Touching on the issue of full tax reforms for permanent income tax cuts, he stressed the government would pursue an agreement reached by the ruling coalition leaders to enact a reform law by the end of year in line with a "balanced tax system in income, assets and consumption." Fujii reiterated he would take "timely and appropriate" measures to stem speculative movements "as seen recently" and keep stable currency rates reflecting economic fundamentals. He stressed Japan's active contribution to global development and called for international policy cooperation through meetings of finance ministers and central bankers of the Group of Seven leading nations and a gathering later this month in Hawaii of finance ministers from the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. But Fujii did not offer any new measures to curb Japan's huge trade surplus. On the global economy, he said, "some signs of a recovery can be seen, but they are not yet indicating a strong growth." Among the leading nations, "efforts are necessary for economic restructuring with structural problems such as huge fiscal deficits and high unemployment."
