In a number of Lombard municipalities where, as [League Secretary] Umberto Bossi said, "our roots are strongest," the Bandwagon [League nickname] defeated Forza Italia. This signals the reversal of a trend -- a reversal which began, Bossi said, "on that 25 April when I marched alone in the midst of insults and catcalls. It was not a comfortable choice, but I had to make it." Does this, then, confirm that the Senator's [Bossi nickname] strategy (say things clearly, highlight the League's specific identity, identify Forza Italia as a conservative party while simultaneously ensuring "governability") is beginning to bear fruit? Speaking from his home in Gemonio, in the early afternoon, Bossi tended to minimize events: "So, you want me to make a statement about such a small development? This was only a victory of the line based on reason." He then went on to call a press conference in Milan. He spoke calmly, but his message was unequivocal: Elections are not imminent, the League is "alive and well," and finally "the League cannot agree with a British-type single-round system." [Passalacqua] Deputy Bossi, are you finally satisfied? [Bossi] I have always anticipated things well in advance. I seen no reason now to overemphasize the election results (In the course of the press conference, he repeatedly put forward this idea -- LA REPUBBLICA editor's note) but we are of course receiving the right signals, a small signal perhaps, but I believe we are getting some results. [Passalacqua] After this election round, do you think early elections are now closer or further away? [Bossi] In my opinion [Prime Minister] Berlusconi's problem is how to prevent governability from becoming the only asset enabling him to win votes. In this country, governability is guaranteed, safe. The League has no intention of calling it into question. [Passalacqua] Not everybody in the majority shares this view. [Bossi] If you like, their reckoning is legitimate. [Passalacqua] Legitimate but dangerous... [Bossi] It is others who reckon in this way. There is a danger that Italy may become the European country facing the greatest difficulties, that it may move from one election to the next. When governability is not at stake, or when it becomes more difficult to invoke it, then people demand values and consistency. Look at what happened in Desio and Lissone, two small towns near to where Forza Italia's leader lives. Voters there preferred the League because they realized that when both the League and Forza Italia guarantee governability, then ideals and values must be rewarded, and when it comes to ideals and values, we are unrivaled. Future battles will be fought on values and consistency, particularly when people realize that there are several government possibilities. [Passalacqua] However, are early elections close or distant, in your opinion? [Bossi] They are much more distant today. This parliament must complete its term. I like to keep my word, and I believe the other allies have a stake in this, too. [Passalacqua] You referred to several government possibilities. What exactly did you mean? [Bossi] I think the Freedom Alliance must be able to govern. We helped Berlusconi to form a government. If this were otherwise, the country might take a dangerous path. However, the League maintains that democratic practice must be followed. If we suddenly realize that the allies are aiming for early elections, we will insist on democratic practice being respected. This is why the League opposes the resignation of the RAI's [Italian Broadcasting Corporation] know-it-alls. Whatever steps are taken or not taken, there is a law saying that, until 1995, appointments are decided by [Chamber of Deputies speaker] Pivetti and [Senate speaker] Scognamiglio. Therefore it is right for the know-it-alls to retain their posts. [Passalacqua] What do you mean by "practice?" [Bossi] If anyone resigns, institutional practice establishes that someone else will govern. When a pope dies, another one is elected. I repeat, there is no chance of going to the polls. I have the impression that false statements are being made about Berlusconi in the press. This is why I intend to ask him myself, personally. I believe there are people engaged in slander and exaggeration campaigns. [Passalacqua] In these elections, the League has both given and taken votes from the Left. Are these the first steps along the path you have marked out? [Bossi] You are forgetting the center. In any case, the League wanted to ensure the protest proposal would prevail. We do not agree with throwing the country into chaos. We are not pleased with the prospect. You see, the voters' support cannot be diverted at will: Voters have rewarded a political force -- in a limited test -- whose values can be shared. When Forza Italia and the League stand side by side, people vote for the League. [Passalacqua] Do you believe these elections have bolstered your position in favor of a two-round electoral system? [Bossi] Advocating two rounds does not depend on election results. Rather, it results from a decision, namely the decision not to support a single-party system. A double-round system would enable a political force to retain its identity and then enter into a coalition so as to ensure governability.
