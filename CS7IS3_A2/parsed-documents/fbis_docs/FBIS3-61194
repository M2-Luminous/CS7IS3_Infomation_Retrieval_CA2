Its capital, invested in several joint ventures with Western companies, is helping "develop the economy from within" and meet the demands of the consumer market. South Kazakhstan, the most northerly cotton-growing area in the CIS, produces high-quality raw material for the textile industry. Several mills in France have been using our cotton fiber for quite some time now. The fact that excellent cotton quality has been achieved is not attributable to the farmers, but rather to procurement specialists. They help select the best plant types and decide on the optimum planting schedule. Another weighty argument has also been added since the arrival of the market economy: the dollar. Prior to 1988, each year South Kazakhstan Oblast, like all parts of the Central Asian republics, would receive an "order" from Moscow, telling it where to ship its cotton, and how much to send. Accounts were paid in rubles at stable low prices. Later permission was granted to sell an insignificant amount of cotton on the world market for dollars. However, the return was small. Incidentally, even today, when the export quota for the "distant abroad" totals 25,500 tonnes, or one-third of all cotton procured, net revenues in dollars and marks is extremely small. Customs duties and all sorts of other fees consume more than one-half of hard currency receipts, with only 40 percent going to the association and cotton farms. There is only one other legal way to make ends meet: barter. But in contrast to some other enterprises that have also obtained the right to engage in foreign economic operations, Kazzagotkhlopkoprom has not gotten into buying pantyhose or automobile cassette players. It uses its hard currency to buy whole factories at once. When the official opening of a a joint venture with the South Korean Telbone Company to manufacture VCR-TV combinations was held in Shymkent a month ago, many of those attending were surprised to learn during the presentation that cotton growers were among the founders. Improvements have been made in the design of the NAM system. The new Ordabasa videocassette system is markedly technically superior to its predecessor. The cotton company was the first in the CIS to assemble Rank-Xerox copying equipment, selling more than 1,000 fax machines at comparatively low prices in every oblast in the republic. The Farat Joint Venture provides servicing and repairs for them. The next stage in cooperation was the establishment of a joint venture with the English to manufacture cotton wool. The raw materials for this facility, located in Turkestan, will be noils -- a waste product of cotton processing. The construction is being closely watched by Uzbekistan, which at this time has no facilities for the manufacture of absorbent sterile cotton. The first unit of the plant should begin operations in December. Negotiations are under way regarding the purchase of equipment for a second unit which will manufacture various cosmetic and medical items. In this way the joint venture will have a guaranteed profit both in rubles and in hard currency. Kazzagotkhlopkoprom will also get a share of the dividends, and that means it will be able to finance the construction of a copying equipment plant, a cotton spinning mill and other facilities that the oblast and the republic badly need. The South Kazakhstan association currently has companies from eight developed countries around the world as its partners. Its specialists find equipment that other enterprises in the region need on the world market at low prices. The production association would seem to be in a very secure position. But in these unpredictable times no one can guarantee prosperity. The association and its customers were hit hard by the introduction of a 30-percent duty on cotton exports to countries in the "near abroad." The government has promised to repeal this duty for enterprises in those republics which are parties to intergovernmental agreements, but that has not happened yet. Much time and effort must be expended on filing raw cotton procurement prices with the republic's State Committee on Prices. Do they not realize that it is simply not to the association's advantage to artificially deflate or inflate prices? The former would drive a wedge between suppliers and the association, and the latter would weaken the cotton's competitive position. One constant headache for the association's management is connected with directed state loans for raw cotton procurement. The new year's cotton harvest has begun, but the R64.5 billion [rubles] required to purchase it are not in the Agro-Industrial Bank yet. There is no money for fuel or spare parts for cotton harvesting combines, nor any money to pay off last year's debts to farms. The CIS's epidemic of defaulted payments for products has not spared cotton growers either. Payments from customers are not being received on time, and so it was not possible to pay off last year's debts on schedule. The capital promised to extend the term of the loan until 1 October, but did not keep its promise -- money was needed immediately for the grain harvest. Yet under contracts concluded with the farms any default on payments to them will result in substantial fines. The solution, according to Sh. Usmanov, general director of Kazzagotkhlopkoprom Production Association, is to issue stock in the association as soon as possible and establish a commercial bank. The farmers and their authorized representative -- the production association -- are fully mature enough for greater independence. Even now, foreseeing delays in funding from the budget, they have reached agreement with the Telbone Company regarding favorable hard currency lending during the harvest period. Yet this will only cover less than one-third of their financial needs. So at this point there is still no way to get by without state support.
