The report stresses that in response to the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of GATT, both the Japanese Government and the private sector should make concerted efforts to cooperate financially and personally with the World Trade Organization (WTO). Commenting on the negotiations at the Uruguay Round, the report harshly attacks the Japanese Government, saying, "Japan focused its attention only on the rice issue and was utterly passive in the negotiations." The report also appeals to corporations in other nations "not to resort to trade methods such as managed trade." The report, which is entitled "The Assessment of the Conclusion of the Uruguay Round and Proposals for Future Tasks," has been compiled by both the Trade Measures Committee and the Services and Trade Committee of the Keidanren. It will be approved at a meeting of the Keidanren chairman and vice chairmen scheduled to be held on 11 April. The report highly praises the reaffirmation of the multilateral free trade principle achieved with the Uruguay Round and the creation of the WTO as an international organization to promote free trade. The report, however, points out that the elimination of a clause on preventing roundabout exports left room for the dumping of exports. The report proposes that the Japanese Government provide financial assistance to the WTO and make aggressive personnel contributions to that organization. The report also emphasizes the need for Japan to revamp its domestic laws to prepare for the inauguration of the WTO in January 1995. In referring to the United States' revival of the Super 301 provision, the report urges the United States "not to take one-sided trade measures, including the invocation of the provision," and it says that the revival of the Super 301 provision runs counter to the goal of concluding the Uruguay Round.
