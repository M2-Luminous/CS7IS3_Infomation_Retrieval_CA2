The province has a 600-house plan for 1994, and is seeking to build in materials-efficient ways. Cuba Vision Network at 0100 GMT on 28 January reports that miners in Moa received a donation from British miners of shoes, shirts, and gloves valued at $15,000. Radio Rebelde at 0000 GMT on 28 January reports that the Bio- Alimentos research center in Moron, Ciego de Avila, has developed a new high protein feed for pigs and chickens; production will begin soon at the 1 January center in Moron Municipality. Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 29 January reports that Valencia and Havana City have signed an agreement for a supply of Pegasus buses as a cooperative gesture of solidarity to improve transport in Havana. Garbage collectors, street cleaners, containers, spare parts, and specific tools for the repair of these vehicles will also be provided. Pedro Chavez, president of the Provincial Assembly of the People's Government, stressed the importance of the agreement and announced that 30 garbage collectors, 10 street cleaners, and some 4,000 containers will begin arriving in February. Radio Rebelde at 1800 on 29 January adds that the Carisol and Los Corales hotels were officially dedicated this morning in Santiago de Cuba and Varadero. The exploitation of these hotels, considered symbols of Cuban tourism development, will be shared by Cubanacan and the German chain LTD. Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision Networks at 0100 GMT on 31 January report that the Che Guevara Plant in Moa, Holguin Province, has saved more than 1.7 million pesos since September by burning oil instead of coal. This was achieved through the research carried out by Engineer Hector Agotis de Ansana, who has been conducting oil- burning tests since 1992. Fifteen kg of oil replaces a ton of coal. Radio Reloj at 1506 GMT on 31 January reports that an experiment in minifarms is being expanded in Cienfuegos Province because results have been good. There are 180 such farms in Cienfuegos for tending cattle. Each farm has two workers only -- and sometimes their families -- who are responsible for 30 cows. Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 31 January announces that an eight- week master class in business law and its economic and international implications began on 31 January in Havana, under the joint auspices of the Autonomous University of Madrid and the University of Havana, sponsored by the Guitart hotel chain. Gabriel Garcia, legal director of the university, explained that "the main objective of the course is so Spain and Cuba can exchange legal experience and cooperate in the process of legislative change that could eventually take place in Cuba as a result of an increase in certain kinds of businesses, such as the tourist business." The course targets lawyers responsible for negotiating foreign investments in Cuba. Garcia explains that such a course is timely because of the "large Spanish investment in Cuba," and also because of the many other foreign investments, since there are "probably" ongoing negotiations with foreign firms that intend to set up branches in Cuba. Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 31 January reports that Las Tunas is attempting to increase the 300 mini-dairy farms in the province to 1,000 in 1994 to increase milk production.

Radio Rebelde at 1000 GMT on 31 January reports that AIDS patients at the sanatorium in the city of Cienfuegos will be trained to make articles of leather and fabric. "This activity joins the efforts by the Ministry of Public Health and other Cienfuegos Province institutions and organizations to incorporate these patients into a socially useful life and contribute to their personal fulfilment. The AIDS patients will, through this work, cooperate in making the sanatorium self-financing." Radio Rebelde at 1000 GMT on 1 Februrary reports that Ernesto Melendez, minister president of the State Committee for Economic Cooperation, upon opening the fifth meeting of the regional committee for the development of subcontracting in Latin America, said that in the past three years, Cuba's trade with the region rose from 7 to 30 percent. Radio Progreso at 1200 GMT on 1 February reports the following: Dominica Coconut Production has donated five tons of laundry and toilet soaps to Cuba. The firm's representative called the donation "another gesture of solidarity with the Cuban people and government, which are struggling to get through the complex moment of the special period and repercussions from the weather." A new France-Cuba flight has been inaugurated. The first joint flight by the companies (OM) and Cubana de Aviacion took place on 31 January. (Michel Taillant), the French airline's marketing director, explains that an increase in the number of flights between France and Cuba over the past few months led the two companies to schedule joint flights to supplement the regular flights of each. He adds, "This is probably a prelude to additional regular flights....This new airline, with a weekly Havana-Paris-Havana flight, will develop and expand French-Cuban tourism relations...." Flights will leave Havana for Paris on Sunday and return on Monday. Pinar del Rio Province expects to harvest over 0.5 million quintals of tomatoes from the 150 caballerias that have been planted. Eighty percent of these tomatoes will be earmarked for consumption in Havana and Pinar del Rio, the rest for industry and for seeds. Workers from Pinar del Rio and from the Revolutionary Armed Forces "35th Anniversary of the Triumph of the Revolution" group are responsible for harvesting these tomatoes. A report from Camaguey says Cuba has begun producing hog cholera vaccine with which to vaccinate all the nation's livestock. Camaguey Province is a priority, under the existing program.
