FR940920-0-00020 FR940920-0-00008 §63.172 Standards: Closed-vent systems and control devices. * * * * * (b) Vapor recovery systems (e.g., condensers and adsorbers) shall be designed and operated to recover the organic HAP emissions or VOC emissions vented to them with an efficiency of 95 percent or greater. * * * * * (k) *␣*␣* (2) The owner or operator has a written plan that requires inspection of the equipment as frequently as practicable during safe-to-inspect times, but not more frequently than annually. * * * * * 15. Section 63.174 is amended by revising paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3)(i); the first sentence of (b)(3)(ii); paragraph (f)(2); and the first sentence of paragraph (h)(1) introductory text to read as follows: §63.174 Standards: Connectors in gas/vapor service and in light liquid service. * * * * * (b) *␣*␣* (1) For each group of existing process units within an existing source, by no later than 12 months after the compliance date, the owner or operator shall monitor all connectors, except as provided in paragraphs (f) through (h) of this section. (2) For new sources, within the first 12 months after initial start-up or by no later than 12 months after the date of promulgation of a specific subpart that references this subpart, whichever is later, the owner or operator shall monitor all connectors, except as provided in paragraphs (f) through (h) of this section. (3) *␣*␣* (i) Once per year (i.e., 12-month period), if the percent leaking connectors in the process unit was 0.5 percent or greater during the last required annual or biennial monitoring period. (ii) Once every 2 years, if the percent leaking connectors was less than 0.5 percent during the last required monitoring period. *␣*␣* * * * * * (f) *␣*␣* (2) The owner or operator has a written plan that requires monitoring of the connector as frequently as practicable during safe to monitor periods, but not more frequently than the periodic schedule otherwise applicable. * * * * * (h)(1) Any connector that is inaccessible or is glass or glass-lined, is exempt from the monitoring requirements of paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section and from the recordkeeping and reporting requirements of §63.181 and §63.182 of this subpart. *␣*␣* * * * * * 16. Section 63.180 is amended by adding two sentences to the end of paragraph (b)(2) and by revising paragraph (c) introductory text to read as follows: §63.180 Test methods and procedures. * * * * * (b) *␣*␣* (2) *␣*␣*. For process streams that contain nitrogen, water, air, or other inerts which are not organic HAP's or VOC's, the average stream response factor may be calculated on an inert-free basis. The response factor may be determined at any concentration for which monitoring for leaks will be conducted. * * * * * (c) When equipment is monitored for compliance as required in §§63.164(i), 63.165(a), and 63.172(f) of this subpart or when equipment subject to a leak definition of 500 ppm is monitored for leaks, the monitoring shall comply with the following requirements: * * * * * 17. Section 63.181 is amended by adding a sentence to the end of paragraph (b)(1)(i) and by revising paragraph (d)(5)(i) to read as follows: §63.181 Recordkeeping requirements. * * * * * (b) *␣*␣* (1)(i) *␣*␣*. With respect to connectors, the list shall be complete no later than the completion of the initial survey required by §63.174 (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this subpart. * * * * * (d) *␣*␣* (5) *␣*␣* (i) The owner or operator may develop a written procedure that identifies the conditions that justify a delay of repair. The written procedures may be included as part of the startup/shutdown/malfunction plan, required by §63.6(e)(3), for the source or may be part of a separate document that is maintained at the plant site. In such cases, reasons for delay of repair may be documented by citing the relevant sections of the written procedure. * * * * * 18. Section 63.182 is amended by revising paragraphs (a)(6)(ii), (c) introductory text, and (c)(4) to read as follows: §63.182 Reporting requirements.
