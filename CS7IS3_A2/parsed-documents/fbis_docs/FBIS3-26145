On the 30th anniversary of the naming of this collective of heroes by the Ministry of Defense, we send warm congratulations to all the officers and men of the 6th Company and pay high respect to leaders at all levels and the broad masses who have spent a great deal of effort for the growth and progress of the 6th Company! Great times have produced a great Army and the revolutionary spirit has nurtured a collective of heroes. As an all-round tough heroic company and a flag for the basic-level army building of the entire PLA, the "Hard-Boned Company" is the inevitable result of implementing the PLA's goal in earnest and carrying forward the fine tradition of the people's army as well as the model that resolutely implements Mao Zedong's military thinking, Deng Xiaoping's thinking about army building during the new period, and Chairman Jiang Zemin's "five-sentence" general demand. Their fundamental experience is carrying forward the hard-boned spirit of the proletariat. Comrade Deng Xiaoping once pointed out: "The work style of the Hard-Boned 6th Company is not only the work style of a company. All companies as well as cadres at all levels should learn diligently and train laboriously like they do and should have political thinking like theirs." Military Commission Chairman Jiang also pointed out: "The hard-boned spirit is the PLA's fine tradition and precious spiritual wealth. This spirit is embodied in the fact that no matter what difficulty one is faced with, one does not yield, dares to struggle with it, and courageously makes sacrifices until one triumphs over it. This hard-boned spirit is needed both in wartime and in peacetime." Comrade Deng Xiaoping's and Chairman Jiang Zemin's important instructions have made a high, summing-up appraisal of the basic experience of the "Hard-Boned 6th Company," revealed the rich contents of the hard-boned spirit, and given a direction for the entire PLA to learn from the Hard-Boned 6th Company and for strengthening the all-round buildup of the troops. The PLA has large numbers of heroes. The hard-boned spirit, which was produced in the battlefield of blood and fire, is not only the spirit of a company, but also the common spiritual wealth of the PLA. This spirit fully embodies the "five types of revolutionary spirit" advocated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping, vividly reflects the firm political position and lofty ideological virtues of the officers and men of the entire Army and their fighting will of making sacrifices courageously, and fully demonstrates the PLA's strict army discipline and the spiritual mood of being an army that captures every stronghold it fights against and wins every battle it fights. In the new historical period, energetically carrying forward this spirit is of very great significance to consolidating our political beliefs, withstanding all sorts of tests, strengthening the all-round buildup of the troops, and improving their combat effectiveness. The PLA is a strong pillar for the people's democratic dictatorship. It shoulders the sacred mission of protecting the security of the motherland and offering a safe environment for reform and opening up and the modernization drive. Properly carrying out the glorious functions of the people's army presents a heavy task and numerous difficulties and tests. We must arouse morale and encourage the fighting will with the hard-boned spirit, be unyielding before the enemy, not fear difficulties, step forward bravely in times of danger, and always maintain the powerful strength of overcoming the enemy, unyielding tenacity, and stamina of persevering to the end. Carrying forward the hard-boned spirit demands that we study basic Marxist theories in earnest, arm the brains of officers and men with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and his ideas on army building during the new period, lay a solid ideological foundation, and enhance the initiative and determination to implement the party's basic line. Carrying forward the hard-boned spirit demands that we standardize army building at the basic level, attach importance to basic-level units every year, lay a foundation every year, carry the nurturing of the hard-boned spirit through in all the jobs of every company, and bring up large numbers of companies that are as tough overall and as "politically qualified, militarily tough, possessing a fine work style and strict discipline, and providing effective safeguards." Carrying forward the hard-boned spirit demands that we educate officers and men to steel themselves in the course of struggle so that they can defend the country and guard the border courageously and tenaciously, take part in rescue and disaster relief operations in a self-sacrificing manner, and undertake demanding and strict military training, acquire knowledge in earnest and painstakingly, overcome new, key technological research problems, and be devoted to production and work. Carrying forward the hard-boned spirit also demands that we uphold the integration of the revolutionary spirit and a scientific attitude and the integration of inheriting ideas and bringing forth innovations so that it retains the traditional content full of vitality while continuously injecting the spirit of the new times, continuously building up a modernized, regularized, and revolutionary Army.
