He stressed: We must further unify our understanding, strengthen leadership, ensure a good job in dealing with major and grave cases of economic crimes, and deepen the anticorruption struggle to maintain the province's trend of reform, development, and stability. After noting the considerably good results Zhejiang has achieved in dealing with major and grave cases of economic crimes since the Second Plenary Meeting of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission in August last year, Li Zemin pointed out: We should not overestimate the results we have achieved -- some corrupt practices are far from being effectively checked. Work in investigating major and grave cases occurring in key departments, especially crimes committed by leading cadres, is still a weak link -- it still falls far short of the expectations of the party Central Committee, the State council, and the masses. Li Zemin said: The guidelines laid down by Comrade Ren Jianxin at the telephone conference concerning stepping up efforts to crack down on major and grave cases of economic crimes are important guidelines of the party Central Committee on fighting corruption, especially for cracking down on grave economic crimes. With the telephone conference as a turning point, and in conjunction with the relevant guidelines laid down by the provincial CPC Committee and government, party committees, governments, and public security, procuratorial, and judicial departments at all levels of the province should faithfully carry out the guidelines set at the telephone conference. First, we should further unify our understanding of the great significance of the anticorruption struggle. Deepening the struggle is an important assurance for carrying out the guiding principle of "seizing the opportunity to deepen reform, broaden the scope of opening up, accelerate development, and maintain social stability," as well as an important effort to strengthen party building. We should further clear up the various vague ideas about the struggle currently existing among a small number of leading cadres, and correct their wrong way of doing things in order to bolster their anticorruption resolve and confidence. It should be made clear that anticorruption is an important assurance for the economy to develop smoothly, and in a healthy manner. We should preserve cadres' enthusiasm and initiative in carrying out reform and economic construction, but we must never defend or wink at their corrupt and criminal acts. Leaders at all levels, especially leading comrades of the party and government, should restudy Comrade Deng Xiaoping's discussion on tightly gripping with two hands, and Comrade Jiang Zemin's speech at the Third Plenary Meeting of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission; further unify their understanding of the great significance of the anticorruption struggle; and carry out the struggle unequivocally, justly, and forcefully, in order to further deepen the struggle and enable it to endure and yield better results. Second, priority should be given to investigating and prosecuting major or serious cases. Vigorous efforts should be made to investigate such cases in key departments, especially major criminal cases involving leading cadres. Specialized organs should follow the mass line by encouraging people to report on criminal cases. We should conscientiously do a good job in making preliminary investigation of clues for solving cases. Party committees at various levels should support law and discipline enforcement departments in making preliminary investigation of cases. A case that should be investigated and prosecuted must be thoroughly investigated and prosecuted, no matter who is involved in the case. We should resolutely resist various personal connections and interceding for others. Interference in the handling of a case that constitutes a crime should also be investigated and prosecuted according to law. We should support law-enforcement departments in handling cases independently. We should conscientiously implement the principle of dealing promptly and severely with serious cases of economic crimes. When it is necessary to make a preliminary investigation of a case, we should do so; when a case should be placed on file for investigation and prosecution, we should do so; and when those involved in a case should be given severe sentences, we should also do so. Under the unified leadership of party committees, news media and propaganda departments should effectively report on and publicize typical major or serious cases in order to strengthen people's confidence in the struggle against corruption. Conscientiously implementing the principle of "being firm, prudent, and accurate," we should strictly distinguish between being guilty and being innocent. Third, it is necessary to effectively strengthen our leadership over the anticorruption struggle, and the investigation and prosecution of major or serious cases. The anticorruption struggle is a task for the whole party. So the whole party should carry it out, and there should be personnel responsible for it at every level. We should make unremitting efforts to do solid work in this regard. We should conscientiously analyze and check on the anticorruption struggle according to the central authorities' requirements and the conditions of our localities or units. We should make further arrangements for the investigation and prosecution of major or serious cases, especially cases involving leading cadres. We should strengthen our supervision and inspection in this respect and vigorously implement relevant policies and measures. We should take the initiative in coordinating the investigation and prosecution of major or serious cases, especially cases involving leading cadres. All department concerned should make concerted efforts in handling such cases. Principal leaders of party and government organizations at various levels should concern themselves with the investigation and prosecution of major or serious cases, support law and discipline enforcement departments in handling cases according to law, help them remove obstructions, and back them in handling cases impartially. It is essential to improve law and discipline enforcement departments' equipment for the investigation of cases, and to make sure they have sufficient funds to handle cases, especially enough funds to investigate and prosecute major cases involving leading cadres. Present at the telephone conference were Chai Songyue, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee and executive vice governor of the province; Wang Qichao, standing committee member of the provincial party committee and member of the provincial discipline inspection commission; Si Daxiao, member of the standing committee and secretary of the political and legal commission of the provincial party committee; Ge Shengping, procurator general of the provincial people's procuratorate; Lu Zushan, secretary general of the provincial party committee; and leaders of relevant departments.
