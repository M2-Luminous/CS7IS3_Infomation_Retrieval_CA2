FBIS4-48012 "drafr090_a_94003" FBIS-AFR-94-090 Daily Report 8 May 1994 CENTRAL AFRICA Central African Republic New Legislative Elections To Be Held in 3 Districts New Legislative Elections To Be Held in 3 Districts AB0905112294 London BBC World Service in English 1705 GMT 8 May 94 AB0905112294 London BBC World Service English BFN [From the "Focus on Africa" program] [Text] With it being over eight months since the Central African Republic [CAR]'s general elections, you might have assumed that any argument about outcome would be over by now, but far from it. The Supreme Court has just decided that there were irregularities and much to opposition dismay. President Patasse's government stands to gain more seats in parliament. From Bangui, Joseph Benamsse telexed this report. According to the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court, three opposition deputies are suspended from Parliament because of irregularities that took place in the parliamentary elections of August 1993. Following submission of this verdict to the Ministry of the Interior, a new round of legislative elections in three districts will be held within 45 days. The areas affected are all districts where President Patasse's MLPC [Central African People's Liberation Movement] Party did not win sits. They include a suburb of Bangui and two districts, west and northwest of the capital. Speculation is rife in Bangui that the MLPC are trying to gain these three seats for themselves as they do not currently hold the majority in Parliament. With 33 out of a total 85 parliamentary seats, they technically need 10 more to hold the majority, but in practice they have been able to count on a number of allies to vote for them thus far. Cracks, however, are now appearing in the informal coalitions in Parliament and the MLPC looks set to lose a couple of their former supporters. And so, if they won these three seats, they would be able to maintain their position.
