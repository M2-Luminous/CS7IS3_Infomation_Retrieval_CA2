These are the 1994 economic work guiding principles as defined at the provincial economic work conference on 21 December. Present at the conference were Wang Guofa, Quan Zhezhu, and Wei Minxue, vice governors of the provincial government; and Sang Fengwen, secretary general of the provincial government. Comrade Gao Yan first divided the guidelines of the national economic work conference into nine parts and relayed the guidelines. The contents of these nine parts are the current situation, the 1994 economic work principles and tasks, the vigorous development of the rural economy, the increase in the peasants' income, the stress on economic results, the efforts to realistically grasp the industrial and communications production, the several major reform measures as put forward in line with the general targets for accelerating the setup of the socialist market economic system, the efforts to grasp favorable opportunities to further expand the scale of opening up, the efforts to appropriately handle the relations of reform, development, and social stability, and the enhancement and improvement of the leadership over the economic work. After that, Comrade Liu Xilin comprehensively arranged the 1994 economic work. After analyzing the 1994 economic development trends and defining the national economic development targets, he first used conclusive figures to introduce the province's new achievements in reform and economic construction. He said: The 14 managerial rights which are delegated to enterprises according to the "regulation" are being delegated in a step-by-step manner. Noticeable achievements have been made in experimenting with the shareholding system. The state-owned and civilian-run enterprises have been popularized on a large scale. Simultaneously, the company system is carried out on a trial basis. Key headway has been made in price reform, new headway has been made in carrying out the social insurance system and reforming the economic system, and new strides have been made in reforming the planning and investment system and the housing system and setting up the market system. Based on the 1992 rapid economic growth rate, in 1993, the province continues to maintain the good faster development trend. The major targets for elevating the economy to a new height have been fulfilled. The GNP is expected to reach 5.5 billion yuan, an increase of 14.3 percent over 1992. Of this, the added value of the tertiary industry is expected to reach 13.3 billion yuan, an increase of 17.3 percent; the total agricultural output value is expected to reach 22.4 billion yuan, the second peak year in history; the total output value of town and township enterprises is expected to reach 30 billion yuan, an increase of 40 percent over 1992; the total industrial output value is expected to reach 81 billion yuan, an increase of 18 percent; the total volume of retail sales of commodities is expected to reach 35.2 billion yuan, an increase of 17.9 percent; and the foreign export trade volume is expected to reach $1.6 billion, an increase of 23 percent.

The capital profit and tax rate reaches 6.24 percent. (If calculated according to comparable factors, the targets of elevating the economy to a new height can be fulfilled.) The per capita labor productivity of the independent accounting industrial enterprises at or above the township level reaches 9,686 yuan. The turnover of the working funds is 1.27 times. The energy consumption for per 10,000 yuan of industrial output value is 3.46 tonnes of (standard coal.) The revenues are expected to reach 6.8 billion yuan, an increase of 19 percent. The bank savings deposits reach 48.39 billion yuan, an increase of 7.5 billion yuan over the figure at the beginning of the year. The per capita net income of the peasants reaches 864 yuan and the urban dwellers' income for living expenses reach 1,735.6 yuan. The investment in fixed assets of society reach 20 billion yuan, an increase of 33 percent over 1992. The investment in the fixed assets of localities reach 14.07 billion yuan, an increase of 34.9 percent. Of this, the investment in technological transformation reaches 2.8 billion yuan. Liu Xilin said: The year 1994 is a year to implement the "decision" of the third plenary session of the 14th party Central Committee, to wholly promote the economic structural reform, and to make key breakthroughs in the economic structural reform as well as the last year to attain the three-year target of elevating the economy to a new height as required by the provincial party committee and the provincial government. The 1994 major national economic and social development targets are defined as follows: The GNP should increase by 12 percent and strive to increase by 16.5 percent. Of this, the added value of the tertiary industry should increase by 20 percent and strive to reach 28 percent. The total agricultural output value should increase by 6 percent and strive to reach 7.4 percent. The total grain output should reach 19 billion kilograms. The total output value of town and township enterprises should increase by 33.3 percent. The total industrial output value should increase by 15 percent and strive to increase 18.4 percent. The capital profit and tax rate of the industrial front should increase by 2 percentage point. The per capita labor productivity of the independent accounting industrial enterprises at or above the township level should increase by 14 percent. The energy consumption for per 10,000 yuan of output value should be reduced by 3 percent. The turnover of the working funds should reach 1.37 times. The revenues should increase by 8 percent. The bank savings deposits should increase by 8.5 billion yuan, an increase of 17.5 percent. The volume of retail sales of commodities should increase by 17 percent. The foreign export trade volume should reach $2 billion, an increase of 25 percent. A total of $750 million foreign capital should really be used, and the use of foreign capital should strive to reach $800 million foreign capital. The per capita net income of the peasants should reach 910 yuan and the urbanites' income for living expenses should reach more than 1,800 yuan. The retail price index should be controlled within 10 percent. The 1994 reform tasks are extremely arduous. Liu Xilin pointed out: Setting up the modern enterprise system is an effective way for realizing the public ownership form under the conditions for exploring the market economy as well as a reform orientation of the state-owned enterprises. According to different actual conditions, enterprises should adopt different forms to reform the property right system. First, develop the shareholding system. Next year, we should strive to transform 50 to 100 state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises with good foundation and good economic results into limited companies or shareholding corporations. Second, reorganize, on a trial basis, state-owned, wholly funded limited companies. Next year, 100 enterprises in the province should be changed into companies of this kind. In addition, we should also carry out various forms of property right systems, such as "state ownership and civilian management," grafting management, shareholding cooperative management, "separate management," management based on reformed system, amalgamation, and bankruptcy. Simultaneously, we should also positively reform the financial, investment, planning, and foreign trade systems in the macroeconomic spheres; positively and steadily promote the reform of price, housing, social insurance systems; focus on cultivating the markets for production factors; and vigorously strengthen the construction of capital, land, labor, technology, information, and property right markets. In regard to the issues of speeding up the economic development and striving to fulfill the task of elevating the economy to a new height, Liu Xilin stressed: We should strengthen agriculture's role as the foundation of the national economy, vigorously develop the shareholding cooperative economy, and cultivate and expand the mainstay of the markets. It is necessary to ceaselessly perfect the responsibility system dominated by the contracted responsibility on the household basis with payment linked to output and the dual management system of linking centralized management with decentralized management and along with the setup of the socialist market economy. We should stabilize the land contract relations and extend the land contract periods. Under the conditions of persisting in the collective ownership of the land and not changing the purposes of utilization of land, the peasants are allowed to sell the land utilization rights within the contract periods. Barren hills and wasteland can be rent, mortgaged, and used in exchange for stocks. In this way, land resources will effectively be distributed and appropriately be managed. The shareholding cooperative system is created by the peasants in order to suit the new situation of developing the market economy. Therefore, all localities should run and transform town and township enterprises in the form of the shareholding cooperation system and organize and set up circulation organizations and socialized service organizations. In regard to the industrial production, Liu Xilin set forth: Next year, we should carry out our work emphatically in line with the requirements for readjusting structures, transforming mechanisms, grasping management, and increasing efficiency. In the course of readjusting the industrial structure, we should further expand such two pillar industries as the petrochemical and vehicle industries; develop the industries with advantages, such as food, medicine, metallurgical, building materials, and paper-making industries; and strengthen such basic industries as energy and raw material industries. We should also positively develop the electronics industry. We should emphatically grasp the construction of a large number of key projects, such as the 300,000-tonne ethylene project of Jilin Chemical industry Company, the sedan car manufacturing project and its auxiliary projects of the Changchun No. 1 Vehicle Manufacturing Plant, and the first phase of the Shuangliao power plant project; and conduct technological transformation among the "bottle neck" and weak links that affect the economic development. The enterprises should organize structural readjustment according to the requirements for the market economy, further develop specialized and integrated management, and adopt various forms to optimize the reorganization of enterprises. The product mix should be readjusted according to the principle of supporting the production of the products with advantages, creating new products, increasing the production of readily marketable products, controlling the production of unmarketable products, and limiting the production of ordinarily marketable products. we should support the production of quality products in line with the preferential policies. Next year, we should develop 2,400 new products and focus on developing 50 new products each creating 2 to 5 million yuan of profits and taxes annually. Keeping a proper scale of investment in fixed assets is a key condition for economic growth. Next year, the investment in fixed assets should be 24 billion yuan. The total investment will be used for key construction projects and technological transformation projects. We should speed up the economic development pace; vigorously develop the collective, private, and individual sectors of the economy; cultivate new national economic growth points; pay high attention to science and technology and education; positively develop the tertiary industry; organize market supply; and make good arrangements for the people's livelihood. Further expanding the scale of opening to the outside world and vigorously developing the export-oriented economy is one of the province's economic work priorities. Liu Xilin urged: In the new year, we should positively expand the international market and vigorously develop foreign trade. We should further improve the export commodity structure; vigorously grasp the export of additional-value machinery and electronics products and complete sets of equipment with strong competitiveness on the international market, high foreign exchange earnings, and good export projects and new high-tech products. We should expand the export of labor-intensive light and textile products. We should accelerate the transformation of a number of export-oriented town and township enterprises; gradually set up a system where the production of grain, oil, meat, vegetable, fruit, and timber is comprehensively developed; and establish enterprise groups with foreign exchange earnings. We should improve the environment of opening to the outside world and positively and effectively use foreign capital. Next year, we should approve 1,000 foreign-funded enterprises and strive to use $800 million foreign capital. We should realistically achieve the construction and management of development zones, continue to run four state-class development zones, and strive to gain approvals for setting up several provincial-level development zones. Liu Xilin urged: To suit the 1994 reform and development, the leading organs at various levels and the leading cadres should noticeably improve their leadership forms and work style. Next year, the provincial, city, and county government organs should conduct reform in succession. The reform targets are to change functions, balance relationship, streamline administration, and improve efficiency. The most urgent task for changing the government functions is to realize the transition from direct management of enterprises to macroeconomic regulation and control, to grasp the setup of the markets for production factors, and to create conditions for sending enterprises to markets. He hoped that the cadres at various levels should clearly understand the situation, have firm faith, overcome difficulties, vigorously promote reform and opening up, and fight for promoting a sustained, fast, and sound development of the national economy. Present at the conference were principal leaders of the city (autonomous prefectural) governments, leaders of the provincial-level and city (autonomous prefectural) departments concerned, and plant directors (managers) of some large enterprises.
