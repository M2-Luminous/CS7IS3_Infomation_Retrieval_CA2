FBIS4-27361 "dreas105__a94042" FBIS-EAS-94-105-A Daily Report 12 May 1994 ANNEX Japan Mitsubishi, Hitachi Cooperate on Flash Memory Mitsubishi, Hitachi Cooperate on Flash Memory 942A0228A Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN in Japanese 12 May 94 p 17--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942A0228A Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN Japanese CSO [Text] Mitsubishi Electric will jointly develop with Hitachi flash memory (read-only memory which can be electronically erased and rewritten all at once) which is the next-generation leading memory. They will employ the Mitsubishi method in 16-megabit products and the Hitachi method in 64-megabit products, develop and sell uniform specification products. The aim is to rival Toshiba which is leading the flash memory market by tieups with U.S. and South Korean manufacturers. Since Toshiba, Hitachi, and Mitsubishi are respectively proceeding with development of unique methods with different specifications for flash memory, making their own method the de facto standard such as the format for VTR [video tape recorders] has become a big task for survival in the market. Various companies are competing furiously as they consider flash memory the next big product after DRAM [dynamic random-access memory] (dynamic read and write memory necessary for memory storage operations). However, it smacks of just talk in advance and there are some rather vague parts such as realistically to what applications will it be most directed? Moreover, viewed internationally, since the large U.S. semiconductor manufacturer Intel now hold the greatest market share, it seems a big task will be how to destroy the Intel stronghold.
