Thanong's resignation from the party thus automatically terminated his membership in the House. Speaking to reporters at Chat Thai Party's head office at noon today, Banhan Sinlapa-acha, leader of Chat Thai Party, said that the approval of Thanong Siriprichaphong's resignation was made on the recommendation of the fact-finding committee set up earlier by the party. However, as yet, Thanong Siriprichaphong is still considered innocent because the court has not yet ruled that he is guilty. Banhan said the drug charge against Thanong has caused severe damage to the country and its political institutions as well as to the Chat Thai Party. [passage omitted]
