The conference, called the Second Round Table Conference With the Government in Havana, officially opens its two-day closed door meetings today, 21 June. The conference was inaugurated by Carlos Lage, vice president of the council of ministers, Christine Stewart, and an executive of the sponsoring publication. Stewart stressed that Canada's government supports an increase in investments in Cuba, not only because they contribute to Cuba's development but because they are beneficial to Canada. Currently, Canada has a significant presence in the foreign investments made in the Cuban mining sector, not only in the traditional nickel sector but also in the new explorations for gold, lead, and copper, as well as in the operation of oil fields. Stewart expressed Canada's readiness to stimulate, even more, the influx of capital to Cuba. Ottawa announced that it will aid in the development of Cuba, as well as through the World Food Program, sending an emergency $360,000 [country of currency not specified] -- $720,000 in 1995 -- in food aid to Cuba.
