That is the clear position of the Norwegian Government before the negotiations with the EU today. If Spain, in today's anticipated last and decisive round of talks, comes up with new quota demands over and above the total of 3,000 tonnes of cod to which Norway has agreed, then, according to the main Norwegian negotiators, the answer will be an unequivocal "no." Norway will only start its negotiations late in the afternoon, after the Council of Ministers has discussed its institutional problems at the beginning of the meeting at 1300 [1200 GMT] today. "We have no more resources to give," Foreign Minister Bjorn Tore Godal told journalists at a news conference yesterday. He rejected any talk of the "EEA [European Economic Area] quota" being stretched any further. Fisheries Minister Jan Henry T. Olsen also answered with a straight "no" when asked whether Norway will give up any more fish if the total permitted fishing quota increases further in the next few years. When asked how such an assurance by the Norwegians could be relied upon when the claim that Norway had "not one fish to give" had already become 3,000 tonnes, Godal replied: "We can discuss until we are blue in the face whether stretching the EEA agreement actually constitutes giving any fish. I call it adjusting or stretching the implementation of the EEA agreement," he said, referring to the fact that Spain will receive these quotas in 1995 rather than 1997. Meeting With Solana Yesterday afternoon, Fisheries Minister Jan Henry T. Olsen had a meeting with EU Fisheries Commissioner Yannis Paleokrassas. A meeting with the Portuguese fisheries minister was also planned for late yesterday evening. Meanwhile, the appointment which aroused the greatest excitement was the planned meeting between Foreign Minister Godal and his Spanish colleague Javier Solana. Godal and Solana met late yesterday evening in the Spanish ambassador's private residence in Brussels. Attempts were made to conceal the venue of the meeting from the press. When Godal emerged from the meeting after 75 minutes, he reported that Spain was not advancing fisheries demands in the usual manner but that the Spaniards felt they were being pressured within the EU. Godal emphasized that the meeting had taken place in a comfortable atmosphere. He presented his colleague with a cigar, but not a single fish. Problem Areas In addition to the technical fisheries issue, which it is hoped will be solved at senior official government level this morning, there still remain four additional so-called "problem areas," namely the issues of resources, administration north of the 62nd parallel, market access, and licensing regulations associated with access to territorial waters. Olsen stated that yesterday's meetings did not result in any rapprochement between the parties concerned, other than on the question of market access. "At the outset, Norway had accepted EU demands for a system to monitor imports of Norwegian herring, mackerel, shrimp, salmon, lobster, and scallops," Olsen said yesterday evening. It is still unclear, however, how long such a monitoring system will remain in place. "The important thing is that the Norwegian fishing industry can continue like today, without being subjected to worse conditions," he added. The fisheries minister was extremely sober in describing the chances of resolving the remaining fisheries problems: "My feeling is that we have an arduous road ahead of us," he said. Olsen believed that the day's negotiations will decide whether Norway will arrive at a solution: "The EU wants to have us as a Member State, but it remains to be seen to what extent it will accept that Norway has some distinguishing characteristics which must be taken into account." He did not want to go into details regarding the solutions that Norway can accept on the matter of administering fish north of the 62nd parallel. "However, the decisive thing for me is that we get a regime under which we can feel safe in the knowledge that our system can continue as it is," he said. In addition to fish matters, a formal statement on the whaling issue still has to be made, and the question surrounding a protocol establishing that Norway can continue its policy of openness in administration has yet to be addressed.
