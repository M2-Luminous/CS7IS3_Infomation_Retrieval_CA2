At its session yesterday, the Crimean legislature approved, with a majority of votes, the nomination of General Lepikhov, who was nominated by [Crimean] President Yuriy Meshkov, as chief of the Crimean Security Service. In this way, it ignored the decree issued by Ukrainian President Kravchuk reorganizing the Crimean Republic Security Service and the Ukrainian Security Service [SBU] General Department in the Crimea. The SBU press service in Kiev emphasizes that the main goal of the reorganization is to increase centralization of the service leadership and the effectiveness of its fight against organized crime in the Crimea, where it is assuming more and more dangerous forms. Through the NOVYNY television and radio agency, the press service also reports that Crimean President Meshkov has practically ignored a wire sent to him by SBU Chief Yevhen Marchuk. The wire informs him that the SBU General Department in the Crimea, established in accordance with Leonid Kravchuk's decree, shall remain unchanged, in terms of its function, staff, and number. The press service also reports that SBU First Deputy Chief Valeriy Malikov is currently in Simferopol with a group of SBU workers. They are preparing materials concerning the fight against organized crime in the Crimea, which will be examined at the next meeting of the SBU Collegium.
