The president spoke this morning and left a number of messages to those who want to listen. Without entering into an open conflict [with the government], Soares set the tone for the congress. He expressed his concern over the state of the Portuguese economy. [Begin Soares recording] How will we live as a nation, when the Community funds come to an end or are considerably reduced? The crisis in agriculture and in the countryside, provoked mainly by the shortcomings in the sale of produce, is turning our fields into wasteland. I cannot accept such a situation. I believe it to be totally unacceptable and inappropriate, although I know we are paid not to produce. No one today doubts that unfortunately we have returned to a situation of having wages in arrears and a drop in real wages -- a situation that I hope will be temporary -- that we continue to have child labor, that temporary contracts are now almost always the rule, that unemployment is threatening to continue to rise, that the banks are suffering many unpaid debts, and that many companies, large, medium, and small, are experiencing many difficulties under the specter of announced bankruptcies. How are we going to get out of this situation, this gloomy situation? For 15 years there was talk of the negative consequences of nationalization on the Portuguese economy, arbitrarily carried out during the revolution by the Council of the Revolution. I hope that for the next few years we will not be speaking, with an equal sense of criticism, of the way in which privatization has been carried out. [end recording] The president's words were applauded by an audience of distinguished members of the opposition. Education, environment, and Community funds were the areas the president criticized, aimed indirectly at Sao Bento [prime minister's residence]. [passage omitted]
