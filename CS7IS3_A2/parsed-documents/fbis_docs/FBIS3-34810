The talks were suspended for one week at the request of the Israeli side to hold consultations with its government. The nature of these consultations and their results are still not clear. However, it is clear that Israel recessed the peace talks in order to cover up its intransigent, maneuvering stands. Israel also wants to prolong these talks to give the impression that it is serious about reaching ideas and views to discuss the question of peace and its requirements. TISHRIN adds: Since the suspension of the talks, Israel has not said anything signaling that the Israeli side has come up with anything new or that it has changed its familiar stand and abandoned its conditions and obstacles. On the contrary, all indications are that Israel still adheres to everything that is far from achieving a just and comprehensive peace. Also, Israel is still committed to sabotaging the peace process. No Israeli official has said anything that inspires optimism and hope for real progress in the Washington talks. TISHRIN goes on: Israel has cast doubt on the results of the talks even before they start. Several Israeli officials have said the talks will be unproductive, just like all the other previous rounds and sessions that have been revolving in a vicious circle since the Madrid conference. The only new thing that Israel has come up with is the old, familiar tune repeated by its Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres when he said: The talks between Syria and Israel should be upgraded. This discordant Israeli tune cannot fool anybody. Israel's previous discordant tune -- arguing that secret talks alone can produce positive results to advance the peace process -- could not fool anybody either. The paper says the secret Oslo talks revealed that the aim Israel seeks behind the talks is to take on each Arab party on its own so that it can easily blackmail it and drive it to make more concessions. The purpose of this is to defeat the Madrid formula and evade its foundations and terms. Since Syria is perfectly aware of Israel's malicious objectives and premeditated intentions, and stemming from a comprehensive pan- Arab perspective, Syria has firmly and proudly rejected Israeli suggestions and claims. Syria has asserted that the one who is concerned about peace would also be eager to maintain the foundations on which the peace process was launched, particularly in terms of a comprehensive solution, clear position, just cause, and that peace is impossible along with occupation, not even some or part of this occupation. This is because peace can only be achieved through real, serious implementation of the resolutions of international legitimacy. TISHRIN concludes: There can be no peace without the Arabs regaining their territories in full. This will enable the region to start an age of stability and prosperity, end tension, explosions, disasters, wars, and calamities. Under the headline "Partial Solutions Are Not the Alternative," AL-BA'TH says: The bilateral peace talks are expected to resume in Washington tomorrow amid an atmosphere that does not inspire optimism. Israel has once again attempted to reshuffle cards in line with its rejection of peace and its policy to take on the Arab parties one at a time, resulting in the Oslo and Cairo accords. AL-BA'TH adds that this policy aims at fragmenting the Palestine question, in fact the Arab-Israeli conflict, to impose surrender on the Arabs and Zionist hegemony on the region. Israel has found a party that responds to it by making endless concessions. This encouraged the Rabin government to show more intransigence whenever it achieves a breakthrough that serves its purposes. The best evidence of this is Israel's demand that representation on the Syrian track be upgraded, or else emphasizing that it has no wish to go any further on this track. This position, though old, has come on the heels of the Cairo agreement. We do not know what new position the Rabin government will come up with after whatever agreement. This is because the talks between Israel and the party that claims to be representing the Palestinian people are not over yet. The two parties need a series of agreements to implement the Oslo accord of capitulation. AL-BA'TH adds that Israel is still deliberately seeking to steer clear of the principles that call for a just and comprehensive solution in the region. This approach, with all its attempts to reshuffle cards, is impossible to continue forever, since a just and comprehensive peace is an international demand, as well as a regional and Arab demand.
