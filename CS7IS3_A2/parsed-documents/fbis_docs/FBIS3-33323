Rodriguez gave a special address to a packed room at the Convention Center where the Computing-94 International Fair and Conference were inaugurated. This event is of great interest to a large number of specialists. Rodriguez said that 1994 should not experience further drops in production and that the national economy will perform better, even if it is not marked by recovery. Following the hour-long address, Rodriguez answered participants' questions. He added that every adjustment process is painful but that Cuba is trying to make things as fair as possible and is particularly ensuring that it has as much support as possible. Rodriguez added that this explains the workers assemblies being conducted by the Cuban Workers Federation and its unions. Rodriguez reported that as of 1993, there were 112 foreign investment agreements, one-fifth of which are joint enterprises, particularly in tourism and basic industry.
