They plan the introduction of proper criteria based on merit for admission to police schools and for the advancement of police officers in the Greek Police [EL-AS] with an objective system of transfers, as well as the institutionalization of the right to form trade unions. The Ministry of Public Order has already drafted a law for the radical restructuring of the police, the change of the system for the admission to the police schools, and for police trade unions. More specifically, the minister and the deputy minister of Public Order in their news conference yesterday presented the following: - A draft bill has been prepared regarding the admission into the police schools for officers and policemen, and for officers of the fire service using the system of General Examinations for the Higher [AEI] and Technical [TEI] Educational Institutions. A draft law has already been prepared which will regulate the transfers in EL-AS based on objective criteria and more specifically based on a system of "points." - The draft bill which has also been prepared regarding trade unions is recognizing this right within the basic framework of Law 1264 which applies to civil servants, but with differences on matters which are not proper for the security forces (such as the right to strike). - The working groups set up by the police have drafted a plan for the restructuring of the various services by creating multifunction precincts supplied with modern equipment, telecommunications facilities, computerization, and which will include in their personnel security services, public order forces, traffic policemen, and market price control police. In other words, all that is necessary to provide the comprehensive policing of a given area. - A special group of investigator-detectives is being formed to deal systematically with difficult cases to combat organized crime. - Also, a special group is being created in the police to deal with emergencies such as street mobilizations, or the illegal occupation of buildings which call for special handling. This group for crisis handling, as Public Order Minister Papathemelis called it, will be properly trained to deal with difficult situations. In greater detail, the draft law provides that the admission to police schools will be done through general examinations, using in the schools for officers the "subject groups" pertaining to the higher educational institutions and in the schools for policemen those pertaining to the technical educational institutions. The officer school studies will be at the university level and will cover eight semesters, while those for policemen will cover five semesters in addition to one semester of practical training. At the same time, a school of national security is being established, corresponding to the war colleges of the Ministry of National Defense, and will deal with the postgraduate and advanced training of higher level police officers. The Public Order minister gave assurances that the bill will be introduced [to the legislature] before Easter, adding that already the bill has been sent to the other interested ministries for their comments which the Public Order Ministry will review. - Regarding transfers to other localities or posts, the minister said that they will take place once a year and will come into force in September to avoid causing family problems to police personnel. The transfers will be determined on the basis of "points" adjusted to the needs of the service. - With regard to the trade unions, the minister said that there will be a first level, a second level, and one third level organization. In other words, the first level organizations will join together in a federation as a second level, and a confederation will be the highest trade union organization for all police personnel. The ministry is engaged in a dialogue with the trade unions and other agencies to resolve various issues.
