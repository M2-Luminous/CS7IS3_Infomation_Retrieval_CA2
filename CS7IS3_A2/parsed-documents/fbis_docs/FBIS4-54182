The two countries agreed Tuesday to resume stalled trade "framework" talks on the three priority areas -- automobile and auto parts, insurance and government procurement of telecommunications and medical equipment. Although the two governments agreed not to make public the contents of the papers they exchanged Tuesday, sources close to the negotiations said that "by making clear the goals in each trade area, the separate negotiations will be able to focus more on the proposals." The papers showed the two sides also confirmed that objective criteria be based on both quantitative and qualitative standards, and that no numerical targets be set. Japan and the U.S. also clarified the goals in considering the criteria for measuring liberalization and the specific deregulation measures in the three markets. According to the papers, the goal for the automobile and auto parts sector is a greater opportunity for entry, while that for the government procurement sector is a major increase in foreign products and services. For the insurance area, the goal is to end obstacles to entry. In future negotiations, the U.S. is expected to ask Japan to increase the number of outlets dealing with imported cars and car parts, and to take action that will make it easier for Japan's automobile dealer networks to sell foreign products, the sources said. As for government procurement, the U.S. will probably ask for improvements in bidding procedures and demand a larger share by foreigners by basing objective criteria on the scale of foreign product procurement, the sources said. In the insurance sector, they said the U.S. will likely ask for an introduction of the broker system and for changes in Japan's practice of "keiretsu," or system of interlocking shareholding among companies.
