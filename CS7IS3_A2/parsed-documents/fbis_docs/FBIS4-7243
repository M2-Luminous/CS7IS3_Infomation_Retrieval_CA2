FBIS4-7243 "dreas082_d_94005" FBIS-EAS-94-082 Daily Report 28 Apr 1994 South Korea China Reportedly Provided Food to DPRK China Reportedly Provided Food to DPRK SK2804045794 Seoul CHOSON ILBO in Korean 28 Apr 94 p 2 SK2804045794 Seoul CHOSON ILBO Korean BFN [Report by Yi Chong-won] [Text] Western sources in Seoul knowledgeable in North Korean-Chinese relations reported on 27 April that China provided North Korea with food, including 10,000 tonnes of rice, as "birthday gifts" on 15 April, President Kim Il-song's birthday. Reporting that China also "presented" 10 tonnes of meat and five tonnes of edible oil to North Korea, the sources noted: "The delivery of those 'food gifts' by China was very unusual, and it hints of North Korea's food problems." It was learned that China gave North Korea 400 tons of pork as a gift on President Kim's birthday in 1992. Regarding this, the ROK Government officials knowledgeable in North Korean affairs said: "In 1993, North Korea yielded only 3.8 million tonnes of rice due to the cold weather, and the amount is down 500,000 tonnes from other years and falls absolutely short of its necessary rice amount of 6.3 million tonnes." They added: "China provides North Korea with 1 million tonnes of rice every year in the form of barter trade. It is unprecedented, however, for China to present food to North Korea free of charge." Government officials analyzed that, although the 10,000-ton rice provided by China is insufficient to solve North Korea's food problems, it was probably of help in somewhat increasing the North Korean people's rice rations or in increasing the ratio of rice in mixing rice and other grains. This amount of rice can be loaded on 2,000 five-ton trucks and is over 50,000 soms -- North Korea sent 50,000 soms of rice to the ROK when we suffered flood damage in the middle of 1983.
