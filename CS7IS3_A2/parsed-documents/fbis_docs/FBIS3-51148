He will also present a writ of amparo calling for the suspendion of the VAT collection in his jurisdiction while the Supreme Court issues a ruling. According to Mayor Isturiz, the law is unconstitutional because tax issues are the exclusive responsibility of the national Congress and therefore its approval cannot be delegated to others. In addition, modifications to the tax system should be done in a progressive manner and not the way it has been done.
