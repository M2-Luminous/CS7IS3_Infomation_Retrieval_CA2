Such is the Vietnamese saying which is often quoted these days by mouth and in deed by the Vietnamese leaders and also the man on the street. The latest examples are the visits to Indonesia and Iran by President Le Duc Anh, to India by Chairman of the National Assembly Nong Duc Manh, the visits to Vietnam by dignitaries from the Czech Republic and Ukraine, and the constant influx of foreign business people who visit to probe the market opportunities in Vietnam. American businesses even held an exhibition in Hanoi to advertize their industrial and consumer goods. In the 50 days from March Vietnam hosted over 50 foreign delegations of ministerial level and higher and thousands of business people. Most notable were the visits by the presidents of Mongolia and the Philippines, the prime ministers of Singapore, Thailand, Sweden and Australia, the deputy prime minister of Russia, and HRH Princess Anne and minister of state for external relations of Great Britain. During the same period, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam Do Muoi visited Malaysia, other Vietnamese leaders and high officials visited countries in Asia and America. In the coming days, President Le Duc Anh, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and Deputy Prime Minister Tran Duc Luong are expected to visit various countries and regions in the world. On all these occasions, Vietnamese leaders reassured their guests and hosts that 'Vietnam wants to be friend all the countries in the world', that 'Vietnam is trying to build a law-governed state and a strong country, a rich people and an equitable and civilised society', and that 'Vietnam pursues an open, independent and sovereign foreign policy to diversify and multilateralise its international relations'. These are the wishes of the Vietnamese people who have fought through four decades of war to defend and build their country. They are also in line with the current trend of the world. In fact, Vietnam has been moving along these lines since the beginning of the national renewal, especially since the start of the nineties. It has made very important initial achievements, including the way the country is viewed in the eyes of the people of the world. Instead of Vietnamese fleeing the country, the world is seeing Vietnam make an annual GDP growth of 7 to 8, which is expected to climb to 9 or 10 over the next few years, export about 2 million tons of rice a year and host over 850 joint-venture and foreign invested projects with a total prescribed capital of over 8.5 billion USD. Visiting these joint ventures now, one will hear English, French, German, Japanese, Chinese, Korean and many other languages. The world also sees an increased presence of American businesses in Vietnam. The lifting of the US embargo against Vietnam has finally driven home to many Americans that they have come too late in the race into the Vietnamese market, and that American economic interests in Vietnam are already, really sizable. Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai told this writer that when the remaining few consular matters are settled, Vietnam and the US will open representative offices at each other's capital. When that comes, it will be yet more proof of Vietnam's successes in its renewal cause which has helped Vietnam improve its bilateral relations with many countries, regions and international institutions and organisations.
