This is what Turkish President Suleyman Demirel said at a meeting with Georgian journalists in Ankara. Five times prime minister and now president, Demirel has a great standing both in Turkey and among foreign political circles. In spite of his busy schedule, he nevertheless found time to speak to us as he believes that Turkish-Georgian relations have a great future. [Chikovani] Mr. President, what are the prospects for Turkish-Georgian relations? What could we have achieved in the past and what can be achieved today? [Demirel] First of all, I would like to repeat that the main principle underlying our foreign policy is the establishment of friendly and business-like relations with all our neighboring states on the basis of international norms. In this respect, we attach great importance to the development of all manner of relations with Georgia. So, I would like to emphasize that Turkey recognizes Georgian sovereignty and territorial integrity. We hope that we will see the development of economic and human resources in conditions of peace and democracy. The Abkhazian conflict gives us cause for great alarm. We believe the problem will be resolved within the framework of the UN Charter and the Helsinki Final Act so that peace can be established in your homeland that has been ravaged by war. At the same time, the peaceful settlement of the Abkhazian conflict in ethnically diverse Georgia will be a good example for the other Caucasian countries. I am glad that Georgia has taken important steps toward democracy and the process of integration with the world. I will remind you that Turkey, within the limits of its own possibilities, has rendered all manner of assistance to Georgia during what has been a difficult period for it. I will give you some precise figures. We have dispatched humanitarian aid to the value of $47,455,275, including wheat valued at $13,432,000. We have given credits worth $50,000,000 to the Exim Bank. We have unhesitatingly supplied our neighbor with electric power when considerable problems were created in this sphere in Georgia. This was precisely an expression of our good will toward Georgia during a difficult time. We are continuing to support Georgia. I believe that an economically developed democratic Georgia will be a factor of stability in the Caucasian region. Thus, we attach great importance to the development of economic relations with Georgia. The geographical proximity of our two countries will enable us to become natural trading partners. During President [as published] Shevardnadze's visit to Turkey, we signed many treaties in the political, economic, cultural, and technical spheres, which creates a legal basis for our relations. Several projects are already being elaborated in the fields of telecommunications, transport, trade, and tourism. The construction of a new border crossing will enhance our commercial relations still further. It is a pleasure for me to have a close friendship with President Shevardnadze, who is a strong and an experienced statesman. I am convinced that, under his wise leadership, the Georgian population will realize all its wishes and aims. [Chikovani] How do you assess the Turkish factor regarding the establishment of stability in the Caucasus? [Demirel] In my view, there exist two fundamental preconditions for achieving peace and stability. First: Respect for internationally recognized norms, which are expressed in the UN Charter and the Helsinki Final Act. Second: The formation of a base for economic and social prosperity, which is possible through close commercial cooperation between the region's countries. I do not think that the second precondition will be disputed given that the world today is striving toward economic integration. Turkey has recognized the independence of Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia and expressed the desire to establish close relations with all three countries without any form of discrimination. This governing and rational principle clearly demonstrates the importance we attach to stability in the Caucasian region. Turkey has always supported and defended the principles of territorial integrity and the protection of international borders by the use of force. Respect for these principles is the chief criterion for achieving stability in the Caucasus that is the homeland of diverse ethnic groups that have lived alongside one another for centuries. In many cases, we have seen that it is precisely the policy of the historical distribution of territories that has been the initial cause of instability. I deeply believe that territorial disputes should be settled only through negotiations and by taking into account human rights. At the same time, we believe that, in the matter of establishing peace and stability in the region, the greatest importance is given to economic cooperation between countries in the region. We should establish close relations in all spheres on the basis of mutual interests and faith. I take this opportunity to express once more my belief that, by taking into account cooperation with the Russian Federation, the region's countries will be able to establish close relations. This belief was the main factor behind the economic cooperation initiative involving Black Sea countries. It is hoped that our relations will turn the Black Sea into a sea of friendship and growth. [Chikovani] The problem of aggressive separatism is also familiar to Turkey. Do you think it is possible to resolve this problem in a peaceful way? [Demirel] Turkey is indeed familiar with separatist actions that have been carried out by the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] terrorist organization since 1984. In accordance with a decision by the Turkish Government, this problem will be resolved in a lawful way. Whilst our security forces are fighting the terrorists, the government is conducting reforms to regulate the economic difficulties in southeastern Turkey. We are investing huge sums of money into this region. The southeastern Anatolian project, which is gradually being launched and which will be implemented on a large scale in a few years time, will radically bolster economic activities and create jobs. I am convinced that the great importance of the economy will split the terrorist group and the "silent majority" of citizens who are not raising their voice against the terrorists today. [Chikovani] The world community is trying not to get actively involved in conflicts and often satisfies itself with just adopting resolutions or statements. In your view, what is the reason for this and to what extent is it justified? [Demirel] Following the defeat of communist ideology, the process of the strengthening of pluralism, the supremacy of law, and respect for human rights got under way in the former Soviet republics. On the other hand, the world has certain doubts as they are threatened by radical nationalism and ethnic conflicts. As a European country that borders on the continent's hottest spots, Turkey has taken upon itself to contribute to the process of establishing peace and stability in the whole region. Today, Turkey is trying to accelerate the transformation of instability into a factor of cooperation and solidarity. Naturally, in order to achieve this aim, one of our priorities are relations with international organizations. We believe that such international organizations as the UN and the CSCE are searching for the right position in order to satisfy the demands of the current transitional period. Of course, the chances of such organizations being able to resolve these problems depend upon the willingness of their members to assume responsibility. [Chikovani] A number of terrorist acts were committed during the preelection campaign in Turkey. To what extent is terrorism a characteristic feature of daily life in Turkey? [Demirel] Terrorists are enemies of the state. The PKK insists that it is protecting the interests of the people yet, at the same time, it is slaughtering Turkish citizens, many of whom are Kurds. The PKK continued its bloody actions during the preelection campaign. As a democratic country, Turkey will not allow anyone to commit terrorist acts. By a decision of the government, our security forces are implementing the most severe measures against terrorism. Terrorism is not a characteristic feature of Turkey today. It is confined to specific geographical regions -- southeastern Turkey -- and, as I have told you, we hope that we will wipe out the terrorists very shortly. [Chikovani] When mentioning Turkey one thinks of the East. However, Turkey has chosen the Western path of development. Has this not led to a change of identity on the part of the people and to what extent has Turkey preserved its centuries-old traditions? [Demirel] Proceeding from its geographical position, I would call Turkey the Eurasian focal point [posti] of the NATO countries. Therefore, we are both in Europe and Asia. Turkey's vast historical experience and cultural inheritance have contributed greatly to its occupying such a unique position. Turkey is an indivisible part of Europe as far as political, economic, and security issues are concerned. Furthermore, the fusion of Eastern and European values has taken place naturally in Turkey, which is further enriching Turkish life.
