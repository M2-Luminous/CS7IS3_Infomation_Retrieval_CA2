Summary of Facts and Representations 1. The Plans are a profit sharing plan and a money purchase pension plan, which as of December 31, 1992, had total assets of $1,642,180 and $960,643 respectively. Dr. Jacobson is the 100 percent owner of Avram A. Jacobson, M.D. (the Employer), a sole proprietorship and the sponsoring employer of the Plans. Dr. Jacobson maintains a pathology practice in Beverly Hills, California. The only participants in the Plans are Dr. Jacobson and his wife. The Trustee of the Plans is Dr. Jacobson, who has sole investment discretion with respect to the assets of the Plans. 2.The Profit Sharing Plan owns three works of contemporary art and the Money Purchase Pension Plan owns one work of mixed media art, collectively known as the Art Work. The Art Work was purchased for a cash amount of $685,000 by the Plans from unrelated parties with respect to Dr. Jacobson, the Employer, or the Plans. To date, the Plans have not incurred any costs associated with acquisition and holding of the Art Work. A description of the Art Work is as follows: 1Plan 1Title 1Artist 1Date of purchase 1Price PSP ``Untitled'' M. Merz 10/6/89 $135,000 PSP ``Grau'' G. Richter 11/9/89 150,000 MPPP ``Pau'' F. Stella 5/1/86 180,000 PSP ``Fouffi Noutti in Hell'' J. Schnabel 5/18/93 220,000 n,n,n,n,s Total 685,000 3. Following its acquisition, the Art Work has been in the possession of Dr. Jacobson at his residence located at 630 N. Sierra Drive, Beverly Hills, California. During a 1993 audit, the Service determined that Dr. Jacobson had engaged in prohibited transactions with the Plans by reason of his use of the Art Work for the years 1989 and 1990. 2 2 The Department notes that in 1987 the Profit Sharing Plan purchased a third party note for cash form the Norman L. Jacobson, M.D., P.A. Profit Sharing plan, the sole participant and trustee of which is Dr. Jacobson's brother, Norman L. Jacobson. In 1993, the Profit Sharing Plan sold the note back to the Norman L. Jacobson, M.D., P.A. Profit Sharing Plan for cash. The Department is not granting an exemption for such purchase and sale and is expressing no opinion as to whether the purchase and sale of such note constitutes a violation of any provision of the Code. Dr. Jacobson represents that he will file Forms 5330 with the Service and pay the applicable excise taxes associated the past prohibited transactions within ninety days of the publication in the Federal Register of the notice granting this proposed exemption. In addition, Dr. Jacobson will pay the Plans the fair market rental value in the amount of approximately $90,000 for his use of the Art Work for years 1989 through 1993. Excise taxes will accrue for the period between 1989 and 1993. 4. At present, the Art Work has produced no income for the Plans. In order to enable the Plans to divest themselves of the Art Work and to invest in income-producing, marketable securities, Dr. Jacobson proposes to purchase the Art Work from the Plans for a cash amount equal to the aggregate of the greater of either: (a) The original amount paid by the Plan at the time of acquisition; or (b) its fair market value on the date of the Sale. Accordingly, Dr. Jacobson requests an administrative exemption from the Department to permit his purchase of the Art Work from the Plans under the terms and conditions described herein. 5.
