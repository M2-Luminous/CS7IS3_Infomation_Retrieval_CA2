FBIS4-38131 "drnes124_k_94012" FBIS-NES-94-124 Daily Report 28 Jun 1994 IRAQ Ministry Report on Embargo Effect on Trade Ministry Report on Embargo Effect on Trade JN2806100294 Baghdad INA in English 0840 GMT 28 Jun 94 JN2806100294 Baghdad INA English BFN [Text] Baghdad, June 28, INA -- A recent report issued by the Ministry of Culture and Information on the impact of the embargo imposed on the country four years now said that it had adversely affected all sectors in Iraq. Minister of Trade Dr Muhammad Mahdi Salih and experts in dietetics stressed the fact that the nutritional value of the commodity actually available is one half of the normal consumption level required for an average man. Prior to the sanctions, Iraq used to import annually about 3 billion dollars worth of foodstuffs, of which 300 million dollars for baby formula alone. These imports, however, are either disrupted completely or severely restricted. Baby formula at cheap market prices are now beyond the reach of the majority of the children. Before August 1990, the individual's share of the food basket distributed by the state was 25 kg per month valued at ID [Iraqi dinar] 4,50 or 1.50 dollars. The basket included dried, fresh and canned commodities. Considering all food items together, the food ration card provides about 1736.6 calories per person per day, little less than one half of average calorie intake which stands at 2306 calories and 64.2 g of protein per day. Food prices have risen quite substantially due to the general constraints on imports and of freezing Iraq foreign assets abroad. Pre-sanctions prices were extremely low compared to those prevailing in neighbouring countries. The sharp increase in food price index has led to a corresponding higher levels of inflation. Current retail prices are higher by 4231 times for foodstuffs, 2933 times for meat, fish and eggs, 1463 times for vegetables and 1115 times for fruits. Other commodities such as household items and consumer durable goods, which the Ministry of Trade used to provide before 1991, have been totally discontinued as a result of the oppressive resolutions and US continued pressure on the Security Council Sanctions Committee. The sanctions imposed also hampered the importation of the spare parts, equipment, tyres and batteries required to maintain the internal transport capabilities. According to the Ministry of Trade sources, foreign companies which used to run business with Iraq before 1990, have lost about US 55 billion since the inception of the economic and trade embargo.
