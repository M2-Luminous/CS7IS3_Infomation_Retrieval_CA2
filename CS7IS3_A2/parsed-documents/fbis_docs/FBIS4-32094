That is probably the main reason the Third Polish Republic continues not to have a constitution. Five years ago, many issues seemed much simpler. Everybody knew what society was protesting against. The June elections to the contract Sejm became a plebiscite putting the screws to the authorities of the authoritarian state. Even the communists themselves, or at least some of them, spoke against the so-called real socialism, and that made it possible to get down to evolutionary changes. "At Last in Our Own Home" There were no major problems with making the ideological cosmetic changes to the basic law. The eagle was crowned again, and the adjective "socialist" was deleted. The idea of a lifelong friendship and military alliance with the Soviet Union was abandoned, which was made easier by the fact that the Soviet Union was just beginning to collapse. The Army was told to be apolitical, while "God, Honor, Motherland" was inscribed on its flags. So adopting a new constitution of the Third Republic seemed like the easiest thing under the sun to do. It should be adopted as soon as one can write a fundamental law that would suit Polish needs and aspirations. But 3 May 1991 is the absolutely final deadline that cannot be violated, Professor Bronislaw Geremek used to say four years ago. But, generally speaking, the task turned out to be much more difficult. When it came time to give some substance to concepts like "democracy," "state based on law," or "social justice" (which are favored by everybody, with virtually no exceptions), then everybody began to understand the concepts in his own way. And the longer the debate continues, the bigger the discrepancies that are emerging. [passage omitted] President or Parliament [Presidential Aide] Professor Lech Falandysz argues that, in the transitional period in which Poland is right now, beyond doubt the country needs a president with quite substantial powers. For the period of the crisis, the country needs a system in which a relatively strong and stabilized executive authority will be acting alongside parliament, which, however, will not have an advantage over the executive authority. By the way, that would be just a natural consequence of the decision made by the Sejm, to the effect that the head of state is elected not by the National Assembly but by citizens in popular elections. The proposal to subordinate the chief of the Polish Army General Staff directly to the commander in chief of the Armed Forces (the president) is an attempt at imposing precisely that kind of model. Efforts to grant decisionmaking powers to the National Security Council [RBN], which up to now was only an advisory organ to the head of state, are also in the same tone. As a result, the RBN would become a supergovernment whose orders would be binding on other authorities, including the Council of Ministers. It is an echo of Lech Walesa's "buffer theory." The prime minister, being responsible in front of parliament, to some degree protects the president, who reserves only the most important powers for himself, including the right to dismiss the prime minister, explains Professor Falandysz. But the problem is that practically no major political party, including the extraparliamentary ones, is willing to agree to such a concept. Both the right wing and the left wing, both post-"Solidarity" and postcommunist parties, are in favor of a parliamentary-cabinet type of system, under which it is the Sejm that has the upper hand in issues that are most important for the state, with the government implementing the day-to-day running of the country.
