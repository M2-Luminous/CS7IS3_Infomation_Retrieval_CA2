The two officials discussed the need for strengthening the ties that have linked Angola and Cuba for several decades. Cuban Foreign Minister Robaina is visiting this country within the framework of a diplomatic offensive which his government launched a few months ago. The Cuban official noted that it is not enough that the two peoples should know and understand each other, adding that they must also seek to cooperate as advantageously as possible. The audience was also attended by Angolan Foreign Affairs Minister Venancio de Moura and the Cuban ambassador to Angola. Official bilateral talks began this afternoon. Roberto Robaina, who arrived in the Angolan capital this morning on his first official visit to this country in his capacity as Cuban foreign affairs minister, had already carried out part of his program before midday: He held a private meeting with Venancio de Moura, his Angolan counterpart and he visited the Cuban doctors at the Military Hospital. He and his team began official talks with their Angolan counterparts at the Foreign Affairs Ministry this afternoon. They discussed the internal situation in Angola and Cuba, bilateral friendship and cooperation ties, and the international situation but, before doing so, they delivered long speeches. Angolan Foreign Minister Venancio de Moura spoke first: [Begin Moura recording] After the talks we had this morning concerning the internal situation in our countries, we found we are motivated to do everything in our power to ensure that we continue working together to overcome the insufficiencies and difficulties our peoples and governments are facing at this stage. Those difficulties have often arisen from hostile behavior toward our countries. [end recording] In turn, the Cuban foreign affairs minister attached special significance to his diplomatic offensive in Africa, where he is on a tour of several countries. Minister Robaina noted that this was particularly the case in the context of the very complex and constantly changing world we live in. He added that in Cuba one cannot talk about a diplomatic offensive without mentioning Africa, a continent with which Cuba has long standing historic relations. [Begin Robaina recording] To my country -- and, I suppose, to Angola, too -- diplomacy at this stage means finding paths, opening doors, and finding solutions to our problems. We must seek advantageous cooperation and think along the lines that what might be a necessity to one side, might also be an opportunity for the other side to [word indistinct]. [end recording] Cuban Foreign Affairs Minister Roberto Robaina is expected to wind up his visit to Angola tomorrow. Among other commitments, he is scheduled to call on President of the Republic Jose Eduardo dos Santos.
