FR941102-2-00062 FR941102-2-00046 In studying increases in cap levels, the Board was mindful of the existing structure of cap categories that require a self-assessment. For example, an ``average'' cap permits daylight overdrafts, on average over a reserve maintenance period, up to 75 percent of an institution's risk-based capital. In order not to diminish the relevance of an ``average'' cap, which can be obtained by an institution only after conducting a full self-assessment, the Board believes the cap multiple for the de minimis cap should not approach 75 percent. At a level of 40 percent of risk-based capital, however, between 85 and 90 percent of cap breaches by institutions that currently have exempt or de minimis caps would be eliminated, assuming certain exempt-from-filing institutions file a board of directors' resolution adopting a de minimis cap. Diminishing reductions in cap breaches by institutions with exempt and de minimis caps are achieved with cap levels beyond 40 percent, with an associated lessening of the relative benefits of a self-assessed cap. Cap levels below 40 percent do not yield a sufficient reduction in cap breaches to warrant any increase at all in the level of the de minimis cap. It should be noted that any increase in the size of net debit caps, in addition to providing capacity to cover current cap breaches caused by the posting rules, would also increase the intraday capacity for daylight overdrafts resulting from irrevocable Fedwire funds and book-entry securities transfers. The Board believes that, for the most part, institutions with a de minimis net debit cap have a relatively limited amount of Fedwire activity and an increase in daylight overdraft capacity will likely not increase significantly the risk exposure of the Reserve Banks. Moreover, Reserve Banks have special procedures in place for dealing with risks posed by depository institutions in poor or deteriorating financial condition. The Board has, therefore, approved an increase in the multiple associated with the de minimis net debit cap from 20 percent to 40 percent of risk-based capital. Counseling As noted above, the Reserve Banks administratively counsel depository institutions that exceed their caps. For cap categories other than the exempt-from-filing category, any daylight overdrafts in excess of a depository institution's cap are subject to counseling by the Reserve Banks. For institutions with an exempt cap, however, only when an institution incurs three or more daylight overdrafts in excess of its cap within a four-week period would it be subject to counseling. The Board reviewed this frequency measure to determine whether an increase may be feasible. By increasing the number of permissible daylight overdrafts in excess of the exempt cap from two in two consecutive two-week reserve maintenance periods to four in two consecutive two-week reserve maintenance periods, 79 percent of the institutions with exempt-from-filing caps that had cap breaches would not be subject to counseling by their Reserve Banks. A significant concern with increasing the permissible occurrences of cap breaches, however, is that there is currently no size limitation on the size of those cap breaches. The Board also believes that increases in the number of non-counselable daylight overdrafts effectively increases the amount of intraday credit that may be used by an institution. Should the Federal Reserve decide to increase the amount of intraday credit to be extended to depository institutions, the Board believes it would be preferable to identify such an increase clearly through an increase in the size of a cap, rather than an increase in the number of permissible excess daylight overdrafts. Another approach to minimize the administrative burden of counseling on both depository institutions and the Reserve Banks is to exempt daylight overdrafts caused either by check transactions or all non-Fedwire transactions from counseling. The Board believes, however, that separate treatment under the PSR policy of different types of payment transactions is not desirable. For example, daylight overdrafts caused by book-entry securities transfers and ACH transactions were initially excluded from counseling under the PSR policy. The Board decided in 1992 that all transactions should be treated alike for daylight overdraft measurement purposes. In addition, counseling institutions for some daylight overdrafts and not for others may lead to confusion, both within the Reserve Banks and at depository institutions. Nonetheless, some degree of counseling flexibility may be appropriate. As noted above, the Reserve Banks have had in place since October 1993 a policy of administering daylight overdraft counseling on a flexible basis, depending upon whether cap breaches were attributable to the new posting rules. Continued counseling flexibility appears to be desirable largely in dealing with institutions that have a zero daylight overdraft net debit cap as well as relatively small institutions that, by the nature of their business, will continue to exceed a positive net debit cap even after appropriate adjustments have been made. These institutions may have few alternatives for eliminating non-Fedwire daylight overdrafts. The institutions that have zero caps for reasons related to their financial condition are typically already on the real-time monitor in reject or pend mode. In addition, in some cases, zero cap institutions are also required by the Reserve Banks to prefund certain payments or collateralize any daylight overdrafts. Routinely counseling such institutions for overdrafts caused by non-Fedwire transactions lessens the credibility of the daylight overdraft counseling program and appears to do little to lessen the actual risk to Reserve Banks. The Board has approved such administrative counseling flexibility on an on-going basis. Posting Procedures Modifications to the intraday posting procedures would be another way to address the frequency of cap breaches by small depository institutions. The Board believes any such modifications should be carefully weighed. The check posting rules were adopted by the Board following a lengthy process involving two requests for public comment and many discussions with the banking industry, as noted above. For example, the principle of the elimination of intraday float for checks was specifically addressed through public comment in 1989. The new posting rules have now been in place about one year and it is possible that institutions may still be adapting to those rules. In addition, changes to these rules after such a short period of time may impose unanticipated costs associated with changing computer programs on a large number of depository institutions.
