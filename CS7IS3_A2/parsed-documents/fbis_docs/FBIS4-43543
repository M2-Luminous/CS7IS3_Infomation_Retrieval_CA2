Faced with future security challenges, it will be in Germany's interest in the 21st century to continue its policy of Western ties and international integration, the chancellor said today while accepting this year's Konrad Adenauer Prize from the Germany Foundation in Munich. This also means that Germany should not stand aside when tasks and operations aimed at preserving and reestablishing peace in Europe and the world are at issue. Hence, the issue of the Bundeswehr's deployment is at the heart of united Germany's future alliance and partnership capability, Kohl added. Anyone opposing bloodshed should also help prevent or end it. If Germany fails in this, then it is "justifiably" losing international respect and its own dignity, but also the confidence that it needs and on which it depends to a greater extent than do other countries. "A people no longer willing to work with its partners for peace and freedom has also morally given up," the head of government said. Kohl once again emphasized the significance of Europe's political union for safeguarding peace. Nobody should believe that the specter of nationalism in Europe is endemic only to the Balkans. On the other hand, Germans should also resist the temptation to despise patriotism just because that notion was abused during the Nazi period. [passage omitted]
