Addressing the annual kwaZulu government prayer breakfast in Durban, he said his opposition was principled and based on honourable and democratic objectives. He warned there could not be reconciliation unless the constitution was amended. "If I am wrong in my constitutional analysis, or if I am wrong that the 1993 constitution does not provide a framework for the emergence of an open democracy, then I will feel greatly honoured to change my views to help me help South Africa to achieve a real democracy." He warned: "I am prepared to go into the wilderness for principles' sake, and I know that there are hundreds upon hundreds of thousands of IFP grassroot members and supporters who are prepared to die for the sake of the principled stand we are taking." He predicted unprecedented resistance ehould the constitution not be amended. The constitution, far from uniting South Africa, "dramatically underlines the conflict between the IFP and African National Congress [ANC]". He added: "I challenge the election that might yet be held under it. I say no to a constitution which is going to spawn more violence than any constitution this country has ever had." Ever more people were being killed in the constitutional dispute and violence would continue to spiral as long as the interim constitution was upheld. Mr Buthelezi said the final constitution would "just be another constitutional instrument for ANC party political power". The IFP and kwaZulu government opposed the interim constitution because it concentrated power in the hands of a ruling political party and did not provide for the dynamic interaction of the country's population and cultural groups in an open working democracy. "It does not recognise the dominance of pluralism in this country, nor does it conform to any of the standards of successful working constitutions in plural societies. Its essential theme is centralism hidden behind cloaks of regionalism or provincialism which just cannot bear proper analytical scrutiny." Mr Buthelezi said mediation in the constitutional crisis was essential to clarify to confused South Africans the validity of arguments for and against it. The IFP's proposed constitutional amendments, which had to be met before it contested elections, were limited to what the party regarded as essential for salvaging the interim constitution from the "partisan hands" which shaped it. These amendments were not aimed at political gain for the IFP, but at reconciliation.
