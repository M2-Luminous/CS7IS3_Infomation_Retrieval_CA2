One of the important objectives of the research on contemporary international development is to focus on work safety and human resources development to ensure that all things originate from, belong to, and serve the people. The human factor becomes the very objective of people's employment. Human resources development covers fundamental factors like work safety, food safety, environmental protection, cultural development ... The nature and objectives of job development projects rest with each individual person's creative and chosen work aimed at happiness for himself and the community. The work force constitutes the most valuable factor of development; the mainstay of knowledge, personality, and ethics; and the essential element of happiness. In addition to the fact that human knowledge is acquired genetically, a person may improve his or her background to an important degree thanks to his or her life experiences. Furthermore, in modern times, owing to the marvelous development of science and technology, human knowledge has played a direct role in production. Employment is part of a citizens' rights and duties. It is also the preliminary condition of the laboring people's subsistence, and covers different forms of activities not prohibited by law and that help bring about gratification and generate income for citizens. The settlement of the unemployment problem must be understood in a new context, as efforts must be made to not limit job development projects solely within the bounds of the social welfare program and of attempts to get rid of the ills of unemployment, underemployment, inefficiency, and low income. Instead, they should be regarded as part of an overall effort to create every opportunity for citizens to enjoy educational opportunities and make better preparations so they may become people of virtue, earn a living, participate in creative work, enjoy the fruit of legitimate employment, have their material and intellectual property rights protected by law, improve their quality of life, seek personal happiness, and contribute to the well-being of the community. Under the system of bureaucratic centralism and state subsidization, the state created jobs for everyone, mainly through the state and collective economies. Citizens were dutybound to work, but did not have the right to create jobs themselves or fully enjoy the fruits of their labor. Generally speaking, personnel recruitment was banned and no incentives were given to encourage people to bring their wisdom or business skills into full play. This led to a situation in which production came to a standstill, with people living in poverty and unable to make ends meet. There were instances in which as much as 10 percent of the population suffered from food shortages. Absenteeism prevailed in the state apparatus. The people were worried. The regime was plunged into a crisis situation. Through the renovation policy, which is aimed at releasing the working class and production forces, a vigorous movement to look for ways of earning a living began in the rural areas and later spread throughout the country, thus completely shifting our nation from unemployment and food shortages to enthusiasm for work and dynamic business and production activities. Many positive changes have been made in everyone's attitude and in other aspects of the national situation. Generally speaking, marked progress has been made in the job market and in the improvement of material and spiritual life. Thanks to creative work and efforts to overcome dangers, the people have become more self-confident. The party-people relations have been consolidated by challenges and shown indications of better quality. Nevertheless, our efforts to resolve the unemployment problem and improve living conditions in the framework of the renovation policy are facing major shortcomings and difficulties. As a result of the heavy impact of the population explosion (2.29 percent) coupled with a growing increase in the work force (3.5 percent per year), about 1.1 million young people reach working age each year. There are of about 2.2 million unemployed people in the cities, nearly 10 percent of the urban population. This ratio is beyond the limit for public security. Urban residents account for 20 percent of the population. This fact constitutes the underlying cause of social vices like prostitution, drug addiction, theft, and robbery resulting in the death of victims ... Most of the unemployed people are youths and 85 percent of them do not have any skills. In the countryside, the average amount of cultivated land per capita is 0.1 hectare, which represents the lowest figure in the region. Meanwhile, the population density is 200 people per square kilometer, which represents the highest figure among agricultural countries. Peasants account for 80 percent of the population, engage chiefly in agricultural production, and receive only about 36 percent of GDP. One wage earner can support only three dependents. In many countries this figure is 20 to 30, and in some countries even 60 or 80. As far as the countryside is concerned, about half of the work force is unemployed and 30 percent of rural families are poor. Worse still, most of those families are social welfare recipients based on the average per capita income earning rate of less than 15 kilos of rice per month. In industry, labor productivity is only 30 percent of the international average, while material and fuel costs are 1.5 to two times greater. Our latent natural resources are very great but our efforts to exploit them are poor. We have 1 million square km of continental shelf, which is three times larger than our inland area; a 3,200-km long coast with hundreds of islands, large and small; 12 million hectares of hills and mountains which are still uncultivated; many border areas; 160 rivers and canals leading to the sea; and a very large area which can be used for aquaculture. Most of these natural resources, however, remain in the form of latent potential. Of striking importance is the fact that we have an intellectual force of over 600,000 cadres with college and higher-education, 400,000 overseas Vietnamese intellectuals, and 5 million war veterans and retired cadres. The total capital of our people, both inside and outside the country, amounts to billions of U.S. dollars. Not much effort has been made to have them invest their money in production. Our capital, a huge asset indeed, is being worn out because of poor business management. Generally speaking, the domestic market, including the labor market, has not been motivated and exploited satisfactorily. Information for the many "input- and output"-related services of various economic components is still very poor. That is why we have not been able to develop our potential to resolve the unemployment issue. This situation has been ascribed to the fact that the starting point for our national development is too low: Our per-capita annual GNP is only around $200, thus ranking Vietnam 156th among the 173 less developed countries. If based on the HDI (Human Development Index, including GNP, and the Cultural and Social Index), Vietnam may rank 115th among those countries. The market economy has taken shape, bringing about tangible results. We are encountering difficulties, however, in changing our economic structure and restructuring economic management and the ownership of various economic components. Political indoctrination has not been closely linked with and has failed to serve as a driving force for economic renovation. Cultural development has also not been blended with economic renovation. Now there is a striking and essential requirement for being consistent in choosing targets and in assessing and using social driving force and the intellectual and material properties of the great national unity bloc for national development and renovation. We must link ourselves with it [the economic renovation task] and through this, develop to the fullest the strengths of science and technology and exploit our advantage as a practitioner who enjoys geographical, political, economic, and cultural, military, and historical advantages as a country in the Asia-Pacific region -- an area with the most dynamic potential for development in the 21st century. We need to resolve these fundamental issues if we are to develop our capability to resolve unemployment more satisfactorily and rapidly. A correct target chosen by our party and people is to realize the socialist ideal. To attain this goal, we need a long, multi-stage process. Therefore, it is important that we pay constant attention to our immediate goal of "building a peaceful, unified, independent, democratic, and prosperous Vietnam" (President Ho Chi Minh's testament) and a prosperous people, powerful country, and equitable and civilized society, bearing in mind a consistent strategic slogan for various stages of development, that is, independence, freedom, and happiness. This slogan of Uncle Ho is inscribed in our national emblem) Our methods to achieve these objectives are: to amass progressive wealth together, progressing from poverty to sufficiency, from humble wealth to greater riches, and to accumulate wealth in all material, intellectual, moral, personality, and emotional contexts. People who becomes wealthy earlier should help others who come later. All national development strategies should have as their main goals the liberalization of labor and production forces, and the use of cultural and socioeconomic efficiencies as criteria for their evaluation. All economic and political establishments, including those of the party, state, and mass organizations, should always strive to diligently do their utmost for national development, happiness, and the prosperous and glorious future of the nation. Henceforth, the party will never hold that it already knows everything, especially when it is a ruling party, but it will always value highly all initiatives from the great national unity bloc in constructing and implementing lines and policies to serve the people. That is also the guiding thought in preventing officialism, coercion, and corruption, and in implementing representative democracy through the National Assembly and direct democracy through the Fatherland Front and other mass organizations. Lack of democracy in combination with improper enforcement of discipline and laws will cause our ideals and objectives to become unclear, and damage the superior characteristics of our regime. These directions, objectives, and methods are the foundation for determining concrete viewpoints and measures in planning and implementing processes to resolve the unemployment problem. We need to confirm the view that the labor force needs to be liberalized, with legal guarantees for all citizens to be free to do business, to amass wealth lawfully, and employ workers in accordance with legal stipulations. We need to remove all prejudices, prohibitions, and hindrances to innovation and development of the citizens' business. We should quickly bring to fruition laws on domestic investment, protection of private ownership and intellectual property, and labor that oblige employers to maintain the welfare of workers and their families. Creation of employment should be based on the development of a multi-sectoral merchandise economy with measures that are diversified, interrelated, cooperative, and competitive between themselves. We need to form a flexible labor market that responds well to supply and demand and that could develop opportunities to create employment in the healthy environment of new moral values and legal codes. Job creation is the core of the issue of ensuring social security and equity during the development process, and is currently the top priority for avoiding a crisis situation. We will not be able to ensure social equity in our economic development if we keep the model of centralized, authoritarian socialism coupled with indiscriminate subsidization. Neither should we pursue economic development regardless of its damage to social equity, as proof of the chaos and degradation in many developing countries. Our economy is developing from a weak starting point, with scant capital and low technology. But we have a strong labor force, so our strategy of job creation must include measures that aim to accelerate economic development while ensuring social equity. Economic sectors and professions which require more labor and less capital such as agriculture, rural industry, light industry, small industry, and handicrafts, should be strongly developed to utilize our advantage of cheap labor and expand exports. Small family and partnership enterprises in cities and the countryside should be expanded. Traditional professions in different villages and city urbans should be restored. Centers for scientific production and research should be established near education centers, universities, high schools, and urban streets and villages to create a new image of linking education with practice, production, and research. We should pay more attention to the urbanization of the countryside and avoid the negative effects of concentrating development in big cities. Regarding industrialization and modernization, we must pay particular attention to rural industrialization as we are modernizing necessary industries such as telecommunications, informatics, biology, oil and gas, renewable energy, and materials .... We must utilize technologies that require less capital and more labor. They do not have to be low technologies. In fact, they can be technologies of high intelligence when we introduce culture into development, when we know how to link intellectuals with workers and peasants in commodity production, and when we know how to adapt, improve, and traditionalize the modern science and technologies and modernize the traditional science and technologies. If we know how to encourage and utilize our abundant national contingent of intellectuals and our intelligent and industrious population with 85 percent literacy, we will able to shoulder this serious undertaking. The strategic direction to solve the unemployment problem lies in rural areas, coastal areas, the 1 million square km of continental shelves, and hilly and mountainous areas comprising three-fifths of our country and 12 million hectares of fallow land. We should supplement and perfect our employment prospecta by providing adequate treatment to intellectuals and artists, retraining workers and managers, and upgrading economic sectors and professions to meet new requirements. We must perfect macroeconomic policies on taxation, land, natural resources, and credit to liberate and develop our potential labor force. We should introduce more policies to encourage citizens and organizations to create more jobs and satisfactorily implement the export of labor. We must consolidate and perfect our system of employment service, our centers for the application and transfer of technologies that provide more jobs, and the employment consultation offices. We must closely supervise our modest national employment fund to direct resources to localities and people with urgent needs for services. We must outline economic development plans to create more jobs practically and sufficiently. Then, we must quickly carry out the plans, avoiding the bureaucracy and formality which requires approval from different levels. We must stop allocating investment capital improperly. Investment capital should be quickly, fully, and directly allocated to create more jobs and develop the economy. In this area, we must strengthen control, quickly correct wrongdoings, and supplement and perfect the necessary tasks. We should perfect our national employment program before introducing it to our annual planning in which directions for the creation of new regions, fields, industries, and professions must be outlined. Our investment should be concentrated on infrastructure to create favorable conditions and environment for citizens and political and socioeconomic organizations to create more jobs. We should pay more attention to the close combination of economy with national security and the economic, cultural, and social development of ethnic communities with programs for the cultural and social development of border areas and programs for the application and development of informatics, renewable energy, new materials, and biology. Work represents the two sources, service and pleasure, of a citizen's happiness. Solving the employment problem is the responsibility of all people, the party, and the political system. It is also a central and urgent task of mass mobilization in national stabilization, renovation, construction, and protection.
