This is an important economic law for improving state macrocontrol, developing a market system, standardizing the practices of fixing prices, promoting open and fair trade, and safeguarding consumers' legitimate rights and interests. Under the situation of the socialist market economy, reasonable market prices and market operation must be based on open, fair, and orderly market competition. At present, the market system is yet to be developed and trade regulations remain imperfect with the result that some businessmen demand exorbitant prices for their goods, cheat customers, and sell bogus goods. The situation in which the quality of goods does not agree with their prices is so serious that it has aroused strong resentment among the general public. According to the "Regulations," all enterprises, administrative and institutional units, and individuals must clearly mark prices for their commodities and services, transaction accounts must be settled in terms of knock-down prices, no goods shall sell at a price higher than the marked price and no surcharges shall be collected, specific items and prices must be listed on invoices, and punishment must be meted out to those businessmen and those units providing service which violate the "Regulations." The regulations will help increase the transparency of prices and make transactions more open. In this way, the malpractice of cheating customers with prices will be curbed to a certain degree, the market will be subject to supervision by the public, the legitimate rights and interests of consumers and operators will be safeguarded, and an open, fair, and orderly market competition will take shape. With the deepening of the economic restructuring, prices for most commodities and services have been open to market forces and thus greatly increased the marketization of the economy. However, freeing prices does not mean the government will refuse to have anything more to do with the market. Rather, the government will exercise indirect and macro-control over the market by economic, legal, and necessary administrative means. Since the "Regulations" will keep the public aware of the process of fixing prices by producers and operators, they will help the government timely and accurately monitor market prices and thus formulate scientific macrocontrol measures, which will guide the operation of producers and operators in the right direction and effect a rational allocation of resources. In the meantime, the "Regulations" will also keep the public aware of the process of fixing service charges by administrative and institutional units so that the government will improve administration and put a end to unauthorized charges. The enterprise is the main body of market competition and the core of market competition is price. Fixing prices in accordance with the "Regulations" will help enterprises have access to information about commodity prices so they will formulate correct price strategies for entering market competition. The "Regulations" will also enable enterprises to learn their strong points and weaknesses through competition in the market to improve management, increase efficiency, and develop the capacity to meet emergencies. The "Regulations" provide consumers with a legal basis for safeguarding their rights and interests, enabling them to compare prices offered by different vendors, and to get good value for their money. Under the "Regulations," the broad masses of the people will supervise the practice of demanding prices for commodities and report any fraud to the government department concerned for investigation and punishment. Governments and departments in charge of prices at all levels must conscientiously implement the regulations and work toward the point where when there is a law it is observed, enforcement is strict, and lawbreakers are prosecuted. All producers, operators, and units providing services must enhance their awareness of the need to abide by laws, consciously observe relevant rules and regulations, and set to others an example of observing discipline and abiding by the law. The broad masses of shoppers are expected to supervise implementation of the regulations. Let us make concerted efforts to implement these regulations to the letter to promote the formation of a market order featuring fair transactions and fair competition.
