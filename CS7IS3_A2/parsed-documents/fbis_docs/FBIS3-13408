The prime minister stressed that the decision was based on a legal statement of opinion submitted by the attorney general and backed by reports from the Shin Bet and the police. When asked whether the cabinet's decision would be upheld by the High Court of Justice, Mr. Rabin said he assumed that the attorney general and the Justice Ministry had ascertained that these steps were legal. Our correspondent Ya'el Ayalon reports that the prime minister was speaking at a memorial ceremony for deceased Israeli presidents and prime ministers. Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu said that movements which promulgated violence should be outlawed. Netanyahu, however, added that there should be legal restrictions limiting the term of such steps to six months in order to examine their effectiveness. NRP [National Religious Party] leader Zvulun Hammer said that the path chosen by the Kahana activists was wrong, asserting that anyone inciting to murder, racism, or the undermining of democracy should be punished. However, Hammer noted, it would be better if such steps were taken by the courts and not by a government with political leanings. Tzomet leader Refa'el Eytan criticized the decision saying that only people who violate the law should be dealt with legally. Labor party secretary Nisim Zvili said that one should not judge the entire settler community on the basis of activities carried out by the extremist movements in the territories. Now more than ever, Zvili said, it was time to establish a dialogue with the settlers so as not to turn them into enemies of peace.
