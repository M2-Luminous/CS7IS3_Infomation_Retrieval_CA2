Last year, there were fund shortages and the center put into effect a series of macroeconomic control policies and measures. In such a general environment, our province, motivated by Comrade Xiaoping's southern inspection remarks and the spirit of the 14th CPC Congress, conscientiously implemented the Provisions, making focused efforts to transform mechanisms and to resolutely adjust the product mix; as a result the industrial economy continued its good momentum of rapid and healthy development: For the year, the total value of output of industrial enterprises at the township level or above provincewide was 56.963 billion yuan, and the sales value of industrial output was 54.419 billion yuan; both figures represented substantial increases over the previous year. The rate of industrial products sold reached 95.7 percent, an increase of 1.2 percentage points over the previous year. There were five gratifying changes in our province's rapidly developing economy: --The growth momentum of heavy industry was strong. Last year the value of output of heavy industry enterprises provincewide increased by 20.3 percent over the previous year, representing a growth rate which was 4.6 percentage points higher than the province's industrial growth rate; heavy industry' share of the province's total value of industrial output increased from 60.5 percent in the year before last to 62.9 percent last year, and the increase in heavy industry's value of output accounted for 78.5 percent of the increase in the province's total value of industrial output. --The nonstate industrial sector grew faster than the state industrial sector. Last year, the total value of output and sales revenues of collective enterprises in the nonstate industrial sector of the province increased by 31.5 percent and 39.1 percent respectively over the previous year. In this respect the total value of output and sales revenues of township-run industrial enterprises increased by 46.8 percent and 55.3 percent respectively; the total value of output and sales revenues of the rest of the nonstate industrial sector increased by 81.9 percent and 97.5 percent respectively. For the same period the total value of output and sales revenues of state-owned industrial enterprises increased by only 10.9 percent and 11.9 percent respectively. --The amount of foreign exchange created by industrial exports increased rather rapidly. Last year the value of industrial exports delivered by the province increased by 27.9 percent over the previous year. In this regard the growth rate for the first half of the year was 16.3 percentage points higher than that for the second half. --Sales revenues of industrial enterprises covered by the budget on the one hand and profits made by those enterprises and taxes paid by those enterprises on the other hand increased in a synchronized manner. Last year, sales revenues of the province's industrial enterprises covered by the budget increased by 30.1 percent, while profits made by those enterprises and taxes paid by those enterprises increased by 27.5 percent. --Industrial production and sales of the prefectures and cities increased on a widespread basis. Last year, except for Tongchuan City, the industrial economy of each of 10 prefectures and cities in the province increased over the previous year; the growth rate of industrial sales revenues of each of seven prefectures and cities was higher than the provincial average.
