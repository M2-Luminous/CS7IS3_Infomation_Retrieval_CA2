FBIS4-55950 "dreeu101_b_94002" FBIS-EEU-94-101 Daily Report 19 May 1994 BULGARIA DPS Accused of Encouraging `Ethnic Separatism' DPS Accused of Encouraging `Ethnic Separatism' AU2405114594 Sofia KONTINENT in Bulgarian 19 May 94 p 4 AU2405114594 Sofia KONTINENT Bulgarian BFN [Commentary by Konstantin Subchev: "A Bosnia in the Rhodopes?"] [Text] However much the DPS [Movement for Rights and Freedoms] as a whole wants to win for itself the humble image of an all-national centrist party, its leaders, through their incautious revelations, are doing everything possible to frustrate these intentions. This time, Osman Oktay let out in Momchilgrad that the DPS should also seize the economic power in the region by appointing its own people as directors of the state enterprises. Accusations of separatism have been poured out against the DPS for a long time now. In the beginning, they came from the extreme nationalists and certain BSP [Bulgarian Socialist Party] leaders, so no one believed them. For too long Bulgarian society has been living with the syndrome of guilt for the "revival process" [forcible name-changing of ethnic Muslims in 1984-85]. However, people gradually returned to their senses, especially following [DPS leader] Dogan's "turn to the left," when even in the SDS [Union of Democratic Forces] people started to see the truth. The truth is simple. No matter what posts the DPS leaders held in the totalitarian structures and what slogans they raised following 10 November 1989, they still remain the exponents of certain regional interests, and they will always act the same. The burned Bulgarian flags and desecrated monuments in the Rhodopes unmistakably prove this. It now remains for them to recapture the last position held by the Bulgarian state in this region. For the DPS, it is of vital importance, because its electorate continues to emigrate in a southeasterly direction. Yet the movement's leaders have done nothing substantial to protect their social and economic interests. Now they have decided that, by appointing their own people to posts in the economic administration, they will manage to deceive their electorate into voting for them again. Of course, the crazy person is not the one who eats the pie offered, but the one who permits this gastronomic prodigality. For far too long, the state institutions have pretended to be deaf and blind to the tactics of ethnic separatism that the DPS is to all intents and purposes practising in the mixed areas in question. In many states that we call normal and extol as models of democracy, Osman Oktay would have long had his parliamentary immunity removed and been charged with treason for making such a statement.
