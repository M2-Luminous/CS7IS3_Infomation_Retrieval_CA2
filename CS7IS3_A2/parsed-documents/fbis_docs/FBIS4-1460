Aldo Ajello noted that the CSC meeting will try to set deadlines for closing down government and Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] assembly areas as well as for winding up the demobilization process. The UN special representative in Mozambique made it clear that he would like to see the whole process concluded in July, even though he agrees that could be done in June as proposed by the National Elections Commission, CNE, chairman. The electoral census is supposed to begin in June. At another point in his news conference, the head of the UN Operations in Mozambique [Unomoz] said he was very happy with President of the Republic Joaquim Chissano's pronouncements in his provincial tours, but he called for there to be consistency between words and deeds. He also disclosed that the Renamo demobilization process is making progress and he added that a list has been delivered containing more than 1,000 names of men supposed to go back to civilian life. That process is scheduled to begin today and be over by 6 May, and Renamo is supposed to demobilize 4,000 of its soldiers. Meanwhile, 4,345 government and Renamo soldiers and officers are undergoing training in Manica, Boane, Dondo, Nacala, and Catembe. The UN special representative in Mozambique also disclosed that $8.163 [figure as heard] million is already in the hands of Unomoz. That money will be used to help Renamo become a political party. It is expected that a further $5.173 million will be given Renamo for that purpose, in addition to funds which may also be allocated by the U.S. and French Governments. The head of Unomoz also said that $2.006 million will be placed with the trust fund [preceding two words in English] for other political parties. He explained that it will be up to Unomoz to manage those funds. He also disclosed that the UN Security Council has sent a list of five international judges to be part of the Electoral Court. Those judges will come from France, Brazil, Nicaragua, Chile, and Portugal.
