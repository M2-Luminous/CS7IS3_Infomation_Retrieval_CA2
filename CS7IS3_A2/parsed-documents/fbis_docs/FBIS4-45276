FBIS4-45276 "jptdd025__l94028" JPRS-TDD-94-025-L JPRS Narcotics 28 May 1994 LATIN AMERICA MEXICO Former PGR Adviser Charges Drug Trafficking Has `Permeated' Former PGR Adviser Charges Drug Trafficking Has `Permeated' All Political Structures PA2905024194 Madrid EFE in Spanish 1302 GMT 28 May 94 PA2905024194 Madrid EFE Spanish BFN [By Julian Rodriguez Marin] [Text] Mexico City, 28 May (EFE) -- Drug trafficking has permeated all Mexican political structures and has corrupted federal, state, and municipal officials who commercialize the application of justice, Eduardo Valle, who resigned from the post of adviser to the attorney general for this reason, has told EFE. When asked by EFE if he is afraid that drug traffickers might make an attempt on his life for making these accusations, he answered: "If they want to kill you, they will. I walk around without protection, without bullet-proof vests or bodyguards." The Attorney General's Office (PGR) was able to obtain the most complete information on drug trafficking in Mexico, but it was unable to eradicate drug trafficking because government structures at all levels are corrupted by drug money, the former adviser said. "Narco-power" has deformed the economy; it is a cancer that has generated economic, financial, and political dependence, which instead of producing goods has created serious problems and distortions ultimately affecting honest businessmen, Valle said. "The struggle against drug trafficking is a problem like physics; there is no absolute vacuum, when one group is eliminated another immediately takes its place," he affirmed. "Narco-power" has permeated the political structure; the three most important drug trafficking groups--the groups of Amado Carrillo, Arellano Felix, and Juan Garcia Abrego--which are accused of approximately 35 killings and about 200 murders, have a bearing on the main decisions of the country, the former adviser revealed. Eduardo Valle, who was a leader in the 1968 student movement and in the Mexican Workers Party, said that no one can knowingly sponsor an initiative against drug trafficking because if he does, he will die. Valle, known in political circles by his student nickname, "El Buho" [The Owl], explained he will leave the PGR without any protection. He has been a federal deputy and president of the Union of Democratic Journalists. "Neither bullet-proof vests nor several bodyguards; my only protection is my fellow journalists," Valle remarked. "I came to the PGR committed to fighting against drug trafficking. Regrettably, I was criticized for that decision, but they must know the problem is not where you are, but what do you do, how committed you are," Valle added. "I came to fight without hesitation against drug trafficking networks, and I am leaving because it is impossible to eradicate these groups, since they have infiltrated all sectors," Valle asserted. He added it would be suicidal and a massacre would occur if there were an attempt to try and enter the domains of the mafia without the support of all police forces. Valle said that at least 10 drug cartels are operating in Mexico, although the most important ones are three that maintain ties with the Cali Cartel (Colombia) and the incipient Peru Cartel. These organizations handle thousands of millions of dollars. The Arellano Felix organization has links to the most important drug trafficking mafias in the world, with Europe, and with the group of Asian nations called the "golden triangle of drug trafficking" (Thailand, Cambodia, and Burma), Valle noted. Drug trafficking organizations have employed government officials at all levels, representatives of the legislative and judiciary branches, and representatives of Mexican security forces, Valle expressed. During the "golden period," between 1988 and 1989, the Matamoros Cartel led by Juan Garcia Abrego introduced six tons of cocaine weekly into the United States. It is estimated over 100 tons were introduced annually. The Matamoros Cartel security chief is former Navy officer Rafael Olvera, "El Rafles," who heads a small army of 70 well-equipped and well-armed men. Pedro Aspe Armella, Mexico's secretary of finance and public credit, has admitted in the United States the influence of drug trafficking in all structures of political and social life in Mexico. "And the secretary came up short, because drug trafficking not only infiltrates the federal government, but also state and municipal governments, as well as national legislative, executive, and judicial branches," the former adviser remarked. Drug trafficking groups in Mexico have grown and handle not only tons of cocaine, but also hundreds of tons of marijuana that are planted throughout the country. Valle regretted that the presidential candidates have not properly addressed this cancer and have not presented a political project proposing an all-out war against drug trafficking. So far only church representatives have demanded an all-out struggle against drug trafficking.
