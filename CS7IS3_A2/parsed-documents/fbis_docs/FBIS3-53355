But only one month after the unprecedented move, differences erupted among the services that were behind the idea. Some say a number of citizens took the weapons to defend themselves against a backdrop of tribal revenge actions, and others stress that some of those who received the weapons sold them to terrorists, bullies, fugitives from justice, and highway robbers. ROSE AL-YUSUF has also learned that those volunteers have not received antiterrorist training. The security agencies gave them weapons and ammunition without telling them what places to guard. The volunteers were only asked to attack extremists wherever they see them--something that did not happen, even in Upper Egypt, which is known for acts of revenge. Those militias were not assigned to guard government facilities or take part in antiterror operations. Indeed, the security services denied that the militias existed, and that only added to the militiamen's confusion. Some People's Assembly and Consultative Council members, and members of local councils in Asyut protested to Asyut Governor Major General Samih al-Sa'id and Security Director Major General Majdi al-Basyuni over the formation of the armed militias, some of whose members have abused the use of their weapons. An official security source told ROSE AL-YUSUF that the security services are now working out a high-level plan to change the dynamics of antiterror operations in Asyut. Most of the equipment and individuals used in these operations have been withdrawn and replaced by forces highly trained in antiterror techniques. A number of police cars have also been replaced with modern vehicles that can easily move in agricultural areas and on mountains where terrorists hide. The source said the plan seeks coordination between Asyut and a number of neighboring governorates to cut off the supply lines for the terrorist groups in Asyut. On the role of the militias in Asyut, the source denied they play any role. The source even denied they exist, although ROSE AL-YUSUF stressed it had seen them and named some people who had actually received weapons. The recent killing of Brigadier General Taha Tu'aymah in Dayrut and the subsequent arrest of terrorist Ahmad Diya' from Suhaj Governorate revealed a new development in the tactics of the terrorist groups in Upper Egypt. Diya's participation in that operation showed that elements from neighboring governorates, especially Suhaj and al-Wadi al-Jadid, are involved in Asyut attacks. Those governorates are used as supply sources for terrorist groups in Asyut, and Asyut terrorists flee and hide there. Ordinary citizens in Asyut are increasingly talking about this, especially since Asyut has the biggest regional university and thousands of students from various governorates, especially in Upper Egypt, go to study there. The attack against Brig. Gen. Tu'aymah was the first of its kind in which terrorists from different governorates took part. In another development, an Interior Ministry team spent five days in Asyut drafting an integrated plan for coordination with neighboring governorates to raid terrorists' hideouts in Asyut, al-Minya, Suhaj, and al-Wadi al-Jadid, and to guard the eastern side of Asyut to prevent infiltration of terrorists via the Red Sea. In the al-Rahmah mosque in Asyut the Friday before last, the Islamic Group members said prayers without making any announcements or statements as they usually do. The mosque preacher asked members of the group to leave the mosque after prayers in small groups to avoid clashes with the heavy security force around the mosque. Not many people attended the prayers. Shops owned by members of the terrorist groups continue their trade activity in Asyut without security interference, although a number of the shops were built along pedestrian streets without a license. The Asyut municipality avoids arguments with the owners and collects taxes in a friendly way, although some of them refuse to pay taxes because they believe it is against shari'ah. Meanwhile, a curfew atmosphere still dominates the cities of al-Qusiyah and Dayrut although the security services lifted the curfew and told citizens they could go out.
