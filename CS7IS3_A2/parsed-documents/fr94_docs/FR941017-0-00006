FR941017-0-00006 FR941017-0-00002 9 CFR Part 92 [Docket No. 94&hyph;080&hyph;1] Specifically Approved States Authorized to Receive Mares and Stallions Imported From CEM-Affected Countries AGENCY: Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. ACTION: Direct final rule. SUMMARY: We are amending the animal importation regulations by adding New Hampshire to the list of States approved to receive certain mares and stallions imported into the United States from countries affected with contagious equine metritis (CEM). We are taking this action because New Hampshire has entered into an agreement with the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service to enforce its State laws and regulations to control CEM and to require inspection, treatment, and testing of horses, as required by Federal regulations, to further ensure the horses' freedom from CEM. This action relieves unnecessary restrictions on importers of mares and stallions from countries affected with CEM. DATES: This rule will be effective on December 16, 1994, unless we receive written adverse comments or written notice of intent to submit adverse comments on or before November 16, 1994. If we receive written adverse comments or written notice of intent to submit adverse comments, we will publish a notice in the Federal Register withdrawing this rule before the effective date. ADDRESSES: Please send an original and three copies of any adverse comments or notice of intent to submit adverse comments to Chief, Regulatory Analysis and Development, PPD, APHIS, USDA, room 804, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782. Please state that your submission refers to Docket No. 94&hyph;080&hyph;1. Submissions received may be inspected at USDA, room 1141, South Building, 14th Street and Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC, between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, except holidays. Persons wishing to inspect comments and notices are requested to call ahead on (202) 690&hyph;2817 to facilitate entry into the comment reading room. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dr. Joyce Bowling, Staff Veterinarian, Import-Export Animals Staff, National Center for Import and Export, Veterinary Services, APHIS, USDA, room 766, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782, (301) 436&hyph;8170. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The animal importation regulations (contained in 9 CFR part 92 and referred to below as the regulations), among other things, prohibit or restrict the importation of certain animals, including horses, into the United States to protect U.S. livestock from communicable diseases. Sections 92.301(c)(2), 92.304(a)(4)(ii), and 92.304(a)(7)(ii) allow certain horses (mares and stallions over 731 days old) to be imported into the United States from certain countries where contagious equine metritis (CEM) exists if specific requirements to prevent their introducing CEM into the United States are met and the mares and stallions are consigned to approved States for further inspection, treatment, and testing. Mares and stallions over 731 days old must be consigned to States that have been approved by the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) as meeting conditions necessary to ensure that the mares and stallions are free of CEM. These conditions, which concern inspection, treatment, and testing of the mares and stallions, are contained in §92.304(a)(5) of the regulations for stallions and in §92.304(a)(8) for mares. New Hampshire has agreed to abide by the State regulations concerning mares and stallions imported from countries where CEM exists, and has entered into a written agreement with the Administrator, APHIS, to enforce its State laws and regulations that meet the requirements of §92.304(a)(5) and §92.304(a)(8) of the regulations, to control CEM. This direct final rule will add New Hampshire to the list of States approved to receive certain mares (§92.304(a)(7)(ii)) and stallions (§92.304(a)(4)(ii)) imported into the United States from countries affected with CEM. Effective Date We are publishing this rule without a prior proposal because we view this action as noncontroversial and anticipate no adverse public comment. This rule will be effective, as published in this document, 60 days after the date of publication in the Federal Register unless we receive written adverse comments or written notice of intent to submit adverse comments within 30 days of the date of publication of this rule in the Federal Register . Adverse comments are comments that suggest the rule should not be adopted or that suggest the rule should be changed. If we receive written adverse comments or written notice of intent to submit adverse comments, we will publish a notice in the Federal Register withdrawing this rule before the effective date. We will then publish a proposed rule for public comment. Following the close of that comment period, the comments will be considered, and a final rule addressing the comments will be published. As discussed above, if we receive no written adverse comments or written notice of intent to submit adverse comments within 30 days of publication of this direct final rule, this direct final rule will become effective 60 days following its publication. We will publish a notice to this effect in the Federal Register , before the effective date of this direct final rule, confirming that it is effective on the date indicated in this document. Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act This direct final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived its review process required by Executive Order 12866. We anticipate that fewer than 20 mares and stallions over 731 days old will be imported into the State of New Hampshire annually from countries where CEM exists. Approximately 200&hyph;300 mares and stallions over 731 days old from countries where CEM exists were imported into approved States in fiscal year 1993. During this same period, approximately 2,228 horses of all classes were imported into the United States from countries other than Canada and Mexico through air and ocean ports; approximately 20,585 horses were imported from Canada; and, approximately 9,676 horses were imported from Mexico. Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Executive Order 12778 This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule: (1) Preempts all State and local laws and regulations that are in conflict with this rule; (2) has no retroactive effect; and (3) does not require administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule. Paperwork Reduction Act This rule contains no information collection or recordkeeping requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq .). List of Subjects in 9 CFR Part 92 Animal diseases, Imports, Livestock, Poultry and poultry products, Quarantine, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.
