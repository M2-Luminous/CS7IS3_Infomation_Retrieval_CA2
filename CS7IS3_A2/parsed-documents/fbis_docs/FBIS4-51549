At an emergency meeting to discuss the yen's recent surge against the U.S. dollar, the ministers concurred on the need to closely watch the developments in foreign currency markets and to keep in touch with nations concerned, the top government spokesman said. They also agreed on the need to smoothly carry out a record 15.25 trillion yen economic stimulus package unveiled in February and seek to pass the long-overdue fiscal 1994 national budget through the Diet as quickly as possible, Kumagai told a news conference. The ministers reportedly agreed the government should come up with more concrete measures to further open its markets by the end of June on the basis of similar steps announced in March. They also reaffirmed the need to chart a course for comprehensive tax system reform by the end of June and push necessary legislation through the Diet by the end of the year, he said. The hastily arranged meeting brought together Prime Minister Hata, International Trade and Industry Minister Eijiro Hata, Koshiro Ishida, chief of the Management and Coordination Agency, Yoshio Terasawa, head of the Economic Planning Agency. Kumagai also attended the gathering on behalf of Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii, who left Tokyo earlier in the day to attend the annual conference of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to be held in Nice, France, from Tuesday to Thursday. Kumagai said the ministers shared the view that the government should spur the nation's sustainable growth led by domestic demand and cope with its massive trade surplus, especially with the United States. The emergency meeting came on the heels of the yen's sharp rise to the 100 yen level to the dollar on overseas markets Friday. In New York, the U.S. dollar closed Friday at 101.55-65 yen after plunging to a postwar low for the market of 100.65 yen. The yen's recovery to the mid-101 yen level to the dollar followed concerted interventions by Japanese and U.S. monetary authorities. It was the first time in eight months that the dollar dipped to the 100 yen level. The dollar plummeted to a historic low of 100.40 yen in Tokyo last August. In London, too, the dollar weakened against the yen, falling below the 101 yen level in afternoon trading before finishing the day at 101.45-55 yen, down 0.40 yen from the previous day's late quote.
