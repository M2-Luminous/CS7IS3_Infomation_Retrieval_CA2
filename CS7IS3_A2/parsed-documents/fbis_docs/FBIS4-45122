A decision to this effect was made by First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets following his visit of the Khimprom company in Chuvashia which used to manufacture chemical shells. The production of chemical weapons was discontinued in the factory in 1987 but the equipment capable of doing so has remained intact. Soskovets and Chuvashia's President Nikolai Fyodorov ordered the compiling of a schedule for the stage-by-stage destruction of the equipment. Viktor Glukhikh, chairman of the State Defense Industry Committee, told Interfax that this decision marked the beginning of a large scale process in the country. The reluctance on the part of the U.S. to sign the appropriate convention might, however, hinder the process, he said.
