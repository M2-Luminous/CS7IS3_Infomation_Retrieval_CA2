The government, Schonbohm added before the parliamentary defense committee, is prepared to negotiate an additional DM160 million for project modifications and extension of the fighter's development phase. On the other hand, it has rejected all other requests, including adjustments for inflation. Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom agreed to develop the Eurofighter 2000 in late 1992, as a (30-percent) less costly alternative to the initially planned European Fighter Aircraft (EFA). They also agreed to postpone the aircraft's production phase. The German defense minister already spurned several manufacturer requests for additional funding last year. The government wants to reach an agreement on the question with participating firms by the end of May, and inform the lower house of parliament, the Bundestag, of the outcome before summer. A Eurofighter prototype made its maiden flight on 27 March, over one year behind schedule. Its official presentation is slated for 4 May. Germany is underwriting one-third of the project's cost.
