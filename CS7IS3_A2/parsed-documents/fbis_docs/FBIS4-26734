The Shanghai Municipal Government has formed a special committee for the project headed by Mayor Huang Ju and leaders of departments such as the agriculture commission, finance and trade office and financial bureau. With the development of the urban economy the land in the suburbs is sure to be developed. To ensure sufficient land for planting vegetables Shanghai has allocated 200 million yuan for the development of 5,000 ha of vegetable land on the city outskirts. Some bases for breeding of pigs, chickens and ducks have also been removed. At present, annually 10,000 tons of high-quality vegetables are supplied to the markets of Shanghai. The scale of livestock raising is growing. The continuous raising of prices through market circulation used to be the main problem for vegetable projects. The city is now taking measures to develop direct sales. Many large enterprises and higher learning institutions are provided with vegetables directly by the vegetable bases. This year the municipal government has invested in the construction of 13 secondary agricultural product wholesale markets. The Shanghai Municipal Government has made a rule that in every district and street, within 300 m to 500 m, there must be at least one vegetable market. The mayor said that the new "vegetable basket project" must be completed within three years.
