The warplanes, built by the U.S. McDonnell Douglas Corporation, are called A4M Skyhawk jet attack planes, according to the NEW YORK TIMES. The plane is regarded as a very effective in a dogfight because it has a small turning radius. But State Department officials said the subsonic Skyhawks would be no match for the supersonic British Tornados stationed on the Falkland Islands and thus pose no threat to the security of the islands. Of most importance to the United States was that the sale of the planes would help preserve the balance of power in the southern part of Latin America, the newspaper said. The U.S. officials said that with the sale of the Skyhawks, Argentina, Brazil and Chile would have roughly equal air strength.
