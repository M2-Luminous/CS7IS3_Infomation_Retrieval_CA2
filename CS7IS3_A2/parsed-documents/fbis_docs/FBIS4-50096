State Department Spokesman Mike McCurry told a news briefing that it was clearly "an illegitimate act by this rump group in Haiti." The Haitian military arranged for their allies in parliament to install on Wednesday 80-year-old Supreme Court Justice Emil Jonassaint as that country's head of state to replace exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. The Organization of American States (OAS) issued on Wednesday night a strong declaration condemning the Haitian military's action as "contrary to the majority will of the Haitian people." "Any action taken by the illegitimate government, including any call to elections, will be deemed entirely invalid," the declaration said. McCurry said the OAS declaration is "a united statement on behalf of the hemisphere which categorically rejects the actions that have been taken by this rump group in attempting to install an illegitimate provisional president in Haiti." "I think the standing of the UN Security Council resolutions in effect," he said. "The purpose of the world community is to restore President Aristide and restore democracy to Haiti." "That is the purpose of the sanctions that have been in place and that are now going to be put in place in an even stronger fashion," McCurry added.
