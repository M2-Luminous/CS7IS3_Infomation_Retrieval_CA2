Rogozhin said his committee's leadership knew of the accident at the 4th reactor of the Zaporozhskaya nuclear power station in Ukraine on January 12 only five days later from a fax from the European Nuclear Society HQ in Switzerland to Moscow. Rogozhin said Russia received information on the accident on the Ignalina nuclear power station in Lithuania only from the press. He pointed out that failures to provide the necessary information to the Russian Goskomatomnadzor by former Soviet republics run counter to the official agreement between the nuclear supervision organizations which was reached shortly after the break-up of the Soviet Union. According to Rogozhin, the Ignalina nuclear power station was equipped with reactors of type RBMK-1500, which are identical to those that were installed in Chernobyl. With the lack of information, it is difficult to speak of the maintenance of nuclear safety. Rogozhin pointed to the fact that reactors functioning now in former Soviet republics are made in Russia, and Moscow must be fully informed of even the most insignificant accidents.
