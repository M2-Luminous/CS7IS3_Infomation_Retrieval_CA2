Witnesses reported isolated clashes early Saturday in the south of the capital between militiamen loyal to opposition leader Bernard Kolelas and troops of President Pascal Lissouba. A commission under Defence Minister Raymond Damase Ngollo formed to mediate a solution to the crisis was in contact with both camps, officials said. But the officials added that the commission had failed to set up direct negotiations, although both sides said they were not in favour of a "military solution" to the standoff. The negotiations are being flagged as a forum for opposition and pro-Lissouba forces to agree on the make-up of a government of national union to end a seven-month crisis sparked by disputed general elections last year. The clashes have killed an estimated 110 people in Brazzaville since the beginning of December. [passage omitted covered in referent item] Opposition forces say they favour the national unity government, provided the results of a judicial inquiry into 58 calls for the annulment of voting in certains constituencies from the June 1 first round of polling onwards are published. The elections eventually returned a majority of 65 pro-Lissouba candidates, reversing the previous make-up of the 125-seat legislature. Opposition forces believe the balance of power could shift again after the inquiry publishes its findings. They are scheduled to be released in February. Clashes after the first round which claimed some 30 lives forced the suspension of polling. Voting resumed in October after both sides reached agreement in August to set up the inquiry. But violence flared again in November, when around 50 died during fresh bloodshed in the capital. The fighting has had a disastrous effect on Congo's already weakened economy, with opposition barricades forcing the closure of the rail link between Brazzaville and the port of Pointe-Noire, the country's main trading centre.
