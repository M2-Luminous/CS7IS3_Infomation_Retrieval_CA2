However, in his celebratory speech held in Pisino, in the heart of Istria, Croatian President Tudjman did not resist the temptation to fire point blank on Italy, the Italian minority in Istria, and Istrian autonomist aspirations. Speaking of the Italian minority in Croatia, Tudjman said that most of its members had collaborated with the Fascist regime, although he acknowledged that some Italians had joined the struggle waged by the partisan forces which, however, had been led from Croatian territory. He did not say a word about native Italians or the Istrian exodus, but added another threatening, retaliatory sentence: "Democratic Croatia favors cooperation with a democratic Italy, and will respect the rights of the Italian ethnic group in accordance with international conventions, but we request the same rights to be recognized for the Croatian minority in Italy, from Trieste to Molise, a minority which is larger than the Italian minority in Istria."
