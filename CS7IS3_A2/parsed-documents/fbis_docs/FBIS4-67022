FBIS4-67022 "jptdd019__l94084" JPRS-TDD-94-019-L JPRS Narcotics 22 March 1994 WEST EUROPE UNITED KINGDOM Statistics on 1993 Drug Seizures Published Statistics on 1993 Drug Seizures Published 94WD0328A London THE DAILY TELEGRAPH in English 22 Mar 94 p 6 94WD0328A London THE DAILY TELEGRAPH English CSO [Article by Neil Darbyshire, crime correspondent: "Amphetamine Seizures Rise by Over 300 Per Cent"] [Text] Almost a tonne of amphetamine tablets and powder were seized by police and customs last year, according to the National Criminal Intelligence Service. At least half the total of 995 kilos was seized by customs officers, an increase of 342 per cent on 1992. But the majority of the 5,000 individual seizures were made by police inside the country. Although 90 per cent of the drugs were manufactured in Continental Europe, particularly Holland, illicit amphetamine "laboratories" were uncovered in Britain. It is now estimated that one in 10 people aged 16-29 has tried amphetamines at least once. While amphetamines and cannabis remain the most frequently misused drugs, crack cocaine is the one most closely associated with extreme violence. Crack users and dealers committed 10 murders and 21 attempted murders in London alone last year, according to an NCIS survey. Police are also concerned about the increasing use of injected steroids. While not illegal, there were many examples of users committing rape, extreme domestic violence and other forms of serious assault. Other seizure figures were: Cannabis customs officers seized 53,145 kilogrammes of cannabis, up 19 per cent on 1992, while police discovered 5,600 kilogrammes, a rise of 21 per cent. A relatively new and highly potent form of cannabis known as "skunk" is becoming much more widely available, police said. It is up to 30 times as powerful as normal cannabis resin and produces a strong hallucinogenic reaction. Cocaine seizures fell sharply. This was largely due to the statistically distorting effect of two extra large seizures in 1992. Demand was not thought to have dropped. Customs officers seized a total of 750 kilos, a fall of nearly 70 per cent from the 2,250 kilos recorded during 1992 which included two of about a ton each. Police seized about 20 kilos, a rise of 28 per cent on 1992. Crack seizures are becoming more widespread outside London, making up about 50 per cent of the seizures at street level. The weight of seizures rose by more than 90 per cent to 2.8 kilos, a new record. Heroin seizures rose by a quarter to 560 kilogrammes, another 120 kilogrammes was seized on the streets, an 88 per cent rise largely influenced by a single seizure of 37 kilogrammes in London. The average street purity was about 28 per cent, with the most common cutting agents being paracetamol and caffeine. The latest figures for addiction related to 1992. They show an increase of 19 per cent on the previous year with a total of 24,703 registered addicts, of whom 9,663 were newly notified. Twelve per cent were addicted to cocaine. LSD seizures fell by 11 per cent. But the total still amounted to 275,000 doses.
