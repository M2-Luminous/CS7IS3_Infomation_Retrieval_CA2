According to the Polish president both countries are natural allies along the road to European integration. Walesa emphasized that there were no historical burdens between the two countries. He recalled that the Polish government had never recognized Latvia's annexation by the Soviet Union, thanks to which Polish-Latvian relations could simply be resumed in the autumn of 1991. The basis for good Polish-Latvian cooperation is the inter-state treaty signed in July 1992, but according to Walesa this needs to be filled with concrete substance. In his view there is need for direct contacts between people. The president stressed that Poles resident in Lithuania were our country's natural ambassador in Latvia. He expressed his satisfaction with the fact that the Latvian authorities have guaranteed the possibility of unrestricted development and preservation of national identity for the Polish minority. Among others Walesa met were parliamentary chairman Anatolijs Gorbunovs. The schedule of the Polish president's visit to Riga calls for further meetings with the ministers of defense and of foreign affairs, and another meeting with President Guntis Ulmanis.
