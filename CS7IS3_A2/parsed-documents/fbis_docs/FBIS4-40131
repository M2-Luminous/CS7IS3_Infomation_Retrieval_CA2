For the Georgian people, this date represents the apogee of one of the great historical stages of the centuries-old national-liberation movement and, at the same time, is an eternal symbol of the restoration of the Georgian sovereign democratic republic and Georgian statehood. On this day, Georgian statehood was restored. Today, on this great anniversary, I congratulate all Georgia's citizens. The Georgian nation has created one of the oldest civilizations in the world. The history of Georgian statehood goes back to time immemorial. Therefore, it was wholly logical that a new Georgian democratic state and a new Georgian constitution should be born and the renaissance of the Georgian soul firmly established at the end of the 20th century. We are celebrating 26 May this year in a particular concrete historical situation. Different forces assess this situation in different ways. However, there is one truth that cannot be disputed: Today, we are at the stage of a critical development of a democratic state and society; more precisely, at the transitional stage from crisis to stability. In this situation, in spite of the difference of views, the domestic and foreign policy of the Republic of Georgia, Georgia's geopolitical location, and its role and significance in the Transcaucasus and the Caucasus, Near Asia, the Black Sea region, the CIS space, and throughout the whole world are being increasingly strengthened and improved. Georgia is today a full-fledged member of the community of peoples of the world. During the last two years, many historical trends have taken shape that correspond to the impulse of 26 May. Today, I would like to emphasize only some of these. In the economic sphere, the process of dismantling the totalitarian economic system of reforms and establishing a market economy has become irreversible, a process that is being steadfastly implemented by the state system -- the Cabinet of Ministers, parliament, and local municipal bodies of power and administration. A fundamental governmental anti-crisis program and social and economic development programs up to the year 2000 have been elaborated on the basis of an edict of the head of state. Following the edict of the head of state and discussion on a wide scale, the national program for overcoming the crisis was approved by a decree of the Cabinet of Ministers. This program was assessed positively by the IMF, the World Bank, the European Bank [for Reconstruction and Development], and many other international organizations that have promised us help in implementing it. It is now important that the program is transformed into reality. We believe that the formation of a market economy signifies faithfulness to the ideas of 26 May, the creation of a free autonomously functioning economy, and the basis for political, constitutional, and state independence. The bodies of state power -- the government and parliament -- are implementing planned special measures in order to strengthen the exchange rate of the coupon and carry out financial and economic reforms in the banking system. Unfortunately, inflation and hyperinflation and other negative factors are hindering the efficiency of economic reforms. Taking into account historical genesis in the sphere of reforms, we have an extremely interesting picture. Inflation and hyperinflation in 1918-21 [years of Georgian independence] undermined the economy of the first Georgian republic and its monetary unit, the boni. Unfortunately, in our contemporary republic as well, the temporary monetary unit -- the coupon -- is having a difficult time; the paralysis of the economy is the principal reason for its devaluation. It seems that it is not so easy to form a national currency, national finances, and a national economy. It was difficult at the beginning of the 20th century and is likewise difficult today at the end of this century. However, the main thing is that we have the basis for social and political optimism. I am sure that, in a year's time, when an independent democratic Georgia will again be celebrating the national holiday of 26 May, we will be faced with a different picture in the national economy that will have already been considerably revived. This will be facilitated by the implementation of a wide-scale anti-crisis national program, balancing the budget, financial reform, the creation of a state treasury, wide-scale privatization, the formation and development of small, medium, and large business, our alliance with the IMF, World Bank, European Bank [for Reconstruction and Development], CIS, and countries in the Black Sea basin, credits and investments and humanitarian aid from other international organizations, the United States, Germany, France, Ukraine, Russia, and many other countries, and other types of economic relations that are being formed on the basis of a market economy and the principles of international law. The state and private sectors of the economy will exist in the transitional period, but both sectors will function only according to market principles; monopoly will be excluded and free competition and free enterprise and commerce will be firmly established. These will be some of the principal directions of our economic strategy. Taking into account the achievements of national and contemporary world civilization, political strategy and state reforms have been implemented during the last two years with a mixed degree of success and in the face of resistance, but always along a firm democratic course and inspired by the ideas of 26 May. We frequently say that the contemporary Georgian republic is the successor of the first Georgian republic of 26 May 1918 and this thesis is correct. This political formula is manifested, first and foremost, in our devotion to the ideas in the 1921 Constitution and to its essence. The constitutional law on power and the 1921 Constitution are in force today. However, these two fundamental documents are unable to fill the "constitutional and legal vacuum." They require amending and improving, taking into account Georgia's dynamically changing internal and international situation and the achievements of national and world constitutionalism. The interests of state construction and political strategy call for an improvement in the structure, functions, and activities of parliament, the government, ministries, departments, and central and local bodies of power. New steps need to be taken in the branch of state reforms. During the last two years, in accordance with the demands of democratization, constitutionalism, and the specific nature of the transitional period, parliament, the government, and local administrative structures have changed and all such changes that have been carried out have been based upon the interests of the people. The Georgian Parliament is the symbol of 26 May, of national and state independence and freedom and democratization and no matter how difficult and complicated it may be to administer its activities, no matter what kind of crisis it involves, we have to tolerate and improve its activities. I firmly believe that the future path of the nation will run along the foundations of democratic development. Parliament has adopted many laws. The market economy, a rule-of- law state, and a civic society are acquiring a solid legal base. At the same time, all factions in parliament, the opposition, and the parliamentary majority or minority should be aware that national energy and intellect and the nation's ability and spiritual culture should not be wasted aimlessly; it should have more constructive pathos than it has today. Unfortunately, the contemporary stage of parliamentary development, at times, assumes a destructive character; there are often confrontations and violations of regulations and parliamentary ethical norms. There is no need for confrontation between different branches of the national movement and political duels between factions in which forbidden ploys are used. History assigns everyone and everything to his and its proper place. We should make a distinction between the oral declaration of national statehood, on the one hand, and its real construction on the other. It is necessary to implement constitutional reforms. Let us begin by examining either the whole or parts of the draft constitution. According to the new Constitution, a new parliament and a system of executive power will be created and judicial power and local municipal bodies of administration and power will be formed alongside legislative and executive power. One of the main events during the last two years has been Georgia's entry into the CIS; the beginning of the building of new relations with Russia. Joining the CIS is necessary for Georgia so that it can attain in reality precisely the ideals of 26 May. Without joining the CIS, it is impossible to overcome the economic crisis and settle ethnic conflicts and restore the country's territorial integrity. Therefore, no matter how unpopular the adoption of this or that decision may be, if the necessity of its adoption has been scientifically substantiated, the state and the government should adopt such a decision and patiently explain to the people the correctness of that decision. This action is dictated by historical inevitability and national interests. Joining the CIS does not mean in any way that we will be paying less attention to the development of relations with western countries, the United Nations, the IMF, CSCE, the European Union, the alliance of Black Sea countries, and other international organizations. Our country is and will be an independent, national, and sovereign state. The social sphere and the social protection of citizens is the most burning issue confronting our reality. Man is the measure of everything. Man is the supreme philosophical and political value. This forms the very basis of our democracy and humanism. Therefore, care for the individual necessitates the creation of a humane rule-of-law state and civic society and three basic directions form the cornerstone of our policy: a market economy, a rule-of-law state, and a contemporary civic society. Democracy, freedom, sovereignty, and the supremacy of the Constitution and the law -- this is our path toward the future. All this is being created for man; therefore, the protection of man's civil rights, including social rights, at the level of the demands of contemporary civilization, is our most important task. Unfortunately, today, we have a budget that is not balanced and a catastrophic budget deficit. By covering the deficit with bank credits, we are causing a further deepening of the economic and financial crisis. The appropriate social funds and a different environment providing effective infrastructures have not been created. Therefore, it should be clear that the social protection of the population is greatly lacking. Alongside hundreds of thousands of unemployed, we have up to 300,000 refugees and displaced fellow countrymen. They need to be looked after and helped, but we do not have enough provisions and resources. The humanitarian aid sent by our foreign friends is a factor of great significance, but it is impossible to live in constant hope of charity. There are also deficiencies in the distribution of this aid; we are implementing emergency measures to eradicate these. Ninety percent of the republic's population is living below the poverty line. The coupon has almost lost the function of money and, in conditions of inflation and hyperinflation, wages, grants, and pensions suffice for only two or three days. The main thing now is to resolve the problem of the national currency, improve finances, emerge from the economic collapse, resolve the energy problem, be prepared for next winter, and provide the essential minimum for the population. It is precisely this that is our main concern. Central and local authorities and administrative bodies have elaborated an extensive national security program that is acquiring a new content. This means not only maintaining a basic standard of living but also improving the quality of life in the future. Today, however, at the present stage, it is necessary to overcome the danger of starvation and poverty and ensure that the population is provided with the minimum amount of consumer goods. A new system of national security signifies that the nation, the state, and each citizen is provided with political, legal, economic, financial, demographic, ecological, military and many other types of protection. Certain achievements have been attained in strengthening our defense capability, forming an army and navy and border and internal troops, and in their combat, professional, and moral training. Georgia's defense capability has been considerably strengthened following its entry into the CIS. The CIS and NATO member countries will help us in the creation of our Armed Forces. At the present stage, the Ministry of Defense and the command nucleus of the Armed Forces have been changed and strengthened; the new cadres have been supplemented with general officers and an officer corps; conscription call-up is proceeding better; national military and naval academies have been opened; an experienced general has been appointed as new [defense] minister; a large part of the bandit armed formations have been disarmed and the disarming of other formations is continuing; a single modern army and navy are being created that will be subject to a single military doctrine and iron discipline, and directly subordinate to the defense minister and the commander in chief of the Armed Forces-head of state. Not only the Army, Navy, and border troops but also the other power structures of the state are developing dynamically and growing in strength; the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the State Security Service are improving their activities and also the Ministry of Justice, the court, and the Procurator's Office that represent the strong backbone of state power. The new Constitution will form a new system of power structures -- ministries and departments -- at a more democratic and civilized level; it will improve further their combat ability and efficiency. Judicial power is being formed on the basis of the new Constitution. Judicial reform is being implemented. This will be a big step forward along the path of the division of power and the construction of democratic institutions. As a result of the effective, comprehensive, and integrated functioning of power structures, it has been possible to prevent a wide-scale civil war, defuse to a certain degree the criminal situation, disarm criminal bands, and strengthen the struggle against such particularly dangerous crimes as murder, kidnapping, rape, theft, burglary, banditry, armed robbery, drug addiction, the drugs business, and so forth. All of this does not have only legal and criminal significance. Stability creates the preconditions for attracting capital from abroad and its effective investment in the Georgian economy. This requirement is demanded of us by all serious businessmen, bankers, financiers, and investors in the world who are attracted to Georgia by favorable conditions that have already been created in legislation, a relatively cheap work force, completely unexploited resources, and a whole range of other factors. From the point of view of adopting a new constitution, state- territorial organization, and economic development, the settlement of ethnic conflicts acquires vital importance, as does the restoration of Georgia's territorial integrity. During the last few months, many things have been done to settle the Abkhazian conflict by peaceful means. One should point out the certain positive results of the bilateral Georgian-Abkhazian negotiations in Geneva and Moscow, the efforts of the UN and the Security Council, and the positive role played by the CIS, the Russian Federation, and a number of other states in resolving the Abkhazian conflict. We have seen a turning point and change in favor of Georgia's territorial integrity and the restoration of Georgian constitutional jurisdiction on territories that have been temporarily occupied. In the near future, there will be the first big flow of refugees and persecuted fellow countrymen returning to Abkhazia under the aegis of the United Nations and with the constructive participation of Russia. CIS member states and the Russian Federation will fulfill an even more constructive role regarding this problem. The so-called "South Ossetian" conflict in Shida Kartli [area of Georgia historically comprising six regions into which South Ossetia was reincorporated under its historical name of Samachablo by the government of ex-President Gamsakhurdia] needs to be resolved. Conditions have now been created for political and diplomatic activity; the Georgian-Ossetian conflict will definitely be resolved taking into account the interests of Georgians and Ossetians. I would not say that the world today is divided into spheres of influence between the giants of the East and West, between the superpowers, but one thing is clear: When the sun shines, a shadow is nevertheless cast somewhere on the earth. This refers with specific logic to certain regions. The signing of the large package of treaties on friendship and cooperation between Russia and Georgia during Batoni [Georgian polite form of address] Yeltsin's visit to Georgia was a great event. I believe these are viable treaties as they contain the rational balance of interests of two independent sovereign countries. We should improve our democracy and multiparty system and firmly establish the achievements of modern world party and political science in our party and political life. Many political parties are playing a positive and constructive role in parliament, the parliamentary majority, the press, and radio and television while, on the other hand, there are many that are forming a destructive opposition and negative public opinion.... New political parties and political movements have appeared on the scene and it is significant that one of these is the Union of Georgia's Citizens that is trying, through specific actions, to bring economic, social, and political stability to society, implement an anti-crisis program, correctly forecast the parameters of economic and social development, and actively participate in carrying out cardinal economic and social reforms. The Union of [Georgia's] Citizens is a party that advocates reforms and this is stated in its policy document "Market Economy, Rule-of-Law State, Civic Society." I agreed to become the chairman of this political movement precisely because it aims to implement radical reforms and the implementation of cardinal democratic reforms represents my political credo. I also want to say here that I initiated [the ruling] that the chairman of parliament should not participate in parliamentary elections on behalf of any party. This was already correspondingly reflected in the rules of parliament. However, many things subsequently changed. Parliament adopted a law on state power that is already in force, the institute of the chairman of parliament-head of state was established, and the necessity arose of creating such a party that would form one of the supports of the government's state policy so that the head of state, when requiring full agreement and support, from the point of view of the consolidation of society, the country's salvation, and determining new domestic and foreign policy, would not find himself hanging in mid air, as they say. At the same time, the Union of [Georgia's] Citizens favors close cooperation with all progressive political forces. Today, 26 May, I want us to extend the hand of accord to one another. Our united efforts will bring greater benefit to Georgia than our separation from one another. Let us be together; let us love our nation, language, motherland, and faith; let us love our fellow man and render the greatest service to mother Georgia. This is a reliable criterium today for [gauging] service to one's country and patriotism. The national state idea should unite and bond a society that has been dismembered into parties according to political ideas. Today, as never before, we need the unity of people and power, mutual understanding between parties, parliament, the Cabinet of Ministers, and local authorities and administrative bodies and their support and the unification of a fractured national consciousness. Democratic Georgia is the motherland not only of Georgians but also of people of all nationalities and faiths and all the republic's citizens. The Republic of Georgia is concerned with protecting the language and cultural development of all peoples living on its territory and their political rights. The motto of the sovereign Georgian state is: People should save culture and culture should save people. We often say: Georgian culture is a unique phenomenon. Unfortunately, in conditions of a market economy, particularly in the transitional period, when there is hyperinflation and a growing budget deficit that is not being covered by reviving production but by loans taken by the government from the National Bank, the state does not have the means to grant big sums and subsidies to science, education, the arts, the press, radio, television, and culture in general. However, there is no other way; certain sums should nevertheless be found so that Georgian literature and arts, music, cinema, theater, painting, architecture, and all branches of material and spiritual culture can again blossom. This is the immediate concern not only of the authorities but also of patrons, sponsors, large, medium, and small business, free entrepreneurs, farmers, traders, well-to-do compatriots, and representatives of national business; it is a subject of concern for the private and state sectors of the economy. It is interesting that the Committee for the Salvation of Georgian Culture is doing effective work; international contacts in the scientific, cultural, and educational sphere should be extended. We should utilize in every way the experience of countries that have an advanced market economy in the sphere of creating cultural funds. We should save Georgian culture and science and education. The epoch of the spiritual revival of the Georgian nation -- a new renaissance -- should be established once more. The state policy of reforms cannot be changed. This is the road to our salvation. Parliament, the Cabinet of Ministers, all ministries and departments, local bodies of power and administration, all city halls, sakrebulos [administrative boards], and all rayon and village gamgebeli [administrative board chiefs] should be reformist in their form, essence, and activities. There is no alternative to the policy of reforms. It is necessary that all regions and centers unite and form a cohesive whole on the basis of a single strategy and tactics and that there be a consolidation of people and power at all levels around the policy of reforms. This year, on 26 May, the sovereign Republic of Georgia will hold a military parade and the newly-born national Army will be on view. This is the Army that has to protect Georgia's sovereignty, its borders, its freedom, and all its historical achievements. The 26 May parade and celebration will be a state demonstration of the new Georgian forces that are undergoing organizational development. Dear fellow countrymen! I congratulate you on the great national holiday of 26 May and wish you health, happiness, and success. God give us hope! Tomorrow will be better than today. God bless mother Georgia now and forever!
