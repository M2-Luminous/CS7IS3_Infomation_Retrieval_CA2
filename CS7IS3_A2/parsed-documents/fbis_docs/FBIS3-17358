The statement refers to those moves as an effort to aggravate the political crisis with a coup d'etat as its final aim. The opposition forces, says the statement, are fighting under the same formula as they did during the Communist regime, that is, "the worse the better." However, if in the struggle against the empire this formula contributed to achieving independence, today, it threatens the existence of independence. A process of destruction began in Georgia much earlier than the present leadership came to power. An unfortunate heritage was left to this leadership: War in the Tskhinvali region and in Abkhazia, a provoked civil war, an integration of the interest of enemies and traitors, a military defeat, a series of subversions and sabotage. Despite all the current difficulties, the government has been trying to bring the country out of the crisis. It has achieved a breakthrough in the international isolation. As a result Georgia has become an active member of the international community and a part of various international political and economic structures, established strategically significant international relations, restored political and economic links with Russia, and other countries. The above-mentioned is, actually, only the beginning of bringing the country out of the crisis. And the establishment of stability in the country is the only condition for the revival of the country's economy. Representatives of the parliamentary majority call against the creation of the government crisis, prove their constructive attitude toward the confirmation of the Cabinet of Ministers, and regard as unacceptable the issue of cardinal changes in the government due to the lack of an appropriate basis. Members of the parliamentary majority appeal to the opposition parties to reach a consensus, considering efforts to discredit the head of state and the Cabinet of Ministers as unacceptable in essence, for it could lead to chaos in the country.
