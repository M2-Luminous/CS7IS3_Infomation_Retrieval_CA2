A news conference devoted to the results of the visit was held at Boryspil airport. Our correspondent Yuriy Horban has the details. [Horban] Aside from Valeriy Shmarov, the delegation comprised high-level officials from the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Machine-Building, and Defense Industry and Conversion, as well as of the National Space Agency of Ukraine. As the deputy prime minister noted, the wide range of issues discussed in the United States primarily included Ukraine's joining the international convention controlling the proliferation of missile technologies and equipment, and its implementation of provisions stemming from START I. Also discussed were possibilities for cooperation in the power industry, particularly, in nuclear power engineering and the conversion of defense enterprises. Summarizing the negotiations held in the United States, Valeriy Shmarov said the following: [Begin Shmarov recording] There is a certain degree of success in our cooperation with the United States -- its recognition of Ukraine as a partner. The U.S. Administration noted in a joint statement that Ukraine has become a reliable partner. There is no attitude of, as the saying goes, an elder or stronger brother -- regular work based on parity is being carried out instead. Regarding our cooperation in RKRT [expansion unknown], we signed a memorandum. For the U.S. side, it was signed by Vice President Gore, from ours, I was commissioned to sign it. The memorandum virtually opens for Ukraine the possibility to conduct studies, as well as to launch production and operation in the space-missile industry. This is very important. I believe that it is a very important document that makes it possible for our state to use and develop its potential. A second aspect important for the future is that, having analyzed the implementation of commitments stemming from the tripartite declaration [on nuclear disarmament] and the START treaty, the U.S. and Ukrainian Governments issued a joint statement, in which Ukraine's actions and consistency in nuclear disarmament were praised. The fact that the United States announced in the joint, bilateral statement that all missiles pointed at Ukraine will be retargeted by 30 May, I regard as our important achievement; not only political but also a practical achievement. Regarding conversion, pilot projects were assigned, and one of the projects -- concerning cooperation between the Westinghouse and Kharprom corporations -- has already been signed, meaning that the first step toward real cooperation has been taken. In general, I would say that we have begun real work in all directions of our cooperation, meaning that we are moving from political intentions toward practical cooperation. [end recording]
