The study group will be comprised of experts and representatives from various media industries, ranging from newspaper, broadcasting and cable television to telecommunications. They will examine, for instance, how those industries can share access to optical fiber communication networks, and discuss charges for their use, the officials said. Rules for new participants in the multimedia services will also be examined, they said, adding that existing regulations on telecommunications and broadcasting industries should also be reviewed. In May, an advisory committee to the posts minister submitted a report urging legal preparations for the upcoming multimedia era, which will inevitably reshape the media industry.
