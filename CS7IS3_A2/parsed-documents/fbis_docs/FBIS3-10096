We espoused this commitment by principle, and in pursuit of our interests. By principle, because one of the priorities of the international community in which Argentina, within its reach and possibilities, now plays a leading role undoubtedly consists in preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. In pursuit of our interests, and thanks to this policy (and within the framework of the transformations our country is carrying out), Argentina is regaining trust and credibility. And this is translated into a reduction of the so- called Argentine risk, a decline in the cost of loans, an increase in investments, and access to sensitive technology that had been banned for us. Without the nonproliferation policy, Argentina would be described today as an outcast country, estranged from the Western world from a political, technological, and economic viewpoint. Changes in the international political system and in the progress made by great powers to achieve disarmament have modified public and political stances on the acquisition of nuclear weapons, and have contributed to creating a closely-knit atmosphere in the sphere of nonproliferation. The international community has become fully aware that the acquisition of nuclear weapons jeopardizes international peace and security and mankind's survival. Proof of this is that at the beginning of 1992 the UN Security Council declared for the first time that the proliferation of weapons of massive destruction constitutes a "threat to international peace and security." Within this framework the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) signed in London, Moscow, and Washington on 1 July 1968, and effective since 5 March 1970, is considered to be the bulwark of nonproliferation. This international legal instrument enables nonnuclear states to freely confirm that they renounce nuclear weapons in a formal and internationally binding way. Moreover, by observing the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards, they can prove that such a commitment is faithfully honored. This has been the path so far taken by some 160 countries -- South Africa, which has an important nuclear program, followed this example. Only 30 states, including Argentina, have not adhered to the NPT. Not long ago President Menem officially expressed his decision to join this important international instrument in the future. This bears direct relation to and is the culmination of the path taken by our government, which enabled the issuance of Decree 603/92 on the control of the exportation of sensitive material, signing the Quadripartite Safeguards Agreement between Argentina, Brazil, the ABACC [Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control of Nuclear Materials] and the IAEA, establishing the ABACC, joining the Tlatelolco Treaty, and participating as an observer to the group of nuclear supplying countries, of which it will soon become a member. It should be pointed out that by virtue of the Quadripartite Agreement and the Tlatelolco Treaty, our country meets all the requirements established by the NPT. The signing of the NPT will earn our country international confidence and openness in our nuclear activities, and will contribute to consolidating the international high standing we have built up for ourselves concerning nonproliferation. Besides, it will facilitate and boost the exchange of new technologies with countries that are more developed in this area. It will also enable us to have greater clout when the renewal of the NPT is discussed next year, so as to be able to include more stringent provisions for the disarmament of nuclear countries. And above all one must not lose sight of the fact that the current nonproliferation system is based on an international treaty (NPT) signed by the majority of states. This means that nonproliferation cannot be effectively imposed only by powerful states or suppliers of nuclear technology and materials, but rather by the experience and action of the international community in its entirety.
