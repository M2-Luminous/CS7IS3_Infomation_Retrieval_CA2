ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: Under the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992, the Secretary is required to establish housing goals to direct the purchase of mortgages by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) and the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) on: housing for low- and moderate-income families; housing located in central cities, rural areas and other underserved areas; and housing meeting the needs of and affordable to low-income families in low-income areas and very low-income families. By Notices published on October 13, 1993, the Secretary established housing goals for 1993 and 1994. This final rule temporarily extends into 1995 the 1994 housing goals that were established by the Secretary for Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. The Secretary will soon propose regulations that will include adjusted housing goals for 1995. When these new 1995 goals are established by final regulation, the 1994 goals extended through this action will be superseded for the remainder of the year, i.e., the new goals will be established ``short year,'' so that the Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae are not expected to perform under the new goals for the entire year. The goals shall be applied using the same requirements set forth in the Notices of Interim Housing Goals and as clarified subsequently by the Department. EFFECTIVE DATE: December 30, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Justification for Final Rulemaking In general, the Department publishes a rule for public comment before issuing a rule for effect, in accordance with its own regulations on rulemaking, 24 CFR part 10. However, the Administrative Procedure Act (see 5 U.S.C. 553) and part 10 provide for exceptions from that general rule where the agency finds good cause to omit advance notice and public participation. The good cause requirement is satisfied when prior public procedure is ``impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.'' (24 CFR 10.1) The Department finds that good cause exists to publish this rule for effect without first soliciting public comment, in that prior public procedure is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to public interest. The rule merely ensures that housing goals are established under which the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and the Federal National Mortgage Association (together, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are referenced throughout this text as ``Government-Sponsored Enterprises'' or ``GSEs'') will be accountable for carrying out their statutory and charter responsibilities. A critical need exists to ensure continued applicability of housing goals pending the establishment of new housing goals through notice-and-comment rulemaking. The Secretary currently is in the process of issuing a proposed regulation that will establish housing goals from the date established when such regulation becomes final, some time in 1995. That final regulation will replace this rule. Accordingly, the housing goals extended through this rule will only apply to that portion of 1995 that precedes the effective date of that rule. This Rule This rule extends the housing goals for the GSEs' purchase of mortgages on housing for low- and moderate-income families, housing located in central cities, and housing meeting the needs of and affordable to low-income families in low-income areas and very low-income families. The housing goals being extended were established by the Secretary and promulgated as Notices of Interim Housing Goals (58 FR 53048 and 53072; October 13, 1993). The requirements of the Notices, including any clarifications issued by the Secretary, will also apply to the housing goals continued for 1995 by this action. For the housing goals for low- and moderate-income families and for housing located in central cities, this rule extends the Notices' goals into 1995. Accordingly, the housing goal for each GSE's purchases of mortgages financing housing for low- and moderate-income families is 30 percent of the total number of dwelling units financed by each GSE's mortgage purchases. For central cities, the housing goal for each GSE's purchases of mortgages financing housing located in central cities is 30 percent of the total number of dwelling units financed by each GSE's mortgage purchases. These goals shall apply on a proportional basis for that portion of 1995 before permanent goals are established and effective following rulemaking.
