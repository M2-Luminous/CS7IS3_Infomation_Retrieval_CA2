FR941128-2-00162 FR941128-2-00085 Equity securities issued by any Project Parent to a person other than AEP or Resources may include capital shares, partnership interests, trust certificates, or any of the foregoing. Non-recourse debt securities issued to persons other than AEP or Resources may include secured and unsecured promissory notes, subordinated notes, bonds, or other evidence of indebtedness. Securities issued by Project Parents may be denominated in either U.S. dollars or foreign currencies. The amount and type of such securities, and the terms thereof, including interest rate, maturity, prepayment or redemption privileges, and the terms of any collateral security granted with respect thereto, would be negotiated on a case by case basis. However, AEP and Resources state that any note, bond or other evidence of indebtedness issued or sold by any Project Parent will mature not later than 30 years from the date of issuance thereof, and will bear interest, if such note, bond or other indebtedness is U.S. dollar denominated, at a fixed rate not to exceed 6.5% over the Applicable Treasury Rate, or at a floating rate not to exceed 6.5% over the Prime Rate, and, if such note, bond or other indebtedness is denominated in the currency of a different country, will bear interest at a fixed or floating rate which, when adjusted for inflation in such country, will not exceed 10% over the Applicable Treasury Rate or Prime Rate. The application-declaration states that AEP will not sell any Shares, and neither AEP nor Resources will incur any indebtedness or issue, or have a Project Parent issue, any guarantee, if the gross proceeds of all outstanding Shares and the principal amount of all such outstanding indebtedness and all such outstanding guarantees authorized hereunder would exceed $300 million. New England Electric System, et al. (70&hyph;8475) New England Electric System (``NEES''), a registered holding company, and New England Electric Resources, Inc. (``NEERI''), its wholly owned, nonutility subsidiary company, both of 25 Research Drive, Westborough, Massachusetts 01582, have filed an application-declaration under sections 6(a), 7, 9(a), 10 and 12(b) of the Act and rule 45 thereunder. NEERI proposes to enter into a joint arrangement with Separation Technologies, Inc. (``STI''), the developer of a process for separating unburned carbon from coal ash. In connection with this joint arrangement, NEERI will be called on to invest in STI projects and to provide certain consulting services to STI. Applicants-declarants state that STI has developed a system of economically separating unburned carbon from coal (or fly) ash produced by utility generating plants. The separated carbon can be reburned by the utility. The processed ash can be sold as a cement substitute in the manufacture of concrete. As part of its joint arrangement with STI, NEERI proposes to enter into a project with STI involving the processing of coal ash at an electric generation facility in the New England/New York region (``NE/NY Project'') owned by a nonaffiliated electric company (``Owner''). NEERI proposes to invest $700,000 in the NE/NY Project in return for a percentage of the NE/NY Project revenue stream. In addition, NEERI will provide to STI consulting services for a fee. STI will be responsible for processing the ash at the Owner's facility. NEERI proposes to enter into similar joint arrangements with STI at other locations where STI equipment will be installed. NEERI's investment in these other utility locations is anticipated to range between $0.5 and $2.0 million per installation. NEERI and STI also propose to perform research to further refine the carbon-rich and low carbon processed waste stream and to find other applications for the STI separation process in recycling. NEES proposes to provide additional financing to NEERI by making capital contributions up to an additional $11.7 million and/or by lending to NEERI from time to time additional amounts not to exceed $11.7 million at any one time, such loans to be in the form of non-interest bearing subordinated notes. The aggregate amount of all investments (including amounts previously authorized by the Commission) by NEES in NEERI shall not exceed $13.95 million. Louisiana Power & Light Company (70&hyph;8487) Louisiana Power & Light Company (``LP&L''), 639 Loyola Avenue, New Orleans, Louisiana 70113, an electric public-utility subsidiary company of Entergy Corporation, a registered holding company, has filed an application-declaration under Sections 6(a), 7, 9(a), and 10 of the Act and Rule 54 thereunder. LP&L proposes to issue and sell up to an aggregate principal amount of $565 million its first mortgage bonds (``Bonds'') to be issued and sold in one or more new series from January 1, 1995 through December 31, 1996. Each series of Bonds will be sold at such price, will bear interest at such rate and will mature on such date as will be determined at the time of sale. One or more series of Bonds may include provisions for redemption or retirement prior to maturity, including restrictions on optional redemption for a given number of years. LP&P may determine to provide an insurance policy for the payment of the principal of and/or interest and/or premium on one or more series of Bonds. LP&L further proposes to issue and sell, from January 1, 1995 through December 31, 1996, one or more new series of its preferred stock, cumulative, of either $25 par value or $100 par value (collectively, the ``Preferred''). The total aggregate par value of shares of those new series of the Preferred issued will be up to an aggregate principal amount of $110 million. The price, exclusive of accumulated dividends, and the dividend rate for each series of Preferred will be determined at the time of sale. LP&L may determine that the terms of the Preferred should provide for an adjustable dividend rate thereon to be determined on a periodic basis, subject to specified maximum and minimum rates, rather than a fixed dividend rate. The terms of one or more series of the Preferred may include provisions for redemption, including restrictions on optional redemption, and/or a sinking fund designed to redeem all outstanding shares of such series not later than thirty years after the date of original issuance. LP&L proposes to use the net proceeds derived from the issuance and sale of Bonds and/or the Preferred for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, the possible acquisition of certain outstanding securities. LP&L states that it presently contemplates selling the Bonds and the Preferred either by competitive bidding, negotiated public offering or private placement. LP&L also proposes to enter into arrangements to finance on a tax-exempt basis certain solid waste, sewage disposal and/or pollution control facilities (``Facilities'') at Unit No. 3 of its Waterford Steam Electric Generating Station in the Parish of St. Charles, Louisiana (``Parish''). LP&L proposes, from time to time through December 31, 1996, to enter into one or more installment sale agreements and supplements (``Agreement''), pursuant to which the Parish may issue one or more series of tax-exempt revenue bonds (``Tax-Exempt Bonds'') up to an aggregate principal amount of $65 million. The net proceeds from the sale of Tax-Exempt Bonds will be deposited by the Parish with the trustee (``Trustee'') under one or more indentures (``Indenture'') and will be applied by the Trustee to reimburse the Company for, or to permanently finance or refinance on a tax-exempt basis, the costs of the acquisition, construction, installation or equipping of the Facilities. LP&L further proposes, under the Agreement, to sell the Facilities to the Parish for cash and simultaneously repurchase the Facilities from the Parish for a purchase price, payable on an installment basis over a period of years, sufficient to pay the principal of, purchase price of, the premium, if any, and the interest on Tax-Exempt Bonds as the same become due and payable. Under the Agreement, LP&L will also be obligated to pay certain fees incurred in the transactions.
