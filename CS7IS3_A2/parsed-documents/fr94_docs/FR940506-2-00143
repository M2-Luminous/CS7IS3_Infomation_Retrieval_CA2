Bando shall not guarantee any borrowings of the SBIC or SBL Subsidiaries, nor shall Bando enter into any express or implied agreement that is the functional equivalent of such a guarantee, including any agreement that will ensure that the SBIC or SBL Subsidiaries has a tangible net worth of a specified amount.

Immediately after the issuance or sale of any class of senior security by Bando or the issuance or sale of any such notes or evidences by the SBIC or SBL Subsidiaries, Bando, the SBIC Subsidiary, and the SBL Subsidiary on a consolidated basis, and Bando and the SBL Subsidiary individually, shall have the asset coverage required by section 18(a), except that, in determining whether Bando, the SBIC Subsidiary, and the SBL Subsidiary, on a consolidated basis, and the SBL Subsidiary on an individual basis, have the asset coverage required by section 18(a), any borrowings by the SBIC Subsidiary or any borrowings by the SBIC Subsidiary or any borrowings by the SBL Subsidiary from Bando, for purposes of the definition of ``asset coverage'' in section 18(h), shall be treated as indebtedness not represented by senior securities. The Bankruptcy Remote Subsidiary will not issue senior securities. 6.
