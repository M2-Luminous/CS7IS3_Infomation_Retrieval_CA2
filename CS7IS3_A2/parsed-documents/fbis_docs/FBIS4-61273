Kozyrev gave an exclusive interview to an ITAR-TASS correspondent. "The agreement signed yesterday [between Israel and the PLO]," he said, "is a good start for the next stage of Middle East settlement. Equally strenuous work is ahead, that is, implementation of the signed document, which will raise many issues, for a new authority means new problems. But we will assist in this, too. "We stressed very clearly our vital interest in this region which is close to us. Russia therefore will participate in the peace process in the future, too. We are already thinking about the next steps in further developing the Palestinian-Israeli settlement and in other areas. We will pay special attention to the Syrian aspect. "Russia intends to develop in every possible way its bilateral relations with all the countries in the region, first of all with Egypt. Boris Yeltsin's message was received by President Mubarak warmly and with understanding. Now, without delay, we will start preparing for his forthcoming official visit to Moscow. "Also, we will develop relations with Israel. Yesterday evening, after the signing, I had a meeting with [Israeli Prime Minister] Rabin which was geared toward strengthening our contacts established during the Israeli premier's recent visit to Moscow."
