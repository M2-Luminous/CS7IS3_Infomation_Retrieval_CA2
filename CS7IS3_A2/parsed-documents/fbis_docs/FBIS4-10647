The leader of that organization, the American Union Party (PUA), Dr. Ernesto G. Messina, denies knowing the confessed assassin of Luis Donaldo Colosio, but he explains: "Mario Aburto Martinez is a great patriot and a great Mexican because he saved the country from the continued dictatorship we are experiencing and which we are trying to disguise as a democracy." Documents obtained by local reporters and special correspondents covering the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta, attribute to Gabriela Gonzalez, cousin of Graciela Gonzalez, the alleged girlfriend of Mario Aburto, statements to the effect that the confessed murderer used to visit a white building located between Madero and Revolution Streets. After exhausting various possibilities involving the location of that building, it was decided that it was the building that houses the clinic of the plastic surgeon who wrote the book entitled Mexico-United States of America Union: Worldwide Revolution. Approximately eight years ago, Messina became a public figure when he decided to place a U.S. flag in front of his clinic on the first floor of an old building on Madero Street, between Third and Fourth Streets; he painted the last stripe on the flag green. He also disclosed that his clinic was the headquarters of the American Union Party and shortly after that the book, the title of which we mentioned earlier, went on sale. Also in 1992 Messina was involved in a controversy when "to protest against fiscal terrorism, anti- democracy in Mexico and police repression," he had a three-colored flag placed on a pole that projected from his clinic, but he had the national coat of arms removed from it. This final action cost him a complaint for violating the symbols of the fatherland, and he had to go to the 4th Penal District Court every week to sign a document. He quoted Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa, who in his book The Fish in the Water justified any means of ending a dictatorship wherever it might exist; within this context, he said that Aburto did not assassinate Colosio out of hatred or because Luis Donaldo Colosio was the person, but because "he personified the dictator's unilateral designation [dedazo]." Mario Aburto, he said, is a patriot because he acted against a dictatorship, regardless of its nature. That is what does the greatest harm to the country and the world. The crime Aburto perpetrated, he argued, is justifiable because we are living in a dictatorship; it would have been objectionable if he had done this in a democracy as happened in the case of John F. Kennedy. Messina said that Colosio's confessed assassin was never a member of his organization, but he would have liked very much if he had been because "he is a brave man who put his life on the line. He knew he could have been killed and despite this he did it in view of the inefficiency of the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] candidate's security guards." Regarding the possibility that Aburto acted alone, Dr. Messina trusts this is so because "we should not undermine his discernment capabilities. As you can see, that is what was said of Chiapas; that they were ignorant Indians who had certain rights and no more, and see what happened. They organized and how are they now?
