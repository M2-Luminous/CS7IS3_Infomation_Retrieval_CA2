FR941216-2-00154 FR941216-2-00090 MCC believes the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 17A of the Act in that it promotes the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions. MCC's procedures setting forth the shortened time period for transferring accounts are appropriate because they properly reflect the changes set forth by the NYSE and NSCC in their efforts to enhance automation of the transfer process. In addition, the revised procedures are consistent with the Commission's effort to reduce the settlement cycle as required by Rule 15c6&hyph;1 7 which mandates a three business day settlement cycle for most broker-dealer transactions effective June 7, 1995. 8 7 For a complete description of Rule 15c6&hyph;1, refer to Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33023 (October 6, 1993), 58 FR 52891 [File No. S7&hyph;5&hyph;93] (adopting Commission Rule 52c6&hyph;1). 8 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34952 (November 9, 1994), 59 FR 59137 [File No. S7&hyph;5&hyph;93] (change of effective date of Rule 15c6&hyph;1). (B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition MCC does not believe that the proposed rule change will have an impact on or impose a burden on competition. (C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants or Others MCC has not solicited or received comments on the proposed rule change. III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A)(iii) 9 of the Act and pursuant to Rule 19b&hyph;4(e)(4) 10 promulgated thereunder because the proposal effects a change in an existing service of MCC that does not adversely affect the safeguarding of securities or funds in the custody or control of MCC and does not significantly affect the respective rights or obligations of MCC or persons using the service. At any time within 60 days of the filing of such rule change, the Commission may summarily abrogate such rule change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. 9 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A)(iii) (1988). 10 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4(e)(4) (1994).
