Keigo Ouchi, chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), said, "We should create a strongly united grouping to support new Prime Minister Hata." He said he wants to see a new bloc to be established among such parties as Hata's Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], Japan New Party (JNP) and New Party Sakigake [Harbinger]. Ouchi made the call in a meeting of DSP legislators. Shinseito, the JNP headed by the just-resigned former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, and the four-member Kaikaku no Kai of a parliament group in the lower house decided to join the new bloc, named "Kaishin (Innovation)," party sources said. However, Sakigake head Masayoshi Takemura, the chief cabinet secretary in the Hosokawa cabinet, rejected the scheme. Some 130 lower house members are expected to take part in the new group, including splinter groups that recently left the opposition Liberal Democratic Party, such as New Party Mirai and the Liberal Party.
