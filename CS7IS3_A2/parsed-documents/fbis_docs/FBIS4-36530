Parliamentary sources have revealed to AL-HAYAH that al-Majali told the deputies in a closed session held the evening of the day before yesterday that "there is an agreement of views" between the United States and Syria on the main lines of a settlement, "but Israel still has reservations regarding al-Himmah triangle which Syria considers to be its own." The sources quoted al-Majali as saying that Syria "is requesting that the triangle be given back to it on the grounds that it had belonged to Syria since 1938." Al-Majali said Egypt considers the triangle, known as "the Palestinian Golan," to belong to the Palestinians, and therefore negotiations on it should be between Israel and the PLO, according to parliamentary sources. Al-Himmah triangle is located at the point where the territories of Syria, Israel, and Jordan meet (north of the Jordanian kingdom). Al-Majali also revealed that there is a border dispute between Jordan and Syria, and another dispute over water quotas, although he did say that relations are "at their best." At the secret session of the House of Representatives, al-Majali also revealed that, during King Husayn's recent talks with President Hafiz al-Asad in Damascus, Syria asked of Jordan a level "higher than coordination" in their bilateral relations. The parliamentary sources interpreted the Syrian request as a call for some form of integration or unity. The sources told AL-HAYAH that al-Majali told the deputies that the reply to Syria was briefly that Jordan "believes in coordination provided relations are not based just on slogans and emotions but rather on reason and a scientific approach." He also said a Syrian delegation headed by Prime Minister Mahmud al-Zu'bi and including Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' will visit Amman on Saturday [11 June] for the meetings of the Syrian-Jordanian Higher Committee, which will be meeting for the first time since the Gulf crisis to discuss development of economic and political bilateral relations. He told the deputies that Syrian-Jordanian relations are at their best, with the exception of "some problems" related to water quotas and border posts. The parliamentary sources said Jordan is still urging Syria to stop exceeding its share of water from al-Yarmuk River. It is worth noting that Israel is also taking a part of Jordan's share in the Jordan and al-Yarmuk rivers. The same sources said the border dispute is over a Syrian request to replace al-Ramtha border post with a border post in the area of Jabir on the border between the two countries. Jordan agrees to the introduction of a border post in Jabir, provided the border post at al-Ramtha remains. The prime minister also said King Husayn contacted the Syrian president the day before yesterday, and the latter confirmed that the Syrian delegation will arrive in Amman on Saturday. The sources quoted al-Majali as saying that the Syrians are still refusing to participate in the multilateral negotiations "to avoid discussion of the issue of water rights, particularly our rights to water controlled by Syria." Reviewing Jordanian-Palestinian relations, al-Majali expressed Jordan's displeasure with Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat's procrastination, failure to coordinate with Jordan, and disregard for Jordanian interests. The parliamentary sources also quoted al-Majali as saying that "we talk a lot about Palestinian coordination with Jordan, which we seek and hope for, but in practical terms it is nonexistent." He pointed out that the Palestinian coordination committees "come for a meeting every time his excellency President 'Arafat comes, and we explain the situation clearly and underline the seriousness of the matter for us both, and point out that coordination does not mean that we would lead or dominate them...." He added: "We thought that, by virtue of our experience as a state, we were qualified to help and aid them in their affairs as they are about to build their own entity...but President 'Arafat always insists on speaking in generalities, and he ignores details and the work of the (joint) committees." Al-Majali added that when the PLO sent Ahmad Quray' (Abu-al-'Ala'), head of the PLO Economic Department, to Jordan with the aim of arriving at an economic agreement after the Palestinian-Israeli agreement was signed in Paris; "an agreement was reached, but they postponed the signing...and that remains the case to this day." He said that, in his view, what is going on now "is an attempt to drag (Jordan) along, in that the Israelis and the Palestinians reach agreement and then drag us along. We categorically reject that." He added: "In the past, we excused them because their attention was focused on survival, symbols, and sovereignty and they had no time to discuss details...but at the latest meeting we told them that there will be no excuse after today and that we care about our own interests as they do about theirs...and that if we decided to work alone that would harm them more than it would harm us." Commenting on al-Majali's statements, Deputy 'Abd-al-Karim al-Kabarati, speaking on behalf of some of his colleagues, said he supports the general policy of the government in its endeavor to protect Jordan and its interests "proceeding from constant Jordanian principles and adapting to regional and international changes and to the realities on the ground so that Jordan may continue to be a player and not become just a playground as its enemies want it to be." On Jordanian-Palestinian relations, al-Kabariti said "inasmuch as we are eager to save as much as we can of the elements of unity between the two banks (of the Jordan River), and although I believe that we should lay down the basis and rules for building future unitary relations between the two states, God willing, equally, we should not allow these genuine feelings to prevent us from carefully examing President Abu-'Ammar's ['Arafat's] policies and his extreme indulgence in tactics at the expense of strategy to the point of ignoring the historical and geographical facts which link our two peoples and countries, and even his clear insistence on moving in the opposite direction to these facts...." Al-Kabariti urged the government "not to be embarrassed to talk about this matter in detail, and to let all the informational, political, and popular forces participate in a balanced and objective way. The public should be reassured that we resolutely and sincerely turn our attention to Palestine and its interests without the slightest interst in hegemony or control but without that undermining our determination, above all, to protect Jordan's interests, particularly its security, future, and economy, and without becoming captives of courtesies, meetings, and minutes which are the prevailing order these days." Twenty deputies spoke during the closed session which lasted about three hours. They covered the various issues raised by the prime minister.
