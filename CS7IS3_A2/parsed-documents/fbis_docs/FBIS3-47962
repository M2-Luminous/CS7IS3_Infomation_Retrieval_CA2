The Keidanren expects the government to take measures without interruption, said Hiraiwa, who visited this western Japan city to attend a meeting of regional business leaders. No effective economy stimulus measures have been taken since Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa took office last August, he said. He urged the government to reduce corporate taxes along with income tax cuts in view of flagging corporate expenditures. Hiraiwa said it is inappropriate to discuss employment security and wage hikes as a matter of option. Both are important problems and the Keidanren will continue to make efforts to realize both, he said. Hiroshi Saito, vice chairman of the federation and chairman of the world's leading steel maker Nippon Steel Corp., who was present at the meeting, called for income tax cuts at least two years ahead of a consumption tax hike. He proposed the floating of national bonds to secure funds for the tax cuts. It is confusing to talk about pump-priming measures and a revision of the tax system in the long run at the same time, he said.
