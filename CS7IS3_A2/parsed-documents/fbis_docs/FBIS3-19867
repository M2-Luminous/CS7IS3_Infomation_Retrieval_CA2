It is us, those you already know, almost all of us. We hope that we will have just as many readers, from whom we have received touching demonstrations of affection and solidarity during these months of forced silence. I think that none of them, seeing IL GIORNALE today--as its editor (the real one) wanted it, of course--can still have any doubts over the necessity, in which we found ourselves, to leave it. These words are by no means intended to be controversial: to each his own ideas and above all, his own style. Ours induces us to immediately clarify certain points to those readers who will want to follow us. The first concerns the shareholders of LA VOCE. Upon leaving IL GIORNALE I swore to myself in public: "Never again an owner." There are no owners here. The ownership is divided among 100 or so shareholders none of whom, by statute, can hold more than 4 percent. First among these are all of us: the editorial staff, clerks, messengers, drivers. But anyone can become a shareholder as of now with one or more 500,000 lire shares: All he must do is submit an application and he will become a "partner" in LA VOCE. This shareholding has been defined by the high ranks of the financial world as being a "ragamuffin" because of its dustheap nature. We do not dislike this term: At this time it is better to stay among the rags than among the kickbacks. The second commitment to our readers is our independence from any political force, even if we will have to opt for one of these on 27 March and everybody is asking us--by letter, telephone, on the street, to the point of being asphyxiating--which it will be. This is a matter that we will begin to face tomorrow, but we can make a premise: Even if we do succeed in formulating one, it will be a preference with a condition. A recent experience, which we do not want to repeat, gave us firsthand experience in the incompatibility of our way of being with the manners of the politicians and their palace, with whom we do not want to have anything to do. (The author thinks that he has already demonstrated this by refusing to go and occupy one of the more comfortable seats.) No preliminary question of sympathy or ill will can succeed in breaking up our equidistance from the forces in the field and from their representatives. If, for example, the Knight [Berlusconi nickname] were to line up with the positions that long before being his were and remain ours, by giving up that man of providence attitude that takes away any credibility from his big words, we will give him a loyal hand. We intend to do this solely as free men and journalists and not as the master's clerks and buglers. Who knows if the master will see the difference. But I think the reader will appreciate it. Third commitment: The language. I do not know if there are still Italians who can distinguish between firmness and virulence and who prefer calm reasoning and talk to shouts and invectives. I doubt so, given the triumphant audience reached by the Olympics of charlatanism and scurrilous language that television in particular--public and private--delights us with in the evening. However, whether they are few or many, we will address ourselves to these readers in the hope that they will appreciate us. This is why we chose this masthead. At the beginning of the century LA VOCE, thanks to its founder Prezzolini, was an arena, not only of great culture, but also of high journalistic civility. We do not aspire to reaching this level but are resolute in honoring the name, primarily in style. Postscripts. In order to be on the newsstand before 27 March, LA VOCE bet the Guinness Book of Records with its two month preparations. Our readers should pardon any starting defects: We will correct them as we go. Second. LA VOCE will not be published on Mondays and will cost 1,500 lire. We are the first to regret this. But, since we can only count on our own resources, we had no other means of balancing the accounts. We hope that our readers will find that the quality of the product compensates for the higher price.
