We learned that Eloy Cantu Segovia, the federal government's official spokesman in San Cristobal de las Casas, will give a news conference. He told us, as we reported to our listeners moments ago, that Jorge Madrazo Cuellar, president of the National Human Rights Commission, would visit San Cristobal. We will give details of Madrazo's news conference later. He reported that there were clashes overnight, that clashes continued at about 0400, especially in the mountain areas near San Cristobal de las Casas. It was also reported that the rebels managed to corner a squad that was attacking these law violators, but the Mexican Army rescued them. Cantu admitted that there are still areas where uncertainty prevails. The rebels continue to operate out of and to hide in houses, as was the case in Ocosingo. Members of the Zapatista National Liberation Army [EZLN] are hiding in houses there and holding its occupants hostage to protect their own lives. He said that the bodies of 20 EZLN members were found in Ocosingo. According to the observations and estimates we made on 4 January, the EZLN sustained more than 30 dead here. Cantu added that the rebels have sustained 61 dead so far. This is the figure registered by the Mexican Army, which managed to arrest 34 subversives. As for Jorge Madrazo Cuellar's visit here, Cantu said that the priority is to ensure a respect for human rights and the civilian population. He added that greater guarantees will be granted to reporters to allow us to perform our work. Cantu also reported that in a few hours there will be shipments of food, potable water, and food to the residents of Ocosingo, which will mark its fifth day under siege, so to speak, or amid clashes. Cantu profoundly regretted the incidents involving our fellow reporters who were sent here. He added that each incident will be investigated. We will now hear Jorge Madrazo Cuellar, president of the National Human Rights Commission, during his news conference. Madrazo said that he came with other officials of this commission to register complaints and reports on human rights violations during the clashes. Madrazo reaffirmed that each of these reports will be investigated, because human rights are respected and guaranteed in Mexico. He added the following: [Begin Madrazo recording, in progress] ...in Tuxtla Gutierrez. We initially responded to a request to help in evacuating tourists from the conflict area [words indistinct] I am accompanied in this work brigade by the first general inspector, the third general inspector, experts on criminology and forensic medicine, and personnel who are involved in investigations and communications. At this juncture of the conflict the National Human Rights Commission's work will focus on offering support to civilians who have nothing to do with the armed confrontation. The commission will also register all existing evidence on alleged human rights violations. The investigation and the report on conclusions will take place within the terms established by the Constitution and the Basic Law of the National Human Rights Commission. [end recording] These were the highlights of developments that occurred on 5 June in San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas State.
