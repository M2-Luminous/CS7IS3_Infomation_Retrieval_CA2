Let me remind you that during his visit to Hungary Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin signed an agreement under which processed nuclear fuel from Hungarian nuclear power stations is to be brought to Russia, for which our country is to be paid $40 million. Here is a report from our correspondent. Correspondent Yevgeniya Novikova: Russia is still receiving radioactive waste from foreign nuclear power stations under international agreements once concluded by the Soviet Union. This concerns only those stations that were built by the Soviet Union on its neighbors' territory, and with which appropriate agreements were concluded. According to Greenpeace, processed nuclear fuel is currently stored on the territory of combines in Chelyabinsk and Krasnoyarsk, where the ecological situation has already caused a high incidence of radiation sickness and oncological diseases among the population.
