But they appear to have raised more queries than they resolved. What is clear is that the UN staff imposed certain aspects of the measures upon the experts, in such a manner as to make what were supposed to be technical questions ridiculous precisely from the technical point of view. In general, the UN staff appear to have bent over backwards to meet every conceivable Turkish objection, to the extent of proposing sheer impracticalities. This is most obviously so concerning the experts' economic proposals. Why do they state that in the area of Varosha to be resettled by the Greek Cypriot owners there should be no banks? Why do they say that monetary transactions there will be in foreign currency? It is difficult to conceive how Varosha can be resettled and developed fully to the benefit of Greek and Turkish Cypriots if it is not integrated into the economy of Cyprus. Varosha could act as a bridge between the economies of the northern and southern parts of the island. But the Cyprus Pound would have to be a crucial feature of this process. The Cyprus Pound should be the main currency of the area, not simply because it is the currency of the Republic of Cyprus, but because Turkish Cypriots want to have access to the Cyprus Pound. It is the strongest unifying force on the island. For years, Turkish Cypriots have had to suffer the rapid devaluations of the Turkish Lira. But over the last week or so they have had to put up with a wildly fluctuating Turkish currency that has thrown trade into chaos. Confidence in the Turkish Lira is zero, and Turkish Cypriots have been screaming for a return to the Cyprus currency. Why, then, should the UN intervene and say not All reasonable people on both sides of the buffer zone would like to trade with the Cyprus pound as the main currency. Does the UN listen only to unreasonable Turkish Cypriots? The UN proposals are also invalid from another point of view. It is proposed that the laws by which Varosha will be governed are those in force prior to the withdrawal of the Turkish Cypriots from government in 1963. The Cyprus Pound was the legal tender at the time, so why exclude it from Varosha now? Similarly, there were a number of Turkish Cypriot and Turkish banks operating at that time. They are still recognised by the Central Bank of Cyprus, so it should be possible for the banks that were operational in 1963 to function in Varosha. One way out of the currency mess would be for the UN to say that both the Turkish Lira (the currency used in the Turkish-occupied north of the island) and the Cyprus Pound could be used in Varosha. This would satisfy Turkish sensitivities, while in practice everyone would be free to use the Cyprus Pound. The ridiculous proposals put forward by the UN experts simply reduce the credibility of the whole process. The experts should be presenting suggestions to the UN which guide the world body towards political solutions that can work. it is a two-way process that requires interaction of ideas. Unfortunately, the UN seems to have imposed political solutions on technical questions, and this just leads to odd proposals. It's a bit like the old saying about computers: "If you put rubbish in you get rubbish out."
