FR941202-2-00034 FR941202-2-00019 Office of the Secretary Garbage Discharges From Navy Ships in MARPOL Annex V Special Areas AGENCY: Department of Defense. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: Under Section 1003 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994, Public Law 103&hyph;160, the Secretary of Defense must report annually in years 1994 through 2000 on the amount and nature of garbage discharges from Navy ships operating in special areas, when such discharges are not otherwise authorized under Annex V of the International Convention on the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL). This notice is published to comply with the act and is the first annual report. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Louis Maiuri, Office of the Chief of Naval Operations Environmental Protection, Safety and Occupational Health Division, Crystal Plaza # 5 Room 678, 2211 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, Virginia, 22244&hyph;5108, 703&hyph;602&hyph;2562. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The International Convention on the Prevention of Pollution from ships (MARPOL), 1973, as amended by the MARPOL Protocol of 1978, protects the ocean environment by prohibiting some discharges altogether, restricting other discharges to particular distances from land, and establishing ``special areas'' within which additional discharge limitations apply. Special areas are particular bodies of water which, because of their oceanographic characteristics and ecological significance, require protective measures more strict than other areas of the ocean. Within special areas that are in effect internationally, except under emergency circumstances the only authorized garbage discharge from vessels is food waste. At present, three special areas are in effect: the North Sea, the Baltic Sea, and the Antarctic Region. Section 1003 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994, Public Law 103&hyph;160, 107 Stat. 1745, established deadlines for compliance by U.S. Navy ships with the Annex V special area requirements. Surface ships must comply with the special area requirements by December 31st of the year 2000. Submarines must comply with the special area requirements by December 31st of the year 2008. The Act further requires the Secretary of Defense to report in the Federal Register the amount and nature of Navy ship discharges in special areas, not otherwise authorized under MARPOL Annex V. Such reports are to be submitted on October 1 of the years 1994 through 2000. This Federal Register notice is the first of the required annual reports. This report covers the period between November 30th 1993 (the date on which the National Defense Authorization Act was enacted), and July 31st 1994. The end date of July 31st is necessary to allow time for data collection and report preparation. Subsequent year reports will cover the period from August 1st through July 31st. During the period of November 30, 1993 through July 31, 1994, there were no garbage discharges from Navy ships into MARPOL Annex V special areas that were not authorized under MARPOL Annex V. Dated: November 29, 1994. Patricia L. Toppings, Alternate OSD Federal Register Liaison Officer, Department of Defense.
