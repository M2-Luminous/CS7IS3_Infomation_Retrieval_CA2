Robin McLaren, the British ambassador to China, said yesterday morning after attending a meeting of the Executive Council in Hong Kong, that he hoped the Chinese side would not overreact to the tabling of the second part of the reform bill by the Hong Kong Government in the Legislative Council today. Zhang Junsheng said he wanted McLaren to explain what is meant by "overreact." Zhang Junsheng said that as far as the Chinese side is concerned, its original intention was to win cooperation with the British side, and that the British side is the one who has now undermined the talks and cooperation. The British side decided unilaterally last year to leave the negotiating table and to submit the first part of the reform bill to the Legislative Council, and this showed that they did not want to have Sino-British cooperation, but wanted a complete breakdown of the talks. Zhang Junsheng reflected: "In fact, since the very beginning of the Sino-British talks, the British side did not have sincerity for the talks." When the Sino-British talks began, in light of the British side's record of not keeping its promises in agreements, the Chinese side first demanded the British side to recognize the principles for the relevant talks, but the British side refused to recognize these relevant principles. Afterwards, the Chinese side made concessions and the talks were able to enter a concrete stage. However, the British side did not return to the foundation of the Sino-British understanding, but raised many unreasonable demands, including attempts to interfere in China's sovereignty as well as matters which should be handled by the future government of the special administrative region, and this led the talks to an impasse. Thereafter, in order to win an agreement, the Chinese side proposed separating the arrangements for the 1994 and 1995 elections and solving problems step by step through the method of "tackling the easy ones first." In the beginning, the British side rejected this and then raised a number of preconditions; both sides discussed the methods, however, when an agreement was about to be reached, the British side quit the talks with an excuse. They are now saying that because the Chinese side omitted the words "on its own" from the phrase "the government of the special administrative region will determine on its own whether to reinstate the appointed membership system," they quit the talks. Zhang Junsheng said that this was complete sophistry from the British side. In fact, the British side never mentioned this problem across the negotiating table, while in diplomacy such wording problems can be discussed after the principle has been fixed. Zhang Junsheng said that, in fact, the British side had left the negotiating table because it insisted on solving the problem of using the single-seat, single-vote system in the 1995 Legislative Council elections simultaneously, whereas this problem is a problem of principle. The British side's rationale was that the single-seat, single-vote system had already been passed by the Legislative Council. If anything passed by the Legislative Council can be imposed upon the Chinese and British Governments, then what kind of talks were these? Using such an excuse to quit the talks only shows that the responsibility for undermining the talks and cooperation is solely on the British side.
