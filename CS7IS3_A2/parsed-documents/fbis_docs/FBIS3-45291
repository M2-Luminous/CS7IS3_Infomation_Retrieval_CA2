Chen Xitong, secretary of the municipal party committee, presided over the session. That morning, Comrade Li Qiyan gave a report to give opinions on implementation of the guidelines of the national economic work conference and on initial arrangements for Beijing's 1994 reform and development. The report said: Since the beginning of this year, the people throughout the municipality have conscientiously studied Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, adhered to the party's basic line, and, proceeding from Beijing's reality, have further emancipated the mind, adopted new ideas and large-scale measures to accelerate reform and opening up in all sectors, and developed the economy in a sustained, rapid, and healthy manner. Comprehensive fulfillment of the target of "making this year's work surpass last year's" as defined by the municipal party committee and people's congress early this year has become a certainty, and a good foundation has been laid for next year's reform and development. Some major manifestations follow: 1) The economy has developed in a rapid, healthy, and orderly manner in the process of accelerating the transition to the market economy. 2) Urban construction has been expedited, and eye-catching changes have taken place in urban and rural areas. 3) Science and technology, education, and other social undertakings have developed comprehensively. 4) Urban and rural people's living standards have been promoted to new heights. 5) New breakthroughs have been achieved in the reform focusing on establishing the socialist market economy system and transforming enterprises' operating mechanism. 6) The endeavor of opening to the outside world has been promoted to an unprecedented range and quality. In addition to the new achievements in economic development, reform, and opening up, notable results have also been won in building the socialist spiritual civilization, improving the legal system, and building a clean government. In general, down-to-earth and effective work of this year has laid a good foundation and created a new opportunity for Beijing's economy to develop rapidly based on a new starting point next year. Speaking on the initial arrangements for next year's economic work, Li Qiyan pointed out in his report: Next year will be an extremely important year for comprehensively implementing the decision of the third plenary session of the 14th party Central Committee and accelerating the establishment of the socialist market economy system. It will also be a crucial year to accelerating Beijing's socialist modernization and achieving the fairly comfortable standard of living three years ahead of schedule. The basic idea for Beijing's economic work is to emancipate the mind, seize the opportunity to accelerate reform and opening up, expedite economic development, and strive to achieve a fairly comfortable standard of living three years ahead of schedule. We should emphasize the following work: A. We should speed up the establishment of the socialist market economy system, with the focus on establishing the modern enterprise system and the system for macroeconomic regulation and control. Next year's reform should focus on transforming enterprises' operating mechanism and establishing a modern enterprise system, and efforts should be made to achieve substantial progress. Meanwhile, focusing on the reform of the financial and tax, monetary, investment, and foreign trade systems, we should establish more rapidly the systems for macroeconomic regulation and control and change the government function of economic administration. B. We should open wider to the outside world and make a new breakthrough in using foreign capital. We should continue to regard use of foreign capital as the most important part of the endeavor of opening to the outside world, expand the scope of the endeavor, open more fields to the outside world, and improve the level. While adhering to the principle of "developing large, medium-sized, and small projects simultaneously," we should particularly draw in funds from international multi-national companies and consortia to build large key projects when bringing in funds from abroad. C. We should optimize the industrial composition, improve economic efficiency, and maintain the good trend of rapid development in urban and rural economies. D. We must have the greatest determination and make the greatest efforts in accelerating the construction of urban infrastructure facilities and raise the level of modernization in urban and rural areas. We should mobilize the efforts of all sectors and comprehensively advance the "well-off housing project" because this is one of the important links for realizing the goal of having the whole municipality become well-off ahead of schedule. E. We should give play to the advantages of the capital and accelerate scientific and technological progress and the training of personnel. The report points out: In order to smoothly fulfill all fields of work during next year, leading cadres at all levels should first solve the following major issues of understanding. First, we should further emancipate the mind. The priority is to further emancipate the mind in four aspects, including how to cope with the economic development rate, what standards to use to judge the realization of the goal of becoming well-off, how to recognize macroeconomic regulation and control under the socialist market economic conditions and how to expand the spheres of using foreign capital. Second, we should firmly seize the current opportunity and have a high sense of historical responsibility and urgency towards this. Third, we should correctly handle the relations of reform, opening up, economic development and social stability. We should pay particular attention to maintaining stability and never slacken our guard in this issue. Fourth, we should realistically improve work style and strengthen the building of honest and diligent administration. Fifth, we must pay high attention to and realistically strengthen study. It is necessary to use Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics to arm the the minds of cadres at all levels. We should soberly recognize that we are still not familiar with the socialist market economy. We must study honestly and sincerely and thoroughly understand the guidelines of the central authorities and the content of a series of reform plans. In the afternoon, Chen Guangwen, deputy secretary of the municipal party committee, gave a report to the plenary session on the situation of anticorruption work since the past four months. Since the issuance of the anticorruption work plans formulated by the municipal party committee and the municipal government in line with the guidelines of the second plenary session of the central Discipline Inspection Commission and Comrade Jiang Zemin's speech in September, the municipality has achieved initial results in its anticorruption struggle and implemented the three tasks on anticorruption struggle raised by the State Council. 1) In line with the demand of the municipal party committee and the municipal government, leading bodies at and above the section level across the municipality have held democratic life meetings on schedule, conducted self-insepction and correction in line with the "11 prohibitions" stipulated in the five central principles and briefed the situation to the masses. 2) We have concentrated efforts on the investigation and handling of a batch of major and appalling cases. In the past four months, the procuratorial organs across the municipality filed 263 economic cases on corruption and bribery for investigation; the courts sentenced 35 criminals involving in four groups and appalling cases, of whom, 25 criminals were sentenced to more than 10-years of imprisonment and 22 were sentenced to death and made their cases known to the public. 3) We have achieved great results in clearing up the work of arbitrarily collecting service charges. As of 10 December, the whole municipality had cleared up a total of 586 cases of this category. 4) We have comprehensively conducted the work of relentlessly checking several unhealthy trends which the masses have strong complaints. The unhealthy trend of using public funds to travel outside the country (territory) has been basically checked; business and enterprises involving party and government organs and the establishment of organs that need payment for providing consulting services have been initially banned; and new progress has been made in the work of rectifying work style of telecommunications departments and railway system. 5) We have closely combined anticorruption with clean and diligent administration and made honest administration to promote diligent administration. In referring to the next step of anticorruption struggle, Chen Guangwen proposed: It is necessary to continuously uphold the principles of persisting in "taking a two-handed approach and be tough with both," "first be resolute, second, be persistent, and third, achieving expected results," and exert great efforts to grasp them well. We must not overestimate the achivements we have made or neglect the existing problems or lower our guard on this. In the morning, the committee members also held group discussions on Comrade Li Qiyan's report. At the end of the session, Chen Guangwen gave a summing-up speech.
