FR940303-2-00194 FR940303-2-00096 Per Diem support from host institutions during an internship component is strongly encouraged. However, for all programs which include internships, a nonprofit grantee institution which receives funds from corporate or other cosponsors should then use those monies to provide food, lodging, and pocket money for the participants. In no case could the intern receive a wage or ``be hired'' by the sponsoring institution. Internships should also have an American Studies/values orientation component at the beginning of the exchange. The U.S. grantee institution should try to maximize cost-sharing in all facets of their program and to stimulate U.S. private sector (foundation and corporate) support. Proposals incorporating internships will be more competitive if letters committing prospective host institutions to supporting these efforts are provided. Funding Competition for USIA funding support is keen. The final selection of a grantee institution will depend on assessment of proposals according to the review criteria delineated below. The amount requested from USIA for this program should not exceed $180,000. However, organizations with less than four years of successful experience in managing international exchange programs are limited to $60,000. While applicants must provide an all-inclusive budget with the proposal, they are also encouraged to include separate sub-budgets for each program component, phase, location or activity. The recipient's proposal shall include the cost of an audit that: (1) Complies with the requirements of OMB Circular No. A&hyph;133, Audits of Institutions of Higher Education and Other Nonprofit Institutions; (2) complies with the requirements of American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position (SOP) No. 92&hyph;9; and (3) includes review by the recipient's independent auditor of a recipient-prepared supplemental schedule of indirect cost rate computation, if such a rate is being proposed. The audit costs shall be identified separately for: (1) Preparation of basic financial statements and other accounting services; and (2) preparation of the supplemental reports and schedules required by OMB Circular No. A&hyph;133, AICPA SOP 92&hyph;9, and the review of the supplemental schedule of indirect cost rate computation. USIA will consider funding the following project costs: 1. International and domestic air fares; visas; transit costs (e.g., airport taxes); ground transportation costs. 2. Per diem: For the U.S. program, organizations have the option of using a flat $140/day for international participants or the published Federal Travel Regulations per diem rates for individual American cities. Note: U.S. escorting staff must use the published federal per diem rates, not the flat rate. For activities in the Middle East, the Standard Government Travel Regulations per diem rates must be used. 3. Book and cultural allowance: Participants are entitled to a one-time cultural allowance of $150 per person, plus a book allowance of $50. Escorts are reimbursed for actual cultural expenses up to $150. U.S. staff do not get these benefits. 4. Consultants: May be used to provide specialized expertise or to make presentations. Honoraria should not exceed $250 per day. Subcontracting organizations may also be used, in which case the written contract(s) must be included in the proposal.
