Publicity and Information Secretary Vuyisa Qunta said in a telephone interview from the BCMA's headquarters in Harare on Friday his organisation would return at the earliest possible date. The future of the BCMA's armed wing, the Azanian National Liberation Army, would be addressed after returning to South Africa. "We are coming back home to strenthen AZAPO in its fight against deprivation of the black people, to strengthen it in its fight against the landlessness of the black people, their non-participation in the economic life of the country and their generally poor social conditions." AZAPO boycotted the April elections saying they would only justify the inequalities created by apartheid. Asked to comment on the 20 per cent showing by the National Party, Mr Qunta said it showed the critical role that needed to be played by AZAPO in urging blacks to be self-reliant and not regard the white man as the "baas" of the old days. "The minds of our people are in bad shape and a lot of work...still needs to be done. "It is often said that the strongest weapon that the oppressor has is the mind of the oppressed, and this was clearly reflected in the recent elections where the oppressor got a substantial number of votes from the oppressed community itself," Mr Qunta said.
