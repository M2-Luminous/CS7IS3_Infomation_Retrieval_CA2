M. Mashimov; UDC 528.33] [Abstract] As the end of the 20th century approaches and the new century is in the offing, there is a wide array of problems which must be dealt with in order to solve problems in astrogeodesy, geodynamics and cartography. These include organization of a planetary geocentric coordinate system, a global position system and a VLBI network; study of the figure, physical fields and internal structure of the Earth with allowance for their secular, long- and short-period changes with time; determination of an inertial coordinate reference system, parameters of rotation of the Earth and polar movement; study of the figures and physical fields of the moon, planets and their satellites and defining coordinate reference systems for the Moon, Venus, Mars and other planets; determination of the center of inertia of the Earth-Moon system for the epoch; organization of state astrogeodetic, geodetic, gravimetric and vertical control networks; organization of special- purpose local, sea and space geodetic networks; tie-in of different coordinate systems and physical fields; astrogeodetic, gravimetric and cartographic support for astroengineering programs in near and distant space; astrogeodetic, gravimetric and cartographic support for study of crustal movements, lithospheric plates and the continents, changes in sea level and the world ocean, prediction of earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and catastrophes of different types; monitoring of natural and technogenic environments; implementation of land, sea and aerospace surveys; production of graphic, digital and electronic topographic and thematic maps. These problems cannot be solved without the coordination of long-term scientific and technical programs in the field of astrogeodesy, geodynamics and cartography during 1995-2010 by the academies of sciences of the CIS and Rosgosstandard. The article discusses the organization of a network of astrogeodetic observatories (AGO) for uniformly covering the entire area of the country and the requirements on a new highly accurate fundamental astrogeodetic network, without which work on the enumerated problems is without promise. The work of the AGO, on which the entire network hinges, also is described, as is the role played by GLONASS, Navstar and Lageos satellites. Work already done and that which is planned is outlined. How the basic system and its subsystems will allow solution of key problems is discussed.
