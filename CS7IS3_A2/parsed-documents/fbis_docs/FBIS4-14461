It says that, as of 28 March 1994, the debt of the Ukrainian military units that use electric power through military units of the Black Sea Fleet amounts to 4 billion karbovanets. As for the debt run up by customers subordinated to Ukraine's Defense Ministry to the construction department of the Black Sea Fleet, it is as high as 16.709 trillion karbovanets. The Black Sea Fleet Command believes that this situation is evidence of the Ukraine Defense Ministry's having violated the understanding reached between the two republics at the presidential level on joint financing of the Black Sea Fleet. In essence, the Ukrainian military is solving its own problems at the expense of the Russian Navy. Unless the Defense Ministry pays up the debt to the Black Sea Fleet before 10 April, the Black Sea Fleet command will halt the construction and assembly work being done for Ukraine's Defense Ministry, and make all Ukrainian military units use their own power resources, the cable says.
