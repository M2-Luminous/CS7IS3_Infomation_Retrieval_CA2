The journalists were outraged: Did it make any sense to convene them just to read out five lines and then run away? Segni listened with some embarrassment to the journalists' protest before being swallowed up into the nonstop meeting with the Piazza del Gesu [Italian People's Party headquarters] bigwigs. [LA REPUBBLICA] So then, deputy Segni, have you reached an agreement? [Segni] We are going ahead with determination and conviction, putting forward the Pact for Italy electoral lists. We are going ahead in the belief that we must offer the country a European political platform, which is modern, moderate, and reformist. This evening, or at the latest tomorrow morning (this morning -- LA REPUBBLICA editor's note), we will complete the process of choosing the candidates. We are committed to ensuring that they represent a profound renewal, and that there will be nobody among them who may still have to settle accounts with the law. In my capacity as the coalitions's candidate for the premiership, I will express an overall opinion on the composition and the drawing up of the lists. [LA REPUBBLICA] So you are going ahead? [Segni] Policymaking is always a difficult business. Attempts to reach broader agreements are often defined as "wavering," whereas standing firm on a principle is called "stubbornness." We are not wavering and we are not being stubborn. I have always had the country's interests at heart. It is those same interests which are now guiding my actions. We must get down to work with the greatest determination, because the future of our country depends on the results we achieve. [LA REPUBBLICA] What about names? [Segni] I do not wish to go into the details, as far as names are concerned. When the lists are drawn up, we will see the results, and then you will be able to judge for yourselves. [LA REPUBBLICA] Why are you encountering so many difficulties, however? [Segni] The difficulty lies in defining the principles, detailing the rules, deciding on the candidacies. We have not yet mentioned any names, and I do not wish to mention any now. However, I am sure that the PPI will follow criteria of openness and political clarity.
