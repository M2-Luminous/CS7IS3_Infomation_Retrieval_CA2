After his return, Cetin evaluated the removal of the German arms ban on Turkey as a normal consequence of Turkish-German relations. Germany which suspended arms shipments to Turkey in April, on claims that these weapons were used in the southeast against separatist terrorists, declared the same day that the ban was lifted, since the allegations proved to be false. `The decision is proof that efforts to damage German-Turkish friendship and cooperation have failed,' Cetin said. `The traditional mutual-trust relations between Turkey and Germany have been strengthened once more, after this experience,' he said.
