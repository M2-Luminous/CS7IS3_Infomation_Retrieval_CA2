The political report clearly stipulates: "The evaluation, selection, and deployment of leading cadres at all levels should be based on the fundamental criteria determined by the resolution of the Party Central Committee Third Plenum: -- A steadfast political standpoint, determination to follow the socialist path, and determination to bring the renovation undertaking of the country to victory. -- Sound knowledge and the ability to participate in a collective decision making process, as well as the ability to organize and implement any assigned tasks efficiently. -- Possession of revolutionary morality; being diligent, thrifty, just, fair, objective, and unbiased; and having a determination to protect the lines and policies of the party. -- Being discipline oriented and protective of the unity in the party. -- Being close with people and trusted by them. Among these criteria, special attention should be paid to political acumen; dedication to the aims and ideals of the party; commitment to lead a moral, healthy, and clean life; and non- involvement in corruption. Ability is very important, but the above criteria should also be considered carefully. This is because the renovation undertaking carried out by our party is bringing about many advantages as well as many dangers and difficulties. Leading cadres will have to confront countless ordeals, and if they, being core leaders, falter and show a lack of determination and political acumen, then it is very likely that they will head in the wrong direction. Working in a market-based economy where leading cadres are empowered with vast responsibility for managing public properties, and in an environment where various forces would love to buy those leaders with their money, if the leading cadres let themselves be spoiled by money and become committed to corruption activities, then the state will lose not only its money and its cadres, but also the trust of the people. We definitely should not inject into the leading organs of the party those who are politically and morally degenerate. Cadre work must be democratized. The evaluation of cadre should be done by the managing party committee and other relevant organs as stipulated, and it should be carried out in orderly, democratic, proper, and just ways. Every cadre has the right to know and answer to the evaluation by the party committee and the leader of that individual cadre. The political report also highly values the fostering and training of talents, which are considered precious assets of the country. To bring the country to prosperity and powerfulness, we should have many talented people in all fields: outstanding politicians, excellent entrepreneurs, and talented scientists, technicians, culturalists, and so forth. Favorable conditions should be created so that all people with sound character and ability, both inside the party and outsiders, both living domestically and overseas, can have a chance to contribute their utmost to the country. The training and retraining of cadres should be done according to plan. The training contents must be specific for each task and for the requirements of each position concerned. Renovation must be carried out in both teaching and studying methods, while adequate funds must be provided for the training. All party organizations will reorganize and reevaluate the existing contingent of cadres. Based on this evaluation, they will make plans for party member work from now until the year 2000. This will correspond to the requirements for the quantity, quality, and structure of cadres. This is our major but difficult task that requires our best efforts to fulfill. The party central committee will give out directives on this task, but each sector, each locality should be a striking force in the implementation process. D. Are Party Members Allowed To Engage in Private Capitalist Economic Activities? The party by-laws stipulate that a party member "must be exemplary in labor, combat, and study; and lead a healthy, clean, and non-exploiting life." The Party Construction Report of the Seventh Party Congress also confirmed: "Party members who are currently employed as workers and employees, in addition to the fulfillment of their assigned tasks, are encouraged to develop family economic activities. Party members can be shareholders of companies, state or collective enterprises. Party members who are not employed directly in organs of the party, state, or mass organizations, but directly involved in labor (manual labor, technical labor, or management labor), are allowed to organize a collective economic establishment (production group, cooperative, and so forth), to tender for bidding, and to lease land or other property of the state and other collective organizations. They are also allowed to do business as individual, small proprietors. Party members are not allowed to be private economic capitalists." The political report reaffirms this and all members should strictly abide by it. Regarding party members who are presently owners of private capitalist economic establishments, the relevant party organizations need to handle them on an individual case basis. They can be helped to transform to enterprises, share-holding enterprises with shares of the laboring partners or the state, or to other forms of collective economic establishment, in order to motivate the capital and entrepreneurial skills of party members on one hand, and to ensure the class characteristic of our party on the other.
