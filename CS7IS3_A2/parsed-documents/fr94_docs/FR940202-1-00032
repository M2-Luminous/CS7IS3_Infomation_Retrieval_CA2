FR940202-1-00032 FR940202-1-00012 The Nine Conferences also point out that the definition of shippers' association refers to a ``group'' of shippers, and concludes that this contemplates an organization or entity separate and apart from the members, which performs functions on behalf of members. In contrast, they maintain that, under the proposed definition, there is no requirement of a group or entity acting on behalf of the members, and consolidation of cargo would be in name only. The Nine Conferences are of the opinion that under the Proposed Rule, any shipper could force negotiations with a carrier simply by joining together with another shipper. Allegedly, section 10(b)(13) of the 1984 Act 4 was not intended to extend this far. 4 Section 10(b)(13) states that no common carrier may ``refuse to negotiate with a shippers' association.'' 46 U.S.C. app. 1709(b)(13). The Japan Conferences argue that there is no statutory authority for joint service contracts or for substituting a mere shippers' agreement for a shippers' association. They contend that the Proposed Rule would weaken and undermine existing shippers' associations. They submit that Congress, in approving shippers' associations, envisioned ongoing, reliable shippers' associations subject to the internal discipline of an association. The Japan Conferences believe that it is currently easy to join bona fide shippers' associations and consequently suggest that there is no need for any liberalization. The South American/Caribbean Conferences likewise contend that it is not necessary to clarify that multiple shippers may form or operate a shippers' association, as shippers of all sizes have been doing so since enactment of the 1984 Act. Fritz opposes the Proposed Rule because it perceives it as allowing combinations of shippers or joint ventures to be treated as shippers' associations although they are not. It notes that the definition of ``shipper'' refers to a person for whose account transportation is provided and concludes therefore that a shippers' association must act as a single entity. In addition, Fritz expresses concern about the possibility that a ``me-too'' shipper will be able to access the rate and volume of only one of the combination shippers rather than the entire obligation of the combination. Hanjin suggests that the stated purpose of the Proposed Rule_to permit multiple shippers to enter into joint service contracts_is beyond the Commission's authority. Hanjin contends that there would essentially be no requirements for the formation of an association and that one could be formed by a one or two-sentence agreement. Hanjin contends that the proposal would make enforcement of shipper contract obligations increasingly burdensome for carriers. Hanjin notes that if the agreement among the members allows for the apportionment of liability, each shipper in effect has its own minimum volume and the carrier has the burden of enforcing portions of a single contract against different parties. On the other hand, if a carrier refuses to permit apportionment of liability, Hanjin suggests that it may be subject to claims of refusing to negotiate.
