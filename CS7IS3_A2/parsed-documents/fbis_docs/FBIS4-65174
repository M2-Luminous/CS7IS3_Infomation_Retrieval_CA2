Neumann reported in Bonn on Monday [9 April] that several hundred people have already been killed in the war between Mas'ud Barzani's Democratic Party of Kurdistan (DPK) and Jalal Talabani's Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK). The two party leaders cooperate in a coalition government of the autonomous region, while their supporters attacked one another on their way to negotiations. The German delegation was led by the chairman of the Bundestag Subcommittee for Humanitarian Issues, Friedrich Vogel (Christian Democratic Union -- CDU). Heinrich Lummer (CDU) was the third participant. Neumann reported that members of aid organizations, including Eberhard Walde of the German liaison office in the region, have left the region, because their security can no longer be guaranteed. Representatives of the two warring parties called this "the saddest day" since Saddam Husayn's anti-Kurdish massacrers. The deputies wanted to obtain some information on the extent of reconstruction aid provided for the autonomous region in Iraq, to which the Federal Government, and especially the laender of Lower Saxony and North Rhine-Westphalia have contributed. Germany's food aid could, however, be largely discontinued due to good harvests in 1992 and 1993, Neumann said. In these two years, Bonn provided almost 40 million marks in humanitarian aid.
