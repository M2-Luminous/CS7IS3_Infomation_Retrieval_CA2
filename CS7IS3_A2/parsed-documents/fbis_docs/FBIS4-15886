Speaking of the need to accelerate privatization and to render all-round support for entrepreneurship, in order to boost the formation of a civilized market and overcome the economic crisis, the president stressed that this help, at the expense of the awaited foreign credits, will be targeted first at those nongovernmental structures that manufacture consumer goods, which are in great demand, and other products. In order to make this government support for private enterprise more regular and targeted, a relevant plan will be worked out in April with the participation of many representatives of Kazakhstani businesses who attended today's meeting. Nazarbayev signed a decree to form a state commission for support of entrepreneurship. Discussing additional measures of social protection of the population, it was noted that those who really need such support will receive it, namely the disabled, war and labor veterans, families with many children, the lonely, and the sick. Taking account of the interests of all these low-income groups, during the meeting the head of state signed a decree increasing minimum wages and pensions up to 100 tenge as of 1 April. In this connection financial compensation instead of former allowances will be increased. War veterans and people of similar status will receive a further 330 tenge a month; war veterans -- 280; labor invalids of the 1st and 2d groups -- 230 and 220 tenge. The salaries of many categories of workers will also be increased.
