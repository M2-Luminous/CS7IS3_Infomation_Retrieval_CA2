ACTION: Interim rule. SUMMARY: In this document, the Bureau of Prisons is revising its rule on Research in order to conform to Departmental regulations on the Protection of Human Subjects requiring, among other provisions, the establishment of an institutional review board. Additional procedural changes have also been made in order to simplify the application process or to clarify policy. DATES: Effective March 23, 1994; comments must be received by May 23, 1994. ADDRESSES: Office of General Counsel, Bureau of Prisons, HOLC Room 754, 320 First Street, NW., Washington, DC 20534. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Roy Nanovic, Office of General Counsel, Bureau of Prisons, phone (202) 514&hyph;6655. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Bureau of Prisons is amending its regulations on Research. A final rule on this subject was published in the Federal Register October 1, 1981 (46 FR 48577). Department of Justice regulations pertaining to the Protection of Human Subjects are contained in 28 CFR part 46. The Bureau's regulations on the conduct of research are consequently being revised in order to conform to Departmental requirements. In compliance with Departmental regulations, the Bureau Research Review Board (BRRB) is identified as the Bureau's institutional review board. Processing procedures are revised in order to stipulate the duties of the BRRB and supporting staff at institutions in its oversight of research projects. As a clarification, the Bureau notes that implementation of programmatic or operational initiatives made through pilot projects are not considered to be research. In addition to these conforming amendments, the Bureau is also making other procedural changes intended to simplify the research application process. For example, procedures on the submission of research proposals are revised to remove reference to distinctions between routine and non-routine requests. Revised procedures in §512.14 instead direct that requests be submitted either to the institution, if only one institution is involved, or to the Office of Research if more than one institution is involved. Section 512.15 restates provisions contained in former §512.17 on access to Bureau of Prisons records. As revised, this section now includes reference to disclosure provisions of the Privacy Act.
