Well-informed sources told INTERFAX that the terrorist, who called himself Nikolay Skvortsov, was seized. He had kept two boys, ages 3 and 4, and their 28-year-old nursery school teacher, Natalia Khitalenko, as hostages. The terrorist, who had also captured a YAZ car with a driver, demanded on Thursday morning that US$500,000 and a plane to go abroad be given to him. He went from Sukhodolsk to Rostov-on-Don together with the hostages. Authorities there agreed to give him a Tu-134 aircraft. Initially, he declared that negotiations would begin as soon as he boarded the plane. He also demanded that he and the hostages board the plane before the crew. Two crews had volunteered to pilot the plane. According to some sources, the terrorist intended to leave for London. Other information says he was going to the U.S.
