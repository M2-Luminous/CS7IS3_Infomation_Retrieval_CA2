The total grain output of the province hit some 23.8 million tons last year, one million tons more than that in 1990, which was the previous record, according to the latest official statistics. Meanwhile, the total agricultural output value of Hebei in 1993 topped some 50.1 billion yuan, up 6.2 percent from the previous year. Exceptionally serious dry weather attacked most of the area over the past year. The average rainfall in the first half of 1993 dropped to only some ten millimeters per month, official sources said. In addition, water in most of the reservoirs and canals dried up due to rare drought. To fight the drought, the provincial government collected some 500 million yuan to construct irrigation systems, draw water and readjust the crop structure. With the support of local governments, the Hebei people sank about 780,000 pump wells, and the total area of effectively irrigated farmland reached some 3.93 million ha [hectares].
