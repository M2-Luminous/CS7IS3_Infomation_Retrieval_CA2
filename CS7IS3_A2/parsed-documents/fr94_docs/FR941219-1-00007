FR941219-1-00007 FR941219-1-00004 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 91&hyph;CE&hyph;40&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; Alexander Schleicher Models ASW&hyph;12, ASW&hyph;15, ASW&hyph;15B, and ASW&hyph;17 Gliders AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes to supersede AD 88&hyph;11&hyph;05, which currently requires repetitively inspecting the wing spar of Alexander Schleicher Models ASW&hyph;15 and ASW&hyph;15B gliders for wood rot, and replacing any wing spar where wood rot is found. Alexander Schleicher Models ASW&hyph;12 and ASW&hyph;17 gliders are of a similar type design of the models affected by the current AD, and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), in working with the Civil Aviation Authority of Germany, has decided that the actions referenced in AD 88&hyph;11&hyph;05 should also apply to these glider models. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent failure of the wing spar caused by wood rot, which, if not detected and corrected, could result in loss of control of the glider. DATES: Comments must be received on or before February 24, 1995. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the FAA, Central Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 91&hyph;CE&hyph;40&hyph;AD, Room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106. Comments may be inspected at this location between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, holidays excepted. Service information that applies to the proposed AD may be obtained from Alexander Schleicher GmbH & Company, D&hyph;36163, Poppenhausen-Wasserkuppe, Germany; or Eastern Sailplane, Heath Stage Route Shelburne Falls, Massachusetts 01370; telephone (413) 625&hyph;6059. This information also may be examined at the Rules Docket at the address above. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Herman Belderok, Project Officer, Small Airplane Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service, FAA, 1201 Walnut, suite 900, Kansas City, Missouri 64106; telephone (816) 426&hyph;6932; facsimile (816) 426&hyph;2169. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Comments Invited Interested persons are invited to participate in the making of the proposed rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications should identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified above. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments, specified above, will be considered before taking action on the proposed rule. The proposals contained in this notice may be changed in light of the comments received. Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the proposed rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this proposal will be filed in the Rules Docket. Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket No. 91&hyph;CE&hyph;40&hyph;AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. Availability of NPRMs Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Central Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 91&hyph;CE&hyph;40&hyph;AD, Room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106. Discussion A report of an in-flight wing failure because of box spar wood rot on a Model ASW&hyph;15 glider that was certificated for operation in Australia prompted the FAA to issue AD 88&hyph;11&hyph;05, Amendment 39&hyph;5997. This AD requires repetitively inspecting the wing spar for wood rot on Alexander Schleicher Models ASW&hyph;15 and ASW&hyph;15B gliders that are certificated for operation in the United States, and replacing any wood wing spar where wood rot is found. These actions are accomplished in accordance with Alexander Schleicher ASW&hyph;15 Technical Note (TN) No. 23, dated April 21, 1988. The wing configuration of these gliders includes a wood box wing spar. Water can penetrate the box spar interior, which permits the growth of wood destroying mold fungus. This fungus could destroy the balsa wood spar webs and plywood blocks of the spar to the point where the residual spar strength would no longer be sufficient.
