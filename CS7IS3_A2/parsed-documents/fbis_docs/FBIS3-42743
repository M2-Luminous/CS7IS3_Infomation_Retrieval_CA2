In response, anonymous leaflets were pasted this week all over Tiraspol, in which General Lebed is accused of preparing for a state coup in the Dniester Area. The leaflets' authors maintain that the coordinators of this coup are Konstantin Borovoy, leader of the Russian Economic Freedom Party, and Sergey Manukyan, head of this party's regional branch and a well-known entrepreneur in the region. A correspondent of the INFOTAG agency reported from Tiraspol that Aleksandr Lebed described the distributed leaflets as "total nonsense." He emphasized that some members of the local leadership, mixed up in machinations and abuse, are trying in such a way to blame the Russian military for their own mistakes and the deteriorating economic situation in the region. Lebed emphasized that the 14th Army command is ready to cooperate in this respect with any organs in order to find out the truth of the matter. In the opinion of Tiraspol observers, the author and distributor of the leaflets is the Dniester Area Ministry of Security, whose chief, Vadim Shevtsov-Antyufeyev, is at odds with Lebed. Speaking at the latest session of Tiraspol Supreme Soviet, he publicly accused the 14th Army commander of preparing for a "state coup."
