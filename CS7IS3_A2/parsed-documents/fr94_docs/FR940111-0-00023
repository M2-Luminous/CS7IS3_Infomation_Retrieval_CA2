FR940111-0-00023 FR940111-0-00006 (6) Withdrawal. An applicant or petitioner may withdraw an application or petition at any time until a decision is issued by the Service or, in the case of an approved petition, until the person is admitted or granted adjustment or change of status, based on the petition. However, a withdrawal may not be retracted. (7) Testimony. The Service may require the taking of testimony, and may direct any necessary investigation. When a statement is taken from and signed by a person, he or she shall, upon request, be given a copy without fee. Any allegations made subsequent to filing an application or petition which are in addition to, or in substitution for, those originally made, shall be filed in the same manner as the original application, petition, or document, and acknowledged under oath thereon. (8) Request for evidence. If there is evidence of ineligibility in the record, an application or petition shall be denied on that basis notwithstanding any lack of required initial evidence. If the application or petition was pre-screened by the Service prior to filing and was filed even though the applicant or petitioner was informed that the required initial evidence was missing, the application or petition shall be denied for failure to contain the necessary evidence. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, in other instances where there is no evidence of ineligibility, and initial evidence or eligibility information is missing or the Service finds that the evidence submitted either does not fully establish eligibility for the requested benefit or raises underlying questions regarding eligibility, the Service shall request the missing initial evidence, and may request additional evidence, including blood tests. In such cases, the applicant or petitioner shall be given 12 weeks to respond to a request for evidence. Additional time may not be granted. Within this period the applicant or petitioner may: (i) Submit all the requested initial or additional evidence; (ii) Submit some or none of the requested additional evidence and ask for a decision based on the record; or (iii) Withdraw the application or petition. (9) Request for appearance. An applicant, a petitioner, and/or a beneficiary may be required to appear for an interview. A petitioner shall also be notified when an interview notice is mailed or issued to a beneficiary. The person may appear as requested by the Service or, prior to the date and time of the interview: (i) The person to be interviewed may, for good cause, request that the interview be rescheduled; or (ii) The applicant or petitioner may withdraw the application or petition. (10) Effect of a request for initial or additional evidence or for interview rescheduling. (i) Effect on processing. The priority date of a properly filed petition shall not be affected by a request for missing initial evidence or request for other evidence. If an application or petition is missing required initial evidence, or an applicant, petitioner, or beneficiary requests that an interview be rescheduled, any time period imposed on Service processing will start over from the date of receipt of the required initial evidence or request for interview rescheduling. If the Service requests that the applicant or petitioner submit additional evidence or respond to other than a request for initial evidence, any time limitation imposed on the Service for processing will be suspended as of the date of the request. It will resume at the same point where it stopped when the Service receives the requested evidence or response, or a request for a decision based on the evidence submitted.
