FR941011-0-00065 FR941011-0-00019 50 CFR Part 678 [Docket No. 920409&hyph;3047; I.D. 082294C] Atlantic Shark Fisheries; Large Coastal Sharks AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Rescission of closure. SUMMARY: NMFS rescinds the closure of the fishery for large coastal sharks conducted in the Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean Sea. This action is necessary because new information indicates that the second semiannual quota for large coastal sharks has not been taken. EFFECTIVE DATE: The closure is rescinded effective October 4, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: C. Michael Bailey, 301&hyph;713&hyph;2347; Michael Justen, 813&hyph;570&hyph;5305; or Kevin B. Foster, 508&hyph;281&hyph;9260. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Atlantic shark fishery is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for Atlantic Sharks under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq .). Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR part 678. Section 678.23(b) of the regulations provides for two semiannual quotas of large coastal sharks to be harvested in or from the Western North Atlantic Ocean, including the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, by commercial fishermen. The second semiannual quota is available for harvest from July 1 through December 31, 1994. The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, (AA) had determined, based on the best available data on reported catch and projections of future landings, that the semiannual quota for large coastal sharks in or from the Western North Atlantic Ocean, including the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, for the period July 1 through December 31, 1994, would be attained by October 10, 1994. Therefore, a closure document was published in the Federal Register on August 30, 1994 (59 FR 44644), to take effect October 10, 1994. Upon further analysis of the landings data, including new information that became available since announcement of the closure date, the AA has determined that a portion of the quota for the large coastal shark fishery remains unharvested. Therefore, the closure date of October 11, 1994, is rescinded effective October 4, 1994, in order to allow an opportunity for shark fishermen to take their full allocation. If the AA determines that the catch will equal the quota, a new closure date will be announced. Classification This action is taken under 50 CFR part 678 and is exempt from review under E.O. 12866. Dated: October 4, 1994. Richard H. Schaefer, Director, Office of Fisheries Conservation and Management, National Marine Fisheries Service.
