Speaking at the meeting, Lt. Gen. Myo Nyunt said that the SLORC has assumed state responsibility for five to six years and that those present should not take their work lightly, but should discharge their duties with a new spirit and personnel in the new year of 1994 to strive for greater improvements. Lt. Gen. Myo Nyunt noted that it has been six months since the positions of chairmen of township LORCs, formerly held by military officers, have been held by personnel from the Department of General Administration. As former members of the LORCs, the new chairmen of the LORCs have no difficulty in discharging their duties, but they need to work with enthusiasm. Lt. Gen. Myo Nyunt said the SLORC government is holding the National Convention for the emergence of the State Constitution in order to transfer state power to the people in accordance with democratic means as soon as possible. Training courses are being held to prepare for the administrative machinery, which will emerge in the future. Those who have undergone the training need to work in accordance with the motto: Quantity with Quality. They will be able to prove their ability in the workplace. As they work in the capital city of Yangon, they will be under the constant scrutiny and supervision by state leaders and close observation by their immediate departmental superiors at township and district level. They should bear this in mind in their work. Lt. Gen. Myo Nyunt said that in implementing the three major tasks of the SLORC, they should observe the following five factors: 1. Always strive to know who are the old and new residents in their respective areas; 2. Inspect the area under one's jurisdiction both publicly and incognito; 3. Move around unnoticed like wind in order to assess public behavior and the situation in districts and townships; 4. Do not engage in four kinds of improper conduct; those who become rich in a short time become poor in a short time; those who are wicked do not have enough to eat, those who are honest have more than enough to eat. Therefore, honestly and diligently work. 5. Discharge diligently one's duty. Their constant duty is to ensure the prevalence of law and order and peace and tranquility. The basic task of the state is to promulgate and execute the existing laws and maintain the capabilities of the Defense Services. Regulations on traffic, roads, and trading are being violated in some townships. There are muggings and robberies by gangs and trafficking and consumption of narcotic drugs. It is necessary for chairmen and members of district and township LORC's to act with care in order to ensure the prevalence of law and order. The government is building roads where there are mountains and bridges where there are streams as part of its effort to ensure good transport and communications and to develop the country, including border regions. Irrigation projects are also being implemented to bring greenery to the regions. They need to cooperate with the development committees in various areas for road repairs and to build drainage and reclaim land. A Shan proverb says: Look after one's land in one's country; it will be developed and prosperous one day. Accordingly, it will be necessary to give priority to agriculture. Lt. Gen. Myo Nyunt said some who do not desire peace and tranquility in the city of Yangon and some power-mad politicians, who have entered the business sector with help and assistance from spies, are manipulating the market to keep prices high and thereby instigate the hungry into creating unrest. District and township LORCs must be vigilant against this and strive to satisfy the people's need for food, clothing, and shelter. Those who are manipulating prices on the assumption that commodity prices will fall if the price of rice falls will have to face the consequences. Lt. Gen. Myo Nyunt also said that security should not be overlooked. He said special care should be taken to prevent the disappearance of the language, religion, and nation and it will be necessary to open monastic schools and conduct courses on Buddhist culture. Colonel Thura Myint Maung, deputy chairman of the Yangon Division LORC, then participated in the discussion and chairmen of district and township LORCs presented the situation in their respective areas. In his closing address, Lt. Gen. Myo Nyunt said the National Convention will resume on 18 January 1994. He explained that the eight groups had achieved the basic principles for the 15 chapter headings at the convention and that when the convention resumes, discussions will be held to obtain firm basic principles for each chapter. He said the Union Solidarity and Development Association [USDA] has been formed with five objectives, basic principles, and a code of behavior to strive for the emergence of a developed and modern state. Branches have been formed in divisions, districts, and townships. He urged those present at the meeting to give necessary assistance for the successful implementation of USDA programs and to serve in the USDA. General Aung San said: Think and work for the reconstruction of Myanmar [Burma] and the preservation of our nation. Heroes plan and work to make our nation become powerful. Lt. Gen. Myo Nyunt said that there are currently some political parties with a tendency to depend on things foreign -- this could lead to the disappearance of the nation. Likewise, among the business sector there is the tendency to depend on things foreign as can be seen in the signboards with foreign names they put up. The meeting ended after Lt. Gen. Myo Nyunt said that although names of townships, wards, and streets bearing English names and names of traitors had been changed during the SLORC administration, there are those who put up the foreign names and they must be duly informed.
