Before that time, it was possible to influence the rate of decline in production with the help of monetary infusions, whereas from the middle of 1993 on, the fall in the volume of production deteriorated and measures to provide monetary grants for production almost failed to influence its dynamics. This was manifested in a particularly pronounced form at the end of 1993 and the beginning of 1994. Between October and December 1993, the rate of inflation was reduced from 23 to 13 percent, but this did not influence the dynamics of production in any way. In January of this year, the rate of inflation soared to 23 percent again due to the payments made at the end of last year. It would appear that this should have given an incentive to producers; besides, consumers also got extra money. However, contrary to all projections, the volume of industrial production suddenly fell by 25 percent (compared to January 1992)--a magnitude without parallel to date. In February, the rate of inflation fell to 13 percent, and in March to as low as 8 percent, but the fall in production remained the way it was in January. On the whole, the decline in the first quarter came to 24 percent. In the opinion of many experts, we have entered a new depressed stage of the economic crisis whereby there already is little dependence between the financial policy of the state and the continuing slump in production. Many people agree that at present it is impossible to stop the drop until the volume of the production hits the bottom of the crisis which is expected by the end of this year. In the process, the volume of production at this lowest point will come to approximately 40 percent of the 1990 volume. What Is To Be Done As the experience of the world indicates, it will primarily be investment that will ultimately help to overcome the crisis in the economy. Suppressing inflation is the main prerequisite for a transition to investment activity. The program of government plans to reduce the monthly rate of inflation to 7-9 percent by the end of the year. In his message, President Boris Yeltsin referred to an even lower percentage rate of inflation--5-7 percent. As the experience of the first quarter and April indicates, this is a realistic task. Following the lowering of the inflation rate, interest rates charged by banks will begin to fall. This has already been announced by the Central Bank of Russia by way of planning major reductions in interest rates on credit. Lower inflation and interest rates and the stabilization of the exchange rate of the ruble and the dollar which is associated with this will provide incentives for saving. Lower interest rates on capital will lengthen the period of credit extension. In this manner, the conditions will first of all improve for medium-term investment, especially foreign-exchange investment. The demand for producer goods will begin to grow which will gradually pull along other sectors of the economy. This process could be accelerated if more favorable conditions for the attraction of foreign capital were created. Money Is Available All Right.... In essence, the existing severe crisis of production is primarily a demand crisis. The manufacturing of individual products is dropping because there is no demand for them. When production falls the specific cost of production increases thus hindering price reductions which could stimulate demand. Characteristically, lower demand is not at all firmly associated with a lack of monetary funds. By now, more than $20 billion has been amassed in foreign-exchange accounts in Russia; another approximately $18 billion (according to realistic estimates) is being kept by Russian citizens and organizations at foreign banks. Every day, R0.7-1.0 trillion is produced at currency trading sessions to be exchanged into Marks or dollars. The activity of the population in acquiring various shares, securities, and so on is known. Money is available but, as is the case in all market economies, an overwhelming proportion of it is concentrated in the possession of the population. Meanwhile, our economy which was formed during the era of a totalitarian state and centralized planning is primarily geared toward meeting the needs of the military-industrial complex and heavy industry, and to a lesser degree toward meeting the requirements of consumers. Hence the structural crisis and a particularly sharp decline in the output of the military-industrial complex and heavy industry which used to thrive on orders and the sectors stimulated through state subsidies (such as tractor and farm machinery building). A peculiar situation has emerged: The population (more precisely, its affluent segment), as well as some of the enterprises and organizations, have money, but they are not inclined to spend it to acquire domestic goods of inferior quality, and at high prices, to boot. It is also difficult to purchase imported goods because of high duties on imports, and consumers are waiting for better times to come. As has already been said, both the reduction in the rate of inflation which has begun and the hardening of the macroeconomic policy proclaimed by the government create favorable conditions for overcoming the crisis through a rise in investment. Who Is Threatened With Bankruptcy? At the same time, we should be aware of the fact that lower inflation will cause the bankruptcy of: a) many banks, which will be unable to recover the credit extended due to the insolvency of the enterprises and organizations using credit which hoped to make money by selling goods at high prices in the inflationary environment. It is estimated that more than one-half of the existing banks may pass from the stage, and both organizations and the population that have deposited money at these banks will suffer losses. The above also applies to investment funds and various credit and finance institutions. This process has already begun, and it will mount rapidly; b) many intermediate commercial structures engaging in speculative operations on the basis of the inflationary growth of prices will also go bankrupt. Almost all small companies which profiteered by selling sugar have already disappeared because the wholesale price of sugar in Russia is decreasing. Regular trade in it has become unprofitable; c) many enterprises will go bankrupt whose products are not in demand at the prices set by these enterprises, prices that are due to high production outlays (the latter is associated with the inefficiency of production). Bankruptcy does not necessarily mean the liquidation of a given enterprise; the enterprise may be placed under a larger commercial structure which will assume the debts and in the future may organize more effective production at the facilities of the enterprise. To Survive Intelligently Of course, a majority of the enterprises will survive during this, perhaps the most difficult time of the period of transition to a market economy. However, they will be able to survive solely by reducing the cost of production because it will be impossible to pass on their excessive costs to the consumer in the environment of a sales crisis. Reducing the strength, spinning off the ineffective sections of enterprises, and switching to strict austerity measures in all areas are the easiest paths toward cost reductions. The growth of unemployment will come as a result of this process which is unfolding before our eyes and which will intensify. At present, registered unemployed in Russia account for approximately 1 percent of labor force. By using their methods for the calculation of the number of unemployed, unemployment experts from Western Europe have actually found that the unemployed account for 5-6 percent of the labor force, including those who work shorter workdays or have been furloughed without pay. It is projected that by the end of the year this statistic can grow to 7-10 percent which will substantially depend on the activities of the state. The state may provide incentives for the creation of new jobs, organize public works to use the nonworking population, and so on. A social program of assistance to the unemployed has yet to be seriously thought through. The existence of mass unemployment which is characteristic of countries with market economies is the largest social problem, social ill, and plague of society which we will have to encounter to the fullest extent shortly. The issue of insolvency of enterprises is inseparably linked to all of the above problems. The total indebtedness of enterprises has come to about R32 trillion, of which defaulted payments come to R16 trillion. The volume of indebtedness comes to approximately 10 percent of the gross national product which is generally quite significant but not fatal. There Is No Panacea; a Set of Measures Is Needed As is known, in the second half of 1992 the insolvency of enterprises was sharply reduced by way of mutual clearing on one hand and the provision of funds on preferential terms to replenish the working capital of enterprises on the other. This made it possible to reduce total nonpayments from R3.2 trillion in the middle of 1992 to R400 billion in the fourth quarter of the same year. That is to say, in comparable prices the reduction came to a factor of more than 20. Unfortunately, this experience taught us nothing; no economic mechanism was worked out for the organization of regular payments in the economy. As a result, mutual insolvency began to mount gradually in the face of government inaction during all of 1993 and the first quarter of 1994. The time has now come to take measures because due to such indebtedness the payment of wages is delayed and individual enterprises shut down, which is fraught with the most serious consequences. A single measure, a panacea for all troubles in this area hardly exists; a set of measures to fundamentally improve the system of payments in the national economy is needed. First, the requirement to pay before the contractual deadline should be made stricter. At present, many enterprises have funds but nonetheless delay payment for the products already received. The arbitration mechanism is imperfect, slow, and ineffective in this area. In a number of cases, the supplier may not refuse to deliver products because this has been ordained by the state (for example, the delivery of oil to specific refineries). In the process, neither the state nor the consumer himself is liable for the timing of the payment, which also needs to be corrected. The cycle of nonpayments frequently runs into and is sustained by the hopelessly ineffective enterprises which are "in debt up to their eyeballs," and there are no prospects in view for them. In this case, there is only one way out--to declare the enterprises bankrupt and to break the entire insolvency cycle. The use of bills of exchange, including those with bank guarantees, is one of the possible devices for bringing temporary insolvency into regular confines. In this area, the initiative of the Tveruniversalbank impresses many people. Small Business Is a Major Thing The development of small businesses is an important condition for overcoming the crisis, alleviating unemployment, and raising the standard of living of individual groups of the populace. Russia is virtually the only country that does not grant major preferences for the development of legal small businesses. At the same time, small business companies enjoy major tax relief and financial and other support from the state in countries with developed market economies. For this reason, the number of small business companies is usually counted in millions (France, Italy, Japan, the United States, and others), and the number of their employees exceeds 3 percent of the total number of the population. As far as Russia is concerned, about 450 [as published] small enterprises and organizations have been officially registered (0.3 percent of the total population). At the same time, hundreds of thousands of other small organizations operate illegally and engage in small business through stands and flea markets, through the system of customer orders, and so on, paying no taxes in the process. The development of small businesses will make it possible to substantially increase the employment of the population in the environment of looming unemployment and also to provide additional income for many families. Besides, this is the most dynamic sector of the economy, which quickly adapts to changing conditions and, consequently, ensures that public needs are met to a fuller extent. Large state enterprises, which have been unable to genuinely plug into the market and largely continue to manufacture old products not sufficiently in demand are facing the most difficult situation in the crisis environment. Enterprises that have technically been converted to the joint-stock format are among such enterprises. At the same time, privately owned enterprises and organizations (in our country, they are frequently referred to as "commercial structures") survive with greater success, and many altogether prosper. In conjunction with this, genuine privatization--one of the most important prerequisites for starting up the market mechanism and turning it into an engine of growth--becomes tremendously important. Where Is the Genuine Proprietor? An overwhelming proportion of Russian enterprises converted to the joint-stock format has actually passed through the first stage of such conversion--the private distribution of shares and check auctions at which on the average 20 percent of the package of shares were sold. Neither the arrangement of private subscription nor sales at check auctions have yielded actual financial resources which are necessary for the recovery and development of the newly created joint-stock enterprises. The assembly line of investment tenders that was promised in the privatization program has failed to kick in. The number of investment tenders is two orders of magnitude smaller than that of check auctions. Therefore, an overwhelming majority of enterprises that converted to the joint-stock format have not been appraised by the market and, consequently, have not found their genuine proprietor. Meanwhile, it is precisely finding a genuine proprietor that is the essence of privatization. To this end, the stock of a given enterprise needs to be appraised by the market and sold and bought freely. Such stock will be gradually redistributed through the stock market, and a considerable proportion of it will end up in the possession of individual commercial structures, banks, or groups of persons whether or not employed at the enterprise in question. The main point is for this proprietor to have a vested financial interest in the profitable, gainful operation of the enterprise in question, to believe in it, to invest funds, and to facilitate its development, i.e. behave as a zealous proprietor would. Actually, the entire post-privatization operation of an enterprise will be associated with determining the market price of this enterprise, finding a "proprietor"--the main owner, restructuring, and possibly changing the output mix of the enterprise in question in order to produce more effective results. First, attention should be focused on marketing services. In the market, the main point is to sell goods rather than produce them. Large companies should have proprietary or subsidiary commercial organizations or dealers to sell or service products. Vertically integrated companies that engage not only in producing raw materials but include the entire chain all the way to the consumer are the most effective in the market. Oil companies whose main business is the processing of oil, production of petrochemicals, and in particular their own chains of gas stations rather than oil production are a vivid example. Compare this to a majority of our oil associations, and their ineffectiveness and low profit margins will become easy to understand. However, the first embryos of vertically integrated companies are also appearing in this lagging sector (Lukoyl, YUKAS). Second, the closest possible attention should be paid to the development of the financial services of enterprises. In many cases, special financial corporations reporting to large producers should be established, and industrial enterprises need to be transformed into industrial and financial groups. Few joint-stock companies actually use their potential for public shareholding; meanwhile, joint-stock companies are mostly formed to attract additional capital. Some Germes or, worse yet, Neftalmazinvest which have virtually no property raise tens and at times hundreds of billions of rubles by issuing various securities, promising high dividends, and so on, whereas our largest oil and diamond-producing enterprises possessing enormous property do nothing to this end and go without funds. Third, strong legal services are necessary. Therefore, a fundamental reorientation of the operation of enterprises is necessary. It would also be good to eliminate from circulation the term "industrial enterprise," and rather refer to them as firms, companies, and societies, and establish such, meaning by this the entire cycle of operations that includes not only production, on which we used be fixated most of all in the past, but also commerce and finance. [Begin box] Taxes have altogether smothered enterprises, and the 1994 budget is no exception. Once again, additional taxes are being introduced, and some of those already in existence are being made stricter. Given this tax load, no leeway is left for maneuvering. I found the highest tax--92.5 percent--at the Surgutneft, the only prosperous association. This is a disaster! Clearly, with taxes like this it is impossible to do anything, to either drill wells or prospect for oil; nor is there money to sustain the social sphere. At present, the government understands that the crisis will not be overcome with such taxes. I think that a certain lightening of the tax burden will follow soon. [end box]
