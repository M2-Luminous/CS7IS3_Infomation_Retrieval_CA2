Piskunov, candidate of economic sciences, senior instructor, Frunze Military Academy, under rubric "Military Economics"] [Text] The cessation of global confrontation of the two superpowers is noteworthy in the fact that assurance of national security today is linked to a large extent with resolution not so much of military as of economic problems. The concept of economic security has appeared in this connection; its content encompasses a wide spectrum of purely economic phenomena affecting survivability, strengthening of society's social and political stability, and strengthening of the state's international positions. Military, technological, raw material, ecologic and sociopolitical components of Russia's security largely form under the influence of government economic policy and of processes occurring in the national economy (see the functional diagram of conversion). Therefore it is quite an obvious fact that conversion also may substantially affect both national security as a whole as well as its components. The problem is to ensure that transformations in the defense sector contribute most effectively to realization of Russian Federation national-state interests. Functional Diagram of Conversion It may appear that a reduction in military production that is forced (not so much politically as economically) will entail an inevitable weakening of national military might, but let us recall that it was this might that for decades undermined the foundations of the civilian economy, which was not only administrative-bureaucratic, but also simply poorly developed and technologically backward. Under these conditions a very important requirement of economic security is that reduced military production volumes be compensated through modernization and growth of the civilian sector of the economy by concentrating the "conversion potential" in those sectors of the national economy which set the tone for S&T progress and determine prospects for society's industrial and social development. Let us recall that we began conversion with neither a serious theoretical foundation nor substantiated plans and programs. This determined the complexity of its practical implementation. In essence, our conversion strides ahead of theory with but one purpose--to close gaping breaches in the economy as quickly as possible and at any cost. But we already are seeing a transition from general euphoria concerning the socioeconomic capacities of conversion to more weighed assessments of the costs of its implementation, its speed and its depth. Calculations show that it is implausible to expect a serious return in the next 2-3 years. Costs of renovating and changing the specialties of enterprises will be rather considerable in many cases. The depth of conversion is no simple matter. What is its optimum value that ensures a socioeconomic effect and preserves sufficient mobilization readiness of the military sector of the economy? The question of the speed of conversion also is no less important. The opinion of specialists is that if we act in a vigorous, considered manner, then conversion of the defense industry will take at least 5-6 years. A number of stages is envisaged. The first (1.5-2 years) is passage of legislative measures, scientific substantiation of programs and plans, and creation of conversion management structures. The second (3-4 years) is development of the economic machinery of conversion with consideration for ensuring the necessary level of mobilization readiness. And the third (in 6 years) is real economic return. The present conversion is for now very far from its principal objective of strengthening national economic security based on increased competitiveness of domestic products on the world market. The obvious interrelationship of conversion and economic aspects of national security makes transformations in the defense complex a task of strategic importance. In carrying out conversion one must not lose sight of ensuring the necessary level of Army and Navy combat readiness. From a military-economic standpoint, conversion effectiveness can be achieved only if military-economic principles are implemented along with socioeconomic ones in conducting it: Assurance of a sufficient level of mobilization readiness in conversion enterprises; flexibility of conversion programs and plans for accomplishing a possible maneuver; optimum combination of the interests of national socioeconomic development and an increase in qualitative parameters of the Armed Forces; priority orientation of conversion enterprises in the military sector of the economy toward satisfying socioeconomic needs of servicemen and their families. Consideration of these principles will permit minimizing conversion's negative influence on material foundations of Army and Navy combat effectiveness and combat readiness. The role of conversion in Russia's economic revival and national security grows even more as a result of the delay in the West giving financial aid to our reform. In the opinion of many domestic and foreign experts, granting of a credit of three billion by the International Monetary Fund [IMF] and creation of a ruble stabilization fund are being postponed for an indefinite period. Under these conditions Russia simply has no one to count on except internal reserves. The production and S&T potential of conversion enterprises thus can become the key to solving economic security problems. Here are just a few figures: Up until recently the defense complex produced 92 percent of equipment for light industry, 76 percent of equipment for agricultural machine building enterprises and 83 percent of medical equipment. As of the beginning of 1993 the defense complex provided 100 percent of television sets, sewing machines and cameras; 98 percent of tape recorders and refrigerators; 95 percent of computers; and 81 percent of motor units [motoblok]. Considering the enormous importance of the defense complex for the Russian economy as a whole, it is legitimate to view conversion essentially as a synonym for a structural policy followed within the scope of economic reform. In essence we are speaking of a dual understanding of conversion. Viewed in the broad sense, it coincides in content with transformation of the entire economic system and represents a transition from a deeply militarized state economy to a market economy. But in the narrow sense conversion usually is interpreted as a structural perestroyka affecting only military production. But economic reform in Russia is slipping. In excluding serious state intervention and effective structural policy for now, it essentially caused spontaneous, poorly regulated conversion which has given rise to a threat not only to national defense capability, but also to the entire industrial and technological potential. In our view, in the situation at hand it is necessary to localize military production at a limited number of enterprises forming the nucleus of the defense complex. That is first. Second, no more than ten percent of existing specialized enterprises should be included in this nucleus. A second layer (approximately 30 percent) should be made up of enterprises with "mixed" production, and the order for their manufacture of products should be formed primarily on a contract [kontraktnyy] basis. The other defense complex enterprises receive full independence, with fulfillment of military orders on an agreement [dogovornyy] basis. Third, the nucleus of defense complex enterprises, which is concentrated in Russia, should have a territorially closed technological cycle for selected models of weapons and military equipment. Participation of enterprises of other CIS countries in cooperation in arms production is advisable based on ordinary contractual [dogovornyy] relations, but it is also necessary to take into account here the risk of destroying inter-republic economic ties and deliveries because of a complication of political relations. That is fourth. Fifth, it is reasonable to reject today's existing demands for keeping reserve capacities in readiness and localize this problem in the defense complex nucleus. And sixth is the activation of arms and military equipment exports as an important factor of supporting the Russian defense complex. All this dictates the need for changing general approaches to conversion. What can be done in today's far from simple situation? Appropriate conditions must be created for reliable functioning of defense enterprises in a transition to the market, and their support, including direct and indirect measures, must be ensured. Direct measures are state budget appropriations for creating arms and for conversion, state orders, and requirements established by directive on certain kinds of activity connected with strengthening defense capability. Indirect measures take in many spheres: Economic (determining benefits and so on); organizational (creating public and commercial organizations to assist conversion enterprises); legislative (adopting laws, edicts and other legal documents regulating the sale of stocks and privatization and conversion of enterprises); information (creating data banks, advertising) and so on. It stands to reason that implementation of these measures requires formation of a conversion market infrastructure, including such elements as, for example, commodities and raw materials exchanges which resolve problems of material and technical supply and sale of products of conversion enterprises. Financial support organizations (investment funds, specialized banks which guarantee investments, provide insurance, and conduct securities operations) also are called upon to play an important role. One cannot get by without functional cost-accounting organizations, which will assume responsibility for certain kinds of activity--foreign economic (including the weapons trade), reference information, marketing, advertising and publishing, security measures and so on. Independent organizations and councils (a unique "conversion lobby") should develop priorities and an agreed-upon policy on conversion directions and assist in passage of appropriate bills, and consulting bureaus should assist in developing and implementing conversion programs through various services: Information analysis, consulting, auditing and so on. The State Committee on Conversion Affairs, the IMF, the VPIK [Military-Industrial Investment Company] and the RIAO [Russian Investment Stock Company] already are functioning in Russia. According to estimates made by these organizations, the volume of capital investments for conversion during 1991-1995 is projected to be R50 billion (in 1990 prices). Analyzing results of the first stage of reform, it can be said that "shock therapy" hardly is applicable for such a rigidly centralized formation as the defense complex. In our view, a well thought out, echeloned conversion program would allow not only preserving and transforming the defense industry's scientific research and technological nucleus, but also would help strengthen the economic foundations of national security. Specialists call breaking out of the crisis by using capacities of the defense complex the "conversion leap" of the economy. Such "leaps" were observed in the United States, Germany and Japan following World War II. The present Russian economy also retains potential capabilities, but it should be borne in mind that, as we already noted, conversion requires enormous outlays. In this connection I would like to cite one more opinion of experts: Under present conditions a reduction of 1 ruble in the military order involves 1.5 rubles needed to finance conversion measures. Hence the growing importance of commercialization and self-financing of defense sector enterprises which are changing specialization. The following conclusions can be drawn from what has been said: Conversion of military production must be given the status of state economic policy. Attempts to orient the production and economic might of the military-industrial complex toward consumer goods production must be precluded, for this would signify destruction of our national wealth. A portion of the military-industrial complex (the "defense nucleus") should be preserved in its initial purpose of strengthening Russia's new defense policy. And the main thing at which conversion enterprises should be aimed is the use of technological and professional potential for designing, manufacturing and introducing supermodern technological systems for manufacturing civilian products. In my view, taking these suggestions into account will permit ensuring Russia's dependable military-economic security. COPYRIGHT: "Voyenno-ekonomicheskiy zhurnal", 1993.
