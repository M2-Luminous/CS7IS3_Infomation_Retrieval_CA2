Since 1990, this is the fifth Solidarity Day to support Kashmir's struggle for freedom. It was started on the appeal by Qazi Hussein Ahmed, leader of the Tehriq-i Islami. Mian Nawaz Sharif's state government in Punjab and the Azad Kashmir government had announced their full support for it, and soon the Benazir government at the Center had to follow suit. As a result, 5 February has attained the status of Kashmir's national day. The first 5 February Day, in 1989, was in memory of the more than 200 unarmed citizens who were killed by firing in Indian-occupied Kashmir. This was the beginning of people's movement against the oppressor, India. In occupied Jammu-Kashmir, this people's defiance movement has spread fully to 10 Muslim-majority districts out of a total of 14. These include all of the six Muslim majority districts in Kashmir; three of the six Muslim majority districts in Jammu; and three districts in Laddakh, one of which is a Muslim majority district. The three districts of Jammu--Udhampur, Kathua, and the Buddhist majority district of Laddakh--are not fully peaceful now. Thus, the city of Jammu itself is not free of this movement. The same situation exists in Udhampur and Leh. From these 14 districts, Kathua is the only one where the mujaheddin have not made any remarkable achievement toward freedom. District Doda in Jammu area, which is a Muslim majority district settled on both sides of the River Chenab, is very important because of its strategic location. It is also the center of the movement, just like the Kashmir valley. One can judge how serious the movement here is from the fact that during the Indian home minister's visit to this place, freedom fighters attacked the helicopters of oppressive India, in which the minister went to Doda. The Indian army had a hard time protecting its home minister. These incidents and details explain the situation of the movement in Jammu and Kashmir. This fact is clear to India, the United States, which claims to be the leader of the world, and its ally and advisor in world affairs, Great Britain. In addition to massacres and ravages in Kashmir, they have ignored the resolutions ordering a plebiscite and are now starting the mischief called the "third option" in order to sabotage the Kashmir issue, which is on the UN's annual agenda. This trick is actually encouraging the freedom struggle. India and the United States are looking for a way to make Amanullah Khan, who lives in the Gilgit district of northern Kashmir, the leader of all of Kashmir. The arrest and release of Amanullah Khan in Belgium recently was part of a game played by India and the United States. But Amanullah Khan's third option slogan and his own personality do not have enough clout to attract the people of Jammu-Kashmir toward themselves. None of the active organizations in occupied Kashmir agree with Amanullah Khan's "third option." The third option is actually an Indian option because, in the arena of plebiscites, the Indian option has failed compared to the Pakistan option. It has failed so badly that one cannot find a Sheikh Abdullah or a Bakshi Ghulam Mohammed anymore. Further, even Farooq Abdullah, who served India as his father did for years, is nothing more than a political skeleton there. Thus, India is controlling this region with its armed forces, and India and its supporting world powers know that this kind of military occupation by spreading soldiers in every lane and village cannot be continued for many years. Therefore, these countries--the United States of America and Great Britain--have joined India and are trying to sabotage the freedom struggle in Jammu and Kashmir through the third option. The idea of the third option is so fallacious that when Amanullah Khan was recently asked why, after struggling so long to join Kashmir with Pakistan, he was talking about an independent Kashmir? Could he mention even one Hindu who had fought side by side along with the mujaheddin against the Indian army? Did the Hindu population ever join the freedom struggle, as the Muslim population did? In a situation when not even one Kashmiri Hindu has joined the struggle for independence from India, how can you establish an independent Kashmir? This third option seeks to divide the struggle for freedom and to put Jammu and Kashmir permanently under Indian slavery. The Muslims will be divided and will start to fight among themselves. The old imperialist formula of divide and rule is being labeled the third option in Kashmir. Amanullah Khan is talking in his naivete, or perhaps he wants to play the role of a new Sheikh Abdullah. This cannot remain hidden for long. An independent Kashmir is just not possible. It would just become an imperialist base between China and the Muslim countries of south and central Asia. But this will be an even more artificial nation than is Israel, and it will have no ideological, geographical, ethnic, or religious coordination. The three regions of Kashmir, from the Sindh valley to Chalas, from the Kashmir valley to the Jammu hills and the semi-hill district, are all separate from each other. But each of them is bound to Pakistan. Jammu and Kashmir can survive only by becoming a state of Pakistan and part of Pakistan. It cannot become a separate country, just like Sarhad or Sindh could not because of the inner strife these areas face. Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan, veteran leader of the Kashmir committee in the National Assembly, recently declared the third option unrealistic and illegal. He said, "The people of Kashmir want to join Pakistan and Pakistan only. They are making sacrifices for this purpose, and Pakistan is their only goal." At this time, despite all kinds of political differences in Pakistan, the Kashmir committee has formed a very strong platform here. This time, the strike on 5 February and the Solidarity Day to show support for Kashmir's freedom struggle are being organized under the Kashmir committee. This is the most appropriate opportunity to prepare this national platform for its next step in order to get independence for Kashmir. This is a good time, because there is a lot of interest in Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan, who can help formulate and implement a national policy on Kashmir. Further, Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan is not suffering any delusions about the Kashmir issue. The platform of the Kashmir committee should be made the focal point of the concerted effort of the whole Pakistani nation. This is a very important national issue, and it cannot be left on the government alone, regardless of which party leads it. In the context of this concerted effort, it is also important that everyone contribute whatever they can to this purpose. Madam Benazir Bhutto is trusted by the West, and her Western connections should also be used for this purpose. The Jamaat-i Islami has close relations with the freedom struggle in Kashmir, and it should be part of this effort. Mian Nawaz Sharif should spend all his energy on this goal. Other leaders of our country should mobilize the country's people and change world opinion at the political and diplomatic levels. They should try to make progress in whatever way they can and, under the Kashmir committee, make these efforts organized and powerful. Instead of making the success of the 5 February strike a goal into itself, we should look forward to the goal of freedom for Kashmir. In this context, we have to make some decisions about this national platform among ourselves and within this country, and some of these steps will be external and at the international level. The internal decisions are: 1. We must make Azad Kashmir the base camp for our freedom struggle. We have to establish unity there that is above political and group loyalties. It does not matter if there is the government of one-party or national government in Azad Kashmir; the government must be formed to reach our goals of independence. The Azad Kashmir government should copy the methodology employed by the mujaheddin. 2. To make the people part of the struggle for freedom, they should be given military training in Azad Kashmir and be armed. They should be given light weapons at the line of control so they can protect themselves. The armed people in Azad Kashmir will have the ability to respond to India's aggression. Only then can Azad Kashmir be the base camp for the independence struggle. 3. A united and potent leadership of independence movements should be encouraged in occupied Kashmir. This leadership will come from occupied Kashmir and not from Azad Kashmir. The leaders of the Pakistani government should not repeat their Afghanistan jihad mistake in Kashmir, and the formation of a political leadership for Kashmir should start now. In this context, one should rise above party loyalties and, at this point, Sayyed Ali Gailani, former opposition leader, can emerge as the sole leader in Kashmir. He should be considered the political leader of occupied Kashmir. By rising above political party loyalties and acting in the greater interest of Kashmir's freedom, a political struggle should start under his leadership. One should never even think that he is the leader of Jamaat-i Islami of occupied Kashmir and that therefore, Pakistan's Jamaat-i Islami will get credit. The question here is not of getting credit, but of freeing this region, without which Pakistan's existence cannot be protected or stabilized. When a person from a specific party is accepted at that level, he does not belong to that party. In our recent history of Pakistani politics, Maulana Mufti Mehmood is the best example of this process. We can all agree on Sayyed Ali Gailani. His sacrifices, continuous jailing, and political background have made him the only person in Kashmir whom everyone can trust. Now Pakistan and Azad Kashmir are also expressing an interest in him. He can be included in negotiations with India or with any international group as a representative of occupied Kashmir for its freedom. Until now, the independence movement in occupied Kashmir has been like a chicken with its head cut off. When the time for negotiations comes, we will need a leader, and that leader is Sayyed Gailani. The steps to be taken at the international level are: 1. Muslim countries, especially Iran and the Gulf countries, must be made aware of India's expansionist designs. Pundit Nehru decided that the goal for India was to control from east of the Suez to the Pacific Ocean, or from Iraq to Indonesia. Every Indian government makes this its national goal and is moving toward this. An economic boycott of India over the Kashmir issue will be a big blow to its expansionist designs. Not only will the path for Kashmiri independence be paved within a few months, but also, India would be cut down to size. In the ocean of the Muslim world, it is the only non-Muslim country, and it cannot continue living there like a crocodile. 2. The moral support for Kashmir's struggle for freedom does not mean help in words only. The real moral support is the kind the Muslim world provided during the Afghan struggle for freedom. Kashmir is a disputed territory where India has led aggression. The people of Kashmir, under the UN charter, had a right to individual and group defense. This is the stand that the government of Pakistan, through the Kashmir committee, can publicize at the international level. 3. From human rights issues to UN resolutions, there are many items that can be used to change world opinion about Kashmir. The aggressor India could be defeated at every step with these points. It is imperative, however, that all political powers in Pakistan promise to work closely and cooperatively. 4. Preparations must be made to present this issue at the United Nations at the diplomatic level, and to pave the way for establishing peace in this region through a UN resolution. The goal should be to make sure that the international community has no other alternative but to follow up on the resolution passed in the Security Council. 5. The last aspect of this is that India, seeing its defeat in Kashmir, might start a war against Pakistan. India's past record also points to this. But India's military grasp is not powerful enough to make such a mistake. This is not 1987, when Pakistan was occupied in Afghanistan and the people there had not challenged its occupation of Kashmir. Still, if India makes this mistake, and if the Kashmir committee and the Pakistani government make preparations inside the country and at the international level, then India will not only be defeated badly, but the Indian union will also come asunder like the Soviet Union. The end of the Indian union is possible just like the end of the Soviet Union, because both were established unfairly and by force. After the British left, instead of making this a free subcontinent, it has become a skeleton of nations in the form of an Indian union. The situation is conducive to Kashmir's freedom, and if our government leadership still sees Kashmir's independence in the American plan, then it would be a major blunder.
