The heads of state of North and South Korea are ready to hold a historic summit meeting. A preparatory meeting for this summit will be held in the cease-fire village, Panmunjom, on 28 June. The United States has relaxed its tone, saying that if the DPRK is willing to freeze its nuclear program and accept the relevant conditions on nuclear transparency, sanctions will be suspended. Why could Clinton not make the situation develop toward relaxation in the previous period? But when Carter proceeded with mediatory work, the situation began to "brighten." Some people said that Clinton was pretending to be harsh, whereas Carter was pretending to be honest; they were cooperating with each other and using both hard and soft tactics; as a result, the situation changed for the better. But other people said that this exactly portrays a decline in U.S. strength. Unaware of the actual strength of the U.S., Clinton sent out a high-pitched action signal, but he could not implement it. Therefore, Carter went to Pyongyang for an informal visit, during which results were achieved. Clinton immediately said that "there are indications of hope" and acknowledged that a summit meeting between North and South Korea will be a constructive breakthrough. Clinton's miscalculation resulted from his prolonged idea that the United States was powerful; he thought that if the United States meted out "sanctions," a small country would knuckle under, obey orders, and be willing to be dominated by hegemonism. But even small countries like Somalia and Haiti have rendered the United States at its wit's end and put it in an awkward situation. The U.S. hard-line attitude on the Korean peninsula has pushed it into a blind alley. Imposing pressure cannot necessarily resolve problems, whereas talks are the way to improve understanding and dispel misunderstanding. A U.S. internal analysis of Clinton's sanctions program against the DPRK indicates that the United States is at a disadvantage and that there is too much risk involved. 1) The United States is making all-out efforts to pursue a foreign policy of participating in Asia-Pacific economic cooperation, but sanctions will cause confrontation and a tense situation in the Asia-Pacific region. This is unfavorable to Asia-Pacific economic development and will be resisted by Asia-Pacific countries; sanctions cannot last long and could ruin U.S. strategic interests in the Asia-Pacific region if implemented by force. 2) U.S. sanctions may force the DPRK to adopt a stronger attitude or withdraw from the nuclear nonproliferation treaty; in such a case, it will be difficult for the United States to carry out nuclear inspection in the DPRK. A confrontation between the United States and the DPRK could finally lead to U.S. involvement in a war. 3) If force is used, the United States will suffer casualties. Waging a war abroad will trigger internal controversy; the United States, which is experiencing an economic depression, does not need to take such a great risk. 4) Clinton does not have a detailed plan for using force as a backup. How many troops will he dispatch? How long will the United States fight? How big will the scale of the war be? If Congress does not support it, he will back off from the plan. The United States always assumes a harsh posture before talks are held, in an attempt to silence its opponent and make it yield, so that it can gain the upper hand at the negotiating table. But after assuming a magnanimous posture, its character usually comes to light--ability falling short of ambition. If its opponent insists, it will back off. This "Solomon-type" [as published] trick has become outdated. Is the DPRK developing nuclear weapons? Russia is the country which designed the nuclear reactor for the DPRK. A senior person in charge of Russian nuclear energy said that the assertion that the DPRK is developing nuclear weapons is a vilification; the DPRK is not manufacturing nuclear weapons. Clinton's "sanctions" have, on the contrary, provided the DPRK with an opportunity to bargain--it can conduct diplomatic contacts with the United States through "freezing its production of nuclear weapons." The upcoming dramatic development will be: The United States and the DPRK will hold talks in Geneva. The noise of "sanctions" has temporarily subsided.
