An accord between Israelis and Palestinians regarding the withdrawal of troops from the Gaza Strip and Jericho could be reached in the next two weeks. This is what Yitzhaq Rabin said today at a news conference: [Begin Rabin recording, in English with superimposed Portuguese translation] It will be done in a few weeks, more than two weeks. And I don't believe that it is advisable to be discussing a specific timetable at the moment. I can assure you it will be less than three months as originally planned. The real problem now is not how quickly the accord will be implemented once it is reached, but how we reach it. I am very sorry to have to say this, but it will take longer than two weeks. [end recording] [Announcer] That was the Israeli prime minister, translated by Miguel Moreira. Prime Minister Cavaco Silva was also at the news conference. He said that Portugal supports an agreement between the EC and Israel as long as mutual interests are safeguarded.
