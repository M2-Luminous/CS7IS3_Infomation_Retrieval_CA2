Foreign Minister Hata said: The coalition parties are working hard to steer the government. But, we just cannot continue indefinitely to keep the current process, in which the parties take every single issue to their own party for consensus before the coalition makes a decision as a while. He then said: Rather than insisting on keeping our own party, I would like to form a strong and stable political force which can compete with the Liberal Democratic Party. I do not mind calling it a new new-party [shin shinto]. In this way he renewed his willingness to form a two-party system, in which change of power can be realized.
