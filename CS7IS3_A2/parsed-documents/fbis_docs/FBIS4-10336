Bussi also indicated that the results of the elections "have exploded the dream" of Governor Ortega of being President Carlos Menem's number two on the ticket for the 1995 elections. "His balloon has burst," Bussi stressed in remarks to a radio station. "Please forgive my lack of modesty, but I believe I have been winning ever since I entered politics because the people of Tucuman have no other reasons to forget the recent past, when the province had me as governor," he said. Bussi maintained that "as no governor has yet surpassed my governorship, the people are thinking about the past," and he reiterated that the decision of the voters "is a severe alert to Ortega to once and for all start governing the province." The former provincial governor indicated that he has not yet studied the possibility of running for the governorship in the next elections and stated that the decision will be made by the members of the Republican Force.
