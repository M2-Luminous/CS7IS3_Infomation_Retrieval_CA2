Norwegian industry, which is in difficulties, is operating on the strength of considerable state subsidies. According to recent European Free Trade Association [EFTA] statistics, industry in Norway receives subsidies that are nearly twice as high as in Finland, for instance. Ulla-Maria Johansen reports: [Johansen] Of the countries seeking EU membership, Norway's industry is in the relatively weakest position because it receives most state subsidies in relation to each industrial job. According to EFTA's state subsidy statistics, each industrial job in Norway received over 15,000 kroner or over 11,000 markkas in state subsidies in 1992. Finnish industry came second, with each industrial job receiving a state subsidy of over 6,000 markkas, nearly 50 percent less than Norwegian industry. Sweden comes third and Austria fourth in the statistics. Without EU membership, it is feared that the position of Norwegian industry and industrial jobs will weaken considerably. Both Norwegian and major foreign enterprises are threatening to leave the country if the Norwegians say no to the EU in next November's referendum. Kvaerner, Europe's biggest shipbuilder and owner of the Masa-Yards shipyard in Finland, will be moving its head office to the EU region. Of foreign companies, Alcatel STK and ABB are threatening to move their production and investments away from Norway if the nation says no to the EU. Japanese companies that are currently investing in the Norwegian market also intend to leave the country along with the EU membership plan [as heard]. The latest threat comes from the Japanese giant (Itoshu) Corporation, which has a turnover of nearly 1 trillion markkas. (Itoshu), investing in anything from the fishing industry to the car industry, has so far invested less than 1 billion markkas a year in Norway, but the company's plans are grand if Norway joins the EU. If Norway remains outside and Sweden and Finland become members, (Itoshu) regards the future of Norway's neighboring countries as bright for Japanese investments. This is Ulla-Maria Johansen in Oslo.
