"We can tell that we have affirmed our position with regard to the Partnership for Peace. It was my duty to express Romania's stance in the plenary session. Our position was very much appreciated and we are waiting to see as soon as possible the criteria that we have to match in order to integrate within this organisation," said Ion Ratiu. "We are supporters and active participants in the Partnership for Peace program with the clear intention to integrate within the NATO structures. Our efforts must be sustained by an internal evolution toward a stable and prosperous economy (...) so that Romania is among the group of countries to be received in NATO in the first five years," said Deputy Petre Roman. "To the basic document called 'The NATO Enlargement' we have contributed with some clarifications concerning Romania's contribution during the war in the Gulf, its contribution to the peace-keeping forces operating in Somalia, the price paid by Romania because of the embargoes against Iraq and Yugoslavia and the clear openness showed by Romania with respect to military cooperation."
