As the FRG Defense Ministry confirmed in Bonn on Tuesday [7 June], in return for the 120 new and 160 old Leopard II tanks, 809 MTLB armored personnel carriers, and 350 Russian BMP armored vehicles from the stocks of the National People'e Army (NVA) that the Swedish Government wants to buy; the FRG commits itself to concluding a compensation deal of equal size over the next 10 years. In order to get the billion-mark order for 160 or perhaps even 200 new tanks from Sweden for the German armament industry, FRG Defense Minister Volker Ruehe (Christian Democratic Union) has made concessions. In April last year it still looked as if the FRG were to be defeated by the competition of Britain and the United States for the armament deal, because Ruehe hesitated to agree to Sweden's demand for a corresponding compensation deal. At that time the Swedes were irritated that the German side required "rather a lot of time" for the negotiations. The skeleton agreements, signed by Ruehe and his Swedish counterpart Anders Bjorck in Stockholm on Monday, now provide for 100-percent compensation as demanded by Sweden, in addition to the almost free old NVA materiel, but they do not set down specific projects for this purpose. Details are to be determined in agreements that are to be extended from one year to the next. The point will not be the purchase of Swedish "large-scale systems" for the Bundeswehr but equipment components, e.g. for the Navy or the Air Force, a spokesman of the ministry in Bonn said. Thus, one might conceive of the purchase of engines, drive aggregates, or guided missiles. For Bonn there is very little prospect of a compensation deal involving the Swedish JAS-Gripen fighter plane, which is favored by Sweden, since the FRG is involved in the development of the "Eurofighter 2000" aircraft, and next year the decision on the procurement of this "Eurofighter" must be made. Future cooperation in the development of a new generation of combat aircraft and submarines is being considered, however, it was said in Stockholm. It was also learned from the Swedish Defense Ministry that 75 percent of the compensation deal will involve the sale of Swedish armament goods and 25 percent the sale of civilian high-tech products. In addition, both sides agreed that only 30 of the new tanks for the Swedish Army will be built by Krauss-Maffei in the FRG; all others are to be produced in Sweden with a license. Instead of being scrapped, the 350 Russian armored vehicles from NVA stocks are to be offered to Sweden to replace its vehicles which have been used up in the UN mission in Bosnia. Bjorck justified the purchase by citing better protection for troop transports -- in Sweden the armored vehicles are to replace tarpaulin-covered trucks -- as well as the favorable price. The Swedish Army has bought the NVA vehicles at the "unit price of a used Volvo," Bjorck said.
