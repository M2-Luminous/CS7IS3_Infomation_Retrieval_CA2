FBIS4-15823 "drsov070_t_94005" FBIS-SOV-94-070 Daily Report 8 Apr 1994 BALTIC STATES Estonia Accord on Paldiski Reactors `Almost Reached' Accord on Paldiski Reactors `Almost Reached' WS0804155394 Tallinn BNS in English 1407 GMT 8 Apr 94 WS0804155394 Tallinn BNS English BFN [Text] Tallinn, Apr 08, BNS -- In the 18th round of the Estonian-Russian negotiations, the parties almost reached agreement on the dismantling of the Paldiski nuclear reactors, Ago Tiiman, secretary of the Estonian delegation for the talks and head of the military issues working group, said at a press conference today. Tiiman told reporters Estonia put forward an "entirely new idea" for dismantling the reactors at Paldiski, which the Russian side is now studying. "The proposal differs from the earlier ones," Tiiman said. "Our position is that the rods must be removed from the reactors by the end of June, and the rest of the jobs, such as dismantling the reactors and removing nuclear wastes, completed as quickly as possible." Tiiman declined to disclose the details of the idea, but declared Estonia's new plan would be optimal in costing the country less than 10 million U.S. dollars. The dismantling of the reactors takes place in three stages. Tiiman said in the first stage nuclear fuel is removed from the reactors and taken out of Estonia; Russia will remove "military secrets" from the reactors during the second stage; and, lastly, the reactors and nuclear wastes will be transported to Russia. Should Russia agree to Estonian proposals, the complete dismantling of the nuclear reactors in Paldiski will take roughly three years. Juri Tikk, special representative of the government in Paldiski, earlier said the first stage of dismantling is expected to begin in the second half of April. Russia will not allow even Estonian experts to attend the second stage of the operation, Tikk said, because they claim the reactors contain secret equipment. Rescue Department Director Harry Hein said a special rescue squad of over 300 men and 100 machines has been formed to ensure security during the dismantling operation. The unit comprises fire, rescue, medical, law and order enforcement, evacuation, and other task forces, he said.
