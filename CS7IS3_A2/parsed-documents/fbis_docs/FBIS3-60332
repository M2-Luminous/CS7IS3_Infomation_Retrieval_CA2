None of the eight North Sea nations will be able to cut its nitrogen emissions in half, as was agreed on six years ago. The threat to the ecosystem of the sea will thus remain. The environment and agriculture ministers of the countries know this as they meet in Copenhagen on 7-8 December in order to discuss the protection of the North Sea. And in their hands they will get a fresh report in which researchers warn against the damaging effects on the marine environment if the countries' governments do not in earnest begin to deal with the nitrogen and phosphorus emissions. The rivers that flow into the North Sea are loaded with nitrogen compounds. According to the most recent calculations, about 1 million tons of nitrogen are added to the sea that way each year. Its origin is primarily commercial fertilizer in agriculture and wastewater; 75 percent of the "river nitrogen" comes from the Rhine and the Elbe. Furthermore, each year the North Sea receives about 600,000 tons of nitrogen in the form of fallout from the atmosphere. Automobile traffic and industrial processes are the biggest sources here. Overfertilizing In the central North Sea airborne transportation of nitrogen plays a greater role than river transportation, and the fallout of ammonia and nitric oxides in this sea has turned out to be greater than previously calculated. The addition of phosphates from the Rhine and Elbe is said to have decreased somewhat in recent years, but, at least as regards the Elbe, researchers are uncertain whether this is the result of lower pollution or because the flow of water during the sampling period was lower than usual. Thus, the overfertilization of the North Sea continues, despite the fact that at the Second North Sea Conference in London in 1987 the environment ministers of the affected countries agreed that nitrogen emissions must be reduced by 50 percent--from the 1985 level--by the year 1995. None of the countries will be able to meet that commitment. The effects of the massive nitrogen flow is, among others, that the balance between a variety of plant plankton (algae) is disturbed. Certain species spread at the expense of others and also increase their production of toxic substances when the supply of nitrogen becomes too high. An example of this phenomenon is the catastrophic accumulation of toxic algae in Skagerrak and Kattegat in 1968. At the Third North Sea Conference, in The Hague in 1990, heavy metals and organic environmental poisons such as dioxins and PCB's [polychlorinated biphenyl] were the principal theme. The ministers decided that the emissions of about 40 indicated substances were to be halved, here as well from the 1985 level, by 1995. The substances are given in a "blacklist." Four of the substances, cadmium, mercury, lead, and dioxins, are to be reduced by 70 percent over the same period because of their toxicity in the environment, according to the decision in The Hague. Uncertain Just what will happen to that goal is uncertain, judging by the levels of substances found in the bottom sediments and organisms of the North Sea. The researchers are saying, somewhat vaguely, that the "emissions have decreased, rather than increased." But even if the emissions have declined, it has still not had any impact on the North Sea. There, the levels of heavy metals and chloro-organic pollution are unchanged or even higher, in certain areas. Footnote: The data on emissions are taken from the 1987 "Quality Status of the North Sea," the most recent public report on the environmental condition of the North Sea. The data were submitted by the respective nations to an international research group, which has been given the task of following the development in the North Sea.
