According to information obtained by WELT AM SONNTAG, the Federal Government has received indications that another application for entry by Zhirinovskiy can be expected on the occasion of a "European Congress," which is to take place in Cologne at the beginning of February. On 29 December 1993 Zhirinovskiy was refused an entry visa. According to findings by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, the "European Congress" is being prepared by rightist German deputies of the European Parliament. According to findings by intelligence services, Zhirinovskiy intends to try to get intentional approval for his policy in Europe and to use his contacts with rightist German politicians for this purpose. At a joint press conference in Moscow this week, Zhirinovskiy assured DVU Chairman Gerhard Frey of "eternal friendship." On the same day, the Moscow public prosecutor's office initiated proceedings against Zhirinovskiy for war agitation.
