That was the biggest mistake...." He linked the long period the National Unity Party remained in power in the TRNC [Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus] with that factor. He also explained the drawbacks created by the failure of the opposition parties in the TRNC to form an alternative. Denktas visited SABAH yesterday. After so many years, he has begun to see things the way we do, although not entirely. His views on the package of confidence-building measures were realistic.... 1. He seemed prepared to hold talks on the package. 2. But he seemed reluctant to take a backward step on it.... The UN secretary general's report has not been drawn up. It was to have been submitted at the end of April. I believe the Western countries are gradually becoming aware of the holes in the second package. This has delayed the report. Turkey has categorically stated the following: "All the holes in the second package of confidence-building measures must be repaired. There can be no accepting that three of the holes will be repaired and the Turkish side should agree to make concessions in the other areas." Britain is the most influential country in the Cyprus problem. It long appeared disinterested. But recently it seems to have agreed that a balance must be established in the package.... That is good news.... Full Membership Developments are expected to take place in Cyprus during the current week.... New proposals will be made to establish a balance in the package.... The package, which has been ruptured in favor of the Greek Cypriot side, will be placed on the negotiating table to be repaired.... Meanwhile, the Greek Cypriot side's plans seem unending. They have raised the question of Cyprus becoming a full member of the European Union. That is what they have been working on for some time.... What the British and French ambassadors in Turkey must realize and explain to their governments is: "The TRNC must integrate with Turkey if the Greek Cypriot side joins the European Union. The Turkish Cypriots will have no alternative. The decision the European Union will adopt in favor of the Greek Cypriots will pave the way for the division of Cyprus...." Turkey has been trying to explain the danger to Europe but "What is Europe's approach to the issue?" That question can be answered as follows: "Some of them are indifferent. Many others are aware of the danger. Several pray that the calendar that has been established for a Cyprus settlement will be heeded, that is, they expect the problem to be solved by 1 January 1995...." Denktas explained the drawbacks in that. Henceforth he will move often and on every platform to explain the drawbacks of the Greek Cypriot side's joining the European Union. He will be justified in doing so. Missed Opportunities We will soon meet in Cyprus again to discuss the Cyprus problem in detail behind closed doors.... We have decided to do that. We will exchange views on the issue.... It seems that discussing the Cyprus problem with Rauf Denktas, who is one of the most experienced political negotiators, will be interesting.... We will inform you of the views we exchange apart from those that are outlined on the condition that they are not published. Denktas mentioned one expectation that has not been realized. No capital investments have been made by Turkish businessmen in the TRNC since 1974. Turkish industrialists have not established factories to operate in north Cyprus.... Denktas described the period from 1974 to 1978 as an era of "missed opportunities." He also criticized Turkey for allowing Archbishop Makarios to return to Cyprus after the Greek coup in 1974. He was justified in doing so.... Denktas was worried by Turkey's revelation that it agreed to the first package of confidence-building measures. He was worried because Ankara failed to consult him on the issue. We disagreed with Denktas on that point. Another aspect of the problem is that we may have to try to explain the situation to the White House, which is expected to influence the effort to solve the Cyprus problem. But the White House maintains an approach that conflicts with the recommendations of the U.S. State Department. Obviously, the U.S. State Department than the White House advisers of the realities in Cyprus. But it seems that it cannot surmount the obstacles created by the presidential advisers, who are influenced by the Greeks and Greek Cypriots. In view of that, I believe that the friends of Turkey at the U.S. Embassy in Ankara should make an effort to help the White House adopt the right approach.... The next few days may be very important for north Cyprus and Turkey. We must avoid making unnecessary statements to maintain our justified position. This applies particularly to Motherland Party leader Mesut Yilmaz. Yilmaz, do you understand what I mean?
