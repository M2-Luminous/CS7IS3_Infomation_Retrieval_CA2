By the end of 1993, more than 200 nuclear enterprises and enterprises posing a radiation threat that belong to such departments as the Ministry of Atomic Energy, Russian Federation Committee on the Defense Industry, Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Transportation, and Kurchatovskiy Institute Russian Scientific Center were examined. The Federal Oversight of Nuclear and Radiation Safety focused its attention on nuclear power plants. The results of the examination confirm that Russia's nuclear power plants are incapable of maintaining their equipment in a safe state or modernizing it. Twenty-nine units at nine nuclear power plants with a total statutory capacity of 21,242 MW are now operating in Russia. This includes 13 units with pressurized water reactors, 15 units with uranium-graphite channel-type reactors, and 1 unit with a fast neutron reactor. Nearly all currently operational power plant units were started up between 1971 and 1990. The only ``latecomer'' among them is the No. 4 unit at the Balakovo Nuclear Power Plant, which was put into operation in 1993. From a nuclear and radiation safeguarding standpoint, nuclear power plant units may be divided into two generations. The first-generation units were developed and constructed before the main domestic normative documents regulating safety in atomic energy came to light. Included among them are the Nos. 3 and 4 units of the Novovoronezh Nuclear Power Plant; the first two units at the Kola, Kursk, and Leningrad nuclear power plants; and the No. 4 unit at the nuclear power plant in Bilibino. In the opinion of experts of the Federal Oversight of Nuclear and Radiation Safety, they all require radical reconstruction because their obsolete and physically worn-out equipment and system components are in the habit of failing very frequently. When the second-generation units were developed, consideration was already given to the tolerances that had been introduced at the time. Today, however, the safety rules, and consequently the power plant units themselves, no longer conform to standards. The Federal Oversight of Nuclear and Radiation Safety has not recently recorded any accidents related to the meltdown of a reactor core or the release of any significant quantities of radioactive materials into the environment. Nor has it recorded any serious fires with the exception of a number of insignificant deflagrations and instances of blanketing with smoke. Incidents involving the operating failure of relief valves and, consequently, nondesign reactor unit shutdown cooling have had the biggest impact on the decrease in the safety of nuclear power plants. The most acute worsening of operating indicators was detected at the Kola Nuclear Power Plant. In the opinion of Federal Oversight of Nuclear and Radiation Safety observers, it is related to a careless attitude toward operating rules and equipment repair. Moreover, a check of the qualifications of about 5,000 technicians at nuclear facilities and facilities posing a radiation threat revealed that nearly 500 of them do not have sufficient knowledge of safety standards and rules. An analysis of violations at nuclear power plants indicates that a significant number, i.e., nearly 40 percent of all violations, have been due to shortcomings in the work of maintenance personnel. The state of radwaste removal has also become unsatisfactory. An increase in the amount of nuclear fuel stored on site at nuclear power plants and the complete absence of even any desire to remove it at power plants with RBMK, EGP, and MBM reactors have been observed. Another problem arising because of the accumulation of waste at nuclear power plants is that there are no free spaces for emergency dumping of the reactor's entire core. The currently existing system of handling radwaste was developed in the 1960s. For this reason not one Russian nuclear power plant has a complete set of units to prepare liquid and solid waste for burial. At the initiative of the Federal Oversight of Nuclear and Radiation Safety, the chairmen of its regional bodies took part in an interdepartmental commission to check the nuclear and radiation safety of the nuclear power facilities and equipment of the Russian Federation Navy's northern fleet. Judging by the results of the checks, the state of the overwhelming majority of the northern fleet's facilities and equipment is catastrophic. Personnel often operate the nuclear power plants of warships by the ``poke method,'' with the most flagrant violations of safety rules, and measures to bring them to the required level are left virtually untaken. It is therefore entirely natural that in the past year, seven navy men were hospitalized with a diagnosis of ``over-irradiation.'' Another problem that has evoked serious concern on the part of the Federal Oversight of Nuclear and Radiation Safety is the navy's handling of radwaste. Tanks to store it temporarily are overflowing, and the navy's admiralty is not taking any measures to clean things up. Meanwhile, navy men continue to insist that they do not need outside help.
