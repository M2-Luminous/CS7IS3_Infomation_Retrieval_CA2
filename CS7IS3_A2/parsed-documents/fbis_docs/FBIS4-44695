No Need for Radio Frequencies in Future Satellites"] [Text] Noordwijk--In 1997, for the first time in history, two satellites will transmit using light. It will only be a test, but data transfer using infrared lasers instead of radio waves ultimately promises great advantages. In an artist's impression or on a photograph of a hovering man-made moon, two significant components are instantly noticeable: the solar panels and the dish antenna. Such a view could drastically change if satellites start using optics for communication. The dish would disappear altogether and the solar panels would become smaller. Volume and weight savings are within reach, and those are powerful criteria in competitive space exploration. The European Space Agency (ESA) will therefore start experimenting with lasers and optical receivers within the next three years. Optical Data Transfer ESA is taking the first step with the launching of the French earth observation satellite, Spot-4, at the end of 1996. Shortly after that, at the beginning of 1997, Artemis will be launched into space. Artemis is an advanced geostationary satellite by which various new telecommunications systems will be tested. These two will be the first to make use of optical data transfer. In addition to the usual dish antennas, with a diameter of almost three meters, each satellite will be specially equipped with a telescope 25 centimeters in diameter. An optical receiver with this diameter would at the moment be no lighter than the dish antennas. But when lasers with a higher capacity are used in the future, the mass of the optical modules could well decrease. "There are as yet no advantages with these first attempts. But by the second or third generation we make a profit," said Gotthard Oppenhauser, payload manager Data Relay Technology Mission (DRTM) at ESTEC in Noordwijk. Spot-4 will send remote sensing data back to the earth via Artemis. The Spot observation satellite orbits at a high speed only 700 to 800 kilometers above the earth's surface and can as a result remain in contact with an individual ground station for no longer than 10 minutes. The Silex optical modules on board Artemis and Spot-4 will, however, enable a direct connection between the observation satellite and the control room in Toulouse (France). Contact is possible as long as Spot-4 is within view of Artemis, which will hover 36,000 kilometers above the earth. Every 50 minutes, Spot will disappear behind the earth's sphere and will in practice be in direct contact with Artemis for only about half of its orbit. Greatest Challenge This also means that the satellites will continually have to search for each other. They will send out strong signals with 19 high capacity lasers, each of 500 milliwatt. This "searchlight" cannot be relied upon for communication, but only for identification. For the actual transmission, a 100-milliwatt semiconductor laser will be installed. Both kinds are (aluminum gallium arsenide) semiconductor lasers with a wave length of about 800 nanometers. This wave length was chosen because it is suitable for the most sensitive receivers. There will be two reserve 100-milliwatt lasers on board. The greatest challenge in the ESA project is the development of a very accurate tracking system. For communication purposes, a continuous connection is necessary between the stationary Artemis and the Spot-4, which will be moving at a speed of 30,000 kilometers an hour. The Silex modules on board Artemis and Spot-4 must be able to track each other at an accuracy level of 0.50 millidegrees. This means that at a distance of 36,000 kilometers, a deviation of a maximum of 100 meters would be allowed. Sensors and electronics must constantly read, calculate, and correct the deviation. The laser signals from Artemis will also be received at an optical ground station on Tenerife. At an altitude of 2,500 meters, and thus almost free of diffused light, a telescope one meter across will be erected during the second half of 1995. The optical antenna has already been made by Carl Zeiss Jena, with support from the German space institute DARA, and was completed in November 1993. At the moment it is undergoing extensive testing. A Promising Future The Silex terminals of which the lasers will form a part were developed by ESA in collaboration with the French space laboratory CNES [National Center for Space Studies]. The transmission speed is 50 megabits per second. With these optical modules, communication is also possible in principle over a distance of 40,000 kilometers at a speed of 100 megabits per second, but the electronics on the Spot-4 are still a limiting factor. Radio waves for satellite communications (with a wave length of 15 and one centimeters) generally also reach a transmission speed of 100 megabits per second. In principle, however, lasers can be modulated with a much higher data speed. For satellite applications, however, a higher capacity is also necessary. "We are doing it with a simple but robust method," said Oppenhauser. "We are merely switching the lasers on and off 50 million times a second." In the future the question to consider will be: greater data speed with more capacity, or a smaller telescope. In any case, Oppenhauser expects a ten-fold improvement in the sensitivity of the optical detection by use of more sensitive modulation methods very soon. Not much energy is required for the laser transmission. The present lasers work at 100 milliwatt, while satellites for radio transmission need to be able to produce 30 Watt very quickly. It will therefore be possible to have smaller solar panels in the future. A consortium of some 20 companies under the leadership of Matra Marconi Space will handle the production of the Silex terminals. The first commercial optical modules will be installed on the DRS1 and DRS2 (data relay satellites) which will probably be launched in 1998 and 2003 respectively.
