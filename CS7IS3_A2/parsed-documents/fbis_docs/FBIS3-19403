Last week, the foreign ministers of Ukraine and Azerbeijan were here; this week, the Hungarian prime minister, the Belarus foreign minister, and the foreign policy commission of the Czech parliament appeared; and next week, the foreign ministers of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania are expected. Why does Germany attract them all like a magnet? Because for our Eastern neighbors, we are the bridge to Europe, and simultaneously a model for the ascent from politican and economic destruction. Just as the Germans after the collapse of 1945 built a flourishing community from ruins and have preserved to this day a much-envied measure of stability and prosperity, the people in the East want to do the same--and use German advice and German support for it. This wish was strengthened by the fact that the FRG itself is integrating into its political and economic system a formerly communist constituent state; that furthermore, it is not a great power in the classical sense and hence more attractive to many in the East than the old Western powers. Actually, the trust resulting from this--beyond the known financial assistance--has already led to a dense network of connections. Important in it are the vocational and professional trainers who are sent from Germany to the neighboring Eastern states to provide practical assistance and establish the dual educational system considered worthy of emulation. A second arm of the Trust Agency, the Trust Agency East, does privatization consulting in the East. The Reconstruction Loan Corporation is represented in all Central and East European states and in all CIS countries. Especially effective is a private senior experts service headquartered in Bonn, which aids the governments of the reform countries in getting qualified expert consultants: Retirees help in building up democratic structures, even in establishing a foreign service. For example, a chief of government asked for a consultant to explain to him from case to case to which institutions and persons in West Europe he can turn. Quite officially, young diplomats of the Central and East European countries and the CIS states are being trained in Germany. In two training courses with 25 participants annually, the Bonn Foreign Office sees to the adjustment to Western ways of thinking and behavior. An expert summarized: "We are on hand everywhere in practical reform work." Against this background, prominent politicians also flock to Bonn to ensure cooperation on concrete questions. Thus the chief of the Belarus foreign office, Petr Kravchanka, sought assistance from colleague Kinkel for the victims of Chernobyl and financial aid for the destruction of 2,000 former Soviet tanks, withdrawn from eastern Germany and left behind in Belarus. The Ukrainian foreign minister, Anatoly Slenko, was primarily concerned with cooperation in economic reforms. Hungary's head of government, Peter Boross, beyond details, wanted to nail down--like all his colleagues in Central, East, and southeast Europe--a more general support by the federal chancellor for the road to membership in the European Union [EU] and NATO. And one does not need much imagination to predict that next Wednesday [9 March], the three Baltic foreign ministers will emphatically demand German solidarity for their peoples, menaced by new greater-Russian emotions. The new responsibility stemming from this is immense for the Federal Government. It is furthermore complicated by the fact that certain aspects of cooperation are contradictory within themselves: How is one to lead the East and Central Europeans to the EU and NATO and at the same time satisfy the Russian president, esteemed as a partner, with his totally different views? And how does the desired strengthening of the Baltic states fit into this? These are questions confronting Kohl and Kinkel. Good will alone is not enough to answer them conclusively.
