President Itamar Franco and Foreign Minister Celso Amorim have already defined the Brazilian strategy: to strengthen the Common Market of the South (Mercosur) and to attract other countries toward a Latin American free trade zone, and only then negotiate with the United States the creation of a Free Trade Hemispheric Area (AHLC) as proposed in 1990 by U.S. President George Bush upon launching the Americas Initiative. The creation of a South American free trade zone, as proposed by President Itamar Franco to the Rio Group in Chile last October, will be discussed by the finance and foreign ministers of the Mercosur on 9 and 10 March in Buenos Aires. Paulo Nogueira Batista, the Brazilian representative before the ALADI [Latin American Integration Association], said: "First it is necessary to bring South America closer together, to integrate the Mercosur and the Andean Pact, and also to attract Chile," adding: "We will try to transform the Mercosur into a customs union and at the same time create a South American free trade zone." Environment Minister Rubens Ricupero, former ambassador to the United States and former Brazilian representative before the GATT, said: The first condition is the stability of the economy. To win and expand markets it is necessary to have an industrial and investment policy, adding: "The 14-percent investment rate in 1992 was the lowest in history. In the 1970's investments amounted to 25 percent of the GDP." Ricupero said: The investment in the 1970's is what made Brazil the third country in export growth in 1992, only slightly behind Hong Kong (20 percent), and China (17 percent), and next to Malaysia (15 percent). He indicated: "If we are unable to curb inflation, we will not be a trustworthy partner and there will be no distribution of profits. The opening of the market demands competition and investment." Economist Yves Chaloult, a professor of the University of Brasilia, said in Bulletin No 9 of the Latin American Integration publication of the Brazilian Foreign Ministry: Globalization has strengthened the irreversible trend toward the regionalization of the economic and political areas, and the formation of blocs. He added: "Brazil is going through a profound state crisis" with "constant oscillations in macroeconomic policies" and "an uncontrolled inflation with a very high social cost." Ricupero said: "Brazil must maintain the diversification of its exports" through regionalization without exclusions by maintaining its good presence in European markets, and by expanding its trade with Asia. Pure and simple support for NAFTA makes no sense. It would be better to negotiate within Mercosur. He added: "There is no advantage in an overall negotiation with the United States. They make more money than we do. Negotiation should be selective, partial, gradual, and progressive like in the GATT." According to a World Bank study, the 47 percent of all Brazilian exports that go to the United States have to compete with Mexico, which is in a privileged position both because it is a member of NAFTA and also because of its geographical position. This is one important factor, in addition to the complementation of their economies, in the success of international trade. For example, Brazilian orange juice may be a loser. A relationship with NAFTA is threatening to destroy Mercosur. In June 1991, Mercosur and the United States signed in Washington a four plus one agreement creating a consultative council to discuss trade and investments. Argentina now wants to become a member of NAFTA, as well as Mercosur, by the middle of this year. If Brazil has its way, it will have to wait. Paulo Nogueira Batista finds it very difficult to negotiate a free trade agreement with the United States, which has an economy 11 times larger than Brazil, in addition to a world leadership that puts its interests in relation to Asia, for example, way in front of hemispheric integration. Nogueira Batista said: "Latin-American countries have production and trade that are of no great importance for the United States. The United States has an income per capita 10 times greater and a solid integration can only exist if there is a minimum of equilibrium." Nogueira Batista added: "In fact the free trade agreement between the United States and Mexico is meant to separate rather then to unite. Manpower transfers have been excluded. The idea is to foster Mexico's development with U.S. investment and an increased entry of Mexican products into the U.S. market so that Mexican manpower will not migrate to the United States." NAFTA formalizes integration among the United States, Canada, and Mexico that already existed in practice. In 1990, the United States purchased 75.4 percent of Mexican exports. In the 1950's, the United States purchased 75 percent of Brazilian exports. Today, it barely purchases 19.9 percent of Brazilian exports. The Brazilian representative to ALADI noted: "The signing of this type of agreement does not represent a priority for Brazil, or for the United States, which intends to remain a world power. It will not resign itself to becoming a regional power. Chile, Argentina, Venezuela, Colombia, and other Latin American countries are experiencing an economic adjustment process. They view negotiations with the United States as a recognition that will afford them international prestige with financial repercussions. It will help them finance their balance of payments requirements." This view coincides with that of Paula Stern, an economic adviser during Clinton's electoral campaign, who endorses the possibility of Chile and Singapore joining NAFTA "and thus remove Asia's fear that NAFTA will discriminate against Asia or that the United States has decided to ignore Asia." In fact the situation is quite the contrary, as U.S. State Secretary Warren Christopher said: "The 21st Century will be the century of the Pacific." Brazil has always used low-cost manpower and its abundant natural resources to compete on the international market. But following the great changes that occurred during the past decades, Brazil must invest much more in science, technology, and professional qualifications. While the ROK is ready to become the first country to widely spread secondary education, the average Brazilian studies for a total of three years and eight months. Ambassador Rubens Ricupero notes: "We export semi-manufactured products to the Asian tigers that process them into much higher value-added products." He noted: "We have lost ground following the failure of the protected computer market policy. In textiles, we have lost ground to China, India, and Pakistan that have lower cost manpower. Concerning steel, oranges, iron ore, and soybeans, we rather depend on quantity. Nowadays, many products exported by Brazil come from competitive areas like the Tupi motors from Santa Catarina State or Embraer [Brazilian Aeronautics Company] planes. Brazilian exports grew from $1.654 billion in 1967 to $27 billion in 1984 due to the promotion policies and the domestic consumption decline caused by the recession of the early 1980's. Ever since, Brazilian exports have been damaged by declining investments and economic instability, thus becoming vulnerable to competition from Asian and East European countries that have abundant natural resources and low-cost manpower. In issue No.23 of the BNDES [National Bank for Economic and Social Development] Studies [Estudos BNDES] -- An introduction of Brazilian exports into the international trade of goods: An area study -- Jorge Chami Batista from the Foundation of Foreign Trade Studies Center [Fundacao Centro de Estudos de Comercio Exterior], recommends "increasing the industrial manufacturing ratio through modern technology and better qualified human resources" to reduce this vulnerability. This study confirms that Brazil has "a relatively diversified exports structure" and that participation in the international markets is directly linked to the use of natural resources, which grows commensurate to the use of these resources. Nevertheless, the demand for those products for which Brazil has competitive advantages is growing very slowly.
