According to a report by JIEFANGJUN JIANKANG ZAZHI [PLA HEALTH JOURNAL], at a meeting with German Chancellor Kohl in 1984, Deng Xiaoping revealed his method of keeping in good health. On that occasion, Kohl asked Deng about his secret for achieving longevity, Deng answered: "I am always optimistic, and I am not afraid of the sky falling." Deng Xiaoping added: "I am taking care of fewer and fewer things, and letting other people take care of more things. I want to live a few years longer. My greatest hope is to live beyond 1997." Deng Xiaoping told Kohl that he still swims and plays bridge. Deng said that playing bridge was the best way to rest after being busy with state affairs, because he could forget everything else after taking up the cards. The report also quoted Deng as saying: "In the past 10 years, I have not even caught a cold. One of the reasons for my good health is that I take a cold shower every morning."
