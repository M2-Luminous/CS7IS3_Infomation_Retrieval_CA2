Ramirez listed several bills destined to implement his proposal, among which he mentioned the laws for issuance of bonds by state enterprises, for regulating the capital market, for amending the corporations law, for regulating investment funds, and the bill on domestic holdings. Ramirez called on young people to join political parties and to vote with responsibility. The candidate delivered a speech at the third Uruguayan Marketing Forum at the Municipal Palace yesterday afternoon. In the evening he addressed more than 200 youths at a meeting in the Herreraist faction headquarters. To the marketing executives, Ramirez used the word "popular capitalism," a model that the Christian Democratic Party used in Germany after World War II, and which gained publicity during Margaret Thatcher's government. The Herreraist candidate explained that there are four basic conditions "without which competitiveness and prosperity are impossible to achieve." He said the first such condition is that "the state should not become an obstacle, with utilities setting prices as monopolies and with a heavy tax burden underwriting inefficiency." He added that "the laws should not promote inequality, which is arbitrary and discretionary" and, as the third condition, that "the country cannot be exposed to the ups and downs of international trade." He said the fourth condition was "to preserve freedom and equality on the market, which are constitutional principles." At the evening meeting with the youths, Ramirez said that "the country will not reverse its course, and no one has proposed a serious alternative to what we have begun in this administration." He added that "beyond the model that the country might promote, everyone agrees that the first requirement concerns stability and the balance of accounts of the government, which should not spend anything over revenues and should not fuel inflation needlessly." He claimed that "in no other Latin American country is life better than it is in Uruguay," emphasizing that under the current administration "the number of people who cannot meet their basic needs has dropped 50 percent." Ramirez upheld individual freedom, but warned that "there is an ethical foundation for everything, and justice is the first objective of society. We must achieve justice," he emphasized.
