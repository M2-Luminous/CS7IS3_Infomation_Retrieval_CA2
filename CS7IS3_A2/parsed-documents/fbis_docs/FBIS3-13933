FBIS3-13933 "drnes055_n_94003" FBIS-NES-94-055 Document Type:Daily Report 20 Mar 1994 LEBANON Ja'ja' Reacts to State Security Measures JN2103060094 Paris Radio Monte Carlo in Arabic 1725 GMT 20 Mar 94 JN2103060094 Paris Radio Monte Carlo Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [Telephone interview with Samir Ja'ja', commander of the Lebanese Forces, by correspondent Ahmad Birru in the studio; date and place not given--recorded] [Text] [Ja'ja'] It is regrettable that the Sayyidat al-Najat Church bombing should be exploited in an attempt to outdo us in our continuous defense of society for the past 15 years in which we offered thousands of martyrs for this purpose. Many lightning strikes against the Lebanese Forces have been launched. Dozens of persons from these forces were arrested and all of them have subsequently been released. The Lebanese Forces' positions are always open and the Army has inspected them more than once. Finally, we were surprised to learn that these centers have been confiscated. The given excuses and rationale cannot be justified. I understand that the judicial sources can level charges and convict people. However, I do not know who accused the Lebanese Forces. Who are they? There have been leaks to the press and rumors to the media. We can see everything except a judicial investigation, which we should see. Ten days have passed so far since a number of measures and arrangements began which they said are security measures to uncover the perpetrators of the Sayyidat al-Najat massacre. But we have not seen anything tangible expect dark, clouds and repression measures that are being taken under the excuse of searching for the Sayyidat al-Najat attackers. We were the first to demand uncovering those who carried out the church bombing. But what is happening today is a case of political repression of the Lebanese Forces. [Birru] They say that at least three of the six suspects have been connected with or have confessed -- the investigation continues -- that they have something to do with the issue. Even the president has hinted that the investigations are about to uncover the suspects. Three of them belong to or frequent the Lebanese Forces centers and it is said that they left for the occupied border strip and from there to Israel and then to Europe and they returned to Kasrawan from Europe. [Ja'ja'] This is our hope. We wish to see three persons admit that they placed the bomb. All the Lebanese people want this. But where are these three people? What are their names? Let them appear before the court. Who is doing the investigation? I do not know. Where are they? I do not know. What are their names? Nobody knows. As for the excuse that they visited the Lebanese Forces centers, any criminal can visit anywhere. If someone visits you and commits a murder two days later, this does not mean that you are also a criminal, that all fingers should be pointed at you, and that you should be accused. I categorically reject any charges against the Lebanese Forces as an establishment. Moreover, we would like the judiciary to carry out its responsibility and carry out its legal measures. Otherwise what is the law for? Three, five, six, or 10 made confessions. Great. Let us uncover them and let the trial start so we know what is going on. Regrettably, the atmosphere is foggy and no one knows what is going on. There are a pack of rumors sometimes against the Lebanese Forces, sometimes against monks, and sometimes other groups. This is no investigation. [Birru] The investigation is ongoing and the judiciary is continuing its work. Do you trust the Lebanese investigation and judiciary. [Ja'ja'] I have every confidence in the Lebanese judiciary. Since the investigation is still continuing, how can some state circles accuse this or that person, this or that side? Let us finish the investigation first and let us leave the case to the judiciary and then we will all support the law. [Birru] Let us return to your relations with the regime, the state figures, the prime minister, the president, and the political parties taking part in the government. How are these relations now? [Ja'ja'] If you please, before discussing these relations now, I have a brief explanation of what is going on against the Lebanese Forces. We all remember that following the Sayyidat al-Najat blast, the commander of the Lebanese Forces held a news conference in which he held the state responsible for the explosion and for any disturbance that might occur in the country. In my view what is going on now is that some of them want to get even by accusing the Lebanese Forces, and hence antagonizing the Lebanese Forces without anything and without any proof, before the investigation is completed and before the case is turned over to the Lebanese judiciary. We regret this and we are complaining about it. For the past ten days, immense security measures have been inacted against the Ghidras centers. The Lebanese Forces centers have all been stormed and inspected, which is natural. But finally they were either occupied or confiscated under the pretext that they have a link. I understand that a person may have a link with an explosion or a security disturbance but for a building to have connection and to be arrested, this I do not understand. With regard to your second question on our relations with senior state figures, and political parties in Lebanon, you are well aware that we were at the forefront of those who promoted the march of national reconciliation. Similarly, we will be the last to abandon this march. Consequently, we pursue dialogue as our basic approach in political action. Our relations with most, if not all, state figures are good. Concerning politics, we, at present, deem ourselves part of the political opposition. This means that we do not approve of anything done by state officials at present. We believe that there are many loopholes that need to be plugged. We also believe that we can do more to build a stronger Lebanon that can better shoulder its responsibilities. [Birru] Dr. Samir Ja'ja': You, just like other Lebanese leaders, have recently gone to Syria to offer your condolences on the death of Staff Major Basil al-Asad. This apparently means that Samir Ja'ja' is maintaining ties with Damascus. What is the nature of these ties at present? [Ja'ja'] There have always been ties between the Lebanese Forces and Damascus. Despite the difficult circumstances they have experienced, these ties have never been severed. These ties are still there. The visit I have made to Syria to offer my condolences on the regrettable incident that took place in Damascus is the least I could do. [Birru] Are you critical of the Syrian role in aiding the Lebanese regime, or of the Syrian-Lebanese ties? [Ja'ja'] We support whatever strengthens the Lebanese state. We support whatever contributes to the creation of a free and strong Lebanese state that is capable of shouldering its responsibilities, and ensuring for the Lebanese citizens their dignity, sovereignty, freedom, and livelihood. However, what has been taking place over the past two days does not speak well for the good conduct of some state institutions. That is why we hoped the officials holding constitutional posts would shoulder their responsibilities to correct the current mistakes. We believe that what is taking place constitutes a total repression of political freedoms. This hurts Lebanon. We hope that this repression will cease, and that the culprits who planted the bomb at the Sayyidat al-Najat Church will be uncovered. It is the true culprits of this blast who should be uncovered. We should not use the Sayyidat al-Najat Church blast as a cover to apply political pressure on a certain party. The culprits of this blast must be uncovered, and the necessary security precautions must be taken to protect the Lebanese people from all mischief. [Birru] Dr. Samir Ja'ja': General Michel 'Awn, a previous rival, has recently spoken about the situation in Lebanon, criticizing the state. He has also talked about a federation between the Christians and Muslims in Lebanon. Do you share with him the view regarding the need to reconsider the territorial and political equation in Lebanon. [Ja'ja'] You have said that Gen. Michel 'Awn is the archrival of the Lebanese Forces. He was our archrival four years ago. Why do you insist that he is still our archrival at present? Maybe, he is still the Lebanese Forces' rival. Maybe, he is no longer the archrival of the Lebanese Forces. [Birru, laughing] He is known as the archrival of the Lebanese Forces. [Ja'ja'] He wants to be seen as such. However, the Lebanese Forces do not want to be seen as rivals of any party. With regard to the issue of launching political plans, this is an open field for everyone. Each and every political party in Lebanon has the right to launch any political plan it deems fit, as long as dialogue is the approach pursued, and as long as the aim is to reach understanding. Each and every political party has the right to raise any political plan at the negotiating table. All other parties have the right to discuss this political plan. This is my comment on this issue. [Birru] Do you still raise the proposal of forming a federation between Christians and Muslims in Lebanon? [Ja'ja'] Our attitude toward this issue is well known. We believe that the Lebanese parties must hold constant consultations among themselves to reach the best possible situation. We believe that the paramount concern is to ensure the unity of Lebanon. Other issues are details that can be discussed among all Lebanese parties. It goes without saying that some of the proposals regarding details, or minor issues, are better than others. We acknowledge this. [Birru] To the best of my knowledge, municipal elections will be held one year from now. It is public knowledge that you boycotted parliamentary elections for obvious reasons. Will you take part in the next municipal elections? [Ja'ja'] This is the third time municipal elections have been postponed. I have serious doubts that officials are serious in their efforts to hold municipal elections. All of us know that 1995 will be the year of presidential elections. Consequently, one can predict what officials will say then. They will say that 1995 is the year of presidential elections. Hence, municipal elections must be postponed, they will argue. Similarly, in 1996, they will say that 1996 is the year of parliamentary elections. Hence, they will postpone municipal elections. The same scenario will be repeated. [Birru] Dr. Samir Ja'ja': Thank you. [Ja'ja'] You are most welcome.
