Mr Han, whose passport was invalidated by Beijing last year, said he would no longer try to return to the mainland through the border checkpoints or other channels. "It's their (the Chinese Government's) fault to force me to stay in Hong Kong. I've tried my best to return home ... now I hope they will do some remedies to their wrongdoings," he said. Now a researcher of the Hong Kong Christian Industrial Committee on China's labour movement, Mr Han added that returning home was no longer his first priority. "I've discovered that Hong Kong can provide a better environment and convenience for my work," he said. Mr Han, however, reiterated that his long-term plan was to return to his motherland. "My ultimate goal is staying neither in the U.S. nor in Hong Kong. I was left (by the Chinese Government) here and I'm now here just because Hong Kong is much closer to the mainland." The activist is very busy with his newsletter, which focuses on the problems confronting China's labour movement. The publication has 1,000 to 2,000 copies per issue sent to the mainland, Mr Han said. "So far, I've received 15 responses from the mainland about my work. They are all very encouraging," he said. He denied that his expulsion had separated him from the workers in China and disqualified him from being a labour activist. "I've been one of them (Chinese workers) for more than 10 years. I understand the relationship between the management and employees. The nature of the labour movement is more or less the same despite some superficial changes," Mr Han said. "Also, I still maintain communication with mainland workers. I know where strikes have taken place and the reasons behind them." After a one-month visit to the United States for the birth of his second son, Yuchen, Mr Han returned to the territory on May 14 to renew his three-month work visa. On the subject of China's Most Favoured Nation status with the United States, the unionist said conditions to ensure reasonable wages for Chinese workers and industrial safety should be attached to its renewal. "Actually, trade itself is abuse of human rights if workers' interests are not protected," he said. But Mr Han did not rule out that unemployment would result if the preferential trade status was removed. Yesterday, Mr Han revealed that the wife of his lawyer, Zhou Guoqiang, who filed a lawsuit against the Chinese authorities for the "unlawful" invalidation of Mr Han's passport, had disappeared. He did not eliminate the possibility that the wife, Wang Hui was, arrested.
