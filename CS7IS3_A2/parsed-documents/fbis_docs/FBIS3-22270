Song Jian, state councillor and director of the Environment Protection Committee of the State Council, made the remarks here today at the closing ceremony of a national conference on environment protection work. Song said his committee will focus on inspecting how well the environment laws and regulations are observed this year. ``Those who break the environmental laws and regulations, irrespective of their positions, will shoulder the legal responsibility,'' Song said. Song said the government officials will not only be judged in terms of economic results but also their achievements in carrying out the environmental laws and improving the environment. What he termed ``major and important cases'' of destruction of the environment will be fully investigated and handled according to law, Song said. The state councillor said the environment pollution has been more and more severe in some areas, and disputes on environment pollution emerge from time to time. Song said the National People's Congress and the State Council will jointly inspect the environment protection work in a dozen provinces this year. Some of the polluters found will be obliged to improve substantially within a set time, others will be shut down, he said. Especially rural enterprises will be further checked, he added, since some of them lack the money and expertise to control pollution, and thus bring more damage to the environment. Song Jian said the role of mass organizations should also be brought into full play to protect the environment. They should be encouraged to participate in this drive themselves, as well as to supervise the governmental work on protecting and improving the environment, he noted.
