We have not yet received further details to add to the report already transmitted by my colleagues. For those who have not heard our previous newscast, let me say that according to the press service of NKR Defense Army headquarters, the Azerbaijani Army launched a large attack in the north of NKR's Mardakertskiy Rayon yesterday. The large aggressive action was launched on the eve of the upcoming high-level talks on the settlement of the Karabakh conflict. Those talks were prepared by the Russian Foreign Ministry. The attack came a day before the opening of the CSCE Minsk Group talks on Nagorno-Karabakh in Prague today. The Azerbaijani Air Force subjected NKR's peaceful cities and villages to massive air strikes yesterday. Three residents were killed and nine were injured only during the bombing of Stepanakert's residential quarters. Most of the victims are women and children. A number of residential buildings in the city were destroyed. There are victims in the NKR's other settlements, which also came under air attack. The Azerbaijani warplanes tried to launch air strikes against civilian objects today. In the meantime, battles are continuing in the northern sector of the front where the Karabakh forces are halting the enemy's attacks. The NKR leadership believes that in exacerbating the situation on the Armenian-Azerbaijan conflict zone, Baku is as usual relying on brute force and is again challenging the international community which is exerting efforts for the peaceful settlement of the conflict. They reported from Stepanakert that because of the air strikes classes were canceled in educational institutions. As regards the situation on Armenia's borders, the Defense Ministry press service reported at 1600 that a relative calm has prevailed since last night.
