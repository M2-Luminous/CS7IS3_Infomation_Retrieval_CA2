After his two years as environment minister, he is lashing out at environmental doomsday prophets and their alarmist movements. Growth is the way forward, we must not run screaming backwards. Yet another provocative book from a nonsocialist former minister. First, Anders Fogh Rasmussen hurled his angry, uncompromising book about the Danish society of grumblers and whimperers onto the table. Now, another former minister, Per Stig Moller, has put some weighty ideas into print. The 51-year-old Ph.D. and gifted humanist writer was the nonsocialist government's last environment minister--in 1991 and 1992--and he cannot forget it. ``I sat at my desk during Easter, some months after the government was out of power,'' he said. ``There were no papers, no matters to be taken care of, no ringing telephones. Being a minister is like being on drugs, you work from 0800 in the morning to 2200 at night, every day of the week. You suffer withdrawal afterwards. I thought: I can't stand this, I will write a book! ``A minister cannot do this because then the prime minister and the whole government must be agreed upon your point of view. You might as well be writing the party platform. Only afterwards is one truly free. So it is tempting, as Anders and I have done, to lean back and focus all of one's personal knowledge on setting things into perspective.'' Moller has an agreeable manner of boasting. He does not try to conceal his compliments to himself behind something else. They come out with a bang. He manifests an unabashed joy in his initiatives--''they never saw anything like it at the ministry``--in his industry, in his results. He can say `dialectic' and other nonendemic words without blinking and quotes French philosophers in French. People at Christiansborg say this has always been his problem in Danish politics, that he thinks--in this way. An unusual man of affairs.'' Today he has nothing to do with environmental policy, as the Conservative Party has decided that everyone is to change places. ``We have seen for ourselves how our predecessors came to appear either lax or pathetic, if they remained within their ministerial area,'' he said. ``If they were critical, it was labeled bitterness. If they supported the new ministers, it was insipid. It hurt them as politicians.'' Ecologists and Nazis One of Mollers important objectives in the book is to shoot down the so-called ecohumanists, who condemn growth. It is not only that he disagrees with their desire for minus growth. He is also afraid that some of them will begin to tamper with democracy in the name of the environment. He worries they will brush aside democracy as too weak to do anything effective about the looming catastrophes. Among Moller's ecohumanists is found the poet, Thorkild Bjornvig. In the 1970's, he began a campaign against industrialism, capitalism, market economics, and democracy, Moller says. Bjornvig rejected the democracies ``with their antiquated materialistic concepts of freedom'' and espoused ecological socialism. This pessimistic line was taken up by David Rehling, director of Denmark's Nature Conservancy Association, who last year in a feature article criticized democracy's incapacity to act. Knud Vilby, chairman of International Cooperation, is also counted among the group. Moller cites him for wanting to use ``consciousness-raising'' to save the earth. And, for those people who are unable to raise their consciousness, he would use ``the force that is necessary to get the last ones to go along.'' ``The ecohumanists imagine that they are angels who have seen the ethically correct path. That we must abandon growth and clad ourselves in sackcloth and ashes,'' says Moller. ``Yet if poverty were to come, people would not put money into nature, they would want social programs instead. The East Germans, who have the biggest environmental problems, give the environment lowest priority. West Germans, who have the fewest problems, give it the highest priority. This is an excellent argument for concurrent growth and environmental policy, for only when you have the funds, do you have the means to look around and view your surroundings.'' Steensgaard: Aren't you seeing phantoms? Not a single society is run by the ecohumanists you warn about. Moller: They are few, but they color political life--also here in Denmark. In my time as minister, the Social Democrats, Radicals, and Socialist People's Party, during an inquiry debate, proposed that growth should be stopped. Jan Sjursen of the Christian Party is out there right now with very much the same kind of thing, in which he says that we have enough growth and should slow down our pace. Politicians do not act in a vacuum. The humanists create the mental imagery, the expectations, and the doom. The Nazi gas chambers did not come from the technicians, but from racial conceptions, which came out of philosophy, God help us. Fear Is the Engine Steensgaard: Is ecology suitable as a new ideology for all those who are searching for one? Moller: Yes. Ecology is a modern expression for nature worship and some would use it politically. The power they did not achieve over society by means of Marxism and socialistic theories, they can achieve through ecology. The engine is fear of catastrophe. In his book, Moller writes that environmental catastrophe has become an issue that mystics and demagogues can use to draw people in. Now that the cold war is over and the ideologies have collapsed, we are immediately able to make another: The old confrontation between capitalism and Marxism has been supplanted by something between liberalism and ecologism. Just as in the 1970's, the Marxists sought to win control over production and gain supremacy over bourgeois democracy with the object of creating a socialist egalitarian society, in the 1990's, the ecologists aspire to do the same. The goal has simply been changed, in this case, to a ``balanced'' society. One of the worst, in the opinion of the former minister, is the German-American religious philosopher, Hans Jonas, who is influential in ecology circles. ``Jonas says that those who understand what this is all about must halt growth. This elite will determine what will be produced and make sure that it is distributed. Democracy is then abolished and a big threat provides the means to do it: The end of the world. In such circumstances, it is a small thing to abolish democracy. Fear is a prop. It paralyzes people and causes them to buy indulgences from the environmental organizations. ``At the other end, you have the right-wing ecologists. They never did like growth and feel that industrialism destroys the soul. They would lead us back to a time of self-reliant households, ancient virtues, and a life without haste or hurry. It is a longing for continuity. They would stop time.'' ``The middle, in which I find myself, does not wish to offer up democracy on ecology's alter. My point is that those who have acquired absolute power to solve a problem have damn well never done it! They have created even greater problems, but in the meantime they entrenched themselves pretty well. There are no extreme solutions.'' The End of the World Moller is neither more or less extreme than a Radical Liberal minister or a Social Democratic one. They are surprisingly united in their concrete policy. Why go to the bother of writing a book when they are all in agreement? ``It is quite irrelevant whether we are agreed or not, as the others have not set down their ideas comprehensively. This is the first environmental book in Danish that was not written by a Green. I try to view the environment humanistically, historically, culturally, and technologically. There are hard, concrete chapters and also historical ones--for example the one on doomsday prophets. That one was fun to write!'' Steensgaard: You poke fun at doomsday prophets from the past, in that each maintained that the end was drawing nigh. Yet, you yourself say that about our situation.... Moller: Yes, I am saying: They have been wrong so many times. This is my message about what we presently know. A colossal number of catastrophes are waiting out there. We have never had so many that dovetailed into one another. They must be solved generally in the same time frame with different solutions that point in the same direction. It is something mankind has never before encountered, because it is the first time the catastrophes have been global. Steensgaard: Where shall we begin when there are so many catastrophes to choose between? Moller: In Denmark, our three greatest problems are: too much waste, a question of adequate ground water, and a lack of knowledge. We simply do not know enough about how nature reacts. Globally, the irreplaceable things must be dealt with first. That is, those things that cannot be restored again: climate changes, the hole in the ozone layer, and the fact that whole species of plants and animals are vanishing. But, above all this hangs the biggest problem of all: the threat of overpopulation. You can go around and solve all of the other environmental problems one after the other--it will not help one bit if you do not at the same time tackle the problem of overpopulation. Steensgaard: The world's biggest environmental problem--that is the others? Moller: The Third World is very frightened of our ecoimperialism. The fact that we come to them and say: You must fix the rain forest. You must not cut the few trees that prevent the desert from expanding--sure, thanks for the advice. But then they cannot survive. Consequently, it is necessary for both parties to understand that they are the ones doing injury. The Third World may not lean back and say: You have created all of the environmental problems, as you use 40 times as much energy as we do. It is you who are overpopulated. There is no reason for the rich countries to be too complacent, Moller feels. We put major hindrances in the way of the poor in every possible way: We invent fanciful trade barriers to keep their goods out. We demand huge sums in interest and fees on loans. And we shut our labor market off so that they cannot come up here and earn money to live on. There is no sign that things are moving in the right direction. That is the most disheartening thing. We bring home more money from the poor nations in interest on loans than we send down there. The GATT negotiations are still not successful, and with all our trade barriers, we chain them to poverty. The West still does not give even 1 percent of its money to the developing nations. But the fact is we have a choice: Either we purchase their goods, or else, we will need to employ them here, and that is something we do not desire either. My joyous message is that it is permissible to produce so as to promote growth, but not to pollute. And that is something the Third World must be part of.
