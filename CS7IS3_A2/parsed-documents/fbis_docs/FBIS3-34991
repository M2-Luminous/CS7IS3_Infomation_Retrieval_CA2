An External Affairs Ministry statement issued last night said that Mr. Clinton has not taken into account the proven role of Pakistan as a state sponsoring terrorism, and no concern has been expressed for the human rights of the victims of the terrorists armed, trained, and sent into Jammu and Kashmir by Pakistan. The statement said that India is committed to uphold human rights as a part of its heritage and as enshrined in its Constitution and laws. On the nuclear front, the statement said India neither had nor intended to acquire weapons of mass destruction. But Pakistan's nuclear intentions are well known and had been confirmed time and again. It said the real danger is not of an India-Pakistan nuclear exchange, but of nuclear adventurism on the part of Pakistan.
