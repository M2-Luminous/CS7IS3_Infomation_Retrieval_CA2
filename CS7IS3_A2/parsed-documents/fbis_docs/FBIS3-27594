The building of the ship lift project, which requires a total investment of more than 200 million yuan, is aimed at establishing a reliable basis for the design and construction of another ship lift at the gigantic water control dam at the Three Gorges on the Chiang Jiang, said engineers responsible for the construction of the ship lift on Qingjiang river. According to them, the main technical indexes of the ship lift under construction, designed and being constructed by the Wuhan Ship Building Company, observe a general proportion of one to ten with the ship lift to be built at the Three Gorges water control dam. The ship lift now under construction is a major part of the Geheyan water control project. The ship lift, consisting of two separate vertical ship lifts, is expected to have a maximum lifting height of 122 m and a maximum lifting weight of 15,000 tons when completed and put into use in 1997, said the engineers. Construction of the ship lift at the Geheyan water control project of Qingjiang river is of great importance for promoting the economy of Hubei and opening up mountainous southwestern Hubei in the Qingjiang river watershed.
