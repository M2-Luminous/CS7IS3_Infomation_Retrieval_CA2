He told the BRTN [Dutch-language Belgian Radio and Television]: "I am not `a priori' opposed to such consultations." According to the Belgian minister, setting up such a consultation process would not be tantamount to giving Russia the right to veto NATO decisions. Futhermore, he added that these consultations could be very useful, as in the case of Bosnia, for example. Mr. Delcroix termed "positive" the comments of Russian General Pavel Grachev, who participated in the meetings with NATO defense ministers on Tuesday and Wednesday. Delcroix said: "A degree of confusion has reigned in Moscow in recent weeks concerning Russia's membership of the `Partnership for Peace (PFP),' a program of increased cooperation between NATO and the other European countries, essentially those in the East." As we recall, General Grachev stated on Tuesday evening that Russia would join the PFP unconditionally, but then on Wednesday morning requested the establishment of a permanent mechanism for consultation between Moscow and the Atlantic alliance. Mr. Delcroix also stated that it was logical for another channel to be opened between NATO and Moscow, although, he added, "that does not mean they will have any guarantees." According to the minister, it is necessary for Russia to first join the PFP: "We must take account of the 18 countries who have already joined the PFP before we can talk of forging closer links with Moscow." He believes that Russia could sign in June. Mr. Delcroix added that he did not approve of Russia's proposal to give the CSCE priority over NATO. He stressed that the CSCE is too large a forum (BELGA editor's note: comprising 52 countries from Europe, North America and Central Asia) to be truly functional.
