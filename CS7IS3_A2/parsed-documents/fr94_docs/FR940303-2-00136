FR940303-2-00136 FR940303-2-00072 Several Standard Test Procedures (STPs) were reviewed in various program areas. Entela will develop and submit additional STPs, where necessary, prior to listing products related to these procedures. Specific program procedures and policies are developed by the individual departments and are audited twice per year by the President or Vice President of the laboratory. Management and the project manager are responsible for assuring that procedures are followed. These operating and testing procedures are determined by the work order which specifies which standard(s) and provisions are to be utilized. Operational procedures and policies are implemented through the training program at Entela, Inc. The master copy is located in the Standards Library, with controlled copies located in each department. Present policy utilizes a technical committee and standards experts to determine the appropriate standard in evaluating a product. Standard interpretations are developed by consensus of the technical committee. The Project Manager distributes technical advisory letters describing standards policy on interpretation or deviation decisions to all parties affected. The laboratory personnel are members of various organizations which develop standards applicable to their on-going programs in the automotive, flammability, metallurgical, quality, electrical and chemical testing areas. A technical committee and standards experts determine the appropriate standard or standards to be utilized in evaluating the product. Disagreements between the applicant and the laboratory regarding standards applicability are resolved using the Entela Inc. Third Party Certification Committee, technical experts, and input from the standards-writing organization. The decision of the laboratory regarding which standard is applicable is final. The TPCP Manual addresses the interpretation of these standards and the appeals procedure available to a client, when there is a disagreement with that interpretation. The TPCP Committee interprets the section of the standards, which are also available for distribution to interested parties. Consumer inquiries and complaints are also addressed in the TPCP Manual. Entela personnel serve on technical committees to enable them to be cognizant of changes to the standards with which they are involved. The laboratory is continuing to develop committee membership in various new product areas of interest. Test procedures contain the following: Instructions on equipment; preparation of test samples; standard testing techniques; references to specific standards, including titles and dates; testing equipment and accuracies; precautionary statements for operator safety; test data obtained, measurement resolution and data recording time; ambient conditions and/or adverse environmental conditions; and acceptance criteria tests. These test procedures are reviewed annually and are approved by the technical department manager and the QA manager. Sample test data sheets and attached work orders contain the following: Standard and clause numbers; product model number; measuring and test equipment I.D.; test date and report number, signature of tester/reviewer; and Q.A; ambient conditions; test observations and deviations; test data in the form of compliance, non-compliance, or the need for further review. Permanent records are compiled to document all technical and quality related activities of the Certification and Testing Division. The system for controlling all technical and quality records is described in the Quality Assurance Manual. The certification reports contain the following: Name and location of submitter and factory; title, number, and date of standard use for evaluation; file number, report date, edition number and revision date; description of product including drawings, specifications, and photographs; conditions of product use; construction and testing narratives which describe how the product(s) comply with the standard; tests and results of tests; deviations and technical rationale for acceptance. The Quality Assurance Manual and the Third Party Certification Program Manual identify the minimum information and reporting format required for an investigation. Most reports followed the required format. Entela has documented specific procedures for the recording of any deviations and the associated technical rationale, or for the modification of testing protocol. The project manager, department manager, and test engineer, are responsible for the preparation and review of the final report. The test report is written by the test engineer or senior technician. The senior technician is also responsible for reviewing and signing the test data before it is reviewed by the project manager. A modified review process of data sheets and reports has been instituted to ensure that all signatures are in place and that any abnormalities or unusual test results are identified. Listings are revised with replacement pages. A new report is prepared if extensive changes are required. Copies of the listing report are given to the customer and to jurisdictional authorities, where required, and placed in follow-up inspection files. Standards updates are secured by maintaining update services for a variety of standards. For example, UL standards quarterly index update service is subscribed to and used to verify the latest edition of their standards. The project manager is responsible for providing the test engineer with the latest revision of the appropriate standards. Superseded standards are archived in the library and labeled as such, superseded standards beyond 5 years are placed in filing boxes, labeled, and stored in records storage. The NRTL Program checklist has been developed so that the file of a product listing is evaluated to assure its completeness through the project manager's review of the file and use of the file checklist. Safety testing records (OSHA/NRTL) are to be stored with the nuclear files which are in a locked fireproof storage room in a fireproof filing cabinet in the third building. No flammability testing is conducted in this building. A procedure for control of files is in place to protect them from damage, theft, or records loss. Duplicate records are not stored off site. The records are alphabetized by client. The verification and identification of test reports of listed products is accomplished through the use of the director of certified products. A label numbering system is to be utilized for the NRTL program that will take into account the various products, manufacturing sites, and variations of a model line. The office manager is responsible for filing and maintaining these records. Procedures are in effect to distribute, recall, and revise test records. The Quality Assurance System consists of separate but interrelated functional areas that report directly to the President or the Vice President of operations. The Quality Assurance Manager is responsible for the internal quality of the laboratory and its operations, and reports directly to the President of the laboratory. The director of Quality Assurance Services reports to the Vice President of Operations and is responsible for the various programs that address the client's preproduction qualifications, suppliers of laboratory services, follow-up program, manufacturing monitoring and quality assurance assessment. The individuals in the two positions assist each other in accomplishing the workload without interfering with their job requirements or the lines of authority. The Quality Manager is independent of operations and has the responsibility and authority for overseeing all activities related to the internal laboratory quality program.
