Yet when the discussion touched on the future of the Golan Heights, the tone changed. Confronted with very bitter and harsh criticism voiced by Golan kibbutzim representatives, who said: You are sacrificing us in advance; you are closing down the settlements, the prime minister laid his cards on the table, stating in no uncertain terms: For the sake of peace, I am willing to remove settlements. [Begin Rabin recording] I view the Golan Heights through the security prism, first and foremost, no matter whether settlements exist there or not. Security, more than any other consideration, is my criterion for the Golan. Settlements may be removed only for the sake of peace. If we reach the point where we need to remove settlements for the sake of peace, I have been and will remain in favor of it. And I am not trying to whitewash anything or throw up a smoke screen. For me, peace is a higher value for Israel's future and security than this or that group of settlements. Just this once, let us view the situation in a framework befitting the new reality, befitting a big and strong country, and not the country we were on the eve of our War of Independence, when we had to hold on to every settlement. [end recording] The prime minister went on to warn: If the peace processes do not make progress this year or by mid-1995 at the latest, we will return to the days of tension, political stalemate, and great peril. He referred to terror, too. He said, for instance, that since 1 January 1994, the terrorist policy of Hamas and the other radical organizations changed. They realized that without attacks inside the State of Israel, they will not attain their objectives. As a result, 23 have been murdered since 1 January, 20 of them inside Israel.
