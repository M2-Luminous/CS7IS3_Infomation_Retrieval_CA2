[passage omitted] Ahmad Birru met with Brahimi and asked him about the results of his contacts with the Sanaa officials yesterday and today and the talks he will be holding with the southern officials. He also asked him to give an evaluation of the seriousness of the new cease-fire decision. Brahimi said: [Begin Brahimi recording] I had the honor to hold a long meeting with his excellency the president of the republic at noon today. I will be meeting a number of party leaders. Tomorrow I will meet with members of parliament. I will then leave Sanaa to continue my contacts elsewhere. Perhaps at 1500 [1200 GMT] you heard a news item from Sanaa radio to the effect that the Government of the Republic of Yemen has decided to implement a cease-fire as of 1800 [1500 GMT] today. We greatly hope that this time the cease-fire will hold. Moreover, the brothers in the Yemeni Republic affirm that they are prepared to enter into a dialogue with the other side but on principles which they believe are essentials for such a dialogue. I believe that this is an encouraging beginning. We hope that little by little, this country will be extricated from its current affliction. [end recording] Our correspondent was careful to explore all aspects of Brahimi's mission in Sanaa and directed the following questions at him: [Begin recording] [Birru] The Yemeni Government is prepared to hold a dialogue with the other side. Does this mean that the exception to the leaders of the secession has been waived? [Brahimi] They say that they have certain principles. It is not for me to list these principles because if we forget one of them, we will have problems. You may ask the Yemeni brothers and they will tell you what they are. Whether or not these principles will be acceptable to the other side, we do not know. However, I consider it to be a good step when I am told that they are prepared for dialogue but with certain conditions. Well, I say you are welcome, let us see these conditions and consult with the other side. [Birru] Will you meet with the leaders of the other side in Aden, al-Mukalla, or in an Arab country? [Brahimi] The important thing is to meet with the brothers and talk to them. The venue is immaterial. This means we will make the necessary arrangements for this to take place. [Birru] The answers you received in Sanaa were positive and encouraging? [Brahimi] Undoubtedly. [Birru] Will you return to Sanaa shortly? [Brahimi] I think I will return to Sanaa but I do not know when. [Birru] Thank you. [end recording] Brahimi did not reveal the place for which he will be leaving tomorrow to meet with the southern leaders. However, sources close to him said that he will be leaving for the Jordanian capital, Amman, where he will meet with southern Yemeni leaders, among whom is believed to be 'Ali Salim al-Bid.
