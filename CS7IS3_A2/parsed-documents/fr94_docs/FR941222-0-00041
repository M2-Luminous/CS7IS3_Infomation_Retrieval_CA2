FR941222-0-00041 FR941222-0-00003 Finding of No Significant Environmental Impact: Availability The Commission has determined under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, and the Commission's regulations in Subpart A of 10 CFR Part 51, that this rule is not a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment and therefore an environmental impact statement is not required. This final rule adds an additional cask to the list of approved spent fuel storage casks that power reactor licensees can use to store spent fuel at reactor sites without additional site-specific approvals from the Commission. The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact on which this determination is based are available for inspection at the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW. (Lower Level), Washington, DC. Single copies of the environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact are available from Mr. Gordon E. Gundersen, Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington DC, 20555, telephone (301) 415&hyph;6195. Paperwork Reduction Act Statement This final rule does not contain a new or amended information collection requirement subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). Existing requirements were approved by the Office of Management and Budget approval number 3150&hyph;0132. Regulatory Analysis The Commission has prepared a regulatory analysis on this regulation. The analysis examines the costs and benefits of the alternatives considered by the Commission. Interested persons may examine a copy of the regulatory analysis at the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW. (Lower Level), Washington, DC. Single copies of the analysis may be obtained from Mr. Gordon E. Gundersen, Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington DC, 20555, telephone (301) 415&hyph;6195. Regulatory Flexibility Certification As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commission certifies that this rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule affects only licensees owning and operating nuclear power reactors and cask vendors. The owners of nuclear power plants do not fall within the scope of the definition of ``small entities'' set forth in Section 601(3) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 15 U.S.C. 632, or the Small Business Size Standards set out in regulations issued by the Small Business Administration at 13 CFR Part 121. Backfit Analysis The NRC has determined that the backfit rules 10 CFR 50.109 and 10 CFR 72.62 do not apply to this final rule. A backfit analysis is not required for this final rule because this amendment does not involve any provisions that would impose backfits as defined in 10 CFR 50.109(a)(1) or 72.62(a).
