SERIYA: FIZIKA-TEKHNICHNYKH NAVUK Russian CSO [Article by L. I.

These systems reduce the probability of a serious accident by an order of magnitude while reducing capital investment and cost price to 15-20%. The AR-600, SIR, SBWR, and V-600 designs make greater use of passive systems, which simplifies the design and reduces the number of components in the first circuit by a factor of 2-6. Construction based on these designs may begin in 1995-2005. The efforts of leading machine building and construction firms in the field of energy are focused on the development of new generation of plants using light-water reactors (up to 1300 MW). These plants should be built in the next 10-30 years and meet current requirements for safety and competitiveness. The VVER-92 design has an accident probability of about 2.5X10[.sup]-7[/] reactor-years. Predominantly passive systems are used in this design. The design conserves materials while providing a double hull for protection. Figures 3; references 31: 12 Russian, 19 Western.
