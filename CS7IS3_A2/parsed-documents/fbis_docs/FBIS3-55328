Replying to reporters within the building of the Council of the Federation, which held its first meeting here, Kostikov noted that the sides would "negotiate comprehensively and seriously" the relations between Russia and the United States. He believes that the U.S. President will explain in greater detail the American "partnership for peace" initiative. "Russia has no reasons to keep aloof of this initiative," the press secretary stressed. "It only remains to see to what extent its implementation meets the national interests of Russia. Kostikov described as sharp and prompt the Russian Foreign Ministry's reaction to the unlawful actions of the Lithuanian authorities against two Russian generals. He said that "at present this reaction is adequate". "But the reaction of the president and of Russia might be even tougher if such incidents were to reoccur in the future, even very tough compared to world precedents," the press secretary stated.
