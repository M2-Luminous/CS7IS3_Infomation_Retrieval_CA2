This problem should be settled through negotiations," Estonian Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary Yuri Kahn told a news conference here today. In his words, the Russian delegation to the bilateral negotiations now wants to settle the withdrawal and military pensioner problems in one treaty while the Estonian side favors separate solution of these problems. "Estonia and Russia are looking for solutions. The problem of Russian troops withdrawal from Estonian territory remains the most serious," said Kahn. "In our opinion, the troops withdrawal treaty is ready for signing, but there are certain conditions put by Russia that hamper the process". "We understand the need for demarcation of the Russian-Estonian border. Estonia has not laid any territorial claims on Russia and it will hardly lay ones. The border line issue should be settled in correspondence to international norms of the Estonian-Russian treaty of 1920," stressed the ambassador. In his opinion, the Russian side is determined to build and equip the state border with Estonia. Kahn hopes the upcoming meeting of the chairmen of the Russian and Estonian parliament committees for international affairs will help to find a way out from the complicated situation.
