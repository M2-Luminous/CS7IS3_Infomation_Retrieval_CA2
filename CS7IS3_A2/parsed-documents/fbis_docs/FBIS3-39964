For this reason, the government is expecting answers to the vitally important questions of safety and access to Famagusta. This statement was made by Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis, who added that next week the course of discussions on the implementation of the confidence-building measures [CBM's] will be determined. Mr. Mikhailidhis was addressing a news conference this morning on the results of his contacts in Germany and said that the prospects for the CBM's are not favorable right now. He also stressed that, if the Turkish side's intransigence and filibustering tactics continue, the whole course will be reexamined. Mr. Mikhailidhis further emphasized that the Greek Cypriot side should be particularly careful so as to be convincing about the Turkish intransigence and pointed out that the discussions on the CBM's will have repercussions on Cyprus' efforts for accession to the European Union [EU]. Referring to these efforts, Mr. Mikhailidhis said that the next goal set by the government is setting a date for opening official EU-Cyprus negotiations on the island's accession. This goal, he added, will be pursued during the Greek presidency of the EU. Mr. Mikhailidhis also expressed satisfaction over his contacts with German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel who, he said, supported Cyprus' accession to the EU.
