Qian Xinhao, deputy director of the provincial bureau of township-run enterprises, said that Zhejiang currently has more than 100,000 such enterprises. They manufactured 300 billion yuan worth of goods in 1993, accounting for 75 percent of Zhejiang's gross domestic product, the value of goods and services produced province wide, he said. That figure also formed 11 percent of the output value of rural industries throughout China, he added. Under the tax reform begun earlier this year, rural companies no longer enjoy lower tax rates as they did before, Qian said. Moreover, most of them are now suffering from acute shortages of funds because the Chinese government has tightened credit control in an effort to ensure top-priority construction projects, he said. Consequently, the profits of rural businesses plunged nearly 27 percent in the first quarter of 1994 to 679 million yuan, he said. "Even so, the development momentum of rural enterprises in Zhejiang is good on the whole," he said. For example, output value of these enterprises amounted to 111.2 billion yuan during the first four months of 1994, up 80 percent over the same period in 1993. To overcome the present difficulties, rural enterprises have accelerated the introduction of the joint-stock cooperative system, he said. According to Qian, the new system has turned workers into shareholders and has tied up shareholders' incomes and fringe benefits with their enterprises, thus resulting in higher productivity. To date, over 60,000 rural businesses have introduced the new system, he said. "Many rural enterprises have shifted their attention to the international market," he said. So far, 119 rural firms have opened factories and subsidiaries in other countries. For example, the Zhedong Cement Pipe Factory in Yinxian county has built a factory in the Philippines at a cost of 15 million yuan in a move to break into the local market. Furthermore, rural enterprises in Zhejiang are trying to promote cooperation with their colleagues in underdeveloped central and western parts of China, he said. They have proposed 100 major projects for cooperation with township-run enterprises in Henan province and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. The deputy director also noted that production of rural firms set up by groups of farmers or individual farmers has been growing rapidly. During the January-April period, output value of such firms amounted to 45.2 billion yuan, up 182 percent on the same period in 1993, he said.
