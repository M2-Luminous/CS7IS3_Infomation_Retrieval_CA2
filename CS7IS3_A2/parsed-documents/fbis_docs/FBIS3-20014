Bei in Rome; date not given: "Bossi: `Berlusconi Is the Lesser Evil'" -- first two paragraphs are L'INDIPENDENTE introduction] [Text] "You know something, the real risk in this election is that if the DC [Christian Democratic Party] and the Left win, Italy will go bankrupt. With a 5 billion lire public deficit, we cannot afford to go back to the old system of handouts. That is why we are sticking with Silvio Berlusconi; he is the lesser evil." Umberto Bossi is tired but confident about the result of the election: "It will be a landslide victory, the League will double its parliamentary seats." Regardless of whether the Freedom Pole wins or loses, "It will be the League that decides who will govern the country, as it is the force with the most clout." This is why he appeals to the voters to "vote League on the gray form, the one for the proportional quota." [Bei] Did you see that the DIGOS [Division for General Investigations and Special Operations of the State Police] is visiting Forza Italia? [Bossi] Yes, giving it a lot of publicity in the process. It looks like a ploy to pass Berlusconi off as a victim of persecution. [Bei] And Luciano Violante resigning ... [Bossi] That was consistent for him. He backed a lie, and he has acknowledged that he went too far. [Bei] Gianfranco Miglio says: "Berlusconi is our opponent and Fini is our enemy." Is that how it will be after the election as well? [Bossi] It will all depend on the figures. If we have a governing quorum, we shall stick with Berlusconi, but not with Gianfranco Fini. The time is not yet ripe for us to be able to use Fini's votes. It is impracticable at the national level: It would be as if the neo-Nazis got into government in Germany. [Bei] Has the alliance with Berlusconi been a mistake, as Miglio says, or a skillful political operation, as Roberto Maroni claims? [Bossi] Miglio is wrong because he is suffering from preelection nerves. If the League had not done the deal with Berlusconi, we should have found ourselves without television time. Berlusconi would have lined up with the DC and Mario Segni, and we should have had the Left on the other side: We would have been cut off and in a bad way. [Bei] Some League supporters would have preferred to go to the front on their own ... [Bossi] That is true, but I cannot send my troops off to take the hill under machinegun fire. It would have been a massacre. This time we had to resort to realpolitik. [Bei] Do you believe you will be able to "straitjacket" Berlusconi? [Bossi] We already have got him in a straitjacket with the election deal! Forza Italia will gain few votes in the north, and it will only gain those few because Berlusconi is the chairman of Milan [soccer club]. [Bei] Was it necessary to straitjacket him? [Bossi] Of course it was, otherwise people might have voted for those who brainwash them every day, those who get into their homes with advertising spots on television. [Bei] Might it not be that, by way of criticizing him, you will side with the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] after the election, albeit under the cover of a "caretaker government"? [Bossi] We cannot take up with Achille Occhetto for two reasons. The first is a matter of principle: The Left continues to oppose reliance on the free market, and the League is the sole true liberalist force. [Bei] And the second reason? [Bossi] Well, if people see us side with the Left, we shall be caught with our pants down, and within a fortnight the doors of the north will inevitably be open to the fascists, the ethnic party of the south, created to steal the keys to the vaults of the north. [Bei] Maroni has said that if Berlusconi loses to Spaventa, he cannot be prime minister. Does that mean that if he wins he can be? [Bossi] No, I think that Berlusconi is intelligent and will not even ask to be. He has too many private interests to be able to act as head of government. [Bei] The first step after the poll will be the election of the speakers in the two houses. Some people would even like to elect a new president of the republic ... [Bossi] And quite right too, because President Scalfaro himself announced that he would resign once there was a new parliament. That being said, however, I do not believe that it is a matter of fundamental importance at the present stage.
