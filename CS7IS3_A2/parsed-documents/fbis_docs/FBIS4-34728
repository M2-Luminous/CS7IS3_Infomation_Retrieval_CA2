The small English-speaking Caribbean countries expressed support for military action against the Haitian military coupists. Nothing suggests, however, that they did so because of U.S. pressure when even the Clinton administration seems unenthusiastic about supporting such military action. It seems that good sense has finally prevailed. Democracy is not imposed through armed invasions. This is, however, frequently overlooked in politics on the basis of the strong moral justifications which have dominated Washington and North America for many years. Although Republican administrations were responsible for the military operations against Grenada and Panama, the democrats' "moral" reasons are also very strong. The truth is that its experience in Somalia, which is considered a failure, has embarrassed the United States. In view of this, it has reviewed, once again, its moral role in the world. Some time ago, Clinton explained that the United States cannot resolve world problems. Perhaps this means it will not even try in the future. This means the bloodbaths in Rwanda and South Yemen will continue indefinitely, enabling the U.S. Administration to maintain peace of mind. It tried, it failed, what else can be done. All this is fine if it entails an end to military invasions justified through legal resolutions. It is bad, however, if it means the United States -- paralyzed by moral contradictions -- will conduct its international affairs in a disorderly fashion. The Clinton administration has been fiercely criticized for renewing China's most-favored-nation status, overlooking human rights violations. What is condemnable, however, is not the fact that it has made an exception with China, but that it has not done so in other instances. While the reasons may differ, there is no need to insist that exceptions apply only in terms of trade. There is no sense to military intervention of Haiti. Not just because the OAS, with good sense, rejects the imposition of democracy through military force, but because U.S. intervention in international affairs depends on the nature of the issues in question. Undoubtedly, every human life is precious, but human rights violations in China are not the same as the massacre of hundreds of thousands of Rwandans or Somalis. Furthermore, it is not absolutely clear that the military action in Somalia was wrong. The international community, through the United Nations, made a courageous decision to stop the massacre of innocent people. This is not the same as imposing commercial or military sanctions on a country to restore democracy. The international community needs a leader who can decide where to act and where not to act. If the Clinton administration does not overcome its moral paralysis, it will be tied down like Gulliver by the Lilliputians.
