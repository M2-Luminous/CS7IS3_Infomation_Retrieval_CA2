This was stated here today by Wu Wenying, the president of the China National Textile Council. The trading center will be located in Huayuan International Mansion, whose foundation was laid today, and will include an exhibition hall, a spot-trade market and bonded warehouses for the display and trading of textile machinery and new textile products and technologies. As one of China's largest industrial sectors and the mainstay of its exports, the textile industry has seen closer contacts with international markets and faster steps in restructuring during recent years, making the establishment of a national free trade market a necessity, according to Wu Wenying. The president also explained that Shanghai, as the country's largest economic center and number one trading port, and blessed with China's largest free trade zone in Waigaoqiao, has been chosen to take on the task.
