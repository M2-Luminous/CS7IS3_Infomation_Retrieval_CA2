President Li Teng-hui left Indonesia for an undisclosed destination aboard China Airlines Flight No. B-106. It is not yet known whether he will return home or stop in another ASEAN country. Reports from Denpasar say that Li Teng-hui and the members of his delegation -- estimated at 35, including a number of ministers -- stayed at the Bali Clear Resort near the Nusa Dua tourist resort. There have been no official statements on the Taiwan president's activities during his stay in Bali because his visit was merely a vacation. In addition, Indonesia has no diplomatic relations with Taiwan; it follows a one-China policy.
