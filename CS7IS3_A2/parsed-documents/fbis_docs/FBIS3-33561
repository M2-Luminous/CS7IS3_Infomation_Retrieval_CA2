We have resolved 50 percent of the listed demands. We have already received a satisfactory response to the following points included on the list of demands presented by the Indian Revolutionary Clandestine Committee -- General Command of the EZLN. One of these points calls for the electrification of the Indian communities and the redistribution of federal investments in the State of Chiapas. Another point deals with the impact of the free trade agreement on the Indian communities. Another point has to do with health, truthful information -- as we reported yesterday -- housing, education -- which involves the construction of schools, school equipment, and the availability of teachers -- obligatory and official bilingual education in the Indian communities, respect for Indian traditions and culture, punishment for anyone discriminating or showing contempt for the Indians, the food problem, economic support for the victims of the war and for the widows and orphans of the conflict, the demands of the women on what should be done so that the Indians may live in peace, the multiplication and strengthening of nongovernment human rights organizations, the need to form -- at the adequate moment -- a national peace commission with justice and honor that will be in charge of following up on the agreements reached during these negotiations, and the channeling of humanitarian aid to the conflict zone through the authentic representatives of the Indian communities. This is the last point on which we agreed. These are the agreements we have reached so far. I repeat: Fifty percent of the demands presented by the committee have been satisfactorily met by the commissioner.
