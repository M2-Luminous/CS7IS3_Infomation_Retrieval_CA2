A compromise plan is gaining ground among the seven-party coaltion after coalition party representatives failed to narrow the gap over whether to offset the proposed income tax reduction with a hike in the consumption tax, the official said. Under the plan, the government would issue a statement that would say the government should reach within a year a final decision on basic tax reform policy including revision of the ratio of direct to indirect taxes in the total tax revenues. The plan also calls for the establishment of a special forum within the coalition to discuss the problem. The government failed to reach an agreement on the issue due mainly to opposition by the Social Democratic Party to raising the consumption tax from the current 3 percent to finance the planned tax cuts. The forthcoming package of economic stimulus measures will include income and resident tax cuts worth over 7 trillion yen, the Shinseito official said.
