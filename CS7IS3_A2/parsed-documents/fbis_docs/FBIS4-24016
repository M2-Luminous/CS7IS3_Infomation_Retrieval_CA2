Facing questions from the media on his and his party's new role at a NP briefing, he said he was impressed by the commitment of all the new cabinet members to ensure that the government of national unity was a success. He refused to evaluate the performance of individual members of the cabinet, but said he had sympathy with any new member. "It takes some adaptation--even a change of portfolios makes heavy demands in getting to know your officials and to get on top of issues." The NP's newly constituted 60-member Federal Council had just held its first meeting where the party's goals as South Africa's second largest party were set out. The NP was still committed to the present electoral principle of proportional representation but had charged a commission to look into possible changes in the electoral system. He hoped the next election would be held on the basis of electoral lists compiled through proper registration procedures. Asked about charges that he had snubbed invitations to attend certain functions, Mr de Klerk repeated that he had had prior engagements and that he did not believe in cancelling one engagement in order to accept another, later, invitation. "But there is an element within the ANC -- and it is their right -- who see me as the enemy and will do anything to harm me. My co-operation is fully constructive but I am also leader of the NP and not invited into the government. I am there because I was voted there by four million people and because the constitution says I have a right to be there." He was not there as part of president Nelson Mandela's team. "I do not think I should attend functions of a party political nature of other parties as a regular exercise." He was comfortable with his new role. He had prepared himself for it psychologically before the election, "and besides it was our party's policy that there should be powersharing". Mr de Klerk gave oblique approval to the removal of the Verwoerd name and bust from Cape Town's ministerial headquarter buildings. He would personally not like to have his ministerial office in a building named after the leader of a political party about which he had very negative feelings. Name-changes in general should however not develop into a rampage of pulling down statues. "Name changes are in general a very emotional issue, one cannot write or decide history out of existence."
