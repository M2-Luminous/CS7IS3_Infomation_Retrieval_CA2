"Keeping voters' faith and ensuring South Africa's first democratic election was not disrupted was probably the biggest challenge in the history of the SAP." Mr Kriel said the professionalism and sheer hardwork of members of the force, far exceeded the call of duty. The performance of the police has shown that members of the force were fully committed to democracy and defending the constitution. Mr Kriel congratulated the Commissioner of Police Gen Johan van der Merwe and every man and woman of the force for their indispensable contribution to democracy. A sincere word of thanks should also go to the SA National Defence Force for ably supporting the SAP in its task, Mr Kriel said.
