Envoys from the United States, Russia and Europe -- a special contact group which has been given a week to look into ways of resuming the bogged down Bosnian peace talks -- held talks with Rose, UN civil affairs coordinator for Bosnia Viktor Andreyev and his counterpart for the whole ex-Yugoslavia, Sergio Vieira de Mello, a spokeswoman said. [passage omitted] Envoys from the special contact group here were named as Charles Redman and two assistants, Nick Lang and Hoyt Yee, representing the United States, Alexey Nikiforov, deputy to Vitaliy Churkin, the Russian envoy to former Yugoslavia, David Manning and David Ludlow of Britain, Michael Steiner of Germany, and French envoys Jean-Pierre Masse and Jacques-Alain de Sedouy. The envoys had not yet drawn up an agenda. The Bosnian authorities had been in touch for possible contacts, the spokeswoman added. An UNPROFOR spokesman said earlier that the envoys were operating individually and dispersing around the city. The envoys were also to travel to Pale, the Bosnian Serb stronghold some 15 kilometres (10 miles) east of the city, for talks with separatist leaders who hold 70 percent of Bosnian territory and have proclaimed a breakaway republic. The international community is attempting to create impetus for negotiations following a NATO ultimatum that obliged Serb forces to withdraw from the immediate vicinity of Gorazde and pull back their heavy weapons to a distance of at least 20 kilometres.
