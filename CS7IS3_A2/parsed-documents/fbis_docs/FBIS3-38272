Philip Mok in The Hague; date not given: "A Pointer From the North -- Finnish Premier Pleads for Realism on Russia"; first two paragraphs are ELSEVIER introduction] [Excerpts] Finland is well on the way to acquiring European Union membership, with negotiations to be completed by 1 March. Last week, Esko Tapani Aho, the very young premier of Suomi, the "land of a thousand lakes," made a trip to The Hague in order to present and secure Finnish interests. [passage omitted] Politically, as a representative of the agrarian Finnish Center Party, he is a moderate man. But he looked sharply across the low table and quietly gesticulated in reaction to the comment that Europe had reacted with euphoria to the revolutionary developments in the former Soviet Union and East bloc, whereas Finland had suffered a severe setback. "I do not deny that this was the direct result of the upheavals," he says. "It was indeed dramatic, we lost our markets in the East. As a result we had to look elsewhere, and increasingly to the European market." [Mok] Therefore you have everything to gain in The Hague, where your colleague Lubbers has been tipped repeatedly as a possible future Commission president? [Aho] Yes. But things are now going much better in Finland. And do not forget that other factors than developments on the other side of the eastern border also affected our economy: the general, international recession, the lack of investments, inflation. We have applied successfully certain measures to fight inflation and reduce unemployment. Our aim now is to attract industrial investments. We will succeed in this, and our competitive position has improved already. And now we are recovering gradually from the blow we received following the events in Russia. In 1990, 13 percent of our exports were destined stil lfor the Soviet Union; in 1991 the percentage had fallen to nearly 3 percent (a fall of 10 percent in just one year), and in 1992 they fell even further. But in 1993 our exports to Russia doubled, so we have reason to be optimistic. [Mok] Perhaps. But we hear of long queues at the Finnish soup kitchens, and a lot of people have fallen by the wayside. [Aho] I am not saying that everything in our welfare state is perfect; just that we are on the right road. But you must not overestimate the speed with which you can succeed in situations like this. [Mok] You have adopted a positive position on the Partnership for Peace initiative, which President Clinton presented so forcefully in Europe. But, apart from EU membership, you are not, like some East European countries, seeking NATO membership. Is Finland, with the vast arsenal of Russian weapons and nuclear power stations like Chernobyl just outside St. Petersburg and practically in Finland's own backyard, to remain politically aligned with Finland and Finland alone? [Aho] We are not so keen on new measures for our security. The East European countries which, as members of the Warsaw pact, have been deprived of their security guarantees, are naturally in a different position than neutral, nonaligned Finland. Our interest in the Partnership for Peace is in that part of the program which deals with peacekeeping activities, a field in which we have experience. [Aho] How do you view the phenomenon of Zhirinovskiy, who with his buffoonery as war-horse of the right won the votes of nearly a quarter of the Russian voters? The Finnish defense budget is to be increased for 1995, is it not? [Mok] The one has nothing to do with the other. We are faced simply with the need to spend money in order to modernize our military equipment. Buying new aircraft, for example, costs money. But as far as the success of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy is concerned, all I can say is that I find it easy to understand the growth of nationalism in Russia. People, also outside the former Soviet Union, have overestimated the rapid changes. Many observers thought Russia would be totally transformed in two years. But it does not work like that: politically, economically, and in the field of civil and human rights, expectations were too high. Realism is the best guide, also in order to view developments in Russia in a long-term perspective.
