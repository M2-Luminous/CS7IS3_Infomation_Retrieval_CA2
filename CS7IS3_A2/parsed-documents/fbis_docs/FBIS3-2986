Qian made the assessment at a press conference here today. In response to U.S. President Bill Clinton's reported disappointment over Christopher's China visit, Qian said: "I am also somewhat disappointed. My talks with Christopher have not produced as many results as previously expected." On U.S. granting China most-favored-nation trade status (MFN), Qian said, its renewal will bring benefit to both China and the United States. Otherwise, it will be bad news for both countries, he said.
