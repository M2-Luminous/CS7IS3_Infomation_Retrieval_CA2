FR940620-0-00002 FR940620-0-00001 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Agricultural Marketing Service 7 CFR Part 51 RIN # 0581&hyph;AB03 [Docket Number FV&hyph;93&hyph;302] Fresh Fruits, Vegetables and Other Products (Inspection, Certification, and Standards) AGENCY: Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This final rule revises the regulations governing inspection and certification for fresh fruits, vegetables and other products (other products are: raw nuts, Christmas trees and evergreens, flowers and flower bulbs, and onion sets) by adjusting the fees charged for the inspection of these products at destination markets and by clarifying other charge-related regulations. The fee increases are necessary to offset the costs of developing and maintaining U.S. grade standards for fresh fruits, vegetables and other products and to recover the costs of providing Federal inspection service for these products at destination markets as authorized by the Agricultural Marketing Act (AMA) of 1946. Regulations regarding fees for inspection of small lots (fifty packages or less) are added to provide a fee commensurate with the level of effort typically required to conduct such inspections. Finally, regulations regarding charges for waiting time are added and conditions governing the applicability of dock-side inspection fees are clarified. EFFECTIVE DATE: June 27, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Douglas C. Bailey, Fresh Products Branch, Fruit and Vegetable Division, Agricultural Marketing Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, P.O. Box 96456, Room 2056 South Building, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456, telephone (202) 720&hyph;5870. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This rule has been determined not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866, and has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. It is not intended to have a retroactive effect. This rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule. Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et. seq.), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has certified that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This final rule for the revision of the Regulations governing inspection, certification and standards for fresh fruits, vegetables and other products will not impose substantial direct economic cost, recordkeeping, or personnel workload changes on small entities, and will not alter the market share or competitive position of these entities relative to large businesses. The regulations were last revised in November 1992. This final rule reflects fee increases needed to offset the cost of developing and maintaining U.S. grade standards for fresh fruits and vegetables previously funded through an appropriation and to recover the costs of Federal fruit and vegetable inspection service at destination markets rendered in accordance with the AMA of 1946. In the Agriculture Appropriations Bill for fiscal year 1994, Congress directed AMS to establish a user fee program, pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 9701, to recover the cost of developing, reviewing, and maintaining agricultural commodity standards that describe product quality attributes. This rule amends fees and charges applied to users at destination markets to recover the portion of the cost for fresh fruit and vegetable standardization that is applicable to these users. The AMA authorizes voluntary official inspection, grading, and certification on a user-fee basis, of fresh fruits, vegetables, and other products such as raw nuts, Christmas trees, and flowers. The AMA provides that reasonable fees be collected from the user of the program services to cover as nearly as practicable the costs of services rendered. The program seeks to maintain an unobligated balance that is at least equal to 4 months of operating expense. The unobligated balance for the Federal inspection service at destination markets at the end of fiscal year 1993 was 1.1 months of operating expense. Approximately $240,000 in increases are expected in the cost the service pays for General Services Administration office rent and Federal Telecommunications Service, and a $120,000 increase is expected for the cost of implementing a locality-based pay system in January 1994. The service is implementing cost-cutting actions during fiscal year 1994 that will save approximately $350,000 in destination market costs each fiscal year beginning in fiscal year 1995. These cost-cutting actions will offset most of the expected increases in service costs; however, further action is necessary to meet all rising costs and for the program's unobligated balance to grow to the 4 month level necessary to provide contingency funding. This final rule amends the schedule for fees and charges for services rendered to the fresh fruit and vegetable industry at destination markets to reflect the costs currently associated with the program. A notice of proposed rulemaking was published in the Federal Register (59 FR 8871&hyph;8873) on February 24, 1994 with a thirty day comment period. The comment period closed on March 28, 1994. Interested persons were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the Agricultural Marketing Service.
