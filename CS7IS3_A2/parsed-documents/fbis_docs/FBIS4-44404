The reporting member of the said committee sees this as the sign that Taiwan products are now in inferior position in the competitive battle for overseas markets between the industries on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. He attributes this situation to the fact that Taiwan merchants have shifted their production bases and have placed large investments on the mainland. There is no doubt that the success of mainland products and failure of Taiwan products on the U.S. market is closely related to the fact that Taiwan merchants have placed investments on the mainland, but it is still open to argument whether this indicates that Taiwan products are "in inferior position" and are "successively declining." If we carefully examine the changes in the trade situation since 1986 as between Taiwan, the United States, and other East Asian countries, we may discover that while other countries and territories have greatly increased their exports to the United States and Taiwan's rate of export increases to the United States has slackened, the value of Taiwan's exports to the various countries of East Asia has greatly increased. For instance, Malaysia's exports to the United States increased from about $2.3 billion in 1986 to $5.8 billion in 1991, while Taiwan's exports to Malaysia also increased from 200 million to $1.5 billion. Thailand's exports to the United States increased from about $1.6 billion in 1986 to $6.1 billion in 1991, however, Taiwan's exports to Thailand increased from $300 million to $1.4 billion. This indicates that as Taiwan merchants placed their investments in Malaysia, Thailand, and in Mainland China, the effect was not at all that products formerly exported to the United States were merely diverted to exports to the said regions, but rather that these regions greatly increased purchases of Taiwan raw materials and machinery for use in their processing industries. From the viewpoint of upgrading industry, this situation is normal and healthy. The said "upgrading of industry" consists in reducing the traditional production of labor-intensive products and shifting to the production of capital- and technology-intensive products. Those industries which Taiwan merchants moved to the mainland or Southeast Asia were mostly labor-intensive industries, which had been gradually losing their competitive strength on Taiwan. On the other hand, overseas industries initiated by Taiwan merchants were purchasing Taiwan products, which were mostly capital- and technology-intensive semifinished products and machinery. This conforms to the directional shift in the comparative advantage caused by the change of comparative prices of key elements of production, as it also conforms to Taiwan's objective of economic upgrading. In actual fact, it is not only Taiwan that is undergoing this kind of a shift, but similar shifts are taking place in South Korea, which is at a similar stage of development as Taiwan, and then even in the more advanced country of Japan. Since 1986, South Korea's share in the U.S. market has declined, but at the same time South Korea's investments in Southeast Asia and South Korea's exports to Malaysia have increased from about $200 million in 1986 to $1.1 billion in 1991, and exports to Thailand during the same period from $200 million to $1.4 billion. Japan is at a much higher stage of development than Taiwan and South Korea, but Japan too is to a certain extent conducting similar operations; between 1986 and 1991 exports from Japan have increased: to Malaysia from 1.7 billion to $7.6 billion, and to Thailand from $2.0 billion to $9.4 billion. Japanese economists have come up with a "wild goose flight" theory of economic development [one goose following the other] to describe this phenomenon. Whenever economic entities of East Asia, which are all at different stages of development, face other economies in the world which are in a simultaneous process of economic advance, the relative scarcity of key elements of production and the gradual transfer of comparative advantages, makes the situation, with its transfers each time from the first economic entity to the hands of the next contestant, appear like a relay race, and in this process investments and trade produce corresponding changes. This does not, of course, signify that nothing is left in the hands of the economic entity that is in the relatively more advanced position, but it indicates that it will, in addition to increased investments and exports to the developmentally lower area, produce new products that conform to its particular comparative advantage. As far as Taiwan is concerned, its electronic communications industry is rapidly developing; its computer main frames and monitors have been at the top in world markets for several consecutive years. Exports of these two items have increased from $2.3 billion in 1990 to $4 billion last year, which gives a good picture of the situation. Going abroad with their investments by Taiwan merchants has of course also its negative effects, and problems involved in investments on the mainland must be noted, must be taken into consideration, and must be studied. However, if one looks purely at the change of their shares in the U.S. market, and would conclude that Taiwan products are in an inferior position and that industrial upgrading has not been successful, it would unavoidably be too rough and careless a conclusion. The effect of the increase in value of the NT$ [new Taiwan dollar] since 1986 and the effect of Taiwan merchants going abroad with their investments must be understood within the framework of the changes in relations between the economic entities through the entire East Asia region, and the true situation can only be understood when studying the development indicated by the "wild goose flight" theory. This alone will furnish the foundation for a rational and feasible policy.
