Shakhray said he was amazed at the intentions to reorganize the government without Gaydar. He said "there were more question marks and minuses than pluses." At the same time, he said he had met neither with Gaydar nor with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin on the issue. "It is necessary to weigh all the factors before making a close analysis of the new composition of the government," he said. Prior to this, Shakhray told journalists he was not prepared to tell who might replace Gaydar as he did not know more of the situation than the journalists themselves. He supposed that Gaydar's resignation will almost certainly lead to granting new credits and another drop of the ruble. In his opinion, the government's policy will be the most likely to be adjusted to meet the needs of the industrialists. Asked about the government's intention to allocate $500 million for the construction of a parliamentary center in Moscow, Shakhray pointed out that "this money would be useful for the economy." At the same time, the vice prime minister noted that achieving the same goal will cost much higher in a year. Commenting on the election of deputy speakers and heads of parliamentary committees by a single list, Shakhray said that on the whole the State Duma gained from using this approach. "Had we nominated heads of parliamentary committees person by person, the political spectrum would have been more uniform, and the factor of professional qualification for the post would not have been always taken into account," he pointed out. At the same time, he said deputies elected from single-mandate constituencies lost from the voting for the list. Only PRUC and the deputies' group "New Policy" stood up for their interests. "However, we were in minority and could not influence the situation," he pointed out.
