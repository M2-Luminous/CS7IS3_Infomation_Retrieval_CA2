Many observers already predict that "it is difficult to expect that a conclusion will be reached by the year's end," with the unified local elections and the House of Councillors election pending next year. Officials at the Finance Ministry's Tax Bureau are ready for a prolonged battle and say, "Talk of a tax increase is taboo before elections, and it is better to carry out an increase in the consumption tax rate in April 1997." As for the SDPJ, which killed the national welfare tax plan, it is true that the party is not concerned about the future of the consumption tax rate after the upper house election. SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi Murayama divulged to people around him that "there is no other choice but to raise the tax rate." It looks like the SDPJ's leaders have already been shown a blueprint by top officials of the Finance Ministry's Tax Bureau of a tax system reform. According to the Finance Ministry plan, the name of the current consumption tax will be changed, will be called either a "welfare tax" or a "national life tax," and will be incorporated in the yearly report of the government-sponsored Tax System Committee, to make it appear that the plan was thoroughly discussed. At first, the tax rate will be set at 7 percent, with the 3-percent rate left intact on sales of food products to save the face of the SDPJ. In addition, the plan is said to have prepared a year-end refund of about 20,000 yen for low-income people, to appease Komeito [Clean Government Party]. It is doubtful, however, whether the governing coalition parties can come to a conclusion before the year's end, as the Finance Ministry hopes they can. As for the Finance Ministry, Administrative Vice Minister Jiro Saito faces difficulty in playing an active role this time, because he was under attack over the national welfare tax. Therefore, Tax Bureau Director General Tadashi Ogawa and his staff are likely to make the necessary prearrangements. But, many Tax Bureau officials are cautious about handling the tax reform and express a negative sentiment by saying that "it is more than enough just to complete the discussions within the year." Such an attitude is attributed to the fact that Director General Ogawa is closely associated with former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, thus suggesting a possible resurgence of the Tax Bureau's behind-the-scenes strife with those affiliated to the line of Ichiro Ozawa and Saito. Director General Ogawa cannot get along at all with Vice Minister Saito, and he does not even nod to the vice minister when he runs across him in the ministry's hallway. At the end of last year, he was reported to be set to be dismissed from his post, and Takeshita seems to have mediated to settle the strife. Their relations, however, are still riddled with cracks. Vice Minister Saito is reputed to be "the type of outstanding person who comes along every 10 years," while Director General Ogawa is the "trump card of the Finance Ministry" who has dealt with broad sections of the ministry such as taxes, the budget, the minister's secretariat, and the like. Within the ministry, it is said prematurely that they will compete for the post of governor of the Bank of Japan 10 years from now. What to do with Tax System Committee Chairman Hiroshi Kato will also become a focal point in the future discussion of the tax system. Although his term of office expired at the end of January, he is full of ambition to act as chairman. However, because of his repeated slips of his tongue concerning his convictions and his settlement of problems with Prime Minister Hosokawa through direct talks over the head of the ministry, the Tax Bureau wants him "to retire." It is also true, however, that "there is no suitable man of ability to succeed him." The composition of the Tax System Committee has been criticized publicly for being "composed of representatives of the rich and for not reflecting the voice of the common people." With this in the background, the Prime Minister's Office is considering a dramatic plan to add new members who are largely women to the prime minister's liking.
