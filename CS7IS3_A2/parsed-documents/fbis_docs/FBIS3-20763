Enterprises are deprived of funds, which are not refunded to them, and their earnings are lower than at enterprises that, in a similar situation, do not have to pay the popiwek. Moreover, as is being pointed out, the popiwek is a disincentive for higher labor productivity. Years of routine application of the popiwek have resulted in generating additional problems. Many enterprises have ceased to pay this tax, while others pay it only irregularly. Postponing the payment of this tax by juggling books is a widespread practice. According to reports from the Internal Revenue Service on 10 December 1993, enterprises owed the [state] budget 17.9 trillion zlotys [Z], of which deferred arrears accounted for Z10.3 trillion; arrears for previous years account for more than half of the tax indebtedness of enterprises. The arguments made in favor of retaining the popiwek are as follows: --The absence of an authentic owner in the state sector means a potential wage explosion. --The popiwek impedes a decrease in employment--that is, it protects against an excessive growth of unemployment. --The popiwek is indispensable to maintaining stability because it serves to restrict wage increases to a relatively moderate pace; this is particularly important to adhering to the principle of indexing the salaries of civil servants and pensioners as well as welfare payments to wages paid in the economy as a whole. These arguments were sharply contested in the Sejm in recent weeks as well as within the governing coalition itself (the OPZZ [postcommunist National Trade Union Alliance] was opposed to the popiwek). Still, the popiwek was extended until the end of March, and the government pledged itself to think up some substitute therefor, and it did so.... Last week, the Economic Committee of the Council of Ministers approved the draft of a new law, "Wage and Salary Guidelines at Economic Entities" (at state enterprises and companies in which the State Treasury owns a share of at least 50 percent). Following its consideration by the Council of Ministers, this draft law may soon now be on the agenda of the Sejm. There are no miracles. The draft law is reworking the traditional popiwek. This is its principal flaw as seen by many deputies. Of course, that is a subject that could be discussed, and I am not sure whether the draft would fare better if the issues concerned were to be plainly posed in advance. If we overlook certain embellishments and revisions (some being debatable) in the language of the proposed solutions, they basically seem simply new versions of the popiwek: --One modification is that enterprises are to be fined by having to pay a tax amounting to double the wage increase in excess of the norm, rather than a progressive tax as in the traditional popiwek, which should be satisfactory to some. --One useful revision seems to be that one-half of the receipts from popiwek-bis is to be transferred to the Industrial Development Agency for spending on industrial restructuring. This will alleviate the discriminatory aspect of that tax. --On the other hand, the replacement of the traditional norm [wage norm, which if exceeded results in having to pay the popiwek], derived from the average wage paid in September 1989, with the average wage paid in the second half of 1993 or in the entire year 1993, is a highly debatable revision. It would hurt the enterprises that, owing to lack of funds or an excessive emphasis on solidity, maintained their wages at below the norm--and such enterprises account for about 40 percent of the total. At the same time, it would benefit those enterprises that granted wage increases and that often owe huge tax arrears because they hope for continued extensions and ultimately for a moratorium on their taxes.... Perhaps a less discriminatory solution would be a specific increase in the norm. Of course, other revisions paving the way to a more consistent parting with the popiwek also could be indicated. For example, agreements for remuneration between the parent agency and the administrator--that is, so-called management contracts--could be made possible. Unfortunately, however, at most enterprises the appropriate organizational and legal conditions for this approach are lacking. This would require a far-reaching alteration of the methods for exercising the function of the owner, a function exercised by the parent agencies, including the application of commercial law [to state enterprises], which would enable the owner [i.e., the State Treasury] to guide more effectively the operations of the actually commercialized state enterprises, etc. Particular questions and problems are raised by: a) the possibility of choosing an accord with the Internal Revenue Service, and b) the possibility of adjustment of wages as a function of actual profits. In the former case, this means an added burden on the already tightly stretched operations of the Internal Revenue Service and, in the latter, a so-called growth formula, with its attendant problems, such as a deterioration in the situation of the enterprises at which the share of wages in operating expenses (in relation to profits) is higher. Moreover, the draft law contains a clause depriving many enterprises of the possibility of choosing a wage-control approach other than the popiwek--namely, the requirement that they must first settle their arrears to the state budget. For an overwhelming majority of the debtor enterprises, this requirement is impossible to fulfill. Thus, in the near future, we can expect another round of government-parliamentary disputes concerning the popiwek. ZYCIE GOSPODARCZE has asked members of the Club of 500 [500 leading Polish enterprises] for specific comments about this draft law of the Ministry of Finance. It can hardly be denied that, given its present situation, the Polish economy would find it difficult to dispense with the popiwek prosthesis. But, in the long run, this prosthesis will not substitute for advanced institutional and market solutions, such as, especially, would afford real possibilities for so-called trilateral wage agreements among employers, employees, and the government. This is not just a question of the number of privatized enterprises but, to an ever-increasing degree, a matter of bringing order into the activities of the state as an owner [of state enterprises], genuinely commercializing state enterprises, etc.
