The late President of Vietnam Ho Chi Minh visited Myanmar 35 years ago, and that visit was a turning point in the road of mutual understanding between the two nations. Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet's visit also left a deep impression on the Myanmar people. Despite the changing weather, thousands of people in their colorful traditional costumes, lined up along the road leading to the center of Rangoon to welcome Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and his party. On the very first day of his visit, all newspapers in Myanmar frontpaged portrait and biography of Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet. They also carried editorials praising relations between the two countries. Various meetings among state leaders of the two countries took place in the atmosphere of mutual understanding. Future economic and trade cooperation between Vietnam and Myanmar was an important topic at the talks. An agreement on trade was signed in 1976, but trade turnover was very modest, mainly in exchange of consumer goods and family facilities. Therefore, this time both Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and his Myanmar counterpart Than Shwe expressed the determination to further strengthen cooperative relations between the two countries. Prime Minister Than Shwe said that he has been following, with keen interest, the successful process of renovation in Vietnam. He said that there was no obstacle for Myanmar to develop its relations with Vietnam. Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet said: Vietnam always attaches great importance to the development of more bilateral cooperation with Myanmar. An agreement on trade, tourism cooperation and the establishment of a joint commission of bilateral cooperation was signed during the visit. It is the concrete manifestation of the two countries' determination. Myanmar is now in its process of renovation. Hence, Vietnam and Myanmar share much in common. The existing fine relations between Vietnam and Myanmar and the outcome of the visit by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet will usher in a new stage of relations and cooperation between the two countries. This was assessed by the foreign ministers of Vietnam and Myanmar. And now the two nations are trying their best to make their cooperation more effective and fruitful.
