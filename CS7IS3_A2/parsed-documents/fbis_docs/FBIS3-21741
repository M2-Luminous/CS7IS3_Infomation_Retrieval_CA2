The institution of federal justice warned that this drug is a toxic substance 400 times more potent than cocaine, producing addiction when first consumed. Within a short time, it also causes irreversible damage and inevitable death to those using it. According to reports submitted to the Federal Judicial Police chief, Adrian Carrera, the drug, derived from amphetamines and other chemical substances, was discovered by the federal agents at this area's international airport. Based on investigations conducted for some time, it was learned that a purchase and sale operation involving the fatal narcotic was to take place at the airport. Therefore, an operation was mounted a week ago, bringing results yesterday. The drugs were in that airport's baggage department and, when they were located, the PGR agents merely waited for the owners to show up. Yesterday, Joaquin Montano Moreno and Enrique Moreno Sanchez appeared to claim the aforementioned packages. When they were caught, they could not explain the presence of the drugs, and hence were placed at the disposal of the agent from the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office, as persons presumed guilty of crimes against health. The drugs presumably were to be sent to the United States. It is known that the product called "crystal," like other synthetic drugs such as "ice" and "crack," is being processed in clandestine laboratories from amphetamines. It is often sold at a relatively low price, owing to its small production cost. Nevertheless, it is highly toxic, causing fatal damage to the human body.
