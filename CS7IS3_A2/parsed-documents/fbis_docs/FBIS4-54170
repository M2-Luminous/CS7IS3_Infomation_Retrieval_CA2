At around 16 hours 33 minutes, three combatant ships of the puppet navy based in South Korean Taechong Islet infiltrated deeply into our side's waters South of Ochajin-ri, Yongyon County, South Hwanghae Province, in battle formation for the purpose of kidnapping our peaceful fishing boats openly in broad daylight. They hurriedly fled South, failing to carry out their hostile scheme due to the quick sailing of a naval patrol craft of the Korean People's Army to the scene. The reckless naval intrusion of the South Korean puppets was a premeditated provocation to incite North-South confrontation and lead the situation on the Korean peninsula to a higher pitch of strain. If the South Korean puppets continue along the road of confrontation and war, ignoring the unanimous desire of the Korean people and the world peaceloving people for the peace of the Korean peninsula and its reunification, they will be meted out a stern punishment.
