There were rumours that Horn's health had deteriorated and he was in critical condition. To prevent other rumours, the physician-director of the hospital, Zoltan Katona, told MTI's correspondent in Miskolc that the HSP chairman continues to be in good condition compared to the injuries suffered. In order to speed up his recovery, a minor operation was carried out on Horn's right wrist on Sunday morning. This means that the traditional cast used for broken bones was replaced with a plate fixing procedure, so that the HSP chairman will be able to use his hand much earlier. Dr. Katona also said the party chairman will be allowed to leave his bed on Monday, and is expected to leave the Miskolc hospital in the second half of the week. Many patients in the largest hospital of Miskolc County exercised their voting rights through the mobile ballot boxes. According to MTI's information, Gyula Horn declined to use this opportunity, as that would mean he would have to vote in Miskolc in the second round of the elections, but he does not wish to be a resident of the hospital at that time.
