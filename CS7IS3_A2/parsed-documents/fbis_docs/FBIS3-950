Our special correspondent, Guy-Bertrand Mapangou, is on line. Guy Bertrand, what are the main resolutions? [Mapangou] The curtains have just been drawn at the 15 January Palace here in Ndjamena on the 29th summit of UDEAC heads of state. The major outcome of the meeting was the signing by the heads of state of the act establishing the Central African Economic and Monetary Community [CEMAC] similar to the West African Economic and Monetary Union [UEMOA]. A new act has just been enacted in the subregion, a new forum for reflection and a new economic framework. UDEAC heads of state are determined to transform their monetary zone into a veritable monetary and economic union. France, [words indistinct], CEMAC, and UEMOA have big integration projects concerning for instance insurance, provident fund, business management rights, the creation of regional centers for economic training, [words indistinct] and economic studies. Concerning the conventions of the monetary and economic union which were not finalized, the heads of state have decided to set up a committee of plenipotentiaries consisting of ministers of economy, finance, external relations, and justice, as well as the governor of the Bank of Central African States, and the UDEAC secretary general. This committee is expected to finalize these conventions before the next UDEAC summit slated for Yaounde in December under the chairmanship of President Paul Biya. The council of heads of states also decided to convene a meeting of the CEMAC and donors to study the means of mitigating the negative effects of the devaluation in the countries of the subregion. An act approving the restructuring of UDEAC was signed by the heads of state. Gabon is expected to apply for the post of deputy UDEAC secretary general which was declared vacant during the summit. Other decisions were also made especially in the air, land, and river transport sectors. The heads of state decided to reactivate these sectors by reopening the river route between Bangui and Brazzaville. The European Union has granted 7 billion CFA francs for the reconstitution of this waterway.
