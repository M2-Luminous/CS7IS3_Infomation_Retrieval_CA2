Chavan, says conditions in Kashmir are favorable for initiating a political process. Speaking to newspersons in Bombay yesterday, he said the antimilitancy drive in the valley has received a good response. Mr. Chavan said the people now realize that the activities of the militants have nothing to do with religion. Meanwhile, the CPI [Communist Party of India] has demanded immediate consultations by the national and the state parties to initiate a political process in Jammu and Kashmir. In a letter to the prime minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao, the party general secretary, Mr. Inderjit Gupta, said the government is relying mainly on administrative measures to tackle the serious problem. The CPI is opposed to this approach. The Janata Dal leader, Mr. George Fernandes, has urged the militants in Jammu and Kashmir to give up the path of violence and come to the negotiating table. Talking to newsmen in Jammu yesterday, he said this will help in restoring democratic process in the state. In Jammu and Kashmir, 11 police personnel have been dismissed from service for dereliction of duty. They were found wanting in preventing militants from setting ablaze a bridge in Anantnag District. They did not put up resistance expected from them to avert the militants. The state government had announced earlier that stringent action will be taken against the defaulting police personnel. It also said the police personnel who show courage to thwart the militants action will be rewarded. As reported 20 policemen were dismissed last year on this account.
