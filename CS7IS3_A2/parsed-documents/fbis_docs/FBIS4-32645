The region became a United Nations protected area in March 1992 after having earlier declared independence from Croatia. The republic of Serb Krajina's late 1991 declaration of independence followed Croatia's secession from Yugoslavia and the removal of Serb national rights from the Croatian Constitution. Speaking in Sisak near the border with Serb Krajina, Gen. Bobetko said Zagreb would expel the peacekeepers if they did not help reintegrate the Krajina region into Croatia, the Croatian press wrote Monday. "Croatia will in that case do it alone," said Bobetko. Under a plan proposed by former U.N. envoy Cyrus Vance, UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] forces were to remain in the Krajina region until a political settlement was achieved between Croatia and the republic of Serb Krajina. Croatia, which does not recognize the Serb republic, considers the region "occupied territory" and has attacked it in three offensives since March 1992. Bobetko and Tomislav Mercep, a ruling Croatian Democratic Union member of the Croatian Parliament, have announced plans for a new offensive on the Serb republic. Mercep is the leader of a Croatian paramiltary formation that has been accused by Serb officials of committing numerous war crimes. The Croatian press quoted Mercep as saying he would organize Zagreb demonstrations in September by about 100,000 members of the Croatian Army and police "ready to liberate all occupied Croatian territories." "If the Serbs refuse to accept Croatia's Constitution, I will personally issue an order to liberate Knin and so devastate it that no two stones will be left standing on top of one another," said Mercep at a recent meeting in the Port of Pula. During the 1991-1992 Croatian war of secession, Mercep led a 500- member special police unit that was reported to have killed at least 2,500 Serb civilians in western Slavonia.
