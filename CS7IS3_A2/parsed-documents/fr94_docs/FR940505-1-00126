FR940505-1-00126 FR940505-1-00012 EPA initiated a convening process to determine the best way to work with industry and other interested parties in developing regulations for small SI engines. The conveners interviewed individuals in leadership roles in key organizations identified by EPA to determine what parties were interested in these regulations, what issues were important to interested parties, and whether a consultative rulemaking process would be feasible and appropriate. A copy of the convening report dated August 24, 1992, is available in the docket for this rulemaking. The convening report recommended an exploratory meeting of interested parties to discuss, but not initiate, a consultative process. Time-forcing factors lending an air of urgency to issuance of the rule include: (1) The need of states to realize emission reductions from nonroad sources that are creditable toward Reasonable Further Progress requirements of the CAA, and (2) the potential threat to industry of patchwork regulation if a number of states opt into California's program in order to attain national air quality goals. The deadlines created by the settlement of the Sierra Club suit mentioned earlier led to even further need to issue a rule quickly. The exploratory meeting recommended in the convening report was held in Ann Arbor, Michigan, on November 16&hyph;17, 1992. Participants decided that state and public interest representatives needed more technical information to fully understand some of the regulatory issues participants might face. It was also decided that another meeting was necessary to discuss the potential design of a consultative process for a small SI engine rulemaking. The technical briefing for state and public interest representatives was conducted in Ann Arbor on December 16, 1992. On January 28&hyph;29, 1993, a meeting to discuss consultative process design was held in Ann Arbor. At the January meeting, it was suggested that EPA consider a two-phased approach to regulation of small SI engines. In the first phase, EPA would propose regulations for small SI engines through the normal regulatory process rather than a consultative process. The suggested Phase 1 regulations would be similar to California's Regulation for 1995 and Later Utility and Lawn and Garden Equipment Engines, modified as necessary to meet CAA requirements. (For example, EPA's proposal would modify CARB's program by including engines preempted from regulation in California.) The Phase 1 proposal would be completed as soon as possible, but no later than the spring of 1994. The final rule would be completed no later than spring of 1995. The second phase of regulation would be developed through the consultative process of regulatory negotiation. It would include issues such as useful life, in-use emission, evaporative emissions, refueling emissions, test procedure, and market-based incentive programs. Today's action proposes that both phases of regulation for small SI engines be applied to the FIP areas. An overview of what EPA anticipates will be included in a Phase 1 program is outlined below. EPA believes that the Federal Phase 1 Standards will result in a 40 percent reduction in the HC inventory with a slight (less than l percent) increase in NO X . Phase 2 small SI engine regulations are expected to achieve 90 percent reduction in the small SI engine baseline HC emissions inventory. The Agency expects that achieving a 90 percent reduction would not depend solely on more stringent exhaust standards, but rather a combination of strategies (i.e., a scrappage program or other programs to accelerate turnover, spillage control programs, fuels requirements and evaporative emission controls) that added together would result in the anticipated reduction. Negotiations have been underway since Fall 1993 and will continue for approximately 18 months. The phased approach to regulation of small SI engines is incorporated in the Sierra Club v. Browner settlement. Phase 2 regulation is expected to apply federally and in California in approximately 2000&hyph;2001. Should the Agency's Phase 2 small SI engine program fail to provide for a 90 percent reduction from the current uncontrolled emissions inventory, EPA shall promulgate a more stringent program applicable to California, or the FIP areas, or propose fees for commercial operators of SI engines at or under 19 kW. (b) Overview of Program to Control Emissions from SI Engines Under 19 kW. The general provisions that EPA expects to propose for the Phase 1 and Phase 2 rules, as well as the rationale for the key parts of the proposal, are briefly described in the following section.
