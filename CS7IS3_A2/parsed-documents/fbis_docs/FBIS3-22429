Mikhaylov: Mikhail Yakovlevich, first of all I would like to congratulate you on assuming the post, your election as chairman of the State Duma Ecology Committee. Even though it seems to many people today that ecological problems are not the most important thing in our present life and that there are certainly things which are more important. Do you agree with this assertion? Lemeshev: I am deeply certain that the rebirth of Russia and the Russian people, which everyone under the sun is talking about now, is impossible without solving ecological problems. This is determined by the fact that in itself the ecological situation in the country is simply disastrous; everyone understands that, there is no need to explain. In fact today we are talking about survival. Take the demographic aspect. It is an altogether depressing situation; essentially the indigenous peoples of Russia are dying out. The scientific research of prestigious scientists, in particular American and Japanese scientists, shows that 40 percent of the children born in recent times are already ill. What will happen to them later, in their adult lives? Generally two-thirds of all diseases today are linked to the bad state of the environment. This is more urgent for Russia than for the West. Above all it is environmental pollution in cities with a population of more than a million inhabitants which causes alarm. Here, as a rule, there is very bad water (and generally it is bad everywhere in our country) and food products contain pesticides, nitrates, and various biological additives. And what is interesting is that this applies less to domestically made products than to imported products. Propaganda, advertising, and pretty packaging do their work here; we are still susceptible to all this. The developed countries often sell us what there is no demand for in their countries. Incidentally, there are fairly strict nature protection laws in many countries of the Western world. In my opinion, that is where we must focus our activity, on improving the health of our people. That is the primary task. Yes, biological diversity and problems of protected territories are important, and that is good, but the most important thing is people's health. Mikhaylov: But to do all this capital is needed, and I would assume a considerable amount of it. Where is it supposed to come from, at the expense of what and at whose expense? After all, the only thing anyone talks about is the meager state treasury and the incredible state budget deficit. As a member of the State Duma, you are obliged to take into account the conditions of our reality. Are all these things you are so persuasively discussing realistic from a financial standpoint? Lemeshev: As an economist, I am simply depressed by the very widespread opinion that once the economy is in crisis, it is then impossible to work on economic problems. It is just when such a crisis arises that we supposedly take up ecology in earnest. And the saddest thing is that, in my opinion, this is simply a bad idea -- it finds a response in people's souls. That is certainly understandable: people are on the edge of survival and this is the point where it is every man for himself, as they say. And that is radically wrong. Without solving ecological problems, we will never raise the economy either, I am absolutely convinced of that. Here is a clear example. With environmental pollution, people get sick more often and more seriously and hence do not participate in production so actively. Does that have an effect on the state's economy or not? In order to treat people, buy medicine, and build hospitals, an enormous amount of capital is needed. Does that really not put a burden on the economy? Only altogether short-sighted people are unable to see that. All right, let us take production of fabrics. For the fabric to be good quality, we need not simply water, but clean water. Isn't it easier and cheaper not to pollute the water from the start rather than spend enormous amounts of money to decontaminate it? Remember that it is impossible to separate the economy and ecology -- it is a single metasystem. And I would like to say one more thing: There are no ecological problems of one state or another; ecological problems cannot be solved within the boundaries of one state. Say the Scandinavian countries have been very successful in solving ecological problems, but 90 percent of the pollution of the natural environment comes to them from other countries. Mikhaylov: But that is putting the question in general terms, so to speak; now what practical steps should the committee begin with, in your opinion? What draft laws do you consider paramount in the sphere of environmental protection? Lemeshev: I would not want to complain right off of lack of organization, but as of now for 15 deputies and just as many apparat employees we have two small rooms, no typewriters, no computers, and no organizational equipment. I do not know how we are going to work. As for the committee's legislative work, I believe preparing a draft law on ecological disaster zones is most important. True, all Russia can now be called an ecological disaster zone, but there are the worst ones, say the Chernobyl disaster zone, rayons where chemical and petrochemical production are concentrated, and production sites of hydrocarbon raw materials in northern Russia where a terrible blow is being inflicted on the habitat of the small peoples. We are in dire need of a law on the ecological expert study, not a departmental one, as is customary now, but a federal state expert study with broad public participation. Only in that way will we be able to put up a barrier on the path of projects that destroy both nature and humans themselves. And isn't legislation on drinking water important? Must we not make additions to the Criminal Code related to accountability for ecological crimes? So there is a vast field of work. Mikhaylov: Mikhail Yakovlevich, looking over the list of members of your committee, the fair degree of diversity caught my attention: there are deputies from "Russia's Choice," and communists, and members of the Democratic Party of Russia, and you yourself represent the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] faction. Doesn't it seem to you that this lack of political uniformity will hinder the committee's normal lawmaking work? Moreover, you must build constructive relations with the Russian Federation Ministry of Protection of the Environment and Natural Resources. Lemeshev: As for the latter, I feel optimistic because of the fact that the minister himself, Viktor Ivanovich Danilov-Danilyan, is a member of our committee, and at least for now, we have a mutual understanding on all issues. Although I have heard plenty of the unbiased polemics between Danilov-Danilyan and the chairman of the RF Interdepartmental Commission on Ecological Safety, Aleksey Vladimirovich Yablokov, which unfolded on the pages of NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, personally I do not quite like it when such disagreements arise between such respected people. It is simply the scourge of our Russian intelligentsia and we must discard departmental, political, and professional ambitions when it is a matter of the common cause. We must change our psychology. But I look at the work of our committee with hope because I am certain that the task of preserving the environment can unite people of the most diverse political views.
