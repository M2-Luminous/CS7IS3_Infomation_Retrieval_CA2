A brief news conference was held prior to the official talks in the State Department building, at which the U.S. secretary of state among other things said that Slovenia was an extremely successful country that was advancing fast. He also expressed satisfaction over the fact that Slovenia had joined the Partnership for Peace. When I asked him what was the U.S. stance toward the statements of some Italian politicians who have been voicing open territorial demands toward Slovenia and Croatia, the U.S. secretary of state said that he was not acquainted with such demands but in extremely categorical terms stated that the United States is opposed to change of borders and resolutely supports the territorial inviolability of Slovenia. Slovene Foreign Minister Peterle after the talks said that they were very successful. They discussed political and economic cooperation, where certain problems exist, for example, the issue of debts of the Krsko nuclear plant that were approved by the U.S. export-import bank EXIM. The Slovene foreign minister also raised the issue of the lifting of the arms embargo for Slovenia. Although the United States would not agree to a unilateral lifting of this UN Security Council measure, there is a growing belief that the United States would consent to a partial lifting of this embargo, especially in nonmilitary spheres. As an example of this, Foreign Minister Peterle put forward the import of explosives used in the construction of the Slovene highways. The U.S. secretary of state among other things also received an invitation to visit Slovenia. With this, Slovene Foreign Minister Peterle ended the talks in Washington.
