The tournament of rhetoric could not even electrify the attention of analysts, as every paragraph is a reiterated condemnation of affairs, topics, and archaic turns of phrases that are already very well known. The ceremonial opening and closing sessions were what attracted the television cameras and photographers. If we had to mention something other than the ritual speeches by Colombian President Cesar Gaviria and Argentine President Carlos Menem, then we would have to say that Fidel Castro's stylized shirt was a general commentary on the meeting. Since just after the Sierra Maestra guerrillas entered Havana, he has never given up dressing in his green uniform. The Cuban dictator loped through the summit like a protagonist without a role. He was barely able to draft a paragraph in which he "bitterly" complained that the Final Declaration (approved by consensus) did not contain one line on the "American sanctions," a topic on which the Argentine foreign minister informally and correctly said that "Cuba is in a position to buy what it needs in Canada, Europe, and a large number of other countries." Of course, the Final Declaration contains chapters on "integration" in a hemisphere where words deny facts, and outlines its opposition to any kind of attempt to cause problems regarding trade links, transactions, and negotiations linked to production, exports, and exchange of products between the hemisphere's nations. Finally, it cannot but mention the Argentine president's move to propose that the Final Declaration contain a condemnation of the practice of abortion -- currently being promoted inappropriately by the United Nations -- a motion that regretably did not receive the hoped for effect. Nevertheless a valuable precedent remains: that in international forums our country defends the life that is about to be born, which is like saying that we are betting on the future.
