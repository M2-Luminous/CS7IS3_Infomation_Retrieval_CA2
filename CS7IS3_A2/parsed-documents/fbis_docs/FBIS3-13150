Our Arab affairs correspondent Ehud Ya'ari reports that the move came as a surprise, has not been coordinated with the United States, and clashes with the U.S. Administration's effort to renew the process. Our political correspondent Gadi Sukenik reports that Jerusalem rejects the idea and stresses that only the format decided on in the original Madrid conference is the framework for negotiations. [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 2000 GMT on 9 March in a similar report adds: "The Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem said in reaction that Israel rejects the proposal to reconvene the Madrid conference, because it has gone a long way in the bilateral peace talks, but adds that if Russia raises an official proposal on the matter, Israel will look into it and respond accordingly."]
