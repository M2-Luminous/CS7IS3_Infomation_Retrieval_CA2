This came in a letter from Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. The letter emphasized the need to observe the general rules requiring that Iraqi money deposited in the suspended account be invested efficiently and that the proceeds be added to the principal. Following is the text of the letter: Your Excellency Butrus Butrus-Ghali, UN Secretary General, New York Regarding UN Security Council Resolution 778 of 1992, I would like to point out the following: 1. Paragraph 1 of the said resolution decided that all the countries that hold deposits of money for the Iraqi Government which represent proceeds of Iraqi oil sales or oil products, paid in or after August 1990, must transfer the funds as early as possible to the suspended guarantee account, as laid out in Resolution 706 and 712 of 1991. Inasmuch as the money put into the Iraqi deposit accounts cannot legally come under this heading, since, although it represents the proceeds of oil sales, having become part of the account it loses this capacity. The money thus becomes Iraqi deposits, in view of the fact that the source of the debt changed from a sales contract to a bank deposit. Consequently, the money does not represent oil sales as stated in the resolution. The argument stated above supports Paragraph 2 of the same Security Council resolution referring to the proceeds from oil sales before they are added to any account. This means the sale price must go into the suspended credit account. 2. According to banking transaction rules, a suspended account owner, in our case the Iraqi Government, does not lose it. Accordingly, as the legal proprietor of the account, the Iraqi Government's opinion must be taken into consideration in all that affects the account. 3. It must also be taken into account that the general rules require funds deposited in the suspended account to be invested efficiently and their proceeds added to the principal. From the above, it is obvious that the provisions of the said Security Council resolution are illegal; indeed, they flout established banking norms that form the foundations of international trade. Kindly distribute this letter as a document of the Security Council. Regards.
