On the last day of his visit, various agreements were signed between Turkey and Moldova envisaging friendship and cooperation. The president held a news conference at Ankara Esenboga Airport on his return and assessed his visits. He pointed out that the visits added strong and rich contents to the relations between Turkey and Ukraine and Moldova. He said: I have come back from a historic embrace with our Turkic brothers. Demirel pointed out that in Ukraine, he gave the message that Turkey is a good friend, a useful neighbor, and a serious cooperation partner for that country. He said that an agreement in principle was reached to jointly build a Mediterranean-Black Sea oil pipeline, and other agreements were signed in highway transportation and tourism. He added: These are basic agreements that will enable our peoples and our business circles to engage in deeper and more beneficial cooperation relations, and they complement agreements signed earlier. We also took a very important step during our visit in affirming that the Crimean Turks -- one of the historical owners of Ukrainian lands -- constitute a real bridge of friendship and cooperation in the relations between our two countries. We announced our good news that as a contribution of the Turkish nation to the return of the Crimean Turks to their historical homeland, we will build 1,000 homes in Crimea. This will be the first international aid to the Crimean Turks ever since they started to return to their homeland. The president said that during his visit to Moldova, he gave the Moldovan officials the message that they can trust Turkey's friendship and that Turkey will try to extend every possible kind of aid to that country. He stressed that the visit built the strong legal foundations of the bilateral relations based on agreements. Demirel pointed out that eight agreements were signed with Moldova on transportation, agriculture, culture, the fight against organized crime, and so on. The most important of these agreements, he said, was the agreement on friendship and cooperation. Demirel said: We reached an agreement on a $35 million Eximbank loan -- which was being discussed for some time -- to be used in the development projects in the Gagauz region. Meanwhile, in the framework of another agreement, the Turkish Cooperation and Development Agency will open an office in Kishinev. President Demirel pointed out that during his visit, he toured the Gagauz region accompanied by the Moldovan president. He added that he had the opportunity to observe the rich customs and traditions of the Gagauz Turks. Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin and Transportation Minister Mehmet Kostepen returned to Turkey with President Demirel.
