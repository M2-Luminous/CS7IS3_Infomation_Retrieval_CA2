It is now possible "that the terrible murders will come to an end. First in this place and then in the others," Kohl said at the Hamburg Christian Democratic Union [CDU] Congress on Monday [21 February]. In the next few weeks, all one's power must be used to achieve an overall plan. Kohl advocated an international conference with "high-ranking" participants. The Germans must not hide in a corner "when storms are blowing. Nobody will buy that," Kohl said. Such an attitude is a "shame for our country."
