The meeting is attended by about 150 journalists, including as many as 100 foreign reporters. The meeting was opened by Minister of Tourism Niko Bulic. Prime Minister Nikica Valentic and Ivica Mudrinic, minister of maritime affairs, transport and communications also attended. Jadran Marinkovic reports from Makarska: [Marinkovic] Tourism is Croatia's main branch of the economy. That is our commitment and economic priority, Prime Minister Nikica Valentic said in Makarska today. Last year we earned 1 billion German marks [DM] from tourism, and this year we will double that figure. However, our final goal is for that sum to reach 5 or 6 billion marks in the near future. There will be no more war on Croatian territory, Prime Minister Valentic said resolutely. Many questions by journalists from 12 European countries focused on the safety of our coast and relations with the local Serbs, that is, the occupied areas. Mr. Valentic had the following to say about this: [Begin Valentic recording] Croatia has done and is still doing everything to solve the problem of the occupied areas and the reintegration of those Croatian areas into Croatia's constitutional and legal system by peaceful means, without war. I can assure you that Croatia has enough economic power and military might to liberate those area by military means. The Croatian Government and the Croatian state will not resort to those methods. We will do everything -- although that takes more time and stirs certain unrest among our population -- in order to reintegrate those areas exclusively by peaceful means. We have the world's support in doing this. On behalf of the Croatian Government, I guarantee you that there will be no war on the Croatian territory because the Croatian Government will not resort to force to solve that problem.
