Under these conditions, increasing the Turkish Armed Forces' importance in securing NATO's southern flank and strengthening their role as a guarantor of their country's security required the Turkish leadership to revise a number of provisions of military doctrine and fundamentally reorganize its Army (see diagram for prospective structure). Flow Chart </graphic> Turkey presently has the second largest Armed Forces in NATO, numbering up to 600,000 persons. They are armed with 3,600 tanks, around 3,000 armored combat vehicles, 5,000 artillery systems, 300 army aviation helicopters, 815 combat aircraft, and 136 ships of the main types. The Turkish command believes that this quantity of troops and combat equipment is sufficient to be ready to conduct defensive and offensive operations on two separate strategic axes, the Balkan and the Caucasian, in accordance with NATO requirements. With this they can perform missions of defending national territory, holding the strategically important Black Sea straits, and conducting military operations to keep enemy troop from moving into Central Europe. The Turkish Armed Forces also support strategic movements of NATO reaction forces (particularly U.S. troops) to areas of armed conflicts in the Near and Middle East. The new military doctrine has now made concrete functions of the Armed Forces for ensuring the country's territorial integrity and suppressing separatist actions, and has broadened the concept of defending Turkish interests outside of national territory. The possibility of giving military assistance to Muslim states of the former USSR and to other countries of the region has been incorporated conceptually. Turkish troops also can be used to participate in peacekeeping actions. Performance of these and other missions requires bringing Turkish troops up to NATO standards and substantially increasing their mobility, striking power and firepower. They were inferior to leading European armies in many parameters until recently. The presence of a considerable number of obsolete arms and an acute shortage of modern combat equipment is the weakest point of the Turkish Armed Forces. Thus, over 30 percent of these arms entered the troops 30-40 years ago and around half of the field artillery pieces and naval ships were made in the 1940's. Therefore, the Turkish leadership planned a broad set of organizational and military-technical measures for a fundamental restructuring of their Armed Forces for the next decade. First of all, the troops' organizational structure is being upgraded, which presumes standardization of formation and unit table of organization structures, a transition from division-regimental to a more flexible brigade-battalion basis, and formation primarily of mechanized and armored brigades. The increase in the number of formations of these types to 70 percent of the Army combat force level by the year 2000 will increase its striking power and offensive capabilities significantly. It is planned to strengthen the troop grouping stationed in the eastern part of the country (2nd and 3rd field armies) and targeted against the Transcaucasus. The number of airmobile commando brigades with Army aviation battalions in their makeup is being increased to ensure a prompt reaction to threats that arise suddenly. Formation of specialized heavy motor transport regiments for moving one centrally subordinate armored brigade and four tank battalions (one in each field army) will contribute to a substantial increase in troop mobility. In addition, it is planned to establish one or two airmobile battalions in each field army as assault transport helicopters are delivered to the troops. The military organizational development plan envisages reoutfitting all branches of the Armed Forces through arms and military equipment deliveries from the United States and Central European countries, modernizing obsolete models and producing new arms under license. Deliveries to the Army of over 1,100 tanks, around 2,700 armored combat vehicles, over 500 self-propelled artillery systems, and 200 combat helicopters will be completed before the year 2000. Up to 270 fighter-bombers, 50 attack aircraft, and 80 medium and light military transport aircraft will enter the Air Force inventory in this same period. The Navy modernization program envisages having up to 40 new ships of basic types in the Navy order of battle by the end of the millennium. Reform of the Turkish Armed Forces presumes improved manning of formations and units with a reduction in the overall number of personnel. The number of servicemen in the Air Force and Navy will remain essentially unchanged, while the Army makeup will be reduced by almost a third. Terms of service for privates and NCO's will be reduced from 15 to 12 months beginning in 1995. The proportion of volunteers performing duty on a contractual basis will increase along with this. Counting regular officers, the overall number of professional servicemen may reach 40 percent in the Army and over 80 percent in the Air Force and Navy in ten years. An improved mobilization system called upon to support formation and unit deployment in shorter time periods is being introduced within the scope of military reform. Along with the fully deployed units, training and cadre units are being preserved and will serve as a base for mobilizing a considerable number of new formations. The presence of so-called green units and subunits will permit establishing territorial self-defense forces on their basis in wartime, deploying troops to reinforce the Army, and bringing the number of personnel in combat units up to wartime strength levels. Armed Forces overall numerical strength can be more than doubled in a month with that mobilization deployment procedure. Finally, Armed Forces restructuring envisages increased effectiveness and stability of command and control by reorganizing staffs at all levels, making comprehensive use of automated command and control systems, adopting modern jam-protected communications equipment, and improving the staff operational training system. Western experts believe that full implementation of the plan for restructuring and modernizing the Turkish Armed Forces will increase their design combat potential by one and one-half to two times. But the shortage of funds, constant dependence on foreign military aid and weapon deliveries, and poor capacities of national military industry may threaten fulfillment of a number of very important military-technical programs. The planned volume of new arms production and procurements for the next decade exceeds $15 billion, while Turkey's real financial capabilities are considerably lower.
