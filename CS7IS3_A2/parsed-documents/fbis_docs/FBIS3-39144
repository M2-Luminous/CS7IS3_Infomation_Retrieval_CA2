We are going over to the Moncloa for a full report from Jose Luis Garcia del Pozo. [Garcia del Pozo] [passage omitted] In conclusion, the prime minister spoke of Bosnia and of the situation of our troops engaged in humanitarian tasks there on the United Nation's behalf. He said that everything possible is being done to protect the men and that there will, of course, be no unilateral withdrawal. He said that, and I quote, we are not going to make a unilateral decision to withdraw our troops. We will talk to our partners because the effect of such a decision on our country's international credibility would be very negative. This would be linked to the fact that our country has already spent a long time (?enshrined)--as Gonzalez put it--in isolation from the international community.
