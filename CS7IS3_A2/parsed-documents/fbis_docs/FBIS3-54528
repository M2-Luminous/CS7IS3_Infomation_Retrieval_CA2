[Begin Sarid recording] I am telling you: As far as I am concerned, the PLO has not yet built confidence. It signed the agreement, but my impression at this point is that it is not honoring that signature. Up until now, I have not discerned any interest on its part in what is happening in the field, and I find this very disappointing and depressing. [end recording] Having said that, Minister Sarid went on to assert that a Palestinian state will definitely be established. According to him, the establishment of a Palestinian state is an inevitable natural development.
