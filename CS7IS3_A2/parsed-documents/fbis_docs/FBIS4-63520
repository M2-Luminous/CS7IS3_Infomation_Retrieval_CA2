He said that a group from the Ukrainian Internal Affairs Ministry made yet another attempt to enter the Crimean Internal Affairs Ministry premises. Their minister issued an instruction appointing them to various top posts in place of their Crimean counterparts. Guards at the building prevented this, however.
