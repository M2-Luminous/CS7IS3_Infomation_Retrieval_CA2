Since then, the Chinese economy has kept growing rapidly. Its real economic growth rate reached 13.2 percent in 1992, and it rose to 13.4 percent in 1993. Among Asia's fastest-growing countries, China especially is attracting attention because of its high growth rate and its huge market -- 1.2 billion people. There is a spectacular inflow of foreign money because after the country vowed to create a "socialist market economy," foreign investors have come to believe that China will not go back to the old-style controlled economy. In 1992, direct investment to China amounted to $58.1 billion on a contract basis. It took only one year to exceed the total amount of direct investment registered between 1979 -- the year the reform process started with the implementation of the new open-door policy -- and 1991. In 1993, direct investment almost doubled, to $110.9 billion. On a working basis, it was $23.3 billion for all of 1979 to 1991, while in 1992 alone it suddenly jumped up to $11 billion. It rose to $25.8 billion in 1993. These figures show how huge is the inflow of foreign capital into China. The IMF has calculated purchasing power parity to evaluate China's economy. According to the IMF, China's economy already ranks third in the world. If its economic development continues to progress smoothly, there is no doubt that China will not only become an economic power in Asia but also an international economic superpower because of its abundant national resources. However, whether we will see the advent of such an era during the 21st century is still open to question. When we take a close look at China's current economic situation, we realize there are so many problems that we can hardly say that China has a rose-colored future in store. The most critical issue is the aggravation of inflation. In the second half of 1992, there were already concerns about economic overheating and the surge of inflation in certain areas. Inflation suddenly became rampant in 1993. In 1993, the national retail price index climbed 13 percent, more than double the 6-percent target set in the national program for economic and social development. There Is No Effective Way To Check the Inflationary Spiral, Which Is Caused by Six Primary Factors Over the same period, the workers' living cost index rose at a higher rate of 14.7 percent, and actual conditions are said to be reflected more accurately in the workers' living cost index than in the retail price index because the former includes prices for services. Moreover, in 35 major cities, the workers' living cost index marked a high increase of 19.6 percent. Fuel prices, as well as prices for services, rose 40 percent. During the first months of 1994, the workers' living cost index went up by 23 percent in 35 major cities. China can no longer leave the price level as it is. Things are assuming a dangerous complexion, because soaring inflation might lead to another round of social disorder, as was demonstrated in the case of the 1989 Tiananmen Square incident. The inflationary spiral has been brought about by various combined factors, of which there are six primary factors: 1) The central government has accelerated the process of introducing a market economy; it has limited the fields subject to price controls; it has promoted price liberalization; and it has rapidly extended the fields subject to market adjustments. These efforts have caused an increase in prices. 2) Overinvestment has helped considerably to escalate the current economic overheating and inflation. The growth-oriented thinking that considers economic development to be an absolute truth has brought about overinvestment and booming real estate development in the special economic zones. These circumstances have led to a sudden rise in energy prices and in prices of construction materials such as steel, wood, and cement. The investment boom was also caused by the fact that local governments have gained greater autonomy with regard to investment activities. Beijing's policy of devolving central powers to local governments has brought forth economic dynamism. It has promoted economic development, particularly in the coastal industrial areas. The problem, however, is that the control system to prevent investment from becoming excessive is not working properly. (3) Illegal financing and the illegal supply of investment capital have added fresh fuel to overinvestment. Financial disorganization, which was evident in three areas -- fund raising, interbank lending, and bank management -- has come into question. The central government has repeatedly issued circulars to restore financial order. (4) A supply-demand gap, which is caused by a poor infrastructure, and more particularly by a lack of transportation facilities, has brought on a sort of bottleneck inflation. (5) Both the government and the people are devoted to money worship. Traders are actively engaging in speculation. In anticipation of a rise in prices, some are forestalling, while others are holding off selling. Moreover, some are taking advantage of tax reforms to raise prices. (6) In January 1994, China unified the exchange rate of the Chinese yuan by introducing a controlled floating exchange rate system based on the market's supply and demand situation. Because the introduction of a single exchange rate virtually corresponds to a substantial devaluation of the Chinese yuan, there are concerns about a further rise in import prices. China's growth-oriented thinking has also increased for the following reasons. The Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-95) has projected an annual growth rate of 6 percent until the end of this century. However, in October 1992, the CPC's 14th Congress gave a strong show of support for Deng Xiaoping's call for accelerated reforms and revised the projected growth rate to 8-9 percent. This upward revision has caused overinvestment and financial disorganization because local governments, which have obtained greater autonomy with respect to investment activities, have striven for economic development and high growth as a natural consequence. The central government is fully aware of the growing inflation pressures. At the beginning of 1994, it moved to check the inflationary spiral by establishing financial order, by promoting financial reforms, and by increasing controls on bank loans to be used for fixed-asset investment. In May and July 1993, it raised interest rates. Under the apprehension that people might lose interest in bank savings, the central government has decided to provide, from March 1994, interest subsidies through the People's Bank of China to enable banks to pay attractive interest rates on fixed deposits. The last time that China's economy overheated was in 1988. Compared to that time, the central government is now taking prompt measures to meet the situation. However, there is no system yet in China to control the economy through a bank-rate policy. In 1988, when it adopted a financial retrenchment policy, the central government carried out a series of direct measures to adjust, through its own efforts, the economy. These measures included controls on investment projects and measures to hold down spending by government organizations and state-run enterprises. As a result, the real economic growth rate dropped in 1989 to 4 percent from 11 percent in 1988, while fixed-asset investment registered negative growth. Having learned a lesson from its previous experience, the central government has projected a lower growth rate of 9 percent for 1994. However, it is not certain whether the central government will be able to impose its policy of slowing down the booming economy to bring about sustained and sound development, because local governments, particularly in the coastal industrial areas, are still eager for rapid development. They are said to be strongly opposed to economic reforms that seek strengthened macroeconomic control by the central government. Above All Else, There Is the Possibility of a Revolt by Farmers, Who Account for Nearly 80 Percent of the Population If the inflationary spiral cannot be checked, and if China continues to take growth-oriented measures, the decline in real wages will weigh heavily on people's livelihood. If that is the case, it might give rise to social disorder. There are indications that the market economy system is already at a deadlock. In some areas, panics have already occurred, because workers are hastily making sundry purchases to hoard essential goods. Meanwhile, according to news reports, workers employed by foreign companies are increasingly going on strikes in calls for higher wages. This give the impression that the open-door policy has also reached a deadlock. If inflation rides high at 20 percent or more even after the summer season, the central government will be forced to carry out direct measures to adjust by its own efforts the economy, as it did in 1989. Moreover, if the economic gap between agricultural communities and industrializing urban areas becomes wider, dissatisfaction will grow among farmers, who are unable to share in the benefits of economic development, and there will be no holding them back. There is a possibility that the central government might become unable to control the drift of population from farm villages to cities. China's structural distinction between agricultural communities and urban communities is indispensable for maintaining the socialist system in China. A change in the social structure might even undermine the foundation of the Communist Party. Even if inflation is curbed to a certain degree, companies with foreign-capital affiliations will see the management environment deteriorating, because they will be forced to raise workers' wages following the adoption of a single exchange rate, and the abolition of the maximum wage system, which was applied to foreign companies. Until now, the maximum salary of a Chinese worker employed by a foreign company was limited to 120 percent of the salary of a similar worker employed by a state-run enterprise. The procurement of raw materials and locally made parts will become more expensive due to inflation, while the Chinese yuan will become hardly obtainable due to a credit squeeze. Taxation reforms will increase the tax burden on foreign firms. [China has introduced a value-added tax], but it said it will take fiscal steps to offer a rebate over a period of five years to foreign firms already operating in China. However, the new tax will from this point forward handicap new foreign companies coming to China. If we take the per capita economic standard into consideration, we have to say that China is still a country on its way to development. However, its economic development has a great influence on the world economy, because it has a huge market composed of 1.2 billion people. China will for quite some time grope for a new path to balance the central government's macroeconomic control with rising economic activity in different parts of the country.
