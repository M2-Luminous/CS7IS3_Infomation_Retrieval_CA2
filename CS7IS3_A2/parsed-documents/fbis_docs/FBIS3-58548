The company announced in Frankfurt am Main this evening that representatives of the 120 or so creditor banks agreed to a modified rescue package with a few reservations after over 10 hours of negotiations. Under the agreement, Metallgesellschaft will receive new equity capital totalling around 2.7 billion German marks [DM] and credits worth DM700 million. Kajo Neukirchen, the chairman of the managing board of Metallgesellschaft, said that with the support of the banks, Metallgesellschaft was now in a position for new horizons to be opened for the company. "We are now able to devote ourselves fully to the tasks before us," he said. Up until yesterday the shareholding banks Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank had been unable to obtain approval for the rescue package from the other banks. The rescue plan for Metallgesellschaft, which was submitted last week, provided for total aid worth DM3.4 billion. The company went into the red as a result of risky oil deals and mismanagement. French and American banks had previously rejected the plan and called for greater involvement by Deutsche Bank, Dresdner Bank, Daimler Benz, Kuwait, and Allianz, the five principle shareholders. The latter are evidently now prepared to raise their previous share of 68 percent of the financial aid being offered.
