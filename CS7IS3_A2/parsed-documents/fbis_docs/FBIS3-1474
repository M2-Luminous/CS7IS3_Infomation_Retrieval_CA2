The meeting will be the first to bring together the four leaders at the centre of the unfolding political drama. It is understood the chaos that racked central Johannesburg on Monday triggered the urgent attempt to bring the leaders together. ANC Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa and Minister of Constitutional Development Roelf Meyer left a scheduled Transitional Executive Council management committee meeting on Monday afternoon to join the IFP's Joe Matthews and the kwaZulu's Ben Ngubane for talks on the summit.
