This would be done first with Herzegovina and therefore with Serbia, and would provide Serbia with access to the sea. This would in fact represent the reassessment of the decision on the unification of Boka with Montenegro. These are the first words of the Declaration of the Boka Convention, which was distributed to the media yesterday, bearing the signature of Convention chairman Slobodan Panovic. The Convention demands that the ruling party, the Democratic Party of Socialists, put a stop to separatist forces -- as the declaration says -- first in their own ranks. Serbian Boka will follow and cooperate with the conventions of Vasojevici, Zeta, old [Stara] Herzegovina, and the Raska region [Sandzak] on the achievement of the Serbian national program. We demand that the Montenegrin bodies inaugurate 26 November 1918 as a public holiday, the date of the unification of Serbia and Montenegro. The Boka Convention demands a change in the attitude of the Republic of Montenegro toward this region.
