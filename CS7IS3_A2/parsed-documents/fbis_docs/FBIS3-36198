The representative of the Russian Space Agency, who took part in the talks, told INTERFAX that the talks are proceeding with difficulty. He said that the issues associated with the sum of compensation for the use of launching sites and the coordination of the system of the legal regulation of relationships among the cosmodrome personnel were postponed for the last day of talks, Wednesday. The Russian Space Agency's representative said that during the talks Russian experts named the sum of the lease, which Russia is prepared to pay, and offered its feasibility studies (he refused to name the figure). He told INTERFAX, however, that the Kazakh side has made no response. Russian experts tend to explain the passiveness of the Kazakh delegation by the ambiguity of its stance. According to information obtained by INTERFAX, Kazakhstan, despite the understanding reached in Almaty in mid-January on giving up the idea of creating on the Baykonur basis an international joint-stock company, still gives it much emphasis, for example, within the framework of the bilateral meetings with U.S. experts (an American 13-member delegation recently visited the cosmodrome at the invitation of Kazakhstan). Russian experts believe that Kazakhstan's uncertainty should go away after President Nazarbayev discusses issues of the U.S.- Kazakhstan outer space cooperation (including the U.S. possible involvement in the use of Baykonur) during his visit to Washington scheduled for mid-February. Experts believe that the future of the Russian-Kazakh agreement on leasing the cosmodrome depends directly on the results of the talks in Washington. The agency spokesman following the three-day talks in Moscow said the two sides will sign a list of concrete problems on which they agree or disagree.
