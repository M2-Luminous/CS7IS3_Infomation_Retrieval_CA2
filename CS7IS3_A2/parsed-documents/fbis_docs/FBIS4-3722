While learning from the BFLIC, we should emulate their practice of "stressing the focal points, doing a solid job, and bringing about concrete results." The three-day meeting on the BFLIC's experience in trial comprehensive and coordinated reform, which was convened by the State Economic Restructuring Commission, closed today. At the meeting, Li Tieying gave an important speech about the valuable points in the BFLIC's experience which merit attention from other regions and enterprises. He said: First of all, reform must center on development and be carried out with a view to tackling practical problems in economic life. The most urgent problems and the cruxes of problems are the focal points of our reform. The value of the BFLIC's trial reform lies in its firm grasp of practical problems in Beijing's development and the gradual resolution of them through reform to promote development. For example, in moving against problems such as considerable losses of state assets, difficulties in circulating available capital, dull enterprise mechanisms, a shortage of capital, obstacles to the mobility of staff and workers, and heavy debt burdens, the BFLIC proposed the basic idea of "increasing the value of assets, switching the industry's production of products, changing functions, transforming mechanisms, and reassigning staff and workers" in its trial comprehensive and coordinated reform, and it integrated the reform of the enterprise system with the readjustment of the industrial structure. It started the industry all over again for the second time through the establishment of a modern enterprise system and comprehensively took in new systems step by step on the one hand, and on the other hand it brought about a switch in industries in its urban enterprises in order of importance and urgency, vigorously developed tertiary industries by redeveloping assets, and developed secondary industries to a high level. In the meantime, it has resolved the problems concerning the future of urban enterprises, the needs of developing the rural economy, and the lack of suitable projects for village and town enterprises as well as their upgrading by supplementing urban areas with the supremacy of rural areas and vice versa, and it has promoted the coordinated development of the urban and rural economies. Li Tieying said: Having developed to the present stage, reform must be carried out comprehensively and in a coordinated manner in order to proceed further. The BFLIC's experience in trial reform is not the experience in a single trial reform by an individual enterprise; it is the experience in a comprehensive and coordinated reform for revitalizing the state-owned economy. One of the important reasons why their trial reform could show results within only one year is because of the high attention received from the Beijing municipal party committee and government. Since the inception of the reform, they have proposed that the comprehensive and coordinated reform should be supported by comprehensive and coordinated policies; principal leaders of the municipal party committee and government personally organized various departments to study and implement the trial comprehensive and coordinated reform program and demanded that all departments transform their functions, improve their work style, and support the reform in a spirit of reform. On the other hand, the reason why there are few significant results in enterprise reform over the years is mainly because individual enterprises judge things as they stand, fall short of overall concepts concerning the comprehensive and coordinated reform, and make no fundamental change to their mechanisms. Enterprises are the bearers of the movement of capital, and if they do not follow the internal requirements of the law of value, establish a mechanism for enterprises to consciously pursue an increase in value and a modern enterprise system suitable for the changes in markets, and carry out comprehensive and coordinated reform with a greater view to revitalizing the entire state-owned economy, the problem of revitalizing enterprises cannot be solved. Li Tieying said: Properly handling the relations between reform, development, and stability is an important prerequisite for doing our job well. We must take a new path to development and create new systems in reform. The deep-seated contradictions and new problems cropping up in the course of economic development must be resolved by means of reform. Reform means a readjustment in the structure of interests and involves all kinds of old and new problems; it will impair stability if it is not handled well. The success of the BFLIC's trial reform lies in its consideration to reform, development, and stability. From the beginning, the corporation has incorporated the arrangements for the staff and workers into the reform program and has improved their quality and competitiveness in obtaining new jobs through training in light of market demands. It created new job vacancies to properly reassign staff and workers through readjusting the industrial structure. In addition, it considered a great deal of thorough and painstaking ideological work to be an important part of the reform. Speaking on the problems that merit further study and attention in learning the BFLIC's experience in trial comprehensive and coordinated reform, Li Tieying stressed: 1) It is necessary to properly handle the problem of state-owned assets. The losses of state-owned assets currently are very grim, and the problem cannot be solved without reform. But how? Can we blaze a new trail for maintaining and increasing the value of state-owned assets by relying on the state economy's own strength, the redistribution of resources and essential factors, and the transformation of the mechanism through reform? The handling of state-owned assets is a very sensitive issue which requires a strong policy; it requires a profound study in the course of reform. 2) The problem concerning the compensated use of land in coordinated reform -- land belongs to the state, and the income resulting from the increase in its value should go to the state. 3) It is necessary to proceed from reality in doing everything. Each locality has its own economic structure and level of development, and the problems it is facing may be different from others' problems. While studying the BFLIC's ways of conducting trial reform, we must avoid copying everything indiscriminately without taking into account local conditions, for otherwise we would acquire the form instead of the essence. We should avoid doing things rashly on a mass scale, because this will not only achieve nothing but will also bungle the good opportunity for reform and development. The BFLIC's experience in trial comprehensive and coordinated reform is still preliminary; it should continue to probe further for constant improvement. Chen Xitong, member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and secretary of the Beijing Municipal CPC Committee, also spoke at today's closing meeting. He said: The outstanding feature in the BFLIC's reform is that in the course of readjusting its industrial structure, it has consciously redistributed the essential factors of production by means of the mechanism of the market economy. In the course of readjustment, we must pay attention to and properly solve the problems of "brand, face, and position" and "yours, mine, and his," consider the overall situation of reform and development, break down the departmental selfishness, and reorganize in a timely manner low-efficiency enterprises by closing them down, suspending their operations, merging them with other enterprises, or switching their manufacture of products. We should emancipate our minds and find a new way for state enterprises to extricate themselves from their predicaments and improve their efficiency. The meeting was presided over by He Guanghui, vice minister in charge of the State Economic Restructuring Commission. During the meeting, representatives of relevant local and central departments from around the country discussed enthusiastically and profoundly the BFLIC's reform experience and reached a consensus on its basic ideas and experience in the comprehensive and coordinated reform. The report entitled "Comprehensively and Precisely Master the Beijing First Light Industry Corporation's Experience and Promote State Enterprise Reform Comprehensively and in a Coordinated Manner" delivered by Liu Zhifeng, vice minister in charge of the State Economic Restructuring Commission, systematically summarized the BFLIC's basic reform experience in its six aspects and in its three characteristics, highlighted six problems that all localities should note in drawing lessons from the BFLIC's experience, and drew the attention of participants in the meeting.
