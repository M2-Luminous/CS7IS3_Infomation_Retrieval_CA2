The process is the result of the joint work done by its research center and two European partners, one Danish and the other Swiss. Grassed over at Antibes, buried in Monaco in the basement of an apartment block, or integrated into a building like at Cergy (near Paris), the water treatment plant for the year 2000 is already operational. The Cergy plant, designed to purify the effluent of a town of 200,000 inhabitants, daily treats some 40,000 cubic meters of wastewater. The standards laid out in the European wastewater directive of 1991 set new limits for nitrogen con10t (less than 10 mg/l) and phosphorus con10t (less than 1.5 mg/l) of urban wastewater, and the conformity of treatment results -- 95 percent must comply at any given time. Existing processes could only achieve these results with great difficulty. Firstly, it would be necessary to multiply by at least four the surface area of existing plants operating using activated sludge, such as the one at Acheres which treats the wastewater of Paris and its region. This is unimaginable in its urban location. Secondly, the control method would have to be changed to a process of continual analysis: until now results have been expressed as a daily average. In 1990, in order to meet these new pollution removal thresholds, the CGE (OTV and Anjou Research) teamed up for three years in a Eureka [European scientific research program] project with the Danish company Danfoss, specializing in sensors, and with Eawag, the Swiss water institute, expert in modeling bioprocesses applied to water. Chris10ed Simbiose (scientific improvements of biofilters and sensors), the aim of this project was to reply to the European water treatment standards with new, high-speed treatment processes. Taking up only small areas, they would simplify the integration of treatment plants in urban areas. Moreover, the use of continuous sensors would make it possible to control the system automatically and would give a water quality permanently in line with the above- mentioned European standards. The total cost of the project was 70 million French francs [Fr], Fr30 million of which came from France -- Fr20 million from the CGE and 10 million from the French government. Frank Rogalla, deputy director of the CGE's research center, noted with satisfaction that "the program was completed in June 1993, and most of the aims were met." Useful Experience Gained To meet the esthetic requirements where the environment is concerned and to resolve the problem of more restricted space in and around towns, OTV had already implemented new pollution removal systems. In this way the company acquired experience with a process using fixed bacteria beds that concentrated the biomass and thus removed the need for clarification equipment. As early as 1982, its Biocarbone process had coupled biology and phase separation in the same reactor. Here the biological purification of water is done by downward percolation through a fixed submerged bed, with air injected in the lower section. Already five times smaller than traditional, activated sludge reactors, it does however require two units for complete purification of wastewater in accordance with the new nitrogen removal standards -- one for the anoxic stage and the other for the aerobic stage. It is also necessary to clean the filters from time to time. The New Generation of Biofilters The process developed in the Simbiose project, chris10ed Biostyr, made the disadvantages of Biocarbone appear negligible. Expanded polystyrene balls are used instead of the mineral support. Since they float, they are kept down by a board. Frank Rogalla stressed: "The choice of a synthetic material enables us to retain tight control over the physical parameters (density, granulometry, etc.) and to alter the selected characteristics to suit the required treatment performance." The pollution flows through the filter from bottom to top. The wastewater is pumped to a higher level and injected in by gravity flow. The two zones, aerobic and anoxic, are thus brought together in the same reactor. The air is injected into the middle of the bed, meaning that the anoxic zone is in the lower section and the aerobic zone is in the upper section. Backwashing by gravity flow is a sufficient washing technique. Ten times less space is needed for this type of installation than for a conventional plant. Re10tion time has also been divided by 10, reduced from 24 hours to just two to three hours. Miniaturization of Sensors and Automated Control This new generation of high-performance biofilters, however, was just one part of the Simbiose project. The other two parts dealt with sensors and the automated control of this new generation of water treatment plant. The sensor part was the responsibility of the Danish company Danfoss. It was charged with designing equipment to continually measure nitrogen and phosphorus levels. Work was based on existing sensors using colorimetric methods, which Danfoss then improved and miniaturized. A prototype sensor is now being tested. The installations currently being produced by OTV will use conventional sensors until the miniaturized versions become available. Bioreactor and automated process management modeling is still at the experimental stage. The Simbiose project time has been ex10ded to ensure the achievement of all the aims set out in 1990. The European directive requires all existing installations and processes to be brought in line with the standards, with all towns of more than 2,000 inhabitants complying by 2005.
