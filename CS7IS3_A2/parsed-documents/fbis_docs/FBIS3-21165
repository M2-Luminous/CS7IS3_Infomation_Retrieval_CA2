In a five-year plan JAERI will conduct tests with Oak Ridge National Laboratories in the U.S. on materials used in the Japan Power Demonstration Reactor (Tokai Village, Ibaraki Prefecture) now under disassembly and with the Kuruchatofu [phonetic] Laboratories on a disassembled Russian reactor. JAERI expects this to be a valuable resource for making decisions on measures to counter reactor aging and to extend reactor life. Recently JAERI and Oak Ridge agreed to a research cooperation agreement for testing and analyzing JPDR pressure vessel steel. They will work together on mechanical strength tests, structural observations by electron microscope, etc., using steel removed from the JPDR pressure vessel. Because the U.S. Atomic Energy Regulatory Commission is preparing regulatory standards for the renewal of LWR permits, it is seeking data on changes over time in actual reactors, and it asked JAERI about cooperation using JPDR, which recorded 12 years of operation. Because Japan does not have adequate facilities for testing radioactive materials, Japan decided that the cooperation would be beneficial to both nations. In cooperative research with Russia, JAERI will use Russia NPP 27, which is a closed reactor that operated for 33 years. Researchers will bore cylindrical samples from the pressure vessel and bring them back to Japan for analysis. Japan plans to bear the costs over the next five years by paying the Kuruchatofu Laboratory about Â¥23,000,000 a year for its part in the study. The STA expects that this test data will form the basis for revision of regulatory standards for the LWRs that electric power companies are using in Japan. As a way of increasing the number of years of operation in nuclear power plants, the government, mainly through MITI's Agency of Natural Resources and Energy, will consider ``streamlining'' the safety regulations that are more stringent than necessary, but convincing data is needed to do so. Japan's LWRs are either BWRs or PWRs. JPDR is a BWR, and Russia NPP 27 is a PWR, so STA believes that it will be possible to do research and testing on the characteristics of both types of reactors.
