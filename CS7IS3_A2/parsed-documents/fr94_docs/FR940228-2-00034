[Docket No. CP94&hyph;224&hyph;000] Take notice that on February 9, 1994, Northern Natural Gas Company (Northern), 1111 South 103rd Street, Omaha, Nebraska 68124&hyph;1000 filed an application pursuant to sections 7 (b) and (c) of the Natural Gas Act for: (a) A certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing the construction and operation of approximately 11.95 miles of various size mainline and branchline looping pipeline; and (b) permission and approval to abandon and a certificate of public convenience and necessity for certain facilities for the modification of nine town border stations (TBS) in the State of Minnesota in order to expand pipeline capacity to provide incremental firm transportation service to Minnegasco, a Division of Arkla, Inc. (Minnegasco) and Great Plains Natural Gas Company (Great Plains), all as more fully set forth in the application, which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Northern proposes to construct the following facilities in order to provide firm transportation service Minnegasco and Great Plains. (1) Approximately 2.82 miles of 30-inch pipeline at the end of the existing D-Line in a northerly direction parallel to Northern's existing mainline in Steele County, Minnesota. A tie-in to the B and C-Lines would be made at the end of the D-Line extension and the existing D to C regulator setting would be moved to the new tie-over point; (2) Approximately 1.28 miles of 30-inch pipeline as an extension of Northern's C-Line parallel to Northern's existing mainline and ending with a tap on the B-Line in Washington County, Minnesota; (3) Approximately 7.85 miles of 8-inch pipeline loop on the Alexandria Branchline in a westerly direction in Morrison County, Minnesota to accommodate a portion of the increased requirements for Minnegasco; Northern proposes to modify the Clarkfield No. 1 TBS serving Great Plains and 8 TBS' serving Minnegasco as follows: (1) Install one 3-inch rotary meter run and modify meter piping on Clarkfield No. 1; (2) Install one 3-inch rotary meter run, modify meter piping, remove 1-inch regulators and install two 2-inch regulators on St. Michael No. 1; (3) Remove existing meters and install one 3-inch rotary meter run and one 6-inch turbine meter run at Glenwood No. 1; (4) Remove existing meter, install two 3-inch rotary meters and modify meter piping at St. Bonifacius No. 1; (5) Remove existing meter and install diaphragm meter at Waconia No. 1B; (6) Remove existing regulators and install two 2-inch regulators at Waconia No. 1; (7) Remove existing meters and install one 3-inch and one 4-inch rotary meters at Prior Lake No. 1A; (8) Replace existing regulators with two 1-inch regulators and modify piping under relief valve at Prior Lake No. 1; (9) Replace existing regulator valve trim at Mound No. 1. Northern estimates the cost of these facilities to be $6,065,000 which would be financed with internally generated funds. Northern proposes to construct the facilities to provide additional capacity on Northern's mainline north between its Owatonna Compressor Station (Owatonna) in Steele County, Minnesota and its North Branch Compressor Station in Chicago County, Minnesota to serve additional market requirements of 19,788 Mcf of natural gas per day requested by Minnegasco and Great Plains during a thirty day open season from November 10, 1993 to December 9, 1993. Northern states that the Alexandria Branchline loop is required to meet Minnegasco's increased requirements served from the branchline. Northern states that the mainline facilities would increase the capacity of the mainline north of Owatonna by 19,288 Mcf of natural gas per day and is required for the 1994&hyph;95 heating season. The balance would be transported through existing capacity, it is indicated.
