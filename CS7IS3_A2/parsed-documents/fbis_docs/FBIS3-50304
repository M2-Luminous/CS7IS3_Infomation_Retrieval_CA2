Mr. Dogan was late for his appointment after talks at the Council of Ministers. The government still has room for manoeuvre and may do a lot more, the DPS leader said after the meeting. The incumbent cabinet was voted into office on the DPS mandate. February 16 is a realistic deadline for the passage of the budget, according to Mr. Dogan. The bipolar model manifests a perpetuation syndrome which is dangerous for the country, said the leader of the third largest parliamentary party. As a democratic alternative, centrism may offer completely different survival strategies to the country, he emphasized. Mr. Dogan reiterated to the president his view that the BSP and the SDS have a lot of shared interests and that this is all the more obvious after their leaders' meeting. "Extremes attract each other because they are similar," he said. The anti-presidential campaign and nationalism as a powerful trump in the hands of the parliamentary BSP and SDS, similar views on the pre-election functioning of parliament and on barring the access of other political forces to a future parliament constitute a dangerous tendency, according to Mr. Dogan. "I would like to state in full responsibility that any calling into question the 4 percent threshold (the proportion of the vote which, under the effective electoral law, a party should poll in order to qualify for the distribution of seats in the legislature) may result in such a mess that we will wonder whether we are in the Balkans, in Europe or somewhere else in the world," he warned. "The new crime situation necessitates more radical countermeasures because the incident in Belite Brezi (a Sofia neighbourhood where two Red Beret commandos were shot and killed by fellow policemen in an unauthorized operation) calls into question the competence of the Interior Ministry," Mr. Dogan said, summing up his views on the other item on the agenda of his talk with the president. In addition to personnel changes in the ministry, it needs a new strategy to handle the problems, he said. One of the basic things is to guarantee decent living and safety to the rank- and-file policemen, the DPS leader stressed. "A minister who should excel at firmness and a strategy for resolute action rather than at his own virtues is another essential condition for the Interior Ministry to do its job," the DPS leader emphasized. He rejected the SDS draft resolution on personnel changes in the Interior Ministry, arguing that an opposition force cannot dictate personnel changes in the ministry.
