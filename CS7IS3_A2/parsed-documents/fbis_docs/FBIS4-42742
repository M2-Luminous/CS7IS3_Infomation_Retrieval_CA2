On 28 May, the undersigned received a dubious honor in this page's column. My name was bandied about with and animal comparisons were made. One could feel the almost childish fun that must have overcome the author when writing this lampoon, something which I last enjoyed in second grade. Mr. Juncker is to be pitied. He who, in the early stage of the election campaign, had announced objective explanations because politics is "no beauty contest," he who likes to present himself as the prototype of elevated political standards has to live with the accusation now of having dragged serious topics down to a very low level and having degraded the ideological debate to playpen standards. To the issue itself, Juncker blames me for praising the minister of labor in Parliament on 18 May and criticizing him in TAGEBLATT on 21 May and even accuses me of cowardice. The dilemma of the minister of labor is obvious. But it still does not entitle him to resort to lies that could doubtlessly win him an honorary membership in Mr. Mehlen's club. One membership card more or less would not matter anyway, when Juncker is also a member of the initiative against the same hazardous waste dump which he supported as a member of the administration. On 18 May I praised the legislative results of the minister of labor because the five statutes of labor law passed during this parliamentary term were positive. On 21 May I criticized the minister of labor because his overall performance as minister of labor is completely inadequate. Why it is unsatisfactory I explained in detail on 18 May in Parliament in the presence of the minister of labor by listing his omissions: 1. There were no impulses or new ideas for humanization of the work environment and work safety. Failure no. 1! 2. For five years nothing has happened to encourage participation in decision making, a broad and important field. Failure no. 2! 3. Instead of discussing working time regulations, new types of working time, etc., there has been a five year silence. Failure no. 3! 4. In the field of plant inspection there was hardly any progress worth mentioning. Failure no. 4! 5. Nothing happened to bad weather settlements despite the possibility of preliminary work. Failure no. 5! This review is all the more alarming because the reform plans were part of the 1989 government statement, in fact some had already been promised in 1984. Not to mention the numerous unanswered letters and inquiries, or the committees under the responsibility of the minister of labor which have not met in months and years...! When Juncker regretted on 28 May that unemployment was a "non-topic" in Luxembourg, he concedes that he not only reacted too late in this matter and that his measures did not work, but also that he has failed socially and as a political ideologist, even though he is not bad at influencing the masses. But it seems that he did not want to waste his skill on the Ministry of Labor which hardly interested him.... This view is shared by the independent LETZEBUERGER LAND, which writes on 14 January 94: "The eloquent ministerial introduction of the press conference (...) was probably meant to make one forget that the Ministry of Labor so far has been somewhat neglected." How little Juncker was interested the Ministry of Labor over the past five years is illustrated by another fact: The recently passed laws on subcontracted labor, on the office for disabled workers, on part-time work and on collective dismissals had been introduced in the chamber of deputies on 30 May 1989 (!) or 9 May 1989 (!!) or 18 January 1983 (!!!) or 1 October 1980 (!!!!) respectively. The law on job safety itself is the implementation of a European directive that earned Luxembourg a reprimand from the Brussels Commission because of delay of application! Thus during five long years nothing new came from Juncker, not a single new regulation in labor law was introduced during this period! It takes a good share of political impertinence and brazenness in view of this pathetic performance, to present oneself as a great workhorse and to toast oneself as a successful minister of labor. How come nobody else is joining in? The fact is that, due to Juncker, there is an enormous backlog in the Ministry of Labor. The fact is also that the Ministry of Labor would never be neglected in Socialist hands. Even the propaganda of lies by the current flop cannot hide that fact.
