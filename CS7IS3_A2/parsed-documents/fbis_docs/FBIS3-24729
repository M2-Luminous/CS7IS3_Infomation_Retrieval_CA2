FBIS3-24729 "drafr020_c_94016" FBIS-AFR-94-020 Document Type:Daily Report 31 Jan 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Predicts Violence Under Current Plan MB2901113594 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1035 GMT 29 Jan 94 MB2901113594 Johannesburg SAPA Language: English Article Type:BFN [By Craig Doonan] [Text] Ulundi Jan 29 SAPA -- The Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] is set to boycott South Africa's first all-race elections and enter "resistance" politics if delegates to a special conference in Ulundi stand by their leader, Mangosuthu Buthelezi's rejection of the poll under the current interim constitution. The IFP president on Saturday [29 January] told several thousand delegates gathered to finalise the party's stance on the April poll that the present constitutional deal would lead to a future "violent clash between the people and an African National Congress [ANC] government". "I do not see how we can enter elections under the provisions of the interim constitution. I say we must oppose the constitution itself, as a matter of principle." His remarks came despite last-ditch attempts by the ANC to reach a constitutional settlement with the Freedom Alliance, although Mr Buthelezi did not refer to or outline the latest ANC proposals. The IFP president called on his supporters to have "the courage to enter the politics of resistance", saying there could be no governance of kwaZulu/Natal without the active acceptance and participation of the IFP. "This is a region where we dominate. No foreign forces shall come into it to rule over us." While he was not calling for violence or declaring war, Mr Buthelezi went on to say: "No government has ever won the kind of war against opposition which an ANC/SA Communist Party government will have to wage against us if we resist the present interim constitution." Violent clashes between "the people" and a future ANC government were inevitable if the IFP capitulated, and played the ANC/SACP's political "ball game". Mr Buthelezi said he would not stand by as an "abortion of a constitution dictates the final annihilation of the Zulu kingdom". He said he had never rejected the notion of reconciliation between the ANC and IFP, but the current interim constitution was an arena for a "struggle to the finish" and contained no scope for constitutional or political settlements. "I am prepared to compete with any political leader and any political party under a fair and just constitution. I will not, however, subject you to a constitution which is totally wrong for South Africa." The current constitution was specifically designed to promote ANC power and was an instrument for the IFP's destruction, he charged, in his 16-page address. Mr Buthelezi also repeated his rejection of the Transitional Executive Council [TEC], saying he would neither recognise nor obey it. On the Zulu monarchy, he said King Goodwill Zwelithini's future could only be secured by entrenched constitutional provisions and "anything less than that will be an unwarranted taking of risks and a gamble I am just not prepared to accept". In closing, the IFP president told delegates to "search your hearts" to decide whether he was wrong and whether he "should submit myself and yourselves to the interim constutition, and put you at the mercy of the TEC and other tranistional mechanisms". "I want to stress that I will respect any consensus that comes out of this conference." He also called for an end to "betraying" in the IFP Central Committee by members who had complained to the press that he was the "problem" in the party and that he was being led by Walter Felgate in rejecting the April poll. He was referring to recent remarks by senior IFP officials who have told the media they support the party's participation in elections and have criticised "hardliners" in the IFP for rejecting the poll. While there is a strong pro-elections lobby in the party, particularly among newly recruited MPs, the mood at the opening of the conference appeared to be in line with Mr Buthelezi's rejection of the poll. Prominent IFP cleric Rev Sipho Mzimela in opening remarks called for delegates to "stand fast" and reject a "socialist dictatorship". Delegates also spontaneously applauded speakers who reinforced Mr Buthelezi's views and who rejected a future anc government. Mr Buthelezi's speech was followed by a closed door discussion of the pros and cons of contesting the April poll. A final IFP decision on the April poll is expected on Sunday afternoon.
