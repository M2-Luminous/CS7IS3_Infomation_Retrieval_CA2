FR940613-1-00049 FR940613-1-00006 In addition to such pre-loan involvement, a holder may determine (whether for risk management or any other business purpose) to undertake or require an environmental investigation (which could include a site assessment, inspection, and/or audit) of an UST or UST system securing the loan or other obligation. Such environmental investigation may be undertaken by the holder, for example, or the holder may require one to be conducted by another party (such as the borrower) as a condition of the loan or other transaction. Neither RCRA Subtitle I nor this proposed rule require that such an environmental investigation be undertaken to qualify for the security interest exemption, and the obligations of a holder seeking to avail itself of the exemption cannot be based on or affected by the holder's not conducting or not requiring an environmental investigation in connection with the security interest. Similarly, a holder is not engaged in management participation solely as a result of undertaking or requiring an environmental investigation, and nothing in this proposed rule should be understood to discourage a holder from undertaking or requiring such an environmental investigation in circumstances deemed appropriate by the holder. Because lender-conducted or -required investigations of a borrower's business or collateral are information-gathering in nature, such activities cannot, alone, be considered to be management participation by a holder. In the event that a pre-loan environmental investigation of a UST or UST system reveals contamination, the holder may undertake any one of a variety of responses that it deems appropriate: For example, the holder may refuse to extend credit or to follow through with the transaction or instead maintain indicia of ownership in other, non-contaminated property as protection for the security interest. Alternatively, a holder may determine that the risk of default is sufficiently slight (or that the extent of contamination is minimal and does not significantly affect the value of the UST or UST system as collateral) to proceed to extend credit and maintain indicia of ownership in the UST or UST system. Additionally, the holder may require the borrower to clean up the contamination as a condition for extending the loan. Such activities are not considered participation in the UST or UST system's management, and a holder that knowingly takes a security interest in contaminated collateral is not subject to compliance with the RCRA Subtitle I corrective action regulatory program solely on this basis. (2) Policing the security interest or loan. A holder may undertake actions that are consistent with holding ownership indicia primarily to protect a security interest which include, but are not limited to, a requirement that the borrower clean up a release from the UST or UST system which may have occurred prior to or during the life of the loan or security interest (as described in the last section); a requirement of assurance of the borrower's compliance with applicable federal, state, and local environmental or other laws and regulations during the life of the loan or security interest; securing authority or permission for the holder to periodically or regularly monitor or inspect the UST or UST system in which the holder possesses indicia of ownership, or the borrower's business or financial condition, or both; or to comply with legal requirements to which the holder is subject; or other requirements or conditions by which the holder is able to police adequately the loan or security interest, provided that the exercise by the holder of such other loan policing activities are not considered evidence of management participation as provided in the proposed rule's ``general test'' of management participation. The authority for the holder to take such actions may be contained in contractual (e.g., loan) documents or other relevant documents specifying requirements for financial, environmental, and other warranties, covenants, and representations or promises from the borrower. While the regulatory exemption in this proposed rule requires that the actions undertaken by a holder in overseeing or managing the loan or other obligation be consistent with those of a person whose indicia of ownership in an UST or UST system is held primarily to protect a security interest, a holder is not expected to be an insurer or guarantor of environmental safety or quality at a secured UST or UST system. The inclusion of environmental warranties and covenants is not considered to be evidence of a holder's acting as an insurer or guarantor, and a finding of ``management participation'' cannot be premised solely on the existence of such terms or upon the holder's actions that ensure that the UST or UST system is managed in an environmentally sound manner. Since these actions are consistent with holding indicia of ownership primarily to protect a security interest, they are not considered to be participation in management in this proposed rule. (3) Loan work out. The holder may determine that actions need to be taken with respect to the UST or UST system to safeguard the security interest from loss. These actions may be necessary when, for example, a loan is in default or threat of default, and are commonly referred to as ``loan work out'' activities. ``Loan work out'' is largely an undefined term but is generally understood in the financial community to mean those activities undertaken to prevent, mitigate, or cure a default by the obligor or to preserve or prevent the diminution of the value of the security. Loan work out activities are recognized by EPA as a common lender undertaking and, as such, these actions will not take a holder outside of the scope of the security interest exemption provided for in this proposed rule, provided that such actions are consistent with the proposed general test of management participation.
