On Tuesday [22 March] Turkish Government officials complained that unsuccessful attempts at provocation by German journalists in the provinces of unrest in the country's east and southeast, which are mainly inhabited by Kurds, have been registered "with great regret." According to their own statements, the Germans want to observe the local elections and the Nevruz celebrations on Sunday. According to diplomatic circles in Ankara, the 17 members of a Hamburg group in Batman, in southeastern Turkey, accompanied their interpreter to the police station out of solidarity, and returned to their hotel on Monday evening. The interpreter is no longer in police custody either. Diplomats in the Turkish Foreign Ministry said the German groups should know that Workers Party of Kurdistan leader Abdullah Ocalan "is no longer taken seriously by his Kurdish fellow-citizens." Furthermore, it was said that the Germans who want to "experience" the local elections on Sunday after the Nevruz celebrations are considered "tourists" rather than "observers."
