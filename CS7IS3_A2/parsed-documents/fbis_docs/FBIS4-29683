FBIS4-29683 "dreas119__a94010" FBIS-EAS-94-119-A Daily Report 17 Jun 1994 ANNEX Japan Reports on U.S. Air Base Issues in Okinawa Reports on U.S. Air Base Issues in Okinawa U.S. Plans on Port Return OW1806041394 Naha OKINAWA TIMES in Japanese 17 Jun 94 Morning Edition p 1 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1806041394 Naha OKINAWA TIMES Japanese BFN [Text] Concerning the reversion of the Naha Military Port and the Yomitan Auxiliary Airstrip -- two major sites concerning the military base issue on Okinawa -- it has been learned by 16 June that the United States has prepared plans of its own accommodating the prefectural government's requests and has presented them to the Japanese Government. According to information supplied by several officials concerned, the U.S. plans -- which propose to merge Naha Port facilities into the Makiminato Supply Depot in Urasoe City and to return the Yomitan Auxiliary Airstrip completely -- were presented to the Japan-U.S. Joint Committee early this year. Meanwhile, the Japanese Government is cautious about its course of action because of the possibility of reaction arising from the local area to which the facilities may be moved, and has not made a clear response yet. Apparently, both cases will need to be resolved through U.S. leadership. On the issue of the Naha Military Port, the U.S. plans propose to install berths on which vessels can dock in the area of Makiminato, where the western coast development project is now underway, and to use the Supply Depot as a backup area for supply storage. The merger plan envisages reducing the scale of the military port by about half of what it is today. The U.S. Armed Forces used to say "it is essential to have a backup area of the size of the Naha Military Port in order to store supplies for contingencies," but they think that problem can be solved by securing a route linking the berths and the collection area in the supply depot. As for the Yomitan Auxiliary Airstrip, the armed forces have shown their intention to return all of it, and are now studying how to solve the radiowave problems of the Sobe Communications Station (Zono-ori), to which the parachuting exercise site will be moved. At present, the Chubu training ground in Camp Hansen between Kin- cho and Ginoza-son is being cited as a possible candidate for the parachute exercise site. On 16 June, the Japan-U.S. Joint Committee agreed to establish a working group to discuss the specifics of the return of the airstrip. The package of U.S. plans for solving the issues, comprised of specific removal and integration plans, was presented by U.S. representatives at the Japan-U.S. Joint Committee session. As far as the problem of the live-fire exercise over Prefectural Highway 104 is concerned, the U.S. forces are studying a plan to move almost all of the exercise to the East Fuji Training Ground in Shizuoka Prefecture. The live-fire exercise has been another major issues along with the other two concerning the return of facilities. The plan appears to envision removing this exercise, now conducted from 30 to 40 days a year on Okinawa, to the East Fuji Training Ground. The U.S. Government is expected to ask the Japanese Government to bear the costs of transporting troops for the exercise. The transport costs will amount to about $1 million for each exercise. Since Japan is not allowed to directly assist combat operations, including exercises under the existing Status-of-Forces Agreement, the conclusion of a new treaty will become necessary in order for the Japanese Government to be able to bear the costs of transporting the troops.
