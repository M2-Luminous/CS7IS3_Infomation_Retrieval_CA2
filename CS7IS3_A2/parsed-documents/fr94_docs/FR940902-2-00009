ACTION: Notice of Revocation of Antidumping Duty Order. SUMMARY: The Department of Commerce (the Department) is notifying the public of its revocation of the antidumping duty order on fabric expanded neoprene laminate from Japan because it is no longer of any interest to domestic interested parties. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 2, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Sally Hastings or Michael Panfeld, Office of Antidumping Compliance, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street & Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20230, telephone (202) 482&hyph;4366. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The Department may revoke an antidumping duty order if the Secretary concludes that the duty order is no longer of any interest to domestic interested parties. We conclude that there is no interest in an antidumping duty order when no interested party has requested an administrative review for five consecutive review periods and when no domestic interested party objects to revocation (19 CFR 353.25(d)(4)(iii)). On July 1, 1994, the Department published in the Federal Register (59 FR 33955) its notice of intent to revoke the antidumping duty order on fabric expanded neoprene laminate from Japan (July 19, 1985). Additionally, as required by 19 CFR 353.25(d)(4)(ii), the Department served written notice of its intent to revoke this antidumping duty order on each domestic interested party on the service list. Domestic interested parties who might object to the revocation were provided the opportunity to submit their comments not later than the last day of the anniversary month. In this case, we received no requests for review for five consecutive review periods. Furthermore, no domestic interested party, as defined under ยง353.2(k)(3), (k)(4), (k)(5), or (k)(6) of the Department's regulations, has expressed opposition to revocation. Based on these facts, we have concluded that the antidumping duty order on fabric expanded neoprene laminate from Japan is no longer of any interest to interested parties. Accordingly, we are revoking this antidumping duty order in accordance with 19 CFR 353.25(d)(4)(iii). Scope of the Order Imports covered by the revocation are shipments of fabric expanded neoprene laminate from Japan. This merchandise is currently classifiable under Harmonized Tariff Schedules (HTS) item numbers 5602.10.00, 5906.91.20, 5906.91.25, 5906.99.20, 5906.99.25, 5911.10.20. The HTS numbers are provided for convenience and customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive. This revocation applies to all unliquidated entries of fabric expanded neoprene laminate from Japan entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after July 1, 1994. Entries made during the period July 1, 1993 through June 30, 1994, will be subject to automatic assessment in accordance with 19 CFR 353.22(e). The Department will instruct the Customs Service to proceed with liquidation of all unliquidated entries of this merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after July 1, 1994, without regard to antidumping duties, and to refund any estimated antidumping duties collected with respect to those entries. This notice is in accordance with 19 CFR 353.25(d). Dated: August 28, 1994. Roland L. MacDonald, Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary for Compliance.
