FR940405-2-00009 FR940405-2-00007 [A&hyph;428&hyph;013] Cold-Rolled Stainless Steel Sheet From Germany; Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review agency: International Trade Administration/Import Administration, Department of Commerce. action: Final results of antidumping duty administrative review. summary: On May 21, 1992, the Department of Commerce issued the final results of its administrative review of the antidumping duty order on cold-rolled stainless steel sheet from the Federal Republic of Germany. We conducted this antidumping duty administrative review pursuant to a remand order from the U.S. Court of International Trade in Krupp Stahl, A.G., et al. v. United States (Slip Op. 91&hyph;31, April 19, 1991). In that decision, the court ruled that the Department had illegally applied its automatic assessment regulation to Krupp's December 1982 through June 1983 entries because the original less-than-fair-value-investigation was initiated prior to the October 30, 1984, amendment to the Tariff Act of 1930 and prior to the October 22, 1986, amendment to the effective date provision of the 1984 Act. Because the 1984 and 1986 amendments are not retroactive, the court held that Krupp was entitled to an automatic review of its entries. The review covers one manufacturer/exporter of subject merchandise, Krupp Stahl, A.G., and the period December 17, 1982 through June 23, 1983. The final margin is 27 percent. The final results of this review were affirmed by the Court on May 26, 1993, in Krupp Stahl, A.G., et al. v. United States, 822 F. Supp. 789 (CIT 1993). The Court's opinion was not appealed; therefore, we are publishing the final results of the administrative review. Attached is the notice of Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review; Cold-Rolled Stainless Steel Sheet from Germany, as issued on May 21, 1992.
