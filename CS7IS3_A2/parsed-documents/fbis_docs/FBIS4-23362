During their talks, the GPS members deliberated on particular proposals they can use to make government reconsider its position on foreigners' ability to vote. They also made suggestions to enable the Ivorian Government to positively review the issue of financing political parties. Mr. Koman Achi, GPS's chairman, comments on foreigners' right to vote. [Begin Achi recording] No sensible and responsible Ivorian can accept a law whose sole aim is to guarantee the election of one man, but which in essence constitutes a serious threat to civil peace in our country and in the whole West African subregion. There is no country in the world where foreigners are authorized to vote to elect the president of the Republic. What prompts Cote d'Ivoire to make an exception to this rule? Are we more democratic in Cote d'Ivoire than other people around the globe? Cote d'Ivoire's political parties are convinced that the law conferring the right for foreigners to vote will be passed if it is presented to parliamentarians at the National Assembly. Therefore, the political parties have decided to do some housecleaning themselves. They have made proposals on methods for party funding. The proposals will soon be submitted to the head of government and the president. [end recording]
