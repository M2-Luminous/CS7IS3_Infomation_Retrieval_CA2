The Amethyst mini-submarine hit the seabed at low speed during a training dive on Wednesday and dented a protective dome for its sonar in the bows, the Navy said. The Amethyst, at 73.6 metres (225 feet), is one of the smallest nuclear submarines in the world. It is armed with 14 SM39 missiles or wire-guided torpedoes. It was the second incident involving a French Navy nuclear submarine in less than a year. On August 18, the submarine Rubis rammed the tanker Lyria as it surfaced, gashing its hull and causing an oil slick. The captain was relieved of his command.
