For the first time, the GDP topped 3,000 billion yuan last year. The total retail volume of consumer goods was 1,000 billion yuan-worth last year, following average annual increases of 100 billion yuan for the previous two years. The output of pork, beef and mutton totalled over 30 million tons in 1993, 9.7 percent up over the previous year.
