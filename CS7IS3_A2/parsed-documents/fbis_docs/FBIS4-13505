FBIS4-13505 "drnes077yy_94004" FBIS-NES-94-077 Daily Report 21 Apr 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Arab-Israeli Talks 'Arafat, Peres Confer During Meetings in Bucharest 'Arafat, Peres Confer During Meetings in Bucharest Peres Discusses Meeting With 'Arafat TA2104062594 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew 0405 GMT 21 Apr 94 TA2104062594 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el Hebrew BFN [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, in Bucharest, by Hayim Zissowitz -- live] [Text] [Zissowitz] Mr. Peres, we just spoke with a Gaza Strip settler about the issue of jurisdiction, namely: Where will Israelis who break the law in the autonomous areas be tried? Can you tell us what, if anything, was concluded with 'Arafat on this issue? [Peres] No, I am unable to tell you, because I would not like to issue forecasts before we have seen the written and signed documents. [Zissowitz] What is Israel's position on this issue? Will it insist that Israelis who violate the law in the autonomous areas be tried in Israeli courts? [Peres] The issue is more complicated than that. It depends on where the crime is committed and on its nature. It is more complicated than it sounds. [Zissowitz] So it is not inconceivable that under certain circumstances, an Israeli who breaks the law could be tried by a Palestinian court? [Peres] I do not want to get into this. I do not want to comment on issues that have not yet been finalized in writing. [Zissowitz] What about Arabs who carry out attacks...? [Peres, interrupting] Look, I do not want to get into the issue of jurisdiction, because at this very moment it is being discussed, and any rash comment could harm the negotiations. [Zissowitz] Before your departure, you said that the POW and MIA issue will be at the top of your agenda. Did you discuss this issue with 'Arafat yesterday? [Peres] Certainly. It was the first issue discussed. 'Arafat reiterated what he termed his word of honor to Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. He reiterated his commitment to this promise. To his and to our great regret, since that time he has learned nothing new but rather encountered great difficulties. He will indeed continue to deal with this issue. [Zissowitz] Zekharya Baumel's father Yona, who is known to be a cautious man, said 'Arafat knows more about the MIA's than he is willing to divulge in public. Is this your impression, too? [Peres] No, I am not sure this is true. I am not sure he knows much more than he told the prime minister. [Zissowitz] Will Israel be willing to consider the demand of the MIA's parents to delay the release of the Palestinian prisoners until more is known about the fate of the Israeli MIA's? [Peres] Look, if we knew it was a matter of exerting pressure to obtain more information, we would not have hesitated to do so. We would have to be convinced, however, that such information can indeed be obtained only by exerting pressure. I am not convinced this is the case. [Zissowitz] I assume that Yasir 'Arafat raised the demand to continue with the release of Palestinian prisoners, including Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] prisoners. Is this true? [Peres] The issue was not presented in such a firm way. The Palestinians claim that Yasir 'Arafat is the leader of the entire Palestinian people and, as such, cannot discriminate between prisoners. I told him that we, too, are the representatives of all the Israelis, but an Israeli who is in prison is in prison. The fact that we are the representatives of all the Israelis does not mean that those who are in prison should be released. [Zissowitz] What is Israel's position regarding the release of Hamas members? Will Israel insist...? [Peres, interrupting] Our position is that people who say that they oppose the agreement and intend to continue carrying out terror acts should not be released. This is a very clear position. [Zissowitz] Are there any circumstances under which Israel would agree to release Hamas members? [Peres] Look, I do not want to get into the negotiations over the radio. These are issues that must be examined. Our basic position, however, is that people who are committed to the path of terrorism will not be released. [Zissowitz] Are you implying that some kind of Hamas commitment to end terrorism could change Israel's position? [Peres] Not a commitment, but if they actually change their behavior, this would be a different matter. Should Hamas declare that it no longer deals in terrorism and that it supports the agreement, this would constitute a new situation, but I do not believe we have reached this. I think the report that came from Jordan is aimed at creating a political smokescreen. [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 0500 GMT on 21 April carries a recorded telephone interview with Foreign Minister Peres by Ya'el Dan, conducted on 21 April. Asked about reports on future cooperation between the PLO and Hamas, Peres answers: "To the best of my knowledge, such cooperation is not on the agenda. Apparently a dialogue is being maintained on a local basis, but there is no talk of formal and comprehensive cooperation between the two organizations."] [Zissowitz] Is there any basis to Nabil Sha'th's statement yesterday regarding progress on the prisoners issue? Sha'th also said Major General Shahaq returned to Cairo with encouraging news from the Palestinians' point of view. [Peres] I think there is a basis to this statement, but I must say that the mood in Bucharest is more reserved. I sat with 'Arafat for many hours, until late into the night. We had to overcome quite a few unjustifiable misunderstandings and doubts. There is still some gap between the mood in Cairo and that in Bucharest, and we still have to check why this is so. I sincerely hope this stems from not being updated on the latest news, or perhaps from an incorrect interpretation of this news. [Zissowitz] You said you found 'Arafat troubled. What is he worried about? [Peres] He is concerned about what he terms the slow progress in the negotiations. I emphasized that Israel is not the side responsible for slowing down the rate of progress. I told him that even if we conclude the negotiations at the beginning of May, the overall delay in the negotiations will not amount to more than 20 days. [Zissowitz] Did he ask for any Israeli gestures to strengthen his position? [Peres] He did not ask for gestures, but he does have more demands. [Zissowitz] Such as? [Peres] I do not want to go into this, because I am in the midst of the talks and am unwilling to hold public negotiations. [Zissowitz] Mr. Peres, are there any difficulties that were not overcome in the meeting with 'Arafat and which could delay the completion of the negotiations? [Peres] There are difficulties that still have to be overcome, but I believe this can be done. [Zissowitz] Can you tell us what these difficulties are? [Peres] We have still not finalized the issues of airspace and territorial waters. The issue of jurisdiction has still not been wrapped up and signed. There is still the issue of the council and its powers and the registration of Gaza Strip residents. As you know, the residents of Judaea and Samaria, as opposed to those of the Gaza Strip, possess Jordanian passports. These are issues that still must be dealt with seriously. [Zissowitz] Nabil Sha'th said that the Cairo talks will be concluded next week and that after that, all that will remain is to prepare for the signing ceremony. Do you share his optimism? [Peres] I share his hope, and I think it is possible. It is still only a hope, however, and I am convinced that we, for our part, and I believe the Palestinians, too, will exert supreme efforts to reach the stage of an honorable conclusion, which will actually be a new beginning. [Zissowitz] Are you scheduled to hold more meetings today, other than with 'Arafat? [Peres] Yes, this morning we will meet with 'Arafat again. We will also meet with the president of Romania, and another three or four meetings are planned as well.
