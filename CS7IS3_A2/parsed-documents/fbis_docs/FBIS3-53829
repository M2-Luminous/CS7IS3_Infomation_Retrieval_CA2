The Palestinians agree to Israeli control over an area of 19 to 20 square kms. It was finally agreed yesterday that PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat and Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres will meet in Oslo on Saturday in a further attempt to break the deadlock in the Taba talks. It was learned yesterday that contrary to announcements by Israeli spokesmen there is a sharp dispute between Israel and the Palestinians on the size of the Israeli autonomy area in the Qatif Bloc. Israel is demanding that in addition to the territories of the settlements and the areas in between them, it will have control of a security belt that would "wrap" the settlements from outside. Israel is demanding overall 46 square kms. The Palestinians are opposed to this and are agreeing to leaving some 19 to 20 square kms with Israel. [passage omitted] The Security Committee in the Taba talks has still not found a compromise formula for control of the border crossings. Some progress was made in the Civilian Affairs Committee, headed by Brigadier General Gadi Zohar. It was decided to set up a single dialing area for the autonomy and to frank a Palestinian stamp. Senior sources in the Israeli delegation said last night that "there would be no Israeli compromise on the crossings issue. Israel went a long way toward the Palestinians on that issue and we now expect them to show flexibility." [passage omitted]
