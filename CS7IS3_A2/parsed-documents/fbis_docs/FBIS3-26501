Ambassador Guo Jiading, leader of the Chinese team, Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group, said that they would also work hard for the long-term stability and development in the area. Guo made these remarks in his Spring Festival message delivered here today. He said, in 1994 the two sides of the Joint Liaison Group would continue discussions on the three major questions in the transitional period, namely localization of public servants and law as well as officialization of Chinese language. Moreover, talks would also be held between the two sides on the retirement pay for public servants, Macao's joining in international organizations and many other issues in the transitional period. Guo said that 1994 would be a busy year for the Joint Liaison Group. However, he said he was convinced that all matters would be handled properly and timely so long as the two sides firmly adhere to the Sino-Portuguese joint declaration and cooperate with each other on the bases of mutual respect, mutual understanding and sincerity.
