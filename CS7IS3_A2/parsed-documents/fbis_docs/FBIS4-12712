[Sarid] First of all, it should be clear to all Israeli citizens that we do not need terrorist attacks to remind us to take all necessary steps. The Army, police, and Shin Bet constantly do everything in their power to prevent terrorist attacks. We have the best army, police, and security services. Even the best security forces, however, cannot prevent every terrorist attack from taking place. That is simply impossible. That is the case in Israel as well as all around the world. Nevertheless, the government is now taking additional steps. A total closure was imposed on the territories yesterday. If this closure requires bringing foreign workers to Israel then there will be no recourse but to adopt this idea. We do not like this option but we like terrorist attacks even less. [Ganor] Despite all the efforts to persuade him, PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat has refused to condemn these terrorist attacks. What is your reaction to this? [Sarid] I vehemently condemn his lack of condemnation. First, I think that 'Arafat is making a grievous mistake with regard to his own position. He will not be doing us any favors by issuing a condemnation. His condemnation will not bring the dead back to life. I think that he is making a mistake on his own part because any civilized person must condemn such a terrible and monstrous deed. I am very surprised that Yasir 'Arafat does not understand this. The second reason is the fact that we are in the midst of a political process which is based, among other things, on trust. It is totally clear that if the level of trust drops, the political process will eventually suffer. 'Arafat should be more interested in the progress of the political process than any other party -- certainly more than us. [Ganor] Do you join those, including several cabinet ministers, who are calling for a suspension of the talks with the Palestinians? [Sarid] God forbid. I think that would be the worst possible mistake. That would be giving the most extreme people -- Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] in this case -- exactly what they want. If we were to do that, it would not be the government, the Knesset, or even the Israeli people themselves who would decide our fate but rather the last, accursed terrorist who would be ready to carry out a suicide mission. By granting this terrorist the power to stop the negotiations we would be entrusting our fate to him. That is a totally unacceptable prospect. [Ganor] What were your impressions regarding the seriousness of the Palestinian negotiators from the last week of talks? [Sarid] The past week was very disappointing. We received the impression that the negotiations were stuck and not making any progress. I can solemnly promise you that this impasse was not Israel's fault. Several things happened here: first of all, not all the Palestinian negotiating teams showed up. Second, we again received the impression that there were internal differences within the Palestinian camp and within the delegation itself that did not permit satisfactory progress. Even our attempts to transfer the beginnings of control on the ground were not implemented. Israel was prepared to permit the entry of an advance force of policemen in order to begin assuming responsibility and control. Even this was not implemented and I very much hope this will be possible next week. This was a disappointing week. I hope that the Palestinian negotiators will get their act together and that next week will prove better. [Ganor] And if this does not prove to be the case, will you support a unilateral Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip? [Sarid] Such a thing does not exist anywhere in the world. If there were such a possibility I would already have expressed my support for a unilateral withdrawal from the Gaza Strip a long time ago. There is no such thing as a unilateral arrangement. A unilateral arrangement would mean total anarchy and chaos in the Gaza Strip. If it were possible I would support it; however, there is no such option and we must continue the negotiations and pull out of the Gaza Strip over the next few days while continuing the protracted and difficult dialogue in order to eventually reach and sign an agreement. Once an agreement is signed we will be able to finally withdraw from the Gaza Strip, although, as you know, we are already in the midst of the withdrawal process. [Ganor] This will not happen by 13 April? [Sarid] This can no longer take place by 13 April. Once again, through no fault of Israel's. We are not to blame for the excessive delay. The delay stems from the inertia of the Palestinian side, whatever its reasons. I reiterate my hope that they will make renewed efforts next week and the negotiations will get back on track. Everything can be wrapped up by the end of this month. We can conclude the negotiations, wrap everything up, sign the agreement, and even implement it by the end of April.
