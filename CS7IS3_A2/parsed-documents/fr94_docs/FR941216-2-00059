FR941216-2-00059 FR941216-2-00039 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY [FRL&hyph;5122&hyph;1] Public Water System Supervision Program Revision for the State of North Dakota AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: Public notice is hereby given in accordance with the provisions of section 1413 of the Safe Drinking Water Act as amended, 42 U.S.C. 300g&hyph;2, and 40 CFR part 142, Subpart B-Primary Enforcement Responsibility, that the State of North Dakota has revised its Public Water System Supervision (PWSS) Primacy Program. North Dakota's PWSS program, administered by the North Dakota Division of Municipal Facilities, has adopted regulations for Phase II (7 inorganic and 26 organic chemicals), Phase IIb (1 inorganic and 4 organic chemicals), and Phase V (5 inorganic and 18 organic chemicals) that correspond to the National Primary Drinking Water Regulations (NPDWR) in 40 CFR part 141 for Phase II ( Federal Register Vol. 56, No. 20, January 30, 1991, Pg. 3526&hyph;3597), Phase IIb ( Federal Register Vol. 56, No. 126, July 1, 1991, Pg. 30266&hyph;30281), and Phase V ( Federal Register Vol. 57, No. 138, July 17, 1992, Pg. 31776&hyph;31849). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has completed its review of North Dakota's primacy revisions and has determined that they are no less stringent than the NPDWRs for Phase II, Phase IIb and Phase V. EPA therefore approves North Dakota's primacy revisions for the Phase II, Phase IIb and Phase V Regulations. This determination shall become effective on January 17, 1995. Any interested parties are invited to submit written comments on this determination, and may request a public hearing on or before January 17, 1995.
