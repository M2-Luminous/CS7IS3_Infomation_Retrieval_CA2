The planned delivery involves ammunition for artillery shells -- so-called bomblets. The approximately 300,000 explosives are currently being finished and made ready for delivery. A spokeswoman of the Federal Economics Ministry told BUKO that a corresponding export permit for Eurometaal has not been issued. All previous permits were granted on condition that the enterprise delivers its products to the Netherlands. From there, the ammunition must not be exported. Eurometaal has a tradition of exporting weapons to Turkey. As early as in November 1992, the MONITOR news magazine reported that the company planned to supply artillery shells to Ankara. After official protests -- and the oft-mentioned suspicion that the ammunition would be used against Kurds -- the firm decided to export a whole production plant. The plant parts that were transported on Turkish trucks are currently being assembled in the town of Kirikale, where the weapons factory is to be established, as DER SPIEGEL reported. A document of the Defense Ministry in The Hague, which is available to BUKO, shows that up to 309,000 artillery shells with the effect of bomblets are to be produced in Kirikale. Their value is estimated at 400,000 German marks. The bomblets that are currently being finished in Liebenau after a complaint during a quality test are to be exported to Turkey by the end of the year.
