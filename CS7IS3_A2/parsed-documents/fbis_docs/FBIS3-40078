[passage omitted] During those three days, he attended two public meetings and was specially interviewed by reporters on two occasions. During the interviews, he maintained his characteristic style--very open and sincere. What was different this time from past encounters was his carefully crafted comments--no speech that would hurt others, and few or no argumentative remarks. Even so, he still met some difficulties. The "Open Window Discussion" sponsored by the Overseas Chinese Hsing-Chung Hui of San Francisco was attended by more than 400 persons. When Wei-kuo arrived at the door, someone stealthily requested him to "talk a little more about Taiwan." As 90 percent of those attending the meeting were from Taiwan, most being retired officials and their families, their concern for Taiwan was quite understandable. However, in his talk, Wei-kuo not only did not say much about Taiwan, he said very little. He set aside the political strife on the island, and focused instead on bicoastal relations, a topic of much greater import--"divided for too long, we must come together; together for too long, separation must occur." Someone asked: "There is a certain opinion afoot in Taiwan at present which says there is `no hurry for unification, nor any hurry for independence.' This seems to be quite a fair remark. We understand there is no urgency for unification, but does no urgency for independence mean a slow evolvement toward independence?" Wei-kuo replied: "Of course unification is not easy, and it needs to evolve slowly. But it should not be slower than independence." This answer again demonstrated his witty use of language which won warm applause from the audience. General Chiang Wei-kuo's widely acclaimed book "Reunification of China," published in Chinese and English, has received the attention of authorities on both sides of the Taiwan Straits. In his book, he proposed three common denominators or points of understanding: 1) We are all Chinese, so we only need one China. Since we need only one China, all who do not admit themselves as being Chinese, and want to partition up our territorial sovereignty become our common enemy. 2) All Chinese must be able to have a good life, or at least, the opportunity to have a good life. All thinking, theories, systems, and laws that prevent people from enjoying a good life must be overthrown (by us). 3) We must respond to an ideal new China, one that will be respected by the international community. Toward this end, we must cooperate to become strong, to be able to carry out our international obligations. When HSIN-TAO JIH-PAO reporter Li Ge [6849 2047] interviewed Chiang Wei-kuo, I was only a bystander who noted Wei-kuo's careful answers. Li Ge used the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks as an example and asked: "Isn't Taiwan's refusal to discuss matters an unreasonable act?" Wei-kuo's reply was: "I had proposed three common points of understanding. If we truly have these three common denominators, discussions will not be necessary, for all we need will be working units to carry out the work. On the other hand, if there are no common understandings, what is there to discuss? As for the three denominators that I have proposed, the other side has recognized all of them, but I have not heard a sound from the Taiwan side." That very clearly illustrates the absence of a common understanding between both sides of the Taiwan Straits. The Kuomintang authorities have shown no response whatsoever to Wei-kuo's three common points of understanding. However, CH'IAO PAO, an overseas Chinese newspaper with a Communist Chinese background published in the United States, reported on the interview with General Chiang in its 4 October issue. It had questioned the points of common understanding between both sides of the Taiwan Straits; but at the same time, Wei-kuo expressed approval of Deng Xiaoping's "Socialism With Chinese Characteristics," because it agreed with one of Sun Yat-sen's "Three Principles of the People," the one promoting the people's livelihood. This view evoked crticism by certain quarters on Taiwan. I surmise that the CH'IAO PAO reporter mis-stated what he had heard to create this problem for Wei-kuo. For a similar problem can be answered in two ways after a lapse of a day. In San Francisco, whether in public or in individual interviews, people have asked: "What are your views, General Chiang, on the CPC's (Communist Party of China) refusal to abandon force with respect to Taiwan?" His answer has been: "The CPC considers itself the central government and will not agree to any territory being separated from it, for the function and responsibility of the central government is to preserve the sovereignty of its territorial integrity. Under this premise, how can it say it will abandon force? Mainland China has four approaches to this unification problem: political, economic, psychological, and military. When the first three approaches are not effective, can you allow that it will not use the military one? These four approaches make a complete whole. To begin with the military approach is not appropriate. It does not matter who wins or loses, it is not good for the country." In discussing the use of military force, it is only natural that Wei-kuo understands the brutality and danger of war. This is fully reflected in his interview with Li Ge. Even this writer who has no military experience fully appreciates this. The young reporter Li Ge is a product of Beijing's Institute of Journalism. His father, now retired, had participated in many battles against the Nationalists in the Shenyang Liaoning region in earlier days. When he heard that his son was going to interview General Chiang Wei-kuo, he asked him to extend his greetings and bring up a question that many people are concerned about--will his generation ever see the day of unification? Wei-kuo replied: "Absolutely possible, for everything is in an idea. Conflict or war appears suddenly. So does peace. We just wish that the politicians are smart enough not to make those of us in the military to suffer some more. We are some of the best citizens. The selfishness of the politicians creates difficulties for the military who have no choice. There are none who love peace, await the nation's dignity, and care about the well-being of the people more than those in military service. A government that can accomplish this is a good government, regardless of its color." [passage omitted]
