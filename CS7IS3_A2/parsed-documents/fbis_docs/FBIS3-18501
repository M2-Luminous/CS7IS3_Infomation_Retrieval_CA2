This, "because," Mario Segni argued, "they are not government blocs or alliances capable of governing, but merely tactical electoral groupings that are bound to fall apart immediately after the election." However, the alliance centered on the Pact, which has confirmed Mario Segni as its candidate for the premiership, is "a real government alliance with homogeneous programs and objectives." The Pact leader recalled the major conflicts within the two rival alignments -- within the left over government stock, NATO, and public appointments; and within the right over virtually everything, in view of the fact that [Northern League leader] Bossi wants to have nothing to do with [Italian Social Movement leader] Fini. Therefore, Segni said, "serious dangers would ensue for the country if the others were to win: On the one hand, there are those who cite fascism, and, on the other, those who have remained beyond the Berlin Wall." Segni also described [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi's promises to reduce taxes as "demagogic and rash," and pointed out that Governor of the Bank of Italy Antonio Fazio has already issued this warning: "To promise a major reduction of tax pressure means to forget about the problem of the public debt." La Malfa condemned the errors committed by Berlusconi (by allying with Fini) and Occhetto (by allying with [Communist Renewal] Bertinotti), but argued that the dialogue remains open with the League. Martinazzoli, however, spoke about "Bossi's delirium." What about them? "Either we have sufficient votes with which to govern or we will stay out of it," Segni said, though in view of the heavy blow dealt to his lists, he would be happy to obtain the 4 percent necessary to accede to the 25 percent proportional quota. But, he said, if there is no majority, the country will be in trouble. He therefore agrees with the desirability of a constituent government ("as long as it does not include the fascists," Amato added). He is also in favor of a second electoral round, "which would facilitate governability and encourage alliances." Martinazzoli commented: "We would already have achieved this, had it not been for the opposition from Occhetto, who had to pay heed to [Communist Renaissance leader] Cossutta and [Rete leader] Orlando on alternate days." Looking at the postelection situation, the PPI secretary, while recognizing Ciampi's merits, would prefer a government "more consistent with the philosophy of a parliamentary republic," because, he explained, "a country would have to pay for the eclipse of politics." The Pact for Italy's program was also presented at the press conference. It contains five main points: a major reduction of unemployment, the reform of public finance, the completion of the institutional reform, the creation of social institutions based more on solidarity than on bureaucracy, and a foreign policy that espouses the Western ideals of freedom and democracy with a view to countering the resurgent specter of ethnic, racial, and religious hatred.
