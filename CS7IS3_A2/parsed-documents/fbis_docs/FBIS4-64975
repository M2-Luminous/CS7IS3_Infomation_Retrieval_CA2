He was responding to pressure from senior back-benchers, would-be Euro-rebels and former Cabinet ministers to promise a plebiscite before Britain joined a single currency or surrendered further powers to Brussels. After a day of hurried consultations in Downing Street and Conservative Party headquarters, the Government's hard line against a referendum appeared to be softening. Party officials said that, while Mr Major's personal view was still against a referendum, the door was not "locked and bolted." Tory MPs had earlier voiced their concern that Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, had seized the initiative in the forthcoming Euro-elections campaign by revealing that a pledge to hold a referendum on closer European integration would be included in his party's manifesto. Mr Norman Lamont, the former Chancellor who has emerged as a potential leader of the Conservative Euro-sceptics, called on Mr Major to follow suit and agree to allowing the people, rather than Parliament, the final say if there was any further "significant" erosion of British sovereignty by Brussels. He said a referendum was now inevitable as it was the only way to resolve the argument over Europe. Otherwise Europe would continue to split the Conservative Party. "There are two wings of the Conservative Party which have different views on this. This is contributing to John Major's personal difficulties, and one way out of this is for him to put this issue to the people as was done in 1975," said Mr Lamont. There was also support for a referendum from the Left of the party. Mr Peter Temple-Morris, Conservative MP for Leominster and a supporter of Mr Michael Heseltine, President of the Board of Trade, said: "We may well have to keep the option open of having a referendum in connection with 1996 (date of the next EC summit), either before the intergovernmental conference, on the basis of what we go there with, or on the basis of what we come back with." But Mr Bill Cash, MP for Stafford and leader of the Maastricht rebels, said that if there was to be a referendum it should be as soon as possible after the European elections. The question could be simply: "Do you want a federal Europe?" At Westminster it was clear that many mainstream Tory MPs believed that the promise of a referendum could help to paper over the Tory Party's divisions on Europe in the run-up to the June 9 elections. But the difficulties faced by Mr Major were underlined when the Positive European Group of Tory MPs voiced strong opposition to any move by the Government to back a plebiscite. One member of the group said: "It is a bad idea and would create disunity, pitting part of the Conservative Party against the other in an official campaign." Lady Chalker, the Foreign Office Minister of State, underlined the tensions in the party when, in the Lords, she launched a strong attack on Euro-sceptics for seeking to undermine the position of Mr Major. "I really don't believe that the question of a referendum on European matters arises now, and therefore it doesn't need any decision now," she said. But by last night it was clear that Mr Major was anxious not to close off the referendum option. While a single currency remained highly improbable and was not likely in any event before the end of this century, "we are not saying never on a referendum," said one senior aide. Mr John MacGregor, the Transport Secretary, told a meeting in Norwich: "It would be economic madness to contemplate any possibility that the UK could withdraw (from Europe), be isolated or be marginalised. Any moves or suggestions that we may wish to withdraw or isolate ourselves could have a disastrous effect on our economic prospects and on jobs." Mr Ashdown campaigning in Truro, said: "We are about to see a re-run of the Tories' Maastricht muddle -- a struggling Prime Minister held at clubpoint by a bunch of Euro-cavemen."
