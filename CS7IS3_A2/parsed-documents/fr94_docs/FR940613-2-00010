FR940613-2-00010 FR940613-2-00005 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Final Policy Guidance on Public Participation Under ยง306(d)(14) of the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) AGENCY: Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management (OCRM), National Ocean Service (NOS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Department of Commerce. ACTION: Issuance of final policy guidance section 306(d)(14) of the CZMA. SUMMARY: The Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management is issuing final policy guidance on section 306(d)(14) of the Coastal Zone Management Act, which requires that state coastal management programs provide public participation in permitting decisions, consistency determinations, and other similar decisions. This final guidance follows review and consideration of comments of draft guidance issued in the Federal Register , Vol. 58, No. 212, Nov. 4, 1993, pp 58840&hyph;58841. DATES: States with approved coastal zone management programs must comply with this guidance June 13, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Elaine Vaudreuil at NOAA/NOS/OCRM, 1305 East-West Hwy, N/ORM4, Silver Spring, MD 20910, by telephone at 301&hyph;713&hyph;3086, or by FAX at 301&hyph;713&hyph;4370. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Authority This guidance is issued pursuant to the authority of the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1451&hyph;1464) II. Background The following guidance outlines OCRM standards for states and territories with Federally approved coastal management programs, and those developing management programs, to meet the public participation requirement under the Coastal Zone Management Act section 306(d)(14), as amended by Pub. L. 101&hyph;508, the Coastal Zone Act Reauthorization Amendments of 1990. This section states that before approving a management program submitted by a coastal state, the Secretary of Commerce shall find that ``[t]he management program provides for public participation in permitting processes, consistency determinations, and other similar decisions.'' The scope of this requirement extends to all activities that require specific or general authorization through permitting, consistency review, or other means pursuant to the enforceable policies of the coastal management program, and applicable state law. This guidance applies to all state authorizations subject to the statutory public participation requirement and shall not conflict with existing state or Federal regulations pertaining to Federal permitting processes, state permitting processes, and Federal consistency review of Federally permitted or licensed activities. NOAA has reviewed public participation opportunities under state coastal zone management programs and has determined that existing public participation procedures under state law satisfy the public participation requirement under section 306(d)(14) for state permits. For applications under state general permits, public participation in the review of administrative procedures or regulations allowing for a general determination of consistency with the Federally approved state coastal management program will satisfy the public participation requirement. NOAA's regulations already require public participation in state Federal consistency reviews of Federally permitted or licensed activities. Therefore, NOAA finds that section 306(d)(14) imposes a new requirement for effective public participation only on the state's review of Federal agency consistency determinations for direct Federal activities under section 307(c)(1) of the CZMA and any other state coastal management decisions not now covered by an existing public participation procedure. The following guidance outlines an acceptable standard for meaningful public participation. State coastal zone management programs will have one year to comply with this guidance. Within one year, each state is to: (1) Develop public participation procedures for the review of direct Federal activities under section 307(c)(1) of the CZMA, if necessary, and submit a copy of those procedures to OCRM as a program change or submit documentation that procedures are already incorporated into the approved program and (2) conduct a review to determine if other public participation procedures are necessary. If additional procedures are necessary, the state must submit a copy of the procedures developed to OCRM as a program change. If no further procedures are needed, the state must submit to OCRM a notice that a review has been conducted and that no additional procedures are necessary. This guidance is sufficiently broad to give states flexibility in developing public participation procedures that meet the intent of section 306(d)(14). OCRM will review each state's procedures during regularly scheduled evaluations of state coastal zone management programs under section 312 of the CZMA for compliance with the public participation requirement under section 306(d)(14), and will recommend procedural changes if necessary to meet OCRM's guidance.
