Kasoulidhis made his statement when he was asked to comment on a statement by a U.S. official to a Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation correspondent in New York in which he said the exchange of territory could provide an alternative to unobstructed access to Famagusta. Kasoulidhis also said that the National Council will convene to make decisions as soon as there are developments. He also said the government has adopted its policy; it will await the UN secretary general's report. As soon as the report is issued, the spokesman added, the government will announce the steps it will take in coordination with the political leaders and Athens. [passage omitted]
