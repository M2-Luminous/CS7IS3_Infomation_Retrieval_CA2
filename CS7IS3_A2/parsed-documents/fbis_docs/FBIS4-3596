Implementation of the 1993 Plan Thanks to the guidance of the guidelines of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important speeches and the 14th party congress and the correct leadership of the provincial party committee, the people throughout the province, firmly focusing on the goal of building an economically strong province, seized the opportunity, deepened reform, accelerated development, and continued the rapid development trend in the economy in 1993 after the rapid growth in 1992. Our gross domestic product registered a 16.5-percent increase over the preceding year and an increase of 4.5 percentage points over the target, marking the largest annual growth since the beginning of reform and opening up. Science and technology, education, and various social undertakings also made new headway, and most of the targets in these areas as defined at the first session of the eighth provincial people's congress were fulfilled or overfulfilled. A. The rural economy developed steadily and township enterprises grew fairly rapidly. Hebei encountered serious drought last year, but peasants' enthusiasm was further stimulated thanks to the series of policies and measures preferential to agriculture adopted by the provincial party committee and government to reduce peasants' burdens and ensure the supplies of funds for agricultural use. Grain output totaled 23.802 million tons, equivalent to 105.8 percent of the target and also a new record; cotton output totaled 192,000 tons, down by 37.1 percent from the preceding year and equivalent to 42.8 percent of the target; and the output of oil- bearing crops totaled 805,000 tons, up 21.4 percent from the preceding year and equivalent to 107.3 percent of the target. Forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline production registered fairly rapid growth, but production of fisheries declined. The annual added value of agriculture was 29.5 billion yuan, up 3.5 percent. Township enterprises developed rapidly. Their annual output value totaled 171 billion yuan, up 65.5 percent; profits 20.1 billion yuan, up 59.8 percent; and taxes paid to the state 3.4 billion yuan, up 37.7 percent. Township enterprises not only constituted an important pillar of the rural economy, but they also became new growing points of the rapid economic development. B. Industrial production grew rapidly, and economic efficiency continued to improve. Despite the "bottleneck" restrictions imposed by funds, energy resources, and transportation, a rapid increase was achieved in industrial production. Hebei's industrial output value was 260 billion yuan, up 29.4 percent. Of the total, the output value of the enterprises at and above the township level was 162.51 billion yuan, up 17.8 percent. The output of most major products reached or exceeded the planned targets. Electricity output was 48.37 billion kw hours, equivalent to 99.1 percent of the target; raw coal output 60.524 million tonnes, 97.6 percent of the target; pig iron output 8.14 million tonnes, 115.5 percent of the target; rolled steel output 4.915 million tonnes, 114 percent of the target; cement output 22.28 million tonnes, 106 percent of the target; cotton yarn output 384,000 tonnes, 118.7 percent of the target; and cigarette output 1.181 million crates, 101 percent of the target. While production developed, economic efficiency continued to improve. The general index of the economic efficiency of Hebei's industrial enterprises at and above the township level that exercised independent accounting reached 94.9 percent, up 10.4 percentage points from the preceding year; their profits and taxes 16.34 billion yuan, up 47.1 percent; their profit-tax rate of funds rose from 8.57 percent in the preceding year to 9.94 percent; and the net value of their fixed assets grew by 24.6 percent. In this way, the targets of "three increases and one rise in ranking" as defined earlier last year were attained. C. Increase in fixed asset investment gained momentum and construction of key projects was intensified. Fixed asset investment made by the entire society in the year was 54 billion yuan, showing a 60.8-percent increase and equivalent to 142.1 percent of the target. Of the total, 31.03 billion yuan was invested by state-owned units, up 54.8 percent. In the investment made by state-owned units, 11.35 billion yuan was invested in local capital construction, up 83.1 percent; and 7.51 billion yuan was invested in technical transformation, up 36.6 percent. Construction of key projects throughout the province proceeded fairly rapidly thanks to the attention given by governments at all levels and the support given by monetary departments. By the end of the year, 9.7 billion yuan was invested in the 149 continued and new key projects in the province, equivalent to 103.3 percent of the annual target. Forty-one projects, including the no. 1 generating unit of the Xibaipo power plant, were completed and commissioned to increase production capacity. Investment in the 82 projects that should be ensured as required by the provincial government exceeded the annual target by 2.2 percent. Meanwhile, breakthroughs were achieved in the early-stage work for the large projects that had a bearing on the overall economic situation of Hebei, such as the middle-section construction of the project to divert water from south to north, the Huanghua Port construction, and the Shuoxian-Huanghua Railway construction. D. The areas where foreign investment was used increased, the scope of foreign investment was expanded, and the stagnant situation in exports was changed. Throughout the province, 1,879 foreign- funded enterprises of the three types were newly registered, and their registered foreign capital totaled $1.19 billion, up 44.4 and 27.96 percent, respectively, from the preceding year and new records both; and 500 foreign-funded enterprises of the three types were newly built, thus attaining the target defined earlier last year. The actual amount of foreign capital Hebei used totaled $480 million, an increase of 68.6 percent over the preceding year and equivalent to 160 percent of the target. Of the total, $360 million were direct foreign investment, up 100 percent. Last year, the three types of foreign-funded enterprises in the province created 6.7 billion yuan in output value, earned $170 million through exports, and paid 210 million yuan of taxes, up 158, 137.2, and 160 percent, respectively, from the preceding year. Foreign trade increased fairly rapidly. Hebei's imports and exports totaled $2.35 billion, up 10.9 percent. Its exports totaled $1.99 billion, increasing by 11.4 percent and equivalent to 106.2 percent of the target; of which exports through ordinary trade and exports by the three types of foreign-funded enterprises totaled $1.59 billion, increasing by 12.9 percent and equivalent to 103.4 percent of the target. E. Construction of markets was further intensified and the scope of commodity distribution was continuously expanded. Hebei's investment in the construction of the markets for consumer goods neared 1.3 billion yuan, up 30 percent from the preceding year. Markets for means of production totaled 304 in the province, and their annual transactions 13.6 billion yuan. Nearly 2,000 markets for labor forces and employment agencies at various levels were built, and markets for personnel were built in the 12 cities and prefectures in the province. Securities exchange agencies totaled 275 in the province, and the markets for technology and information also became more and more vigorous. The scope of commodity distribution was continuously expanded thanks to economic development and the cultivation of the market system. The annual commodity retail sales totaled 57.7 billion yuan, up 16.1 percent from the preceding year. The general level of retail prices rose by 10.5 percent over the preceding year and was 2 percentage points lower than the national average. F. The financial situation improved and revenues increased substantially. The financial order was rather chaotic in the first half of 1993. After July, monetary departments at all levels conscientiously implemented the correct central policy of strengthening and improving macroeconomic regulation and control and actively adopted effective measures to gradually improve the financial order. By the end of 1993, the savings deposits of the monetary institutions in the province totaled 140.6 billion yuan, an increase of 24.48 billion yuan over the figure registered at the beginning of the year; and their loans totaled 146.12 billion yuan, an increase of 25.22 billion yuan, thus effectively supporting production and construction. Notable results were achieved in financial and tax work. The annual revenue totaled 14.39 billion yuan, increasing by 44.4 percent from the preceding year and equivalent to 132.2 percent of the budget. Financial balance was by and large achieved. Science and technology, education, and other social undertakings were further developed, and the standard of living was improved. In 1993, Hebei achieved positive results in its "scientific and technological advance year" activities. Scientific and technological achievements registered with the province and ministries totaled 1,082, of which 33 were new in the world, 155 were advanced in the world, 475 were new in the country, and 379 were advanced in the country. Fifty advanced and applicable scientific and technological achievements were disseminated, and eight permanent technology markets at the provincial and city levels were built, thus attaining the targets defined earlier last year fairly successfully. Education developed fairly rapidly. Ordinary institutes of higher learning enrolled 38,400 students (including 4,900 students of institutes for adult education), up 39.2 percent from the preceding year; and secondary specialized schools enrolled 75,000 students, up 57.6 percent. The increase resulted mainly from recruitment of self-funded students and students to be trained on the entrustment of some organizations. Hebei's natural population growth was 9.17 per thousand, which was 3.53 per millage points lower than our planned target of 12.9 per thousand. Cultural undertakings were made flourish, and urban and rural sanitation work was strengthened. Sports, radio and television broadcasting, press, publication, archives, tourism, and environmental protection all made new headway. The living standard further improved on the basis of developed economy. Hebei's total wage was 20.27 billion yuan, up 20.4 percent; and the per capita cash income of staff members and workers was 2,945 yuan, up 18.5 percent. Peasants' per capita net income was 803.8 yuan, up 17.8 percent. On the whole, Hebei scored great achievements in the economy and various social undertakings. However, as our systems and mechanisms were in the process of transition, there were still many contradictions and problems in our economic activities. First, the foundation for agriculture was weak, and capacity for sustained development was lacking. After the rather large decrease in cotton production in 1992, 1993 saw another large decrease, with the output equivalent to about one-third of that of normal years. The comparable efficiency of cotton and other crops was rather low, and peasants' income increased slowly. This restricted the increase in agricultural investment to a certain extent and affected the capacity for sustained development. Second, structural adjustment proceeded slowly, and overall industrial quality was rather low. In 1993, Hebei's rapid increase in heavy industry resulted chiefly from the increase in fixed asset investment, and the proportions of finely processed goods and goods with high added value were not high. Light industrial production grew by 12.3 percent, which was 9 percentage points lower than the growth in heavy industry and 10 percentage points lower than the national average. Hebei's improvement in the industrial economic efficiency was attributed to the price rises in the raw materials in metallurgical industry and building materials industry and the increase in their quantity, and merely a very small part of it was attributed to management and technological advance. Third, contradiction between the supply and demand in funds, electricity, and means of transportation was conspicuous, and the "bottleneck" restrictions still existed. Contradictions, such as fund shortages, strained railway cargo transportation, and shortages of electricity supply, remained conspicuous due to the rapid economic growth and the increase in investment. Despite the series of measures for strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control adopted by the state, it would take time to alleviate these contradictions once and for all, and some enterprises still had difficulties. Fourth, our level in opening to the outside world and reliance on foreign trade in economic development remained low. Hebei made notable progress in opening to the outside world in 1993. Compared with advanced provinces and the requirement for building an economically strong province, however, we still lagged far behind. Major manifestations were the small amount of foreign capital we had used and the small number of the foreign-funded enterprises of the three types we had established, especially the small number of large projects; and the low percentage, merely about 13 percent, of our imports and exports in GNP, which was very incompatible with our status as a coastal province. We should pay attention to and address the above-mentioned problems in the new year. 2. The Guiding Thought for Arranging the 1994 Plan and the Targets of Macroeconomic Regulation and Control The year 1994 is an important year for China to continue the good economic development trend and also a decisive year for Hebei to implement the "outlines of development," comprehensively fulfill the Eighth Five-Year Plan, and attain the second 100-percent-increase target. In line with the guiding principles and arrangements of the state and the province for economic work, the guiding thought for arranging Hebei's 1994 plan is to take Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as the guide, conscientiously implement the guidelines of the third plenary session of the 14th party Central Committee, accelerate establishment of the socialist market economy system to meet the requirement for seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening wider to the outside world, promoting development, and maintaining stability, continue to strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation and control, realistically intensify construction of basic industries and infrastructural facilities, greatly develop the high-yield, good-quality, and high-efficiency agriculture and the nonstate sectors of the economy, intensify the technical transformation of old enterprises, restructure the economy, improve economic efficiency, and promote sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development and comprehensive social progress. In compliance with this guiding thought, we have paid attention to the following points when arranging this year's plan. --Only development is the essential criterion. All projects that can be accelerated will be as long as conditions permit and there is a good market and good efficiency so that the gap between Hebei and advanced provinces can be narrowed. We will both do our best and act according to our capacity, never competing unrealistically. --Promote development by deepening reform. The modern enterprise system will be established, deep-seated contradictions in economic activities resolved, and the financial and tax, monetary, foreign trade, foreign exchange, planning, investment, and money lending systems reformed in compliance with the target and requirement of establishing the socialist market economy system and with a focus on transforming the operating mechanism of enterprises to invigorate large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, so that the systems will develop internal impetus to promote sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development. --Implement the strategy of promotion through the export-oriented economy. All trades and professions and all localities should add impetus to the endeavor of opening to the outside world, give attention to and develop foreign investment, foreign trade, and foreign economic relations simultaneously, and strive for a new level this year. --Regard optimizing structure, strengthening management, and improving efficiency as priorities in economic development. Based on the existing foundation, we will accelerate the technical transformation of the existing enterprises through scientific and technological advance. We will strengthen enterprise management and fully tap their potential to achieve better efficiency through better management. Guided by market demand, we will greatly adjust and improve the product mix and the industrial composition. --Achieve a basic balance between total demand and total supply. We will both make active efforts to achieve dynamic equilibrium and proceed from reality to consider objective possibility. We will both fully develop the potential of resources to facilitate rapid economic growth and prevent large fluctuation in the economy and notable inflation. --Develop economic construction and social undertakings in a coordinated manner and promote social stability. On the basis of a developed economy, we will continuously improve people's living standards and quality of life and make particular efforts to increase peasants' income. Meanwhile, we will strictly control population growth, strengthen environmental protection, develop the two civilizations simultaneously, and greatly promote the socialist spiritual civilization. Based on the above-mentioned guiding thought and principles, the major targets of the 1994 economic and social development plan are as follows: A. Economic growth rate: GNP growth of more than 11 percent, which, translated, will be a 4-percent increase in primary industry, an increase of over 14 percent in secondary industry (a 12-percent increase in industries at and above the township level), and an increase of over 14-percent in tertiary industry. B. Output of major products: Grain output will be 23 million to 23.5 million tonnes, cotton output 350,000 to 500,000 tonnes, output of oil-bearing crops 800,000 tonnes, raw coal output 60 million to 63.4 million tonnes, electricity output 53.8 billion kilowatt hours, rolled steel output 5 million tonnes, pig iron output 8.5 million tonnes, and cement output 23 million tonnes. C. Fixed asset investment: Investment in fixed assets made by the entire society totals 61 billion yuan, up 13 percent from the preceding year. Of the total, 34.9 billion yuan, an increase of 12.5 percent, will be investment by state-owned units, and the investment rate will be 32 percent. D. Revenue and banking: Calculated according to the new revenue- sharing system, local revenue is budgeted at 8.03 billion yuan, up 7.9 percent from the preceding year. Savings deposits of banks increase by 17 billion yuan, up 17 percent; and their loans increase by 22 billion yuan, up 20.9 percent. E. Foreign economic relations and trade: The actual amount of foreign capital used will be $600 million, up 25 percent from the preceding year. Exports total $2.16 billion, up 8.5 percent; of which exports through ordinary trade and exports by the three types of foreign-funded enterprises will be $1.83 billion, up 15 percent. F. Commodity distribution and prices: Commodity retail sales total 67 billion yuan, up 16 percent from the preceding year; and the increase in the general index of retail prices is kept within 10 percent. G. Scientific and technological advance: We will undertake 140 key scientific research projects, tackle 40 major scientific and technical difficulties, study and develop 100 new technologies at and above the advanced level of the province, and disseminate 50 key scientific and technological achievements. H. Social development and living standard: Ordinary institutes of higher learning will recruit 36,000 students, ordinary secondary specialized schools will recruit 75,000 students, and the natural population growth will be kept within 12 per thousand. Total wage of staff members and workers of the province will be 24.57 billion yuan, up 21.2 percent from the preceding year; and efforts will be exerted to make peasants' per capita net income 900 yuan, up 12 percent. The above-mentioned targets have been arranged after calculation and comprehensive balancing, and they are positive and reliable while leaving some leeway as we have considered both the tasks assigned Hebei by the state and the requirements of the "Hebei's outlines of economic development" which were approved at the first session of the eighth provincial people's congress and because we have not only considered the favorable conditions of various fields, but also analyzed the restricting factors of various fields. In line with the requirements of the "Hebei's outlines of economic development," we should ensure a 500-percent increase and strive for a 700-percent increase in Hebei's GNP by the end of this century, raise Hebei's rankings in the country in terms of the major indicators of the economy, and turn Hebei into an economically strong province. Judging from the practice in the first three years of the 1990's, the 500-percent increase in GNP can be achieved as long as it increases by 9 percent every year in the next seven years, but an average annual increase of 13.2 percent should be maintained if we are to achieve the 700-percent increase. For this reason, this year's GNP increase is planned at over 11 percent. In the process of implementation, we will strive for a higher increase and still better results in fulfilling other targets.
