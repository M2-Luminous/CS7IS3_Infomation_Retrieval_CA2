Mikhail Zadornov Believes This Is `Profanation of the Budget Process'"] [Text] Mikhail Zadornov, chairman of the Duma Budget, Banks, and Finances Committee, will recommend to the lower chamber at its session today not to consider amendments to the budget involving a change of its basic indicators: revenues, expenditures, and deficit. According to Zadornov, the Duma is bound to such a decision by the budget procedure it has itself approved. Under it, Mikhail Zadornov's committee has singled out all amendments that affect the basic indicators so that "the Duma rejects them automatically." Zadornov allows, however, that "some factions" today are going to return to the discussion of the main indicators "with a view to increase military spending to 55 trillion for populist considerations." A return to the adopted figures of the main budget indicators, according to Zadornov, "will turn the budget process into profanation." According to Zadornov, the committee, "in spite of multiplying rumors about the idea of raising military spending being supported by the president," so far has only an amendment on this score by Sergey Glazyev. Zadornov said that "neither the president nor the government has submitted any amendments on increasing military spending to the Duma." Zadornov made the following supposition: "Possibly the president himself or through his representative will submit his proposals on defense needs to us at the plenary session itself." A similar recommendation by the Federation Council was not executed as an amendment and was not even adopted in principle, which does not allow to consider it formally. Even so, Nikolay Gonchar, chairman of the Federation Council Budget Committee, speaking at yesterday's session of the Duma New Regional Policy faction, stated that "the senate will never approve a budget that places the economy of Russia's 33 regions, which is made up by military industrial complex enterprises, on its knees." The committee also rejected Glazyev's proposal to increase budget revenues with receipts from privatization because "nobody knows what the system of selling property will be after 1 July." Zadornov considers it possible to create a targeted extra-budgetary fund for defense needs if money from privatization is generated in the volumes promised by Glazyev. The committee does not advise the Duma to include these revenues in the budget, however, unless it wants the government's indebtedness to the Defense Ministry, "which will be inevitable even with the military spending level as envisioned under the original draft budget," to become really catastrophic. According to information in SEGODNYA's possession, in spite of the budget committee's opinion, the communists, the Party of Russian Unity and Accord, New Regional Policy, the agrarians, and the Democratic Party of Russia are ready to vote for a return to the basic budget figures. The Communist Party of the Russian Federation, the Agrarian Party of Russia, and the Democratic Party of Russia yesterday summoned a special joint conference on this issue. If the agro-communist coalition fails to get the Duma to return to the consideration of the main indicators, they can vote against the budget. The Yabloko faction, with which Zadornov is affiliated, will vote against both increasing military spending and against the budget as a whole. Russia's Choice and Women of Russia will in all likelihood support the committee. The majority of deputies from the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia together with their leader will go on a trip around the country and will not take part in the budget process.
