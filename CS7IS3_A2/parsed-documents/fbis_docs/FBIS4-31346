At the same time, Klaus' government was putting together rescue packages for less economically advanced regions of the country that are being crippled by the opposite problem: rising unemployment. Bridging the gap between these extremes, while making the job market more competitive by raising overall unemployment, will be one of the major tasks of the Czech government and business leaders over the next few years. The Czech Republic's remarkably low overall unemployment rate has long been the envy of all Europe. Currently at about 3.5 percent -- representing 180,000 people -- the rate is expected to rise to between 4.5 and 5 percent by the end of 1994. The statistics are telling. In March, unemployment in Prague stood at 0.3 percent, with the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs estimating that for every worker in the city there are eight job possibilities. But in the most depressed areas outside the capital, unemployment has exceeded 8 percent, and the government has recently been compelled to offer a program of state subsidies for local industry and infrastructure in the country's four worst-hit regions, three of which are located in Moravia. The phenomenon of an east-west imbalance in national employment is not a new one. According to Vladimir Rudolf, deputy director of employment policy at the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, in the Czechoslovak First Republic (1918-1938), the areas of fullest employment were also in the western and central parts of Bohemia, close to the centers of Czech and German industry and trade. The poorest regions have always tended to be in the east, close to the Polish and Slovak borders. Investment is now generally following this traditional route, which has its source in the wealth of Germany and Austria. Many areas of eastern Moravia remain in dire need of support, while the Bavarian border is a veritable flood plain of German affluence, lined with plush new restaurants, high-tech gas stations and shops. A Czech-German agreement allows Czechs to seek better-paying jobs in Germany within a 50-kilometer strip along the border. For the Bavarians, this constitutes a cheap but legal source of imported labor. The same phenomenon has an equal and opposite effect on the Czech-Polish border, where Czech entrepreneurs find cut-rate workers from nearby Polish industrial cities. In these areas of stagnation, where unemployment sometimes reaches 20 percent, Poles and Ukrainians find good work for good wages, by their standards. Meanwhile, an increasingly dejected local population cannot get to work because of rising transportation costs, poor bus and rail connections and the collapse of communist-era single-factory communities. Agricultural regions have also been hard-hit by foreign competition and modernization. Rudolf said that Czech psychology also plays a role in the stagnation of various regions. "For many decades, Czechs were unaccustomed to relocating to be near their workplaces, as Americans regularly do," he said. "Now inhabitants of Kladno prefer to pick up welfare checks rather than come to Prague to work." He admitted that, due to the chronic housing shortage in Prague, provincial victims of unemployment find moving to the capital nearly impossible. The increasingly difficult situation on the country's eastern borders is forcing people to re-evaluate their lifestyles. Now many Moravians are starting to migrate west, renting holiday cottages in the resort-heavy Sumava and Krkonose areas, near the German border, and working across the border. The former East German border is less desirable, with unemployment as high as 10 percent in the old socialist state. The Austrian border is also less inviting: Relations between Prague and Vienna remain tense, with no signed guest-worker agreements and an Austrian law limiting to 10 percent the ratio of foreigners in the work force. For the fortunate minority of unemployed, benefits start at 60 percent of the average income for the first three months, then go down to 50 percent for the second three months. If the claimant is still jobless, means testing is applied to determine the sum for state support, with a minimum amount set at 2,300 Kc ($79) per month. As part of the government's plans to kick start depressed areas, this benefit will be paid directly to employers using previously jobless workers. "We prefer active, preventive measures to passive support of idle workers," said Rudolf. An employee at the Economics Ministry said that the need to bolster the regions economically had forced Klaus to detour from his oft-stated policy of laissez-faire economics, because the high rate of unemployment in the country's four worst-hit areas seemed likely to induce nostalgia among voters for a command economy. The ministry worker said he thought that the 150 million Kc ($5.2 million) recently earmarked for regional development in the Moravian areas of Bruntal, Novy Jicin, Znojmo and the north Bohemian city Louny represents an important first step in rejuvenating local economies but will not be enough in the end. "We would need to invest at least four times as much," the ministry employee said. Jana Petrova, spokeswoman for Klaus' Civic Democratic Party (ODS), the main member of the government coalition, said the amounts reserved are not optimal, but are all that can be spared at present. She said that the Czech Republic is too integrated to be split by uneven regional development. Rudolf also said he is confident that the recovery package, called the Region Program, constitutes a good start. But one of its drawbacks may be that it only deals with areas exceeding 8 percent unemployment, he said. "There are unfortunately another nine areas with 7 percent or over," he said. "These could be jealous of those areas targeted for aid." If the scheme proves successful, it will lessen the geographical divide that is threatening to cleave the country on an east-west basis. If the regional economies cannot be brought more closely in line, experts warn that the Czech Republic could, like France, develop a head that is too large for its underdeveloped body. But in Prague, with its job surplus, the unemployment problems seem as far away as the moon. Ludmila Hilova, personnel manager at Krone, one of city's largest department stores, faces a special set of problems with the store staff about 80 workers short. The problem goes beyond simple city-wide overemployment: Some small stores are overpaying employees by up to 1,000 Kc ($34) per month, Hilova estimated. Some of these can afford to do so because they have had buildings restituted to them and have few overhead costs to cover, while others deal in the abundance of contraband, duty-free goods that regularly enter the country. But Hilova said the costs of higher wages have caught up with many bigger businesses. "Large, reputable stores cannot afford to do this, although we have the advantage of being more stable in times of economic hardship."
