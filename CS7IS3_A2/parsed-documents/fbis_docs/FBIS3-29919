That day large-calibre artillery units and armed bandits of the South Korean puppet army incited a war atmosphere, firing hundreds of bullets and shells in the areas adjacent to the demilitarized zone in Yonchon, Paju and Chorwon Counties, and formations of helicopter gunboats and transports of the puppet army staged an exercise of support and transport for ground attack units. The war racket of the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets is a vicious challenge to the unanimous desire of the Korean people and the world's peaceloving people for peace and reunification of Korea.
