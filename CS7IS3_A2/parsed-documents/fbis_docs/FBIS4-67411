(KEPCO) reveal all mishaps and precise information related to the nuclear power plants in Yongkwang, West of Kwangju. In a press conference at the Kwangju City Council building, Greenpeace said the two nuclear reactors in Yongkwang were highly hazardous due to technical flaws in their steam generators and fire protection equipment, and urged the authorities to disclose data about the reactors and mishap details. The nongovernmental body, on a 13-day Korean tour kicked off April 12 by its flagship MV Greenpeace, traveled from the Northern port city of Samchok and Pusan to arrive in Kwangju on Wednesday while staging various antinuclear campaigns and other activities to raise environmental consciousness along the way. The group will reach Seoul on Friday after stopping off at Inchon. This particular steam generator, a core part of nuclear reactors made by Westinghouse of the United States, is causing accidents worldwide due to technical problems, Greenpeace campaigners said. Yongkwang's steam generators, which were built in a similar period as those of other countries, could also have defects, they said. A campaigner pointed out that a control rod had been destroyed while a fuel rod was changed at the No. 2 Yongkwang reactor in March 1988 but nothing was revealed about the mishap. Greenpeace urged the government and KEPCO to look into the possibility of nuclear accidents and conduct training for emergency evacuations to ensure public safety. It pledged to work with environmental coalitions in the area in staging antinuclear campaigns and continue with its environmental activities in Korea. Later in the day, Greenpeace sponsored a seminar at Chonnam University and showed a video tape of its activities. Campaigners from various nations then visited the Mangwol cemetery, where victims of the Kwangju uprising are buried, and took part in a concert to get across their environmental message.
