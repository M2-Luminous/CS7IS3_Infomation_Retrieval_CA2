By escalating its attacks in such a provocative manner against Lebanon and its citizens, villages, and residential areas, Israel not only shows disregard for the international community's will, but also deliberately complicates and aggravates the regional situation and pushes this region toward the brink of an abyss so that Israel can implement its schemes, maintain its occupation of the Arab territories, and evade the obligations of a just and comprehensive peace. Israel still refuses to withdraw from the occupied Arab territories in accordance with the Security Council resolutions and the land-for-peace principle. Beyond this, Israel is still approaching the peace process as an occupying force that adheres to the gains of occupation from an arrogant and dominating position. Israel has proven this through its hostility toward the peace process and through its maneuvering and tricks. By escalating its attacks on Lebanese territory, Israel once again confirms that it will not abandon its aggressive and expansionist ambitions designed to annex the Arab territories and drag the Arabs into making concessions and relinquishing their own rights by mixing the regional cards and evading all that would make Israel comply with the terms and components of the peace process. More than two and a half years have passed since the peace process began and there has been nothing yet to indicate that Israel is ready to withdraw from the Golan and southern Lebanon. Added to this is what continues to take place both in and with regard to the occupied Palestinian territories before and after the Oslo agreement. All events and developments before and after the Oslo agreement confirm that Israel only needs a group to follow its orders, implement its instructions, and take part in repressing the Palestinian people on their own territory, which iw exactly what the Lahd mercenaries in southern Lebanon are doing against the Lebanese people and their townships and villages. The savage Israeli shelling of al-Biqa', the Israeli military buildup in the occupied part of southern Lebanon, and the Lahd troops' joining of the Israeli forces in shelling the southern Lebanese villages, townships, and cities have all revealed an important fact that no one should forget; namely, that the aggressive Israeli character, which practices abductions, killings, and destruction, is placing the entire region in a turbulent and feverish atmosphere and in a volatile situation, especially since these practices recall the atmosphere which Israel wants. As Israeli aggressions has exceeded all limits, it is necessary to confront this belligerence through an international response that will end the policy of killings and destruction. Moreover, the international community, which is eager to maintain the peace process, should take the initiative and stop the continuous Israeli encroachments and oblige Israel to comply with the UN resolutions. Israel's refusal to implement Resolution 425 and other UN resolutions, which call for Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories, is a flagrant rejection of international legitimacy and disregards the principles of international law through aggravating the situation in southern Lebanon, spreading the atmosphere of war in it, and continuing the shelling of southern Lebanese villages, townships, and cities. Hence, confronting the aggressive Israeli character is not only a duty and right for the Lebanese people--who have emphasized the importance of, and need for, continuing the resistance and rallying around it--but is also an Arab and international responsibility that first stems from the need to expose and foil the Israeli objectives and pressure Israel into complying with the terms and components of the peace process, led by full withdrawal from the Golan and southern Lebanon.
