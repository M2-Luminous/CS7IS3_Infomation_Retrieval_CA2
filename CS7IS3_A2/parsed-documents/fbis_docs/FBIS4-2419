The relatives of the Taiwan compatriots who died in the "31 March Hairui pleasure boat fire" came to the funeral parlor in Tonglu [a county southeast of Hangzhou], Zhejiang Province to pay their last respects to the remains of the deceased. At 0755, the cremation of the first body began. Earlier, at 0630, reporters arrived at the Tonglu funeral parlor to find themselves in a spacious mourning hall permeated with an atmosphere of solemnity. The coffins of the 24 Taiwanese victims were shrouded in green silk covers and laid neatly in a line. Both sides of the mourning hall were lined with wreaths from relevant departments and individuals from the mainland and Taiwan. Under a banner which read, "Mourning with deep grief the death of our compatriots," stood the portraits and name tablets of the deceased. At 0645, relatives of the Taiwanese victims came to the mourning hall. Facing portraits of their loved ones, they burned incense, paid their respects on bended knee, and went through mourning procedures according to Taiwan customs. Afterward, the relatives chose cinerary caskets for the victims. Some of them had brought cylindrical caskets with them from Taiwan. Ma Shiyong [7456 2514 7167], vice mayor of Hangzhou, attended the mourning ceremony with his office personnel. He said: We are here today with deep grief and would like to express our heartfelt condolences over the deaths of the victims and sympathy for their families on behalf of the provincial, city, and county governments. We hope you will restrain your grief and take care of yourselves. Afterward, Ma Shiyong and his office personnel bowed three times to the portraits of the Taiwanese victims as a gesture of condolence, to which the victims' relatives responded. It is learned that today's mourning ceremony and cremation had been arranged according to the wishes of the victims' families. The cremation of the Taiwanese victims' bodies will continue until the morning of 8 April. Information from another source said that by yesterday afternoon [6 April], the bodies of eight mainland victims had been cremated or buried. (Because Chunan is a mountainous area and lacks a crematorium, crew members from Chunan who died in the accident were buried there.)
