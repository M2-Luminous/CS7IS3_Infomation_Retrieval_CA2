FR940406-1-00014 FR940406-1-00003 Example of Above_The following presents a sample calculation of the information specified in Method 2: Basic Empty Weight=2,064.5 lbs. Arm=78.3 in. Moment=161,650 in.-lbs. Paragraph C. 6: Nose Wheel Weight_341 lbs Paragraph C. 9: ␣ 1Weight (lbs) 1Arm (in) 1Moment (in-lbs) 2064.5 78.3 161,650 ^34.5 79.1 ^2,730 s 2030.0 (*) 158,920 *Arm=(18920)=78.29 (2030.) Paragraph C.10.: Moment=(341 lbs)×(83.25 in)=28,388 in-lbs. Paragraph C.11.: ×=(23,388 in-lbs)=13.98 in. (2030.0 lbs) Paragraph C.12.: CG=92.50 in.^(1.01)×(13.98)=78.38 in. Paragraph C.13.: Difference=(78.29)^(78.38)=^.09 in. Airplane is within plus/minus 0.5 tolerance, therefore paragraph D.1., applies. Figure 3_Weight and Balance Information Accuracy Method No. 3 Determine the basic empty weight and CG of the empty airplane using the Weighing Instructions in the Weight and Balance Section of the POH/AFM. Record the results in the airplane records, and use these new values as the basis for computing the weight and CG information as specified in the POH/AFM, Weight and Balances Section. (i) Upon completion of the requirements of paragraph (h) of this AD, remove the placards required by paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of this AD (including all sub-paragraphs), as applicable, and observe the original limits. (j) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with 14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199 to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. (k) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an equivalent level of safety may be approved by the Manager, Wichita ACO, FAA, 1801 Airport Road, Room 100, Wichita, Kansas 67209. The request should be forwarded through an appropriate FAA Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and send it to the Manager, Wichita ACO.
