Abu Hassan Sazili, chairman of House Commission I in charge of foreign affairs, defense, security, and information, advised the government not to force the Philippine Government to cancel the conference because the political system of the Philippines differs from Indonesia's. In this regard, he urged the Indonesian Government to provide the international community with information about developments in East Timor. Such a step would be better than an emotional reaction to the conference. Meanwhile, Theo Sambuaga, leader of the Functional Group in the House of Representatives, hoped that Indonesian NGOs invited to the conference would tell others about the true situation in East Timor instead of discrediting the government.
