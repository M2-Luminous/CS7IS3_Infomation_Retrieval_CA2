The notice was published in the Federal Register on October 5, 1994 (59 FR 50776). At the request of the State Agency the Department reviewed the certification for workers of the subject firm. New findings show that worker production declines and worker separations occurred at Alfred Angelo, Inc., in Hatboro, Pennsylvania and willow Grove, Pennsylvania during the relevant period. Company imports increased in 1993 compared to 1992 and in the first six months of 1994 compared to the same period in 1993. The intent of the Department's certification is to include all workers who were adversely affected by increased imports. Accordingly, the Department is amending the certification to include the Hatboro, Pennsylvania and Willow Grove, Pennsylvania locations of Alfred Angelo, Inc. The amended notice applicable to NAFTA&hyph;00211 is hereby issued as follows: All workers of Alfred Angelo, Inc., located in Horsham, Pennsylvania, Hatboro, Pennsylvania and Willow Grove, Pennsylvania who became totally or partially separated from employment on or after December 8, 1993 are eligible to apply for NAFTA&hyph;TAA under Section 250 of the Trade Act of 1974.
