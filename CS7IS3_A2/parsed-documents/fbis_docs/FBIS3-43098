S. Belyavskiy, S. G. Mulyarchik, A. V. Popov, Belorussian State University; UDC 621.382.82.001] [Abstract] Two algorithms are proposed for automatically selecting subsets of A-conjugated vectors having a simple configuration for a system of linear algebraic equations (SLAE) with a symmetric positively determined matrix. New computation methods of conjugated gradients are developed based on these algorithms. A numerical study was carried out of the developed methods for a two-dimensional modeling problem of an insulating metal-oxide-semiconductor structure with oxide in the shape of a ``bird beak'', containing non-planar boundaries. With these methods, the modeling time can be reduced by a factor of two. Figures 3, references 8: 5 Russian. 3 Western
