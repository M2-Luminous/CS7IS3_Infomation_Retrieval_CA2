In statements to the Tunisian newspaper AL-RA'I AL-'AMM published today, 'Arafat said that the obstacles and hindrances that the Israeli Government created for the implementation of the Declaration of Principles over the past few months is due to its desire to spoil the joy of the Palestinians as they return to a part of their homeland which has been under occupation for over a quarter of a century. Despite all its procrastination, Yitzhaq Rabin's government is unable to face the consequences of failing to implement the Oslo agreement, 'Arafat stated. There are four extremist groups [tanzimat mutatarrifah] within the Israeli military who are doing everything they can to obstruct the implementation of the Declaration of Principles. These groups see the Declaration of Principles as being against their interests, 'Arafat said. 'Arafat said that hectic preparations are under way to bring thousands of Palestinian fighters from Tunisia, Yemen, and Sudan to Gaza and Jericho. He added that schools, hospitals, and other public facilities will be built in Jericho which has insufficient supply of such services due to its sparse population. 'Arafat said that 1,300 Palestinian families are expected to arrive in Jericho in the next four months.
