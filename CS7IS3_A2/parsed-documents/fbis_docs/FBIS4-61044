Today, thank god, it seems everyone has worked out who is who. Now calls of another kind are being heard -- calls to save the defense industry which, as a result of the overwhelming reduction in the defense order, unconsidered conversion, and diversification, has been brought to a critical state. Many enterprises have come to a halt, others are on the verge of stoppage. Every third designer, engineer, and worker has left the military-industrial complex. But despite that in the budget for 1994 it is planned approximately to halve appropriations for defense. And it is planned to reduce appropriations for research and development 130 percent and appropriations for purchases of weapons and military equipment 450 percent. What threat does this entail for the army, design bureaus, scientific research institutes, plants, and Russia as a whole? That was the question which began our correspondent's talk with Colonel General Anatoliy Sitnov, chief of armaments of the Russian Federation Armed Forces. [Sitnov] If the defense budget is approved in precisely this form the Defense Ministry will be obliged, having paid its debts for 1993 and for deliveries which have already been made in 1994, to release the remaining appropriations to ensure nuclear safety and the safety of the Navy's ships and vessels undergoing construction and repair and nearly ready for delivery and to finance work on guarantee supervision and the solution of priority tasks in the operation of armaments and military equipment. Contracts for the delivery of the remainder (over 80 percent) of the arms and military equipment envisaged by the state order will have to be dissolved. But the Russian Federation Government must make an official decision on the complete repeal of the state order for 1994. It is obvious that all this will entail catastrophic consequences. The development and production of arms and military equipment will be halted and all scientific and technical programs of a defense nature will be curtailed at over 3,000 industrial enterprises and organizations and over 4 million people will be left without work. In addition it will be necessary to channel additional funds (about 6,000 billion rubles [R]) from the state budget to maintain the fixed capital of enterprises (heating, water, electricity, security, and so forth) and to pay unemployment benefits. [Rudenko] What are the armed forces' real requirements today for new combat equipment and weapons systems and to what degree are they being met by industry? [Sitnov] To meet the armed forces' required level of combat readiness and capability by the year 2006 the provision of weapons and military equipment should be 80-100 percent. These indicators can be achieved on condition that average annual volumes of deliveries are increased 50-100 percent compared with existing ones. Here the proportion of modern models will be less than 50 percent. To achieve a level of 60 percent modern models for all main types of weapons as is the case in the Western countries' armed forces, we must increase average annual deliveries three to five times. Realizing that under the conditions of restricted financing this is unlikely, the Defense Ministry's main efforts are aimed today at ensuring priorities in the development of arms and military equipment, modernizing existing arms, expanding their standardization among the branches of the armed forces, and reducing their range, increasing the reliability and quality of repair and technical servicing with a view to extending operational life. [Rudenko] Which avenues for the development of arms and military equipment are regarded as the priority ones and how are they being financed? [Sitnov] We rate as priorities in the armed forces' armaments system the strategic forces and facilities, intelligence and communications facilities, automated control systems, the improvement of the efficiency of various classes of conventional arms, means for the serviceman's combat and technical equipping meeting the requirements of modern combat, and the preparation of the necessary scientific and technical groundwork for key elements of promising models of weapons. Right now a special "list of models of arms and military equipment whose production must be retained in any economic situation" has been drawn up. Thus in 1993 about 80 percent of appropriations envisaged for research and development was spent on financing priority work. This year, in connection with the uncertain nature of volumes of financing for the state defense order, it is planned to earmark 60-70 percent of appropriations for these purposes. [Rudenko] A recent Defense Ministry conference showed arms purchases graphs. They virtually all showed a downward curve. Where is the critical level below which there is catastrophe? [Sitnov] However painful it is to say this, already the production of a number of types of arms and military equipment is below the minimum permissible level. We regard as critical the level below which the disintegration of manufacturing processes and production cooperation begins. In 1992-1993 arms production volumes were reduced by a factor of seven to eight. Therefore the Defense Ministry, the State Committee for the Defense Industry, and the Ministry of the Economy elaborated the state order for 1994, which basically makes it possible to preserve the defense potential in the country's interests. But its execution is now under threat of disruption. Insufficient volumes of financing have in practice already led to the nonfulfillment of the plan for the first half of the year. [Rudenko] Is the advance funding of the state defense order being carried out, as prescribed by the relevant edict of the Russian president? [Sitnov] Ensuring advance funding for work on the development and production of output (commodities, operations, services) within the limits of up to 20 percent of the annual volume of budget appropriations for the purchase of arms, military equipment, and scientific and technical output for military purposes is something that we are not yet able to do. As of 1 April this year, for instance, only 4 percent of the required volume of funds had been earmarked for advance funding of the defense order. As for research and development, there is virtually no advance financing. All income funds (about 5 percent of those requested) go to cover expenses on work which has already been carried out or is being carried out. [Rudenko] Many leaders of defense firms complain not so much of the lack of the defense order as of the lack of certainty. There is the long-standing question of hiving off so-called public plants which would make up the nucleus of the defense complex and have a guaranteed state order. Has the list of these plants been approved? [Sitnov] Such a list has been compiled. It is now being coordinated in the ministries and departments concerned. But even if a decision is made at government level to transform these enterprises and organizations into public ones, the question remains of the smooth financing, in the necessary volumes, of the state defense order which they are fulfilling. [Rudenko] What measures should be taken to stabilize the state of affairs in the defense complex and to fulfill the state defense order for 1994? [Sitnov] Above all it is essential really to implement the guaranteed budget financing (the even receipt of money over the year with the funds' prompt and full indexing with inflation) and material and technical provision of the state defense order. The Russian Federation Defense Ministry must be allocated appropriations for advance payment of those who carry out the work. All benefits connected with the fulfillment of work on the products list of the state defense order must be extended to the fulfillment of work on the products list of the Russian Federation Defense Ministry's direct order. Banks of any form of ownership must be set a three-day deadline for forwarding Defense Ministry payments to those who have carried out the work and fines must be introduced for violating this deadline. Special accounts must be opened for those who carry out the work into which advances and current payments from the Russian Federation Defense Ministry would be paid. Money from these accounts should be used only for expenses connected with the fulfillment of the state defense order. The creation of a standard legal base for planning and implementing the state defense order must be completed. We realize that in the present economic and financial situation it is difficult to fulfill all these conditions. But it must be done. Otherwise Russia will not simply large behind the leading Western countries but will lose the ability to produce modern arms and military equipment systems.
