He also mentioned unqualified changes in hospital management and the halt of health insurance transformation as causes leading to the present state. He said the different development of the Czech and Slovak health sectors after the 1993 split of Czechoslovakia were the result of the "better running of the Czech Health Ministry which could project its needs and support them with hard evidence." "Unfortunately, we failed to do likewise in this country," he added. The health sector's budget was not a priority under the previous government, resulting in health services being as much as 50 billion crowns ($1.5 billion) in debt, Sagat said. He added that this year the 15.7 billion-crown health sector budget was 5 billion crowns short of the requirement. He said extra money would have to come from national reserves, causing a deepening of the budget deficit, or from foreign loans. It is hoped that a foreign loan decision would come by the end of June since his ministry plans changes in the financial management of the health services to take effect as of July 1, Sagat said. A foreign loan is to be managed by health insurances as their "starting capital," since the hitherto "irregular and variable" insurance revenue has left them unable to cope with service costs, Sagat said, adding that the government would have to back the health sector more effectively. Health and social insurance funds would have to be separated as the past six months' performance of the mixed National Insurance showed it to be falling behind expectations. The separation of the two funds looks likely to happen, Sagat said.
