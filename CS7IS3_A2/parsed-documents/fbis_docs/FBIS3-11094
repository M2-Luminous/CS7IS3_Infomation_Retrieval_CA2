He categorically stated that the EZLN will not unilaterally open fire in spite of provocations against the peace process by farm owners and ranchers in Chiapas. He noted: "If the farm owners do not take a military initiative against us, we will not take one against them because the Indian Revolutionary Clandestine Committee decided on its own to respect the August elections process." Marcos explained: "At this moment political work is above military actions, and our watchword to the communities of the region and to all the country is: `Here we are! This is our call now.'" Marcos was interviewed in a rebel military operations center. The subcommander spoke about his military strategies and tactics, the social support his movement enjoys in the communities, and governing the rebel-controlled zones for the past two years. [passage omitted] [LA JORNADA] Is the EZLN surrounded by the federal Army in the jungle? [Marcos] In a military sense, yes, our forces are surrounded. We cannot make any offensive movement or muster big or small units of troops or try an offensive like the 1 January one. But we maintain a defensive position, and we are in our territory. We are trained for this. When we withdrew after the attacks on the municipalities, we adopted this position. [LA JORNADA] Has this cease-fire period represented a military advantage for the Mexican Army? Have they located you? Were you prepared for this phase? [Marcos] We are. When the cease-fire came on 12 January the federal Army said to itself: "I have located them. I have their barracks and their communications centers, and I am ready to bomb them," and it did. They bombed several of our positions even after the cease-fire order had been given and later argued that the troops did not know about the cease-fire. What happened is that the Army already had complete military intelligence reports and then planned to definitely push us out of the towns into the mountains and then engage in a counterinsurgency phase, but now without the media being on top of the Army. Then the federal Army realized that the Zapatist positions were, geographically speaking, in the center of rural towns. The Army then decided, within the framework of the fabrication that came out of the Persian Gulf war that it is possible to wage war against a nation and to kill only the military without harming the civilian population, that a surgical-type annihilation would be easy. I imagine that the political cost of this was estimated. The government and the Army were bewildered. They wondered who is really behind this movement. They looked at each other out of the corners of their eyes wondering if the person at their side could be the one sponsoring it. Then they decided to go for the cease-fire and for the dialogue, to see who is behind all this. [LA JORNADA] What is the difference between the EZLN and other guerrilla movements, such as those in Central America? The EZLN seized some municipalities and then withdrew. [Marcos] Yes, because our force is made up of peasants. We have no forces in the cities. Of course the peasants can control the cities and the roads militarily. They do not have to attack cities to control them. The peasants may attack a city to recover weapons, ammunition, or to do propaganda work. We began our struggle with political work and with the formation of militias in the towns for the self defense of territories, but we do not have the capability to carry out urban military actions. The truth is that those urban military actions that took place during the armed conflict were the work of other organizations. We had nothing to do with that. The current EZLN stage is one of survival, and we have to see that no life is lost, in the best of cases, and that this allows us to keep our territory to survive as a combatant force. Another objective is to receive the support of the people, who have told us: "Do not surrender the weapons." First they used to say: "Talk, make peace." Later they said: "Talk, but do not believe in what the government says; do not surrender the weapons because if they are going to give us something it is because we are armed; if you put down your weapons, they will give us nothing." We received this kind of advice from many people. [LA JORNADA] The interview was interrupted by a combatant who brought a message. Marcos concluded the interview with an anecdote from General Francisco Villa. [Marcos] His people used to ask him where he was going to sleep, and he always named a place, but the next morning he would wake up in a different site. He was afraid of being betrayed."
