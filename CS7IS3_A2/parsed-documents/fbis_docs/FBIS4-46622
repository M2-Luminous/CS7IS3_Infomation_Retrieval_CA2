Bogdanov, deputy commander for Rear, chief of Fleet Rear of Black Sea Fleet, under rubric "Army and Navy Rear": "A Special Fleet in a Special Period"] [Text] The Black Sea Fleet performs missions in its operational zone as a component part of the Russian Federation Navy. The missions are responsible and important and are aimed at achieving peace, tranquility and stability of the political situation in the given region. Keeping Fleet forces in constant readiness and success of performing combat missions largely depend on the status of logistic and technical support systems, i.e., they are determined by the capacities and capability of these systems to bring permanent readiness forces up to full allowances of arms, ammunition, fuel and other supplies in a short time and carry out mobilization and deployment of Fleet forces in the logistic sense. What are the features of functioning of the Black Sea Fleet logistic support system today? Above all it is the Black Sea Fleet's simultaneous operational subordination to two Presidents--of Russia and Ukraine. Fleet rear units and establishments are on the territory of two sovereign states, experiencing the painful process of reorganization of the economic base of CIS states and all complexities of the transition of their economy to market relations and of the break in economic ties. Financial resources for military expenditures have been reduced considerably and centralized deliveries of supplies have stopped. Regional conflicts (Georgia, Moldova, Abkhazia) have affected us directly. Despite all difficulties and problems, the alignment, composition and manning of the Fleet rear, the availability of supplies and their echelonment as a whole for 1992-1993 permitted supporting Fleet forces with everything necessary and getting prescribed standards of allowances to each seaman, warrant officer and officer. Along with performing missions inherent to it, the Fleet rear has performed much work to fulfill Russian government assignments. An operation was carried out to evacuate servicemen's families and the civilian population from Abkhazia, Poti and Batumi. A total of around 50,000 persons were evacuated. Tens of thousands of tonnes of stockpiles were evacuated from the territory of Georgia and a peacemaking mission of Black Sea Fleet ships and naval infantry to the city of Poti was successfully supported to protect lines of transportation. The operation of all rear elements was and is continuing to be carried out in an extremely unstable political and economic situation in the Crimea and Ukraine. The absence of a precise legal status of the Black Sea Fleet and of course of a legislative and legal base both for the Fleet as a whole as well as for the personnel and for servicemen's families is having an especially negative effect on the activity of rear entities. Together with Ukraine's discriminatory laws and with the constant ideological pressure on Fleet personnel and their families, the inaction of Russian Federation laws "On Defense," On the Status of Servicemen," "On Military Obligation and Military Service" and "On Pension Support to Persons Who Have Performed Military Service...," especially with respect to provisions on social protection and benefits and against the background of old social problems which remained, engenders a feeling of uncertainty about tomorrow and apathy in many. And the duality of Black Sea Fleet operational subordination is causing serious problems and difficulties in timely, complete support of Fleet ships and units with supplies. The chief problem is that the procedure for financing and supplying the Fleet has not been worked out or defined up to the present time. The Yalta agreements between Ukraine and Russia are being violated unilaterally by Ukraine and are leading to disruption of centralized deliveries of supplies coming from Russia. Thus, new Ukrainian customs rules placed in force as of 1 April 1993 provide for a 0.15 percent customs duty on military cargoes; financial resources have not been allocated for these needs. Ukraine is taking enormous funds from the Fleet in the form of a tax on land (13 billion karbovantsy for 1993), which is leading to actual disruption of Black Sea Fleet financing. Officers and warrant officers arriving from Russia for duty in the Black Sea Fleet pay 300,000 karbovantsy each, i.e., almost one month's pay, for customs inspection of containers of household goods. Ten dollars, or this amount in karbovantsy at the bank rate of exchange, is collected for each flight of aircraft from the territory of Russia to the Black Sea Fleet. Five dollars is collected for each customs worker arriving to inspect the aircraft, and it is based on double rates if this occurs on days off or holidays. Pay for Fleet servicemen in karbovantsy is much below the financial support to Russian Armed Forces servicemen in real buying power. Compare. The pay of a Black Sea Fleet officer is $15-20 according to the local rate of exchange. Benefits envisaged for a serviceman by Russian laws are not being applied in the Black Sea Fleet up to the present time. The Fleet has a colossal debt for fuel, food, electrical energy and water. Power and water supply agencies disconnect garrisons and housing areas where thousands of people live for systematic nonpayment of accounts. All the above leads to a strained social situation in the Fleet. The established 50-percent support of the Fleet in equal proportions by Russia and Ukraine is not being upheld. The main reserves of supplies come basically from Russia. Thus, while 81 percent of fuel oil, 88 percent of diesel fuel, 75 percent of aviation kerosene, and 67 percent of clothing and related gear were supplied from Russia in 1992, 100 percent of fuel oil, diesel fuel, clothing and related gear, and equipment came from Russia in 1993. In August of last year Ukraine unilaterally stopped all financial support of the Black Sea Fleet. The Fleet rear is supported only by Russia, which once again confirms that only an economically highly developed state is capable of maintaining and supporting the Navy and keeping its combat readiness at a sufficient level. The reduction in the Armed Forces, reorganization of the country's economic base, and the need for increasing the effectiveness of work by rear units and establishments in the course of military reform dictate the advisability of accelerating a transition to a system of supporting Black Sea Fleet forces on a territorial principle. The main content of this principle must be an increase in responsibility and effectiveness of using rear units and establishments existing in peacetime for autonomous, reliable support of Fleet forces by making fixed bases, depots, and transportation, repair and other rear establishments into primary ones and investing them with additional rights and obligations. The essence of the territorial principle of logistic support of Fleet forces is that a rear grouping deployed in a designated basing area supports all ships, units and formations performing missions in or near the given area, i.e., they are assigned to the corresponding rear grouping for support. The territorial (zonal) support system permits concentrating all Fleet forces and assets and all resources, maneuvering them flexibly and using them effectively in full accordance with the operational-rear situation. Fleet rear departments, on whose basis we propose to establish Fleet logistic and technical support areas without increasing the numerical strength of the management apparatus, are the basis of the territorial system of Black Sea Fleet logistic support. In peacetime this will permit reducing the time periods for delivering supplies to consumers, organizing centralized supply, simplifying the system of records and accounts, increasing effectiveness of control over support to Fleet forces, and also using the local economic base most advisably. Most important, the alignment of the peacetime rear will correspond to the operational alignment of Fleet forces in the initial period of war. And in wartime this will enable distributing and sheltering supplies promptly, increasing the survivability and autonomy of the system of logistic support to Fleet forces, improving the effectiveness of command and control of the rear and, of course, ensuring stability of the system of logistic support to Fleet forces because of the fixed base. Subordinating the management entities performing logistic, technical, transportation, medical and basing support functions to one official must be the basic principle of operational development of the Navy rear. It is necessary to observe the unity of administrative and functional subordination. With consideration of this principle, in my view it is necessary to concentrate forces and assets in the makeup of rear management entities in fleets, naval bases and formations to perform tasks of providing all kinds of supplies; repairing ships, weapons, arms and equipment; providing basing and medical and other kinds of logistic support; and providing means of transportation for military movements and delivery of supplies. The history of Navy development shows that the rear was centralized and unified for a lengthy period of many centuries. History itself moves us to conclude the presence of a stable trend, tested by war experience and peacetime combat training, toward development and perfection of a centralized, unified rear in the center and in the fleets, and a unified fleet logistic and technical support system. Wherein does the positiveness of a unified fleet rear structure lie? First of all, under a unified command element the rear accomplishes a mutually coordinated, comprehensive, and complete integrated support of fleet forces in all zones and areas of support, which contributes to more effective and precise use of forces and assets. Secondly, it meets requirements for centralized delivery of supplies, permitting performance of assigned missions with a lesser detail of forces and assets. Thirdly, it permits increasing, in a logistic sense, the autonomy of combat force groupings by creating integrated, autonomous support subsystems in individual areas and on specific axes, which creates favorable conditions for performance of support missions by available peacetime forces and assets with the sudden beginning of combat operations. The division of the rear which occurred in 1989 and the removal from its makeup of organs of technical and engineer support, medical service, military transportation service and armored service created difficulties in planning and accomplishing logistic support to forces, especially with the establishment of rear groupings for integrated support. Alas, planning and implementation of these plans were under the purview of two entities subordinate to each other. In essence, the unified system of integrated logistic and technical support was disrupted. The division of the rear occurred only at the fleet level; the organizational structure of formations and units did not undergo changes. As a result, the principle of identity of organizational structure at all levels of the fleet rear was violated. The breakup of the rear complicated command and control of logistic support forces and assets in peacetime (especially with a transfer to a wartime footing). Therefore we propose to establish a Fleet rear organizational structure in the Black Sea Fleet that unites logistic, technical and engineer support forces and assets under a unified command of the Fleet chief of rear. Successful functioning of the Fleet logistic support system is impossible without means of transportation. The low strength level of basic types of vessels negatively affects the possibilities of support to Fleet forces in ocean and forward logistic support zones, at mobile basing facilities, at supply facilities, and at permanent station facilities of the Black Sea Fleet main logistic support zone. The auxiliary fleet has a special need for universal artillery ammunition carriers, marine dry-cargo carriers, technical tankers, seagoing harbor tugs, and water carriers. And in the future the construction of comprehensive and special support ships (vessels) with a fleet speed of 20-24 knots, of air-cushion transport vehicles (boats) with a speed of 80-100 knots and hydrofoils with a speed of 50-60 knots is needed. This will allow increasing the operational use factor of vessels and lowering the need for them by 1.5-2 times, i.e., reducing the need for vessels and realizing the principle of preferential use of the floating rear in supporting ship groupings by increasing quality parameters. An extremely serious situation has taken shape with auxiliary fleet ship repair. Today vessels are being operated with expired periods between repairs and periods between drydockings. The actual percentage of ship repair support in 1992 was 30. Because of the absence of financing, the question of accommodating vessels for repair has not been resolved up to the present time. With the present nature of warfare, the effectiveness of all kinds of operations and combat operations of naval forces depends to an even greater degree on reliability of their logistic support. An analysis shows that the volume of logistic support in modern operations is growing by approximately 10-15 times compared with the Great Patriotic War period. In conducting combat operations it is necessary to replenish supplies, above all of weapons and fuel. The existing system of storing supplies in the Fleet shows that norms in force for dispersal and echelonment of unit-level operational supplies are not being sustained. A high concentration of supplies in categorized cities with a low degree of their shelter in protected structures can lead to great losses in the very first days of war, since dispersing considerable volumes of weapons and supplies in short time periods is a very complicated task. The basic cause of the unfavorable state of affairs with dispersal and shelter of supplies is the poor state of Fleet support with depot spaces and fuel tanks. This means the status of the material-technical base for storing supplies in the Fleet does not conform to rates of development of Fleet needs, which in turn is determined by the absence of necessary funds for construction materials and poor capabilities of Fleet construction organizations. A serious situation has formed with echelonment of supplies in the first echelon--on ships and in units and formations. The lowering of reserves in the troop rear due to a shortage or absence of depot spaces not only affects the combat readiness of unit and formations, but also in the final account leads to a disruption of the entire system of echeloning supplies in the Fleet and to an overloading of Fleet depots and fuel bases with unit-level supplies to the detriment of their containing operational-level supplies. The lag of the material-technical base behind the quantitative and qualitative development of Fleet combat forces is a stable trend in the Black Sea Fleet, which is showing up especially at the present time. While in their development based on the newest achievements of science and technology, combat forces are at the level of the 1990's for many qualitative parameters, the material-technical base is at the level (yes, yes!) of the 1960's and 1970's. This relates above all to the basing system, to the ship and vessel repair and drydocking base, and to the presence and status of storage areas and tanks for keeping weapons, ammunition, equipment, fuel, provisions and other supplies. As a result of the insufficient capacity of the material-technical base, ship and vessel repair and drydocking time periods increase. The incomplete state of support involving storage areas and tanks does not permit keeping stockpiles in necessary amounts and leads to their losses and to a decrease in survivability of reserves. The principal direction for solving this problem is the elimination of disproportions between the development of Fleet combat forces and development of the material-technical base. Development of the rear should be constantly balanced with consideration of quantitative and qualitative changes in the order of battle of Fleet forces and in its combat assets, arms and equipment. These changes should occur simultaneously and even with a certain lead time for entry into the Fleet of rear equipment needed for supporting new ships and for preparing and delivering weapons and other supplies. Realization of this direction can be achieved only by increasing the funds for development of the material base at the expense of a quantitative and qualitative reduction in the construction of new ships and by excluding obsolete ones from the Fleet makeup. In my view, it is advisable to bring the material-technical base into line with needs for supporting forces along the following directions: - ensuring a proportional ratio between combat forces and their supporting forces (assets). Under conditions of a reduction in numerical strength of the Armed Forces, this ratio should be changed in the interests of the rear already in peacetime. In developing a long-range program for Navy development it is advisable to develop and provide for a ratio of 1.0-0.8 between combat forces and the rear; - achieving an outstripping development of rear equipment and armament, i.e., it is advisable to apply the principle that new rear equipment should be created and enter the Fleet before new ships and aircraft are included in the order of battle; - a balanced development of the shore (fixed and mobile), floating (surface, underwater and amphibious) and airmobile rear; - creating technical equipment on ships (vessels, transports) that supports mass, rapid transfer of cargoes from vessels (transports) to ships, and also the loading and unloading of vessels off an austere beach. An improvement in the rear management system is impossible without accelerated establishment of an automated system for managing the Navy rear; without modelling logistic support processes using modern operations research methods permitting choice of the optimum option based on an evaluation of alternative options of decisions and logistic support plans; and without introducing methods of military and economic substantiation and forecasting of the directions of rear development and methods of a military and economic evaluation of rear operational and combat training measures. Realization of the main directions for development of the Fleet rear in peacetime will help attain stable logistic support of Fleet forces. The Fleet rear has considerable plans. Would that energy, knowledge and persistence were enough. We must create a highly developed territorial system of support for the Black Sea Fleet meeting the defensive nature of military doctrine and the adopted structure of the national economy, ensuring effective satisfaction with everything necessary for life, everyday routine and combat training in peacetime and contributing to the buildup of the rear's forces and assets in a short time when it is mobilized and placed in full combat readiness.
