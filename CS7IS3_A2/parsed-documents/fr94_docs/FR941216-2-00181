FR941216-2-00181 FR941216-2-00105 Additionally, the petitioner stated that the non-U.S. certified 1992 Ferrari 348TB complies with the Bumper Standard found in 49 CFR Part 581. Petitioners also contended that the non-U.S. certified 1992 Ferrari 348TB is capable of being readily modified to meet the following standards, in the manner indicated: Standard No. 101 Controls and Displays: (a) substitution of a lens marked ``Brake'' for a lens with an ECE symbol on the brake failure indicator lamp; (b) installation of a seat belt warning lamp; (c) recalibration of speedometer/odometer from kilometers to miles per hour. Standard No. 108 Lamps Reflective Devices and Associated Equipment: (a) installation of U.S.-model headlamp assemblies which incorporate sealed beam headlamps; (b) installation of front and rear sidemarker/reflector assemblies; (c) installation of a high mounted stop lamp. Standard No. 110 Tire Selection and Rims: installation of a tire information placard. Standard No. 111 Rearview Mirrors: replacement of the passenger side rearview mirror, which is convex but lacks the required warning statement. Standard No. 114 Theft Protection: installation of a buzzer microswitch and a warning buzzer in the steering lock electrical assembly. Standard No. 115 Vehicle Identification Number: Installation of a VIN plate that can be read from outside the left windshield pillar, and a VIN reference label on the edge of the door or latch post nearest the driver. Standard No. 118 Power-Operated Window System: rewiring of the power window system so that the window transport is iniperative when the ignition is switched off. Standard No. 208 Occupant Crash Protection: (a) installation of an ignition switch-actuated seat belt warning lamp and buzzer; (b) installation of a passive restraint system consisting of driver and passenger side automatic seat belt assemblies, tracks, and a control unit that have part numbers identical to those found on the U.S. certified 1992 Ferrari 348TB. The petitioner claimed that the lower dash panel on the non-U.S. certified 1992 Ferrari 348TB is identical to that found on its U.S. certified counterpart, and that a knee bolster is not supplied on the U.S. certified vehicle. Standard No. 209 Seat Belt Assemblies: installation of seat belts labeled in accordance with the standard. Standard No. 214 Side Door Strength: installation of reinforcing beams. Standard No. 301 Fuel System Integrity: installation of a rollover valve in the fuel tank vent line between the fuel tank and the evaporative emissions collection canister. The reader is referred to that notice for a thorough description of the petition. One comment was received in response to the notice of the petition, from Fiat Auto U.S.A., Inc. (Fiat), the United States representative of Ferrari. In its comment, Fiat stated that Ferrari, and other companies within the Fiat Group, have invested considerable resources in the design and production of vehicles that comply with the Federal motor vehicle safety standards. Although it stated that it has not determined what modifications are necessary to bring a vehicle into compliance with the Federal safety standards, Fiat contended that it is not possible to achieve such compliance by simply retrofitting a vehicle built for the European market, without conducting extensive development and testing. NHTSA accorded Champagne an opportunity to respond to Fiat's comment. In its response, Champagne stated that the entire passive restraint system that it proposes to install in the non-U.S. certified 1992 Ferrari 348TB, including the control unit and the wiring harness, is available from Ferrari in kit form. Champagne further stated that it is simple to install this equipment because all mounting points are supplied on the non-U.S. certified vehicle. As they have been performed with relative ease on thousands of vehicles imported over the years, none of the other modifications described in the petition would preclude NHTSA from determining that the non-U.S. certified 1992 Ferrari 348TB is eligible for importation. NHTSA has accordingly decided to grant the petition. Vehicle Eligibility Number for Subject Vehicles The importer of a vehicle admissible under any final decision must indicate on the form HS&hyph;7 accompanying entry the appropriate vehicle eligibility number indicating that the vehicle is eligible for entry. VSP 86 is the vehicle eligibility number assigned to vehicles admissible under this decision. Final Determination Accordingly, on the basis of the foregoing, NHTSA hereby decides that a 1992 Ferrari 348TB not originally manufactured to comply with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards is substantially similar to a 1992 Ferrari 348TB originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the United States and certified under 49 U.S.C. 30115, and is capable of being readily altered to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards. Authority: 49 U.S.C. 30141(a)(10(A) and (b)(1); 49 CFR 593.8; delegations of authority at 49 CFR 1.50 and 501.8. Issued on: December 13, 1994. William A. Boehly, Associate Administrator for Enforcement. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;31014 Filed 12&hyph;15&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;59&hyph;M
