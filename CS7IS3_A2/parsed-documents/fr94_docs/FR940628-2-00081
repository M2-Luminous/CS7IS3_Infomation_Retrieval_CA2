FR940628-2-00081 FR940628-2-00065 Timing of Disclosure Several commenters questioned the proposed Policy's timing for required financial disclosures. Seven believed the required certifications and/or disclosures should be made at the time of an award, not when the proposal is submitted, and one suggested that institutional review take place within 90 days of submission of the grant proposal to NSF. Two commenters believed the proposed Policy required grantee institutions to collect financial disclosures on a periodic basis, and also prior to the submission of each grant proposal. These commenters felt the two requirements might be inconsistent. In order to provide the required certifications, institutions will have to collect all required disclosures and resolve actual or potential conflicts prior to the time an award is funded. In addition, the final Policy requires that, during the pendency of any NSF award, institutions either solicit financial disclosures on an annual basis or require updates as investigators obtain new reportable financial interests. Overly General and/or Ambiguous Terms Some commenters were troubled by the proposed Policy's lack of definitions for various terms, including ``entrepreneurial venture'', ``significant financial ties'', ``significant conflict of interest'', ``routine small holdings'', ``direct relevance'', ``directly and significantly'', ``immediate family'', ``close business associate'', ``adequate enforcement mechanisms'', ``professional employee'' and ``relevant consulting arrangements''. These terms were left undefined in the proposed Policy so that institutions would be able to tailor definitions and conflicts policies to the particular conditions existing on their campuses. This remains NSF's basic philosophy, but the final Policy provides more guidance on the types of financial interests that must be disclosed, the types that need not be disclosed, and the individuals who must make financial disclosures. Contents of Institutional Conflict of Interest Policies A few commenters believe institutions should establish conflict of interest policies, but that NSF should not prescribe the details of those policies. Three suggested that NSF establish ``outcome'' or ``performance'' criteria for institutional disclosure policies, rather than requiring disclosure of specific categories of financial interests. NSF agrees that institutions should have some latitude to develop policies that fit local circumstances. For this reason, NSF's Policy requires institutions to solicit financial disclosures, but does not prohibit any particular financial interest or mandate specific rules for managing conflicts of interest. NSF believes that its system, in which institutions will have primary responsibility for collecting and reviewing financial disclosures, establishes the minimum requirements necessary to protect the integrity of NSF-funded research. Scope of Required Disclosure Most commenters agree that limited and targeted financial disclosure is a cornerstone of an effective conflict of interest policy. However, many believe the proposed Policy required more information than was necessary to effectively manage actual and potential conflicts of interest, and some suggested that disclosure be required only where financial ties are directly related to NSF-supported research. Two commenters from state institutions in Connecticut believe that their local Freedom of Information Act will essentially make these disclosures public information. NSF has narrowed the Policy's disclosure requirements so that they now apply only to those individuals who are responsible for the design, conduct or reporting of research or educational activities funded or proposed for funding by NSF. In addition, the categories of disclosable financial interests have been limited to so that they now must relate to research funded or proposed for funding by NSF.
