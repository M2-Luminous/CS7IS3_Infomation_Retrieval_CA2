Au Ka-lun reports. [Begin recording] [Au] This is the largest-ever crackdown on pirated CD's in Guangdong. Various quarters at the provincial and city levels have launched joint operations and raids in Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and Shantou. In six shops in Guangzhou alone, they seized more than 70 boxes containing over 10,000 pirated CD's. In Zhuhai, the operations involved over 500 people, who raided shops in the vicinity of Gongbei and seized 30,000 pirated audio-visual products. In Shenzhen, the operations are still continuing today. Inspection personnel inspected the shops near the railway station and seized nearly 30,000 pirated CD's and nearly 20,000 video tapes. What deterrent effect are the large-scale operations having? We find that, despite the inspections which have just ended, some shops are still selling their stuff. [Au] It is still possible to buy these two pirated CD's featuring Hong Kong singers for 15 yuan a piece in Shenzhen today. The shopkeeper admits that the CD's are pirated. [First unidentified shopkeeper] I don't think I am going to sell this stuff any more after all the CD's have been sold. [Au] Why? [First shopkeeper] If the pirated stuff is banned, I am not going to sell it. [Au] Near the railway station, we find the racks at some shops frequented by Hong Kong customers almost empty. But a shopkeeper is placing pirated CD's on them and says he will continue to sell all that he has in stock. [Second unidentified shopkeeper] No, I am not going to start selling again. Almost all the CD's have been seized. How can anyone sell them? [Au] With the recent operations on pirated CD's, some shops have switched to selling genuine CD's, which cost 100 yuan or more each. Shenzhen Vice Mayor (Li Ronggen) has said that Shenzhen will continue to crack down on pirated audio-visual products and will protect the interests of legitimate businessmen. Au Ka-lun, TVB.
