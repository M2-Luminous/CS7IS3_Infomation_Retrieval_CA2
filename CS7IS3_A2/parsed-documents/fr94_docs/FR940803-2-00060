FR940803-2-00060 FR940803-2-00050 NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION [Docket No. 50&hyph;285] Omaha Public Power District, Fort Calhoun Station, Unit No. 1; Environmental Assessment and Finding of Significant Impact The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR 50.36a(a)(2) regarding submission of the report of annual radioactive liquid and gaseous effluents released to unrestricted areas during the previous calendar year to the Omaha Public Power District (OPPD/the licensee), for the Fort Calhoun Station, Unit No. 1, located in Washington County, Nebraska. Environmental Assessment Identification of Proposed Action The proposed action would exempt the licensee from the filing time requirements of 10 CFR 50.36a(a)(2) regarding the submission of the report of annual radioactive liquid and gaseous effluents released to unrestricted areas during the previous calendar year. By letter dated May 25, 1994, the licensee requested an exemption from 10 CFR 50.36a(a)(2) to allow the licensee to change the date specified in the technical specifications for submitting this report from March 1 to before May 1, starting in 1995. These reports are required by 10 CFR 50.36a(a)(2) to be submitted at intervals no greater than 12 months. Because of the change, the interval between the 1994 and the 1995 reports will be greater than 12 months. The Need for the Proposed Action The proposed exemption is needed to allow the licensee to implement the new requirements of the draft Generic Letter regarding the new 10 CFR part 20 into its Technical Specification (TS) 5.9.4.a. The previous TS 5.9.4.a was based on the old requirement that the report be submitted within 60 days after January 1 of each year (March 1). Approval of the new TS will require this one time exemption to change the date of submission from March 1 to any date prior to May 1. This exemption will not affect the information required to be submitted for the time period the report covers (the previous calendar year's data); only the date the report is to be submitted would be changed. Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action Our evaluation of the proposed exemption from 10 CFR 50.36a(a)(2) indicates that the granting of the exemption will not affect the information required to be submitted or the time period the report covers. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no measurable radiological or non-radiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed exemption. Alternatives to the Proposed Action Since the Commission has concluded there is no measurable environmental impact associated with the proposed exemption, any alternatives will have either no environmental impact or will have a greater environmental impact. The principal alternative would be to deny the requested exemption. This would not reduce the environmental impacts attributed to this facility and would result in precluding the licensee from changing its TS to be consistent with the new 10 CFR part 20. Alternate Use of Resources This action does not involve the use of any resources not previously considered in the Final Environmental Statement (FES) for the Fort Calhoun Station, Unit No. 1, dated August 1972. Agencies and Persons Consulted The NRC staff reviewed the licensee's request and consulted with the Nebraska State official. The State official had no comments regarding the NRC's proposed action. Findings of No Significant Impact The NRC staff has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed exemption. Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, the staff concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment. For further details with respect to this action, see the request for exemption dated May 25, 1994, which is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555 and at the Local Public Document Room located at the W. Dale Clark Library, 215 South 15th Street, Omaha, Nebraska 68102. Dated at Rockville, Maryland this 27th day of July 1994. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Theodore R. Quay, Director, Project Directorate IV&hyph;2, Division of Reactor Projects III/IV, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation.
