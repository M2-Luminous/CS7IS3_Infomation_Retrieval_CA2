Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Krylov told Interfax Tuesday that neither Russia nor Ukraine wanted it. It his view, things have to be sorted out. "We must find out who is guilty and of what and not allow the incident to grow in scale," Krylov said. He said that he had been in Kiev Monday where he had met fairly well-informed Ukrainian Foreign Ministry and Defense Ministry officials. He said it was difficult to make out a clear picture of what had happened. In his words, some its aspects were incomprehensible and unpleasant and some people involved in it were reportedly drunk and that nobody had authorized them to do what they did. Krylov thought that the incident happened between various branches of the Navy and had to be resolved by them. He recalled that the fleet was under joint command of two presidents. The original cause of the conflict was that some navigational instruments were moved from one Ukrainian port to another. They were to remain the property of the same navy, Krylov believed. The whole story was probably the fault of sailors who have now to settle the conflict, he said. Krylov thought that Ukraine was least of all interested in perpetuating the incident when its new parliament had not even started work. Such incidents would inflame the Ukrainian radicals and this would destabilize the situation, Krylov thought. He believed that there were numerous hotheads in Russia, too. In his view, there was no need to add to tensions. He did not agree that the Russo-Ukrainian relations were increasingly deadlocked. He believed that both Russians and Ukrainians had a fairly clear idea of what they wanted from each other but their good intentions were not easy to materialize. Domestic factors had a significant role to play in this. Because Ukraine's new parliament had not even been convened, the executive branch was to some extent inactive, Krylov said. Krylov thought that such incidents would inflame Ukrainian radicals and could further destabilize the situation. He emphasized that Russia regarded the Crimea as part of Ukraine but did not shut the door on economic and cultural links with the Crimea.
