The country has the right to know the name of the DEA director, where his office is, who his immediate aides are, and, above all, demand that his investigative methods abide by the country's current juridical order. But nothing like that happens. In the eyes of the Bolivian people, the DEA is a mysterious and clandestine organization. Not even the chief of its national counterpart -- the FELCN [Special Antinarcotics Force] -- gave the name of the individual responsible for that organization. It has been learned that the DEA uses methods of intimidation and control over telephone lines, and through them control over private conversations. It has "safe houses" where, according to reiterated denunciations, physical and psychological torture are used to get the testimony of those under arrest, and where it can arrest any citizen going over judicial formalities. We know the DEA has the delicate mission of fighting drug trafficking, and because drug trafficking is a clandestine and illegal activity, its operations and personnel must be protected with some degree of confidentiality. The National Police and the FELCN also have that mission but their chiefs show their faces because their task is legal, and any action they commit is subject to the judgment of the people and the verdict of judicial officials. The methods used by the DEA in its operations are very different. To start with, as more than one Bolivian jurist said, that foreign organization uses methods that, if legal in its country, are not in our country. Kidnapping, for example, which according to the U.S. Supreme Court is admissible in some cases, continues to be prohibited in our legislation and is considered a crime even if the reason is to fight another crime. The same situation is valid for the presumption of innocence, which is the basic principle sustained in our entire juridical structure in contrast to the presumption of guilt used by that organization. Another aspect that needs rectification is the one used by the DEA that consists of offering all types of rewards -- including reduction of sentence or acquittal -- if a witness offers testimony or evidence against another. Our juridical system rejects this method, and it is against our tradition and convictions. If this method is used in more developed countries than ours it is their responsibility, but we don't have to accept it. What exists in essence is what the president of the Republic dramatically stated in his latest public speech, when he said our dependency is "terrible." And it is precisely that adjective that makes it intolerable because dependency in the broad sense exists in any country in the world, including the United States, which in some way "depends" commercially on Japan. But we cannot continue widening that gap; we should reduce it, and any effort in this regard deserves the support of all the people. Therefore, it would be good for a branch like the legislative to thoroughly investigate the activities of that foreign agency, and to put it under strict legality with the possibility of annulling the agreement that authorized its presence in the country. If political organizations and the media provide full support, this will no longer be a utopian situation.
