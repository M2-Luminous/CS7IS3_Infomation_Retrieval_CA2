Drafting Information The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Jonathan Epstein, Project Manager, Office of Navigation Safety and Waterway Services, and Ms. Helen Boutrous, Project Counsel, Office of Chief Counsel. Background and Purpose The Inland Navigation Rules and the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (72 COLREGS) provide Rules governing all vessels on inland waters and on the high seas, respectively. In order to maintain consistency between the 72 COLREGS and the Inland Navigation Rules, the Coast Guard is proposing to revise certain technical rules to conform with amendments to the 72 COLREGS scheduled to become effective in November 1995. The Coast Guard anticipates that these proposed revisions, if adopted, would also become effective November 1995 to coincide with the effective date of the COLREGS amendments. In no case would the amendments become effective before November, 1995.
