Social democrat Dagys said the motives for rejecting income declaration were the same as in the case when a law on illegally acquired money during the introduction of the litas was vetoed. The lawmaker said the president's step may be regarded as concessions to financial groups that evade taxes and fear that the true, "as if social democratic," nature of state authorities would be revealed. In Dagys' words, the ruling Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party "no longer follows social democratic principles." He said the fact is exposed by attempts to push through an amendment to the law on collective conflicts that would ban strikes in the systems of interior affairs, state defense, public transport, energy and health care. Dagys said he participated as a guest in a conference of Nordic social democratic parties and the governing committee of labor unions. The conference discussed preparations for a long instability period in Russia, he said. The lawmaker told reporters that Nordic social democrats seek to implement the idea of cooperation in the Baltic sea region. "This would be a possibility to protect our interests if a threat from the East appears."
