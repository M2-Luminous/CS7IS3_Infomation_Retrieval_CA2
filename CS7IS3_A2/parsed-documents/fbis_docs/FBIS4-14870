A representative of the Republic's Foreign Ministry, answering questions today from a correspondent of KCNA, the official North Korean news agency, pointed out that "we make a positive assessment of the fact that Russia opposes sanctions and pressure and intends to find a solution to the problem around the political consultation table. But we are concerned that Russia's proposal for multilateral negotiations may complicate the problem."
