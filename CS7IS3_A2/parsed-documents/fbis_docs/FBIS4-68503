The plant has been designed by a consortium of three Finnish firms: Ematran Voima, Polar and Siemens. Pile driving work is now going on at the site. The plant's first power bloc of 450 milliwatts will be ready at the end of 1996 and the second should come on line two years later. Then the Russian side will build two analagous blocs with its own resources. The Russians will be able to pay for delivery of western equipment with electric power which will be delivered to Finland for a sum of two billion Finnmarks. St. Petersburg's power system requires 30 percent repair in the coming years. Two blocs of the Sosnovyy Bor nuclear power plant will be shut down in the year 2000. St. Petersburg is competely supplied with electric power but there is not enough for heating. Construction of a steam electric power plant for the expanding northwestern region of the city will be a rational solution to this problem.
