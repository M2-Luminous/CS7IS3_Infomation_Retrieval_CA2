The Swedes were on their way to Tuzla when they were stopped and landmines were placed around them. The nightmare in the intensifying conflict in Bosnia in the last few days has been that in retaliation for the UN calling for help from NATO planes or in revenge for the UN losing its neutrality and taking the Muslim side -- in the view of the Serbs -- the Serbs will deliberately start pointing their rifles at the UN peacekeepers. And now it has happened: 13 Swedish UN soldiers and two Norwegians are being held prisoner for the third day at the Koviljaca road block northeast of Sarajevo on the normal route to the main Swedish base in Tuzla. This information came just after 2100 from the AFP news agency and it was later confirmed by the leaders of the battalion. According to the same source, the Swedes are trapped behind landmines. The Swedes were driving a convoy of six vehicles carrying essential supplies to the Swedish bases when they were stopped for what was called administrative reasons on Sunday afternoon. A few hours later the first aerial attack took place which was to force the Serbs to ease the pressure on the encircled Muslim enclave of Gorazde. The Serbian soldiers then placed landmines around the Swedes and their vehicles. In the war in Bosnia, UN soldiers of all nationalities are living dangerously, but generally they have been able to avoid harassment or acts of war deliberately directed at them. The situation of the Swedes, however, is not so precarious. The leaders of the battalion are hoping to send other soldiers tomorrow, so that the soldiers, who are virtually imprisoned, can be replaced.
