A mission official said the information became known after the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported to the U.N. Security Council, explaining that "the council's quick adoption of a presidential statement reflects the urgent state caused by North Korea's fast refueling of the nuclear reactor." Referring to IAEA Director-general Hans Blix's letter on May 27 to U.N. Secretary-general Butrus Butrus-Ghali, the official noted that "only two days remained for that opportunity." In the letter, Blix said that if North Korea continued removing fuel at the present pace, the chances for selecting, segregating and storing the discharged rods for later IAEA measurement would be lost in a few days. Accordingly, the North Korean nuclear crisis is expected to reach a critical stage in the middle of this week. It is also anticipated that the Security Council would take follow-up action such as adopting a resolution warning of economic sanctions if Pyongyang continued discharging the fuel rods.
