After returning to the United States, he talked on the telephone with President Clinton and met with relevant senior U.S. officials in order to brief them about his visit to the Korean peninsula. This time, Mr. Carter promoted an exchange of opinions between the DPRK, the United States, and the ROK on the nuclear issue, and his mediation activity was fruitful and has eased the tense situation on the Korean peninsula to a certain degree. In the recent period, the situation on the Korean peninsula became tense due to the nuclear issue. In particular, after the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] adopted a resolution to impose sanctions against the DPRK on 10 June and the DPRK announced its withdrawal from the IAEA on 13 June, dialogue between the various parties concerned on the nuclear issue in the DPRK was suspended, and the situation on the Korean peninsula was strained further. The United States and some other countries intensively planned to push the UN Security Council to pass a resolution on imposing sanctions against the DPRK. The U.S. and ROK armed forces carried out exercises and deployed "Patriot" missiles. The DPRK also issued repeated statements, saying that sanctions in any form would be regarded as an act of war against the DPRK. At this moment, Carter was invited to visit the Korean peninsula. Although it was just a private visit, it still attracted extensive attention from the international community. Before visiting the DPRK, Carter first visited the ROK and held a meeting with President Kim Yong-sam. In Pyongyang, he met President Kim Il-song twice, and the two talked for a long time. After leaving the DPRK, Carter once again visited the ROK and conveyed a message from President Kim Il-song to President Kim Yong-sam. Carter's mediation has achieved positive results: the DPRK allowed IAEA inspectors and monitoring equipment to remain in the DPRK, and agreed that the United States should send personnel to help the DPRK search for the remains of American soldiers killed in the Korean war. President Kim Il-song also expressed willingness to unconditionally meet with President Kim Yong-sam at any time and in any place. The ROK gave a positive reaction to this, and proposed that the two sides hold a meeting of deputy premiers on 26 June in Panmunjom to make preparations for the first summit meeting between the leaders of the south and the north, which will be an important event on the Korean Peninsula and will promote the peaceful settlement of the Korean nuclear issue and regional stability. After returning to the United States, Carter talked on the telephone with President Clinton, and then told the press that "the crisis was over." He also said that efforts made by the United States to impose sanctions against the DPRK would "just delay and hold up the diplomatic actions." Although the White House expressed "prudent optimism" about Carter's visit to the DPRK, it still "greatly appreciated the former president's benign efforts." All international opinion valued highly Mr. Carter's trip to the Korean peninsula. His mediating activities once again show that dialogue is better than confrontation and that continuing to seek political settlement is more favorable to the settlement of differences than recklessly imposing sanctions and exerting pressure. People believe that through further dialogue, the relevant parties involved in the Korean issue will certainly be able to find a way to settle the issue peacefully and will eventually realize the two objectives of making the Korean peninsula a nuclear-free zone and safeguarding the stability on the Korean peninsula.
