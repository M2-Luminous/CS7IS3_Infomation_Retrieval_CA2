Senior Western officials, the paper writes, have done nothing to resolve the situation in Bosnia. Western rhetoric is nothing but a half-hearted attempt to justify a situation that is only as disgraceful as it is untenable, the paper states. The tragedy in Bosnia-Herzegovina proves that the United Nations is no improvement on the League of Nations. Actually, it is even more impotent than the defunct league. The United Nations may have 180 members and a charter that endows it with powers the League of Nations never had, but its never assumes these powers except to satisfy the desires of some of the major powers.
