In the meeting, both of them stressed the common interests the two countries have in global, regional, and bilateral matters, Christopher told a press conference, which was held here today at the end of his four-day official visit to China. "He (Qian) stressed, as I had, that China wants a broad and solid relationship with the United States," Christopher said. "In an overall sense, I find the differences between China and the U.S. are narrowing somewhat," he added. He noted that China and the United States concluded here this morning the statement on cooperation in implementing the memorandum of understanding on prohibiting import and export trade in prison labor products. In addition to the human rights and most-favored-nation issues, he and Qian also discussed a number of other matters, including regional security matters, the forthcoming APEC conference, various trade issues, defense conversion and other military issues, Christopher said.
