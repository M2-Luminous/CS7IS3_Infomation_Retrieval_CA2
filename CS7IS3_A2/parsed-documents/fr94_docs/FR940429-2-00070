FR940429-2-00070 FR940429-2-00060 [TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,442] Simmons Upholstered Furniture, Inc., Vancouver, WA; Negative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration By an application dated March 22, 1994, the workers requested administrative reconsideration of the subject petition for trade adjustment assistance (TAA). The certification notice was published in the Federal Register on March 18, 1994 (59 FR 12984). Pursuant to 29 CFR 90.18(c) reconsideration may be granted under the following circumstances: (1) If it appears on the basis of facts not previously considered that the determination complained of was erroneous; (2) If it appears that the determination complained of was based on a mistake in the determination of facts not previously considered; or (3) If in the opinion of the Certifying Officer, a misinterpretation of facts or of the law justified reconsideration of the decision. The investigation files show that the workers produced upholstered furniture; however, only the workers involved in sewing and cushion filling activities met the worker group eligibility requirements necessary for certification. Its stated that workers engaged in framing, cutting and upholstering were impacted by foreign imports as much as those included in the certification_workers in sewing and cushion filling activities. Other investigation findings show that all the cutting and upholstery operations were transferred to another domestic plant and that the framing and distribution activities would remain at Vancouver. A domestic shift of production would not form a basis for a worker group certification. Conclusion After review of the application and investigative findings, I conclude that there has been no error or misinterpretation of the law or of the facts which would justify reconsideration of the Department of Labor's prior decision. Accordingly, the application is denied. Signed at Washington, DC, this 18th day of April 1994. Robert O. Deslongchamps, Director, Office of Legislation & Actuarial Service, Unemployment Insurance Service. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;10276 Filed 4&hyph;28&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4510&hyph;30&hyph;M
