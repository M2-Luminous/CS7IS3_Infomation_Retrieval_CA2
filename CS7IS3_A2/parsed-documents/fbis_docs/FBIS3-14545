Dr. Beilin hoped these points would not delay or obstruct the negotiations and said substantive issues have been resolved. What remains, he said, are quantitative and numerical issues such as the size of the police force, including the Palestinian police force and international observers. He expressed his conviction that when the matter is related to quantitative and numerical issues, it will be easier to reach an agreement. He hoped that negotiations on the Gaza and Jericho agreement will also begin tomorrow and that this issue will be dealt with quickly. Regarding the phased settlement in Gaza and Jericho, Dr. Beilin said the issue of the number of Palestinian police and that of coordination and understanding between them on the one hand, and the Israeli police and Army on the other, are still unresolved. This is one of the issues to be discussed in connection with the phased settlement just like the economic issues. As for security arrangements in Hebron, talk is revolving around small and limited numbers of Palestinian policemen, and this continues to be the main topic of disagreement. Naturally, the deputy foreign minister said, there are no difficult substantive issue in connection with the issue of Hebron or even the Gaza and Jericho agreement. Asked whether the deployment of a Palestinian force is the necessary step now to maintain security in Hebron or if it is related to a step toward the Palestinian side aimed at supporting the position of the Palestinian leadership and consequently restoring the previous momentum of the negotiations, Dr. Beilin said: I think this step is symbolic. Moreover, I do not belittle such symbols. I do not think that those policemen are the perfect solution for the present security problem. I am aware of the problem between the settlers and Palestinians in the territories. But, it is important to demonstrate here that we are alert to what happened in the aftermath of the massacre in Hebron. We, too, do not overlook the dimensions of this action and we are ready to undertake an unusual action. Talk is about a Palestinian force in Hebron and an international presence. We have not planned for this happening before a comprehensive agreement is reached. Replying to another question, Dr. Beilin did not want to discuss proposals about rounding up Jewish settlers in one or two locations in Hebron to prevent friction and maintain the security of both sides. He said the security authorities will find the right answer to these issues. Asked about the way the decisionmakers in Jerusalem view the situation of the present Palestinian leadership as a leadership to which one can talk in the future when a final solution is reached, and the extent of the Palestinian leadership's ability to make crucial decisions under critical circumstances like the present ones, the deputy foreign minister said: I do not want to discuss details of the final solution or the nature of the political solution to the Palestine question although you know how firmly I support a solution based on a confederation between the Palestinians and Jordan. I am following what is taking place in the Palestinian camp and I must in this regard say that I was not taken by surprise. Everyone knew that at a decisive moment there would be a difficult confrontation within this camp. We have never thought that once a settlement is reached or a solution between us and the Palestinians gets closer, all the Palestinians will clap in support of the realistic current within the PLO. Undoubtedly, I am aware of the difficulties facing this current or trend in implementing its policy. But, I also believe that this current will emerge from this process stronger and firmer. When a change occurs on the ground and when the Palestinian police force is deployed in Gaza and Jericho, and in case autonomy is established--which will enjoy economic and practical ability and authority--this current or main party within the Palestinian camp will get stronger. During his conversation with us, Dr. Beilin expressed concern over the phenomenon of extremism and the violation of law by certain factions living at the margin of the Israeli society. He said he never thought such a phenomena exist, particularly in this magnitude. He indicated that the decisions made by the government proved that the Israeli Government has realized the characteristics and dangers of the new situation after the Hebron massacre and acted accordingly. In light of the good chances that economic talks between Israel and the Palestinians, which started in Paris on the Palestinian customs system, will resume in Cairo tomorrow, we asked Dr. Beilin about the economic future of Israel and the Palestinians and whether the two economies should be disengaged. He said: Had it been up to me and were it possible to start right from the beginning, I would have certainly been inclined to disengagement on the economic level between us and the territories. Today, we cannot seriously talk about this because the territories connection with Israel and vice versa is extremely big and because the Palestinians depend mainly on us. If we close the borders between the territories, or the autonomous areas and Israel, it would mean thousands of Palestinians would not be able to work in Israel and would face unemployment problems. This would undoubtedly be immediately reflected in the living standards in the autonomous Palestinian areas. Therefore, although I wish to see economic and political disengagement between the two sides, I know this is not realistic and we have to continue the present situation, but perhaps on a narrower scale. Finally, we asked Dr. Beilin about talks with Syria and the U.S. role in healing the rift between the two sides, as well as bringing solutions closer to reality, he said: The Americans returned from Syria, encouraged by Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad's readiness to push forward the peace process. I also hope that negotiations with Syria will resume in the second half of April. I hope the Americans will intensify their efforts because I do not envisage any progress with Syria without intensive U.S. intervention. Moreover, the prospects of reaching an agreement with Syria in 1994 are still realistic and possible.
