The Spokesman of the Royal Thai Army Colonel Phalangkun Klahan has made it clear that the Thai Government and the Royal Thai Army have always respected the UN resolution on the political solution to the war in Cambodia. The spokesman said the Royal Thai Army has not banned site inspections by foreign diplomats at any time. He added the Royal Thai Army has provided humanitarian aid to displaced Cambodians who fled from the fighting into Thailand and that the army did not forcibly repatriate those Cambodians. It is the Cambodian Government's responsibility to take care of its people affected by civil war or those who are displaced in their own country.
