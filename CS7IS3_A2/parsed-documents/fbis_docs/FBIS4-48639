FBIS4-48639 "drafr100_c_94010" FBIS-AFR-94-100 Daily Report 24 May 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Schedule of Parliament Sittings Announced Schedule of Parliament Sittings Announced MB2405101994 Johannesburg SAPA in English 0935 GMT 24 May 94 MB2405101994 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [By Pierre Claassen, political correspondent] [Text] Cape Town May 24 SAPA -- Parliament will adjourn for almost a month at the end of this week following a three-day debate on the state president's opening speech on Tuesday. Nonetheless, various committees will start with open sittings soon to consider legislation due to be tabled for debate immediately after Parliament reconvenes for the budget on June 22. Parliament will then be in session for little over two weeks during which it will debate the budget before once more going into recess for the July winter holidays. The budget vote committee stage will commence once Parliament reconvenes in August. This unusual programme underscores the clear break with past parliamentary schedules while upholding the practice of breaking for the winter recess. According to government and parliamentary sources, debates on the new government's first legislation are due to start the day after Finance Minister Derek Keys introduces his 1994/95 budget. The budget will be referred to committee for the required seven-day "sweat" period immediately after being introduced. Then the National Assembly will start considering other legislation. The Senate, empowered to review legislation passed by the National Assembly, will in all probability start debating bills a day later. It is uncertain when the Constitutional Assembly (the National Assembly and Senate sitting jointly) will convene for its first working plenary. These sittings are expected to be rare and primarily aimed at ratifying work agreed to by a number of specialised committees to be set up within the next week or so. Officials said on Tuesday there was some urgency to get the committees functioning to prepare enough work for Parliament to continue sitting until the budget debate itself started. This would require enough legislation to occupy the house for little over a week. The various committees will now function in open session as opposed to the closed-door deliberations which characterised law-making in the past. The public and press will now have direct access to debates on bills unless a committee chooses to go into closed session.
