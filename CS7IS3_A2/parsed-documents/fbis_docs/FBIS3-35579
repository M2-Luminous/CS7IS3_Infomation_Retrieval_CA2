"The references to General Staff issue numbers, the publication date of the document, and the Defense Ministry form are not valid," the general said, "and only a very gullible and incompetent person could be taken in by them, not a professional." "I have before me," Kolesnikov said, "a list of all the Russian General Staff and Defense Ministry index numbers we put on our working documents. Those named by the weekly are not on it. The letters "SM" were part of the old USSR Council of Ministers index nunmber, but it was abolished in 1991, and I do not know what these letters mean now. As for the Defense Ministry form, it is clearly a forgery. The form is no big secret, so the document could have been easily put together on a computer or photocopied. At the same time, Kolesnikov said, our documents are not stamped "top secret." But perhaps this is not a very accurate translation. Furthermore: Under the general staff there is no Military-Strategic Analysis Center, which allegedly prepared the "report." But the most important thing is the lies in the body of the report. "I cannot say anything about the scientists, since we do not keep track of where they go and why, it is not our concern and not our headache," Kolesnikov said, "but the claim that Pyongyang has one or two nuclear warheads and several more will come off the conveyor belt by the end of this year is total rubbish. I can definitely say that the DPRK does not have any of this. Neither does it have the mythical missiles such as Nodong-1 and Nodong-2 and several hundred other nuclear warhead delivery vehicles." Incidentally, the Russian chief of general staff said, we received several South Korean military delegations last year. They talked of their anxiety about DPRK military might, about their suspicions that it was working on something, but there was no mention of the "facts" presented by the Japanese weekly in any discussion with serious-minded people. Evidently they knew that they did not exist. I feel sorry for the Japanese journalists and their publication, Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov said. Perhaps they were simply taken in by the forgery when it was slipped under their door. But such, it seems, is the public state of mind in Japan that they will believe any claptrap about Russia, its General Staff, and Armed forces. A pity.
