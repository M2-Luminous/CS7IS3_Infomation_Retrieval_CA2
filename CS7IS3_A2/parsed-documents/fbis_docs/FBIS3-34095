He said that his optimism is based on the developments that took place between the two sides in November 1993 when Iraq approved Resolution 715. He said: My feeling is that we have started well and that progress has been made. He said that his talks with Iraqi officials will deal with political and technical issues, including the application of long-term monitoring, which is related to Resolution 715. He said: For our part, we will explain the situation at the UN Security Council as well as the prospects for development and progress. Our hope is to make progress as soon as possible so that the committee would be able to submit its report to the UN Security Council and so that it would be able to affirm that Iraq has honored its obligations. Thus, we can do something to pressure the UN Security Council to take the necessary measures to lift the oil embargo against Iraq. He explained that his visit to Iraq is part of the dialogue that started in July 1993 and to maintain the momentum of the positive developments that have been realized. In response to a question on the duration of his visit to Baghdad, Ekeus said: This depends on the talks that we will hold with the Iraqi side. He said: The talks will certainly cover the issue of lifting the embargo against Iraq, but I cannot make any comments because the process is continuing and we hope that it will become more extensive. The delegation includes John Scott, the committee's legal adviser; Tim Terevan [name as received], the committee spokesman; and Maurizio Zifferero, deputy chairman of the International Atomic Energy Agency. The first session of talks will begin at the Foreign Ministry at 2000 today.
