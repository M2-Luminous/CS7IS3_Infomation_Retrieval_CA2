The woman was killed when shooting broke out between NP and African National Congress [ANC] supporters at an NP rally.

He was granted bail and released. [passage omitted] Minister of Law and Order Hernus Kriel said that unless the ANC took immediate and credible steps to control its supporters, South Africa's first democratic elections were in danger of degenerating into bloody chaos. In a statement, Mr Kriel said the intimidation and violence of especially ANC supporters was already extensively hindering free political activity. "The ANC's persistent refusal to discipline its violent supporters has created the potential for widespread violence wherever other political parties seek to exercise their right to free political activity," Mr Kriel said.
