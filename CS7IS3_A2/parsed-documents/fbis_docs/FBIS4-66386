The joint funding approach has been undertaken to facilitate the prioritization of allocating important national S&T resources, promote closer ties between basic and applied research, enhance national economic construction, and to accelerate development and conversion of basic research results. The NSFC and 20 other related departments including the Ministry of Construction and the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources, provinces, municipalities and industries have cooperated in funding 262 projects, with 9.777 million yuan coming from NSFC and 7.445 million yuan from the other participants. This cooperation effort has resulted in a marked improvement in S&T research, an increase in the number of qualified S&T personnel, and the promotion of high-tech industry growth. According to statistics, 19 of the `Seventh 5-Year Plan' and the `Eighth 5-Year Plan' key projects are funded jointly, with a total amount of 51.43 million yuan coming from the participants; and the `Eighth 5-Year Plan' key S&T projects were also supported by 5.7 million yuan of joint funding. The joint funding effort also worked successfully from collaboration with the State key laboratories and the State open laboratories on S&T research projects. In 1992, 62 of the 186 NSFC-supported projects, which received a total funding of more than 95 million yuan, had close ties with the State key laboratories, and 37 of them were linked to the open laboratories. Meanwhile, the NSFC is also encouraging the research institutes and industries, and also colleges, universities and industries to apply for joint fundings for their research projects for the purpose of bringing industries, institutes, and universities closer. The NSFC has also been very successful in promoting other multi-channel fundings through international cooperation. For example, on 28 October 1993, the NSFC signed a `Ford-China Research and Development Foundation Agreement' with U.S. Ford Motor Company to initiate the international cooperation. Furthermore, the NSFC is exploring other cooperative channels with the local governments to promote S&T progress and to foster training of qualified S&T personnel. Presently the NSFC is establishing the `Zhongmi S&T Revitalization Foundation' with the Mi County of Henan Province. Zhang Cunhao [1728 1317 3185], Chairman of NSFC, pointed out that in order to promote ties between S&T and national economy to a new level, the NSFC is planning a new joint research project to cover all industries, universities, and research institutes under this joint funding program.
