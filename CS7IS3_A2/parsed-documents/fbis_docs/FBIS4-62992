Ahtisaari's meeting with group of Russian journalists; date and place not given: "Martti Ahtisaari: Finland Could Become Russia's Nearest Outlet To Europe. The New Finnish President's First Official Visit to Moscow Begins Today" -- first three paragraphs are introduction] [Text] On the eve of his visit to Moscow President Martti Ahtisaari met with a group of Russian journalists. During the conversation he gave his assessment of the current state of Russian-Finnish relations and shared his vision of their future, and answered questions, including those posed by ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI. In particular, describing the current phase of Russian-Finnish relations, Martti Ahtisaari said that he considers them to be exceptionally good, and hopes that his forthcoming visit will promote their further development. In addition, Martti Ahtisaari expressed the hope that, as a result of his forthcoming meetings in Moscow, he will be able to deepen his understanding of the processes which are taking place in the social, economic, and political life of Russia. The meeting with President Martti Ahtisaari left an impression of him as a calm, balanced person, that is to say the classic model of the Nordic person. At the same time his manner of speaking reveals the experienced diplomat. He undertook to answer all the questions posed directly, but to some of them he gave only pointers, leaving the interlocutor himself the right to draw conclusions. [Question] Are there any unresolved problems between Russia and Finland? In particular, is the so-called "Karelian question" pertinent? [Ahtisaari] It all depends on what we mean when posing it. In may view, it is above all a question of developing relations between Finland and the Republic of Karelia as adjacent regions of two countries, and we could have a lengthy conversation on this subject. On the whole I would describe the problems which exist as natural ones for partners, that is to say, they are the sort of problems which arise to confront the sides, to be solved as their cooperation develops. For example, questions connected with the need to open new border-crossing points require constant negotiations at various levels of state power. But we have no problems that could be called insoluble. [Question] How do you see the main, priority avenues of economic cooperation between Russian and Finland in the light of the fact that Finland, all the signs suggest, is going to join the European Union? [Ahtisaari] Last year was marked by the exceptionally favorable development of trade relations between our countries. Exports from Russia increased by one-third, and Finnish imports almost doubled. In addition, there was a significant broadening of the range of goods. The latest customs department statistics testify that this trend in trade development is continuing in the current year. In my view, this means that Finnish and Russian enterprises have found one another. I think -- and this finds confirmation in the trade statistics -- that we have already reached the end of the initial learning curve, which is necessary for the transition from state jurisdiction over foreign trade to the establishment of foreign trade at the level of enterprises. Hence it is no accident that there is no shortage of business representatives in the delegation which is coming with me to Moscow. As for Finland's future of as regards the EU, the question of EU entry will be finally settled -- positively, I hope -- during a referendum on this question in the fall. I believe that even bigger opportunities for extending and deepening cooperation between our countries open up as a result of our probable entry into that organization. If Finland becomes an EU member, it will be Russia's nearest outlet to the European market. I hope that we Finns will be able to use our "know-how," our experience of conducting business with Russians, for the further development and stimulation of cooperation in new conditions. [Question] What can you say about the current state of cooperation between adjacent regions? [Ahtisaari] Finland's cooperation with St. Petersburg, Leningrad Oblast, the Republic of Karelia, and Murmansk Oblast has already outgrown the framework of the interstate protocol, and it is frequently impossible to keep up with the speed of developing cooperation. This is just as it should be between neighbors, and here the main thing is that state organs manage to create the prerequisites for further cooperation at the level of enterprises and firms. However, despite the scale of the market between adjacent territories, Finland's interests extend further. The Finnish economy contains priority sectors whose achievements can be used far more extensively. I have in mind the timber and paper-making industries, ship building, electronics, chemicals, and other sectors. I believe that cooperation in these sectors could be of interest not just to nearby regions. [Question] Finland and Russia are neighboring countries; what happens in Russia is not a matter of indifference here. How will events in Russia develop, in your view? [Ahtisaari] I would be pleased to answer that question after the end of my visit, but I will try to give you my impressions right now. Russia has a material base in the shape of vast natural resources, and this is a basis for the development of the economy. As for sociopolitical development, this is always a complex process, especially in periods of radical change. For example, unemployment in Finland currently stands at almost 500,000, and this is painfully reflected in society. It is very important that Russia undertakes a search for paths of accord in order to maintain stability in society. As neighbors, we follow Russia's efforts to transform its country with great sympathy. Therefore, within the limits of our existing resources, we would like to take part in this process. It is important that cooperation develops in all areas of vital activity. In this respect it is gratifying that lively, active relations have been established between Finnish parliamentarians and the deputies of Russia's revived Duma; also pleasing is the growing cooperation between the governments of our countries. I hope that all this will enable our peoples to respond properly to the challenge of the times.
