In Uruguay, we have for many years supported a midpoint policy, that is, agreement with our two large neighbors -- with the active participation of Bolivia and Paraguay -- to transform the River Plate Basin into a geopolitical structure, allowing Uruguay to assume its role as the River Plate Basin's export gate. Uruguay has been described as a "hinge," a country in the lower abdomen of South America that may be the most effective renderer of services and may demonstrate competitive advantages over its huge neighbors -- Brazil and Argentina. Within the integration drive, Argentina has bilateral and quadrilateral relations. Bilaterally, we have our economic agreements, our political agreements on border cooperation, our joint River Plate statute, the common River Plate seashore since 1974, our Uruguay River with its dams and bridges that involve every aspect of integration -- physical, transportation, and electric power integration. This is complemented by trade integration. In our opinion, integration involves bilateral agreements, basically through Mercosur [Common Market of the South]. This shows that both Uruguay and Argentina must gradually meet the other partners within a strategy that will allow us to increase understanding rather than misunderstanding, increase complementation rather than disagreement, and increase competitiveness rather than exclusion from participation in our joint efforts. This integration involves complementation not subordination. This is the idea we are promoting. With this idea of bilateral projects, complemented by quadrilateral projects and a hemispheric projection, we began to increase the dynamics of our relationship in issues involving common interests, especially the River Plate. Uruguay has specifically established as a priority the dredging of the Martin Garcia Channel. Why? Because it involves active participation in a common river, because it increases the dynamics of rendering services in the River Plate Basin area, and because it confirms the legal obligations of the five countries that make up the Waterway Treaty. This treaty has yet to be implemented. It has been partially approved in Argentina and Brazil. Private and public sectors are already developing a number of initiatives and projects, clearly showing the implementation of the enterprise. Bearing in mind the waterway project, we consider the Martin Garcia Channel and the reactivation of Nueva Palmira, the waterway terminal, to be a priority. The waterway project is not just of interest to Uruguay. It is important and we wanted to mention it the way we explained it to Argentina. Not just Uruguay, or Nueva Palmira, or navigation linked to Uruguay's interests will benefit. The idea is a better rendering of services in the field of river transportation, involving maintenance costs, transportation costs, and enhanced navigation security. It involves a more effective rendering of services that will allow increased demand, both in quantity and in quality. This point was raised by Uruguay. Therefore, Uruguay considers the Martin Garcia issue a priority in its geopolitical stance. We experienced problems, comings and goings, and tense negotiations for many months prior to the exchange of notes in June 1993 and now the signing of notes, calling the bid and the filing of specifications for the Martin Garcia channel dredging and the commencement of this project by the end of the year. We also have the management of common resources, like the common fishing zones and everything pertaining to fishing policy with Argentina. Uruguay is experiencing a special situation; through a fishing agreement that was signed a few days ago it is now forbidden to catch medium-size hake in this zone so as not to plunder this resource which migrates south and which has been exploited by Argentina and by the EU. All this has been raised by Uruguay, with concern, firmly, but respectfully because these are common resources that must be managed. We have raised these issues at the United Nations, the EU, and at the bilateral level. We have the river transportation system, in which we must define how the flag system will operate in the bilateral area; we also have the passenger transportation system, which is important for Uruguay, for which we sought and found the solution that was signed with Argentina on 3 June. We have a river transportation system in which a long-standing disagreement between two ways of thinking is going to be resolved. This issue is also linked to the Uruguay River's navigability. This is another aspect of our border cooperation policy, and we must remember that our borders with Argentina involve rivers. The situation is not like that with Brazil, with which we do not share any navigable rivers, and this gives rise to other dynamics and a different situation. With Argentina, we share a river that unites us, supplies us with resources, and allows us to cooperate in the fields of transportation of merchandise and passengers; tourism, which today represents Uruguay's main source of foreign exchange; and energy production. Salto Grande is one of the most important hydroelectric power plants in the region. It involves production, sale, coordination, and cooperation in the energy field between the two countries. The river will consolidate our cooperation and the supply of joint services. The Uruguay River and the Salto Grande project involve water and energy. Navigability of the Uruguay River is important because it serves as an outlet for distant export centers in Argentina and in Uruguay. Nueva Palmira is the last stop along the Paraguay-Parana waterway, a project that involves five nations. Dredging the Martin Garcia Channel is a contribution to navigation safety and modernization. Another joint effort involves the river transportation of passengers using a clear flagging system. Fishing is a very important resource for the country. The preservation of the environment, particularly the ocean front, concerns the entire world, not just our two countries. These projects involve joint efforts by both countries and the search for common elements for cooperation. These common aspects are characteristics of a more interdependent and global world where nationalities consolidate and project themselves into integration and cooperation projects. The old system of isolating nationalism is being replaced by a dynamic nationalism involving cooperation and coordination. The true expression of nationalism for our peoples will be prosperity. This prosperity should not be an expression of egoism, it should be an expression of coordination and reciprocal concessions for our mutual benefit. This is the model of our relations with Argentina. We talk about the issue at all forums when we refer to subregional or regional aspects. But we also have a hemispheric projection. Our geopolitical relations involve Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, and Chile. It is a trade integration plan that assumes integration and openness are compatible. We suggest an administrated openness in which Mercosur acts as the cornerstone of production and integration. When we ask Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay to consolidate this effort, to respect our obligations, and to advance, it is because we believe in the process. It is precisely through credibility that we will strengthen our internal relations. We know integration in general is full of unfulfilled goals, but we do not want this. We are sometimes confronted with problems that place national interests against group interests. In this case it is more important to stress the national interest even though the group will have difficulties, because this is the only way to maintain credibility and respectability. Consistency, openness, and professional attitudes are the three pillars of our foreign policies. We project them in our bilateral relations with Argentina and we project them in our multilateral relations through Mercosur. [passage omitted] We also project ourselves politically into our hemisphere, in a world with a single world power. We have dynamic relations with the United States. We want to integrate gradually with them economically, through Mercosur. But we also want the United States to become integrated into a more balanced concept of international law, particularly in aspects that are important to us, like the new concept of hemispheric security. Uruguay and Argentina have expressed their desire that nonintervention, self determination, and peaceful solutions to controversies should become unchangeable principles. We believe these principles should be established tenets, not because we are conservatives but because they represent the essence of respect for countries' identity and a valuable tool in handling political relations between stronger and weaker nations. Uruguay, we have always said, is geographically, militarily, and economically a lot smaller than Argentina or Brazil. But the principle of the sovereign equality of nations makes us as strong as any other nation at the time of defending those principles. We want to see great caution regarding hemispheric security so as to avoid being the instrument of other country's policies. This is very important because it gives us credibility and respectability. We handle these issues with clarity and frankness and the Argentine Government understands and accepts our position. All these elements show Uruguay is integrating its foreign policy and has privileged bilateral relations with Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay through Mercosur. Uruguay is also integrating its policies with the Southern Cone, and naturally with Chile. There has been a qualitative change in our relations with Argentina over the past few months. Difficulties are being gradually solved with a lot of flexibility. This quality has its maximum expression in the Argentine president and the Argentine Foreign Ministry. They have a vision like that of former Argentine President Juan Domingo Peron when we signed the Rio de La Plata Borders Treaty which, beyond any doubt, contributed greatly to the juridical security of our relations. It created the idea that we should share a resource that belongs to both countries, setting aside the idea that the stronger party is always right. [passage omitted] Integration today is the projection of the idea and the thought that our participation is not done in detriment of our identity, but precisely to strengthen it. The fact that we are working on integration projects--including some project that might have an importance beyond our borders--does not mean we are losing our Uruguayan nationalism. Our origin, and the effects of our culture, family, education -- and even the strategic projection of our future -- are reflected in our reality. Europe, the continent that bestowed upon us a series of positive cultural elements and even religious traditions, is very distant when we begin to discuss trade interests. When we defended Uruguayan interests during the GATT round we realized that European interests, not solidarity with Latin America, always prevailed. That is their legitimate right and their legitimate position. When we defend our positions we must place limits on our romantic ideas and emotional reactions. This is why we view the region and our relations with Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Bolivia as our great priority. We are a region, a subregion, with the same origin, feelings, and interests. These three elements unite us. Regrettably, the intensity of these feelings is sometimes used by groups that seek privileges. These elements must by administered by governments, the people, and by those interests. The short-term success of those interests usually means the defeat of medium-term state positions and strategies.
