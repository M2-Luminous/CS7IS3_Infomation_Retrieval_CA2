The particulars are: 1. In the case of cotton farmers, the system of fixed quota purchases by contract shall be continued. Uniform purchases of the cotton designated in the contracts shall still be effected by the supply and marketing cooperatives (in districts with fertile land and abundant harvests purchases may be entrusted to the processing plants for improved varieties of cotton) and there would be no harm in actually opening cotton markets. This year's plan provides for 2.2 million mu of cotton acreage for the entire province, with a the responsibility to buy a fixed quota of 2.2 million dan. 2. According to a decision by the state council, Sichuan province will again raise the purchasing price for cotton, namely for each 50 kg of standard grade (grade 3, 27 millimeters) ginned cotton, last year's price of 330 yuan is raised to 400 yuan. Price differentials for different grades are also adjusted and raised by 6 yuan. 3. Redemption of [above-norm production] bonus sales of chemical fertilizer and diesel oil shall be effected according to the differential between parity prices and negotiated prices, that is, with each purchase of 50 kg of ginned cotton an allowance of 14 yuan shall be paid as differential between parity prices and negotiated prices of chemical fertilizer and diesel oil. 4. The provincial government has decided to continue to uphold the cotton support policy; for each 50 kg of grade 1 to 4 ginned cotton purchased, a subsidy of 15 yuan shall be paid by the provincial treasury. 5. Cotton that was grown without having been included in the plan shall be fixed up within the provincial plan and shall be treated equally without discrimination with regard to applicability of policies. 6. The provincial finance administration's cotton support policy for cotton farmers with regard to plastic mulch film shall remain unchanged. The Sichuan provincial party committee and the provincial government also asked the banks, supply marketing cooperatives, and other such agencies to ensure availability of funds needed for cotton production and to ensure supply of agricultural means of production. The official agricultural agencies must conscientiously and effectively survey and report plant diseases and insect pests and undertake preventive and curative action. They must perfect the establishment of bases for the growing of high-quality cotton. The provincial party committee and the provincial government ask all localities to exert efforts to fulfill and overfulfill the cotton quota procurement tasks of the province, so as to raise Sichuan's cotton production from out of its low state and to make increased production and increased income a reality.
