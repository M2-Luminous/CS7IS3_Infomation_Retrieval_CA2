FR941003-2-00079 FR941003-2-00046 To prevent transients that would produce pressure excursions exceeding the Appendix G P/T limits while the reactor is operating at low temperatures, the licensee installed an LTOP system. The LTOP system includes pressure relieving devices in the form of Power-Operated Relief Valves (PORVs) that are set at a pressure low enough that if a transient occurred while the coolant temperature is below the LTOP enabling temperature, they would prevent the pressure on the reactor vessel from exceeding the Appendix G P/T limits. To prevent these valves from lifting as a result of normal operating pressure surges (e.g., reactor coolant pump starting, and shifting operating charging pumps) with the reactor coolant system in a water solid condition, the operating pressure must be maintained below the PORV setpoint. In addition, in order to prevent cavitation of a reactor coolant pump, the operator must maintain a differential pressure across the reactor coolant pump seals. Hence, the licensee must operate the plant in a pressure window that is defined as the difference between the minimum required pressure to start a reactor coolant pump and the operating margin to prevent lifting of the PORVs due to normal operating pressure surges. The licensee LTOP analysis indicates that using the Appendix G safety margins to determine the PORV setpoint would result in a pressure setpoint within its operating window, but there would be no margin for normal operating pressure surges. Therefore, operating with these limits could result in the lifting of the PORVs and cavitation of the reactor coolant pumps during normal operation. Therefore, the licensee proposed that in determining the PORV setpoint for LTOP events for McGuire, the allowable pressure be determined using the safety margins developed in an alternate methodology in lieu of the safety margins required by Appendix G to 10 CFR Part 50. The alternate methodology is consistent with ASME Code Case N&hyph;514. The content of this code case has been incorporated into Appendix G of Section XI of the ASME Code and published in the 1993 Addenda to Section XI. An exemption from 10 CFR 50.60 is required to use the alternate methodology for calculating the maximum allowable pressure for LTOP considerations. By application dated June 28, as supplemented August 18, 1994 (and further clarified by letter dated September 7, 1994), the licensee requested an exemption from 10 CFR 50.60. Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action The Commission has completed its evaluation of the licensee's application. Appendix G of the ASME Code requires that the P/T limits be calculated: (a) Using a safety factor of 2 on the principal membrane (pressure) stresses, (b) assuming a flaw at the surface with a depth of one-quarter (1/4) of the vessel wall thickness and a length of six (6) times its depth, and (c) using a conservative fracture toughness curve that is based on the lower bound of static, dynamic, and crack arrest fracture toughness tests on material similar to the McGuire reactor vessel material. In determining the PORV setpoint for LTOP events, the licensee proposed to use safety margins based on an alternate methodology consistent with the proposed ASME Code Case N&hyph;514 guidelines. The ASME Code Case N&hyph;514 allows determination of the setpoint for LTOP events such that the maximum pressure in the vessel would not exceed 110 percent of the P/T limits of the existing ASME Appendix G. This results in a safety factor of 1.8 on the principal membrane stresses. All other factors, including assumed flaw size and fracture toughness, remain the same. Although this methodology would reduce the safety factor on the principal membrane stresses, use of the proposed criteria will provide adequate margins of safety to the reactor vessel during LTOP transients. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that this proposed action would result in no significant radiological environmental impact. With regard to potential non-radiological impacts, the proposed change involves use of more realistic safety margins for determining the PORV setpoint during LTOP events. It does not affect non-radiological plant effluents and has no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant non-radiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed exemption. Alternative to the Proposed Action As an alternative to the proposed action, the staff considered denial of the proposed action. Denial of the application would result in no change in current environmental impacts. The environmental impacts of the proposed action and the alternative action are similar. Alternative Use of Resources This action did not involve the use of any resources not previously considered in the Final Environmental Statements related to operation of the McGuire Nuclear Station, dated April 1976, and its addendum dated January 1981. Agencies and Persons Consulted The NRC staff consulted with the state of Tennessee regarding the environmental impact of the proposed action. The state official had no comments. Finding of no Significant Impact The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed exemption. Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment. For further details with respect to this action, see the request for exemption dated June 28, as supplemented August 18, 1994 (and further clarified by letter dated September 7, 1994), which is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC and at the local public document room located at the Atkins Library, University of North Carolina, Charlotte (UNCC Station), North Carolina 28223.
