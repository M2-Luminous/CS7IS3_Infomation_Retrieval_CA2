FR940830-1-00080 FR940830-1-00012 S1. Purpose and Scope. This standard specifies requirements for door locks and door retention components including latches, hinges, and other supporting means, to minimize the likelihood of occupants being thrown from the vehicle as a result of impact. S2. Application. This standard applies to passenger cars, multipurpose passenger vehicles, and trucks. S3. Definitions. Back door means a door or door system on the back end of a vehicle through which passengers can enter or depart the vehicle, or cargo can be loaded or unloaded. Fork-bolt means the part of the door latch that engages the striker when in a latched position. Fork-bolt opening means the direction opposite to that in which the striker enters to engage the fork-bolt. * * * * * S4. Requirements. Components on any side door leading directly into a compartment that contains one or more seating accommodations, and components on any back door of a passenger car or multipurpose passenger vehicle with a gross vehicle weight rating of less than 4,536 kilograms (10,000 pounds), shall conform to this standard. However, components on folding doors, roll-up doors, doors that are designed to be easily attached to or removed from motor vehicles manufactured for operation without doors, and doors which are equipped with wheelchair lifts and which are linked to an alarm system consisting of either a flashing visible signal located in the driver's compartment or an alarm audible to the driver which is activated when the door is open, need not conform to this standard. S4.1. Hinged Side Doors, Except Cargo-Type Doors. * * * * * S4.2. Hinged Cargo-Type Side Doors. * * * * * S4.3. Sliding Side Doors. * * * * * S4.4. Hinged Back Doors. S4.4.1. Door Latches. Each door latch and striker assembly shall be provided with two positions consisting of_ (a) A fully latched position; and (b) A secondary latched position. S4.4.1.1 Load Test One. The door latch and striker assembly, when in the fully latched position, shall not separate when a load of 11,000 Newtons (2,500 pounds) is applied in the direction perpendicular to the face of the latch such that the latch and the striker anchorage are not compressed against each other. When in the secondary locked position, the door latch and striker assembly shall not separate when a load of 4,450 Newtons (1,000 pounds) is applied in the same direction. S4.4.1.2 Load Test Two. The door latch and striker assembly, when in the fully latched position, shall not separate when a load of 8,900 Newtons (2,000 pounds) is applied in the direction of the fork-bolt opening and parallel to the face of the latch. Figure 1 depicts the loading direction for this test. When in the secondary latched position, the door latch and striker assembly shall not separate when a load of 4,450 Newtons (1,000 pounds) is applied in the same direction. S4.4.1.3 Load Test Three. The door latch on doors that open upward shall not disengage from the fully latched position when a load of 8,900 Newtons (2,000 pounds) is applied in a direction orthogonal to the directions specified in S4.4.1.1 and S4.4.1.2 above. S4.4.1.4 Inertia load. The door latch shall not disengage from the fully latched position when an inertia load of 30g is applied to the door latch system (including the latch and its actuating mechanism with the locking mechanism disengaged) in any direction. S4.4.2 Door Locks. Each door shall be equipped with a locking mechanism with an operating means in the interior of the vehicle. When the locking mechanism is engaged, both the outside and inside door handles or other latch release controls shall be inoperative. S4.4.3 Door Hinges. S4.4.3.1 Load Test One. Each door hinge system shall support the door and shall not separate when a load of 11,000 Newtons (2,500 pounds) is applied perpendicular to the hinge face plate such that the hinge plates are not compressed against each other. S4.4.3.2 Load Test Two. Each door hinge system shall not separate when a load of 8,900 Newtons (2,000 pounds) is applied perpendicular to the axis of the hinge pin and parallel to the hinge face plate such that the hinge plates are not compressed against each other. S4.4.3.3 Load Test Three. Each door hinge on doors that open upward shall not separate when a load of 8,900 Newtons (2,000 pounds) is applied in the direction of the axis of the hinge pin. S4.5 Sliding Back Doors. The track and slide combination or other supporting means for each sliding door shall not separate when a total longitudinal load of 17,800 Newtons (4,000 pounds) is applied, with the door in the closed position. * * * * * S5.1 Hinged Side Doors, Except Cargo-Type Doors. * * * * * S5.2 Hinged Side Cargo-Type Doors. * * * * * S5.3 Sliding Side Doors. * * * * * S5.4 Hinged Back Doors. S5.4.1 Door Latches.
