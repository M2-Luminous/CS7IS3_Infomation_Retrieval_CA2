The chemicals are used in the refinement of oil used by Jordan. The Jordanian Government has submitted a report showing the kind of materials exported, the license plate numbers of trucks that transported them, and the dates of export. The U.S. measure is meant to increase pressure on Jordan by propagating rumors that Jordan is not complying with the embargo against Iraq. The purpose is to force the Jordanian Government to conclude a treaty with Israel before discussing its details. Observers note that the United States wants to give the world the impression that Jordan is smuggling on the official level. Knowledgeable sources say Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali might sacrifice Finance Minister Sami Qammuh -- since Qammuh was the one who issued the export approvals -- in a bid to convince the United States that Qammuh acted on his own without consulting the government.
