SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act) requires that each Regional Fishery Management Council submit any FMP or FMP amendment it prepares to the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) for review and approval, disapproval, or partial disapproval. The Magnuson Act also requires that the Secretary, upon receiving an FMP or amendment, immediately publish a notice that the FMP or amendment is available for public review and comment. The Secretary will consider the public comments received during the comment period in determining whether to approve the FMP or amendment. Amendment 2 would establish the Norton Sound Section of the Northern District of the king crab fishery as a superexclusive registration area. The operator of any vessel registered and participating in this fishery would not be able to register that vessel and participate in other BSAI king crab fisheries. A proposed rule has been submitted that would remove existing regulations, which supersede State of Alaska regulations that established Norton Sound as a superexclusive registration area in the exclusive economic zone of the BSAI.
