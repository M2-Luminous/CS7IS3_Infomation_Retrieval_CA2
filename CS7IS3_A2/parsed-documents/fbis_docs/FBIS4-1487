FBIS4-1487 "drafr083_cs94011" FBIS-AFR-94-083-S Daily Report 28 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA ANC, IFP Trade Charges of Election Irregularities ANC, IFP Trade Charges of Election Irregularities IFP's Ziba Comments on Problems MB2804204094 Johannesburg SABC TV 1 Network in English 1645 GMT 28 Apr 94 MB2804204094 Johannesburg SABC TV 1 Network English BFN [News conference by IFP spokesperson Ziba Jiyane and unidentified party official; place not given -- live] [Text] [Jiyane] Many of the problems experienced yesterday are continuing today, in fact, even worse problems have been reported by our informants on the ground in the whole process of elections. Now, the most disturbing thing about this is that in many areas we continue to have ballots without IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] stickers being used in the vote, and we understand that there is now tremendous pressure being put by some political parties to cause the IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] to accept these as valid, and we have said from the beginning if anything could really threaten this whole election process it would exactly be that -- to count ballots without IFP stickers. Now, nonapplication of IFP stickers in many areas has happened even today in areas like Chatsworth, Mtubatuba, Newlands West, Glenhills School, Zilungisele School, Nomhlebe Preschool, plus more than 17 others. Voting continued in all of them without IFP stickers and of course late opening of the stations continued to be a problem today, and shortages of supplies was a problem today, now polling stations on the IEC list which have not yet been opened at all, are such as the eight stations around Vryheid. We were told that these will be remedied by Judge Kriegler yesterday, and we have seen the situation deteriorating today. But you see, ladies and gentlemen, we are more troubled by the fact that of the more than 20 million missing ballot papers we have now more and more evidence that certain political parties have possession of this. We have heard reports from KwaMashu that people were given ballot papers with IEC stickers at the back, which were already marked ANC. Now this happened in an area called (Amatikwe). Voters were given two or three ballot papers for national and provincial lists. Now, we also have here in our possession something signed by police which has been distributed all over the country, of evidence of many ballots that were distributed, around which have the clear marking of the ANC votes. These have been distributed and the police have alerted us here and all over the country. These were used in PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging]. Now, we just received also a message here as you saw me entering, reading it from Gerrie Beetge, who is an informant who will...[pauses] from an informant will not reveal his or her name, told Gerrie Beetge, that last night at the Nasrec [National Exhibition Center] stadium -- counting 34 polling station ballots in Soweto, Johannesburg, people opened boxes and removed the IFP sticker and replaced it with others. Today there are no IEC officials at the stadium and the IFP banners, etcetera, have been ripped off. Now this happened at Nasrec stadium -- now, in 34 polling stations in that area. We have evidence that the missing ballots are in the hands of certain political parties, because where else would they get he ballots with IFP stamped at the back and giving these to people on the queue, who in a station near Ntuzuma were not even inked, because the presiding officer allowed this despite protestations from our party agents. I was first pleased to hear that Judge Kriegler has indicated that he has raised the issue of extending the election time to tomorrow because if that did not happen that would be a serious infringement of thousands of people's right to vote. It would effectively disenfranchise thousands of voters, in particular, in northern Zululand -- in northern Natal. Now I don't know if my colleague here will add other...Lastly, I would like you to also be informed of this because the real problem, the main problem today is the evidence that is coming in that the missing ballots are actually in the hands of certain parties, and so far the only evidence we have is that the ANC -- because including this ballot paper which the police has been warning us about, has possession of many ballot papers. Now, there is a case, a serious case here also, with an affidavit in front of me here, which is still being investigated by the police, of what happened yesterday at 7 PM, Ntuzuma court, where people had to guard the ballot boxes. An Isuzu was seen full of ballot boxes, and its registration number was NU136960. It looked suspicious to the people there, and the cap of the Isuzu was white and the back was black. People were afraid and they approached this vehicle because there were too man people in the area and many cars parked behind the bakkie [pickup truck]. The Isuzu van was then moved outside the gate of this court. Furthermore, three women arrived carrying ballot boxes into Ntuzuma court, without any guards and were not marked with IEC identification. What struck us was that this truck was open without a canopy and nobody was looking after the boxes. We then rushed to the nearest police station in order to report this incident. The police opened a report, OB1680. Now, this is a common thing now, that lastly, besides this particular case of Isuzu, we have received at least three reports of people saying that private ANC cars, in particular, have been seen carrying away ballot boxes to destinations not known. [IFP official] At the heart of the election campaign we noticed a government or a ZP vehicle which was in our yard here and was loading posters, and there were press people taking photographs, and within a couple of minutes we had been alerted by people in Ulundi that ZP and ZG number plates had been stolen from government vehicles and these same number plates appeared suddenly at the information center and there were a lot of press around taking photographs of these...I'm sure quite legitimately, because there were large numbers of pressmen here all the time, but I mean obviously it's very damaging, that it just goes to show that this...what in fact was happening, those numbers were stolen and in fact they used some vehicles that were driven into our information center, loaded up with IFP stickers, in order to try and create the impression that in fact government and KwaZulu Police transport was being used to transport IFP election material, and I'm afraid propaganda put out by Mr. Ramaphosa today is exactly the same thing. We have personally checked and you are welcome to go and check. Those officials will categorically deny that that ever took place. It's just sheer propaganda. [Jiyane] ANC, in particular, are panicking. The reason why Ramaphosa has come out with such a diatribe on national television is because they see the tremendous amount of support that the IFP seems to be getting through these votes. The long lines in northern Natal for example, are IFP. In fact, all that he has alleged are things which are done by the ANC here. The party agents of the IFP are being intimidated by ANC people, and as you will all know, the IEC staff that are mostly presiding officers and others, do not include IFP people, because IFP entered late. The people who are intimidating party agents there are ANC partisan officers, as well as thugs who come, like the thugs who came to KwaMashu to threaten old people there, but we are confident that the IFP, if this election has any semblance of freeness and fairness, the IFP will win by a wide margin here.
