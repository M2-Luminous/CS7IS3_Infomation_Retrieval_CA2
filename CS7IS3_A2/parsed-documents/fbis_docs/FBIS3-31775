"According to coordinates given by Gen. Angus Ramsey, UNPROFOR's chief of staff for former Bosnia-Herzegovina, it is clear that this attack launched from antiaircraft weapons could have not been launched by the Srpska republic army," Milovanovic said. UNPROFOR said that the attack took place at the village of Ribnica (coordinates 9010), four kms northeast of Kakanj; the nearest Serb position is 22 kms as the crow flies, he stressed. "Despite indisputable facts, Gen. Ramsey threatened on several occasions last night and yesterday that he would personally authorize NATO air strikes on Serbs," Gen. Milovanovic said. However, he added, Gen. Michael Rose, commander of UNPROFOR in former Bosnia-Herzegovina, reacted adequately and demanded a detailed investigation of yesterday's incident. "I am certain that the investigation will confirm that the Serb side did not fire on the Swedes," Milovanovic said. [passage omitted]
