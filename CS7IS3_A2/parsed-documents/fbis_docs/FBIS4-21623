On average, the number of problems and accidents per plant in operation stood at a low of 0.3 for the year. There were 46 nuclear power plants in operation in 1993. The ministry's Agency of Natural Resources and Energy is required to report all serious incidents under the electricity enterprises act. MITI also listed seven instances of less serious problems that are by law not required to be reported. Breaking down serious accidents, agency officials said there were 10 cases in which reactors were shut down manually and seven instances in which damage was found during periodic reactor checks. There were no reported automatic shutdowns, in which the emergency core cooling system shuts down the reactor, the most important safety mechanism to prevent nuclear accidents. The officials also said operating rates for the nation's nuclear power plants averaged 75.4 percent in fiscal 1993 ended on March 31. It was the 11th straight year the average operating rate topped the 70 percent mark.
