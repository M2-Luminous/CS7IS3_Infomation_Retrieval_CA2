A high-ranking official at the Russian Foreign Ministry who refused to be identified, told ITAR-TASS on Friday that "the Vorontsov-Lavrov link continues to operate". Lavrov is now in New York. Talks that Lavrov may replace Vorontsov at his post, started last year for the first time. Lavrov's possible appointment will complete a series of planned reshuffling among Russian leading ambassadors. Russian First Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoliy Adamishin will evidently replace Boris Pankin in London while Vorontsov will most likely go to Washington to occupy the post held by Vladimir Lukin, the present chairman of lower house Committee on International Affairs.
