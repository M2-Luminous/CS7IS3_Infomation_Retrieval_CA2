SUMMARY: This notice announces the acceptance, under Notice 89&hyph;61, 1989&hyph;1 C.B. 717, of petitions requesting that epichlorohydrin and allyl chloride be added to the list of taxable substances in section 4672(a)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Publication of this notice is in compliance with Notice 89&hyph;61. This is not a determination that the list of taxable substances should be modified. DATES: Written comments and requests for a public hearing relating to these petitions must be received by May 13, 1994. Any modification of the list of taxable substances based upon this petition would be effective October 1, 1992. ADDRESSES: Send comments and requests for a public hearing to: Internal Revenue Service, P.O. Box 7604, Ben Franklin Station, Washington, DC 20044 (Attn: CC:DOM:CORP:T:R (Petition), room 5228). FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Tyrone J. Montague, Office of Assistant Chief Counsel (Passthroughs and Special Industries), (202) 622&hyph;3130 (not a toll-free number). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The petitions were received on November 21, 1991 (epichlorohydrin) and December 6, 1991 (allyl chloride). The petitioner is Dow Chemical Company a manufacturer and exporter of these substances. The following is a summary of the information contained in the petitions. The complete petitions are available in the Internal Revenue Service Freedom of Information Reading Room. Epichlorohydrin HTS number: 2910.30.00.00 CAS number: 106&hyph;89&hyph;8 This substance is derived from the taxable chemicals propylene, chlorine, and sodium hydroxide. Epichlorohydrin is a liquid produced predominantly by the chlorohydration of allyl chloride, which is obtained by chlorination of propylene, followed by the hydrochlorination of the formed dichlorohydrin. The stoichiometric material consumption formula for this substance is: C 3 H 6 (propylene) + 2 Cl 2 (chlorine) + NaOH (sodium hydroxide)__> C 3 H 5 ClO (epichlorohydrin)+2 HCl (hydrogen chloride) + NaCl (sodium chloride) According to the petition, taxable chemicals constitute 100 per cent by weight of the materials used to produce this substance. The rate of tax for this substance would be $8.58 per ton. This is based upon a conversion factor for propylene of 0.61, a conversion factor for chlorine of 1.98, and a conversion factor for sodium hydroxide of 0.96. Allyl chloride HTS number: 2903.29.00.00 CAS number: 107&hyph;05&hyph;1 This substance is derived from the taxable chemicals propylene and chlorine. Allyl chloride is a liquid produced predominantly by noncatalytic flow-pressure, high temperature chlorination of propylene. The stoichiometric material consumption formula for this substance is: C 3 H 6 (propylene) + Cl 2 (chlorine) __> C 3 H 5 Cl (allyl chloride) + HCl (hydrogen chloride) According to the petition, taxable chemicals constitute 100 per cent by weight of the materials used to produce this substance. The rate of tax for this substance would be $6.45 per ton. This is based upon a conversion factor for propylene of 0.66 and a conversion factor for chlorine of 1.20. Dale D.
