According to him, the offer for Slovenia to actively participate in the NATO security concept is very advantageous and at the moment, the optimum opportunity. Partnership for Peace provides Slovenia with the equal initial conditions that other European countries have. However, it is up to Slovenia to decide how it will join the partnership. According to the prime minister, what is important for us is to cooperate on drafting defense concepts. We also have the opportunity to hold consultations if our security is endangered. It is also important that the document has particularly presented the concept of the so-called clear defense -- in fact, defense that is under the complete control of civilian politics. Regarding relations with Croatia, our government does not want to bring the events connected with Croatia's debts to the Krsko nuclear power plant to the state level. The government is convinced that Croatia has to settle its liabilities for the electricity that belongs to it and that this is a matter of usual business relations. The prime minister expects that this, as well as other open questions between the two states, will be solved soon at the meeting with Croatian Prime Minister Nikica Valentic, which is to be held in Ljubljana next Tuesday, 25 January. The meeting should be a new stage in our relations. However, we cannot guarantee that, he said, even though Slovenia is interested in solving all disputed questions and in not having mutual relations become aggravated. The Piran Bay border will be, according to Dr. Drnovsek, one of the most difficult problems in the negotiations. [Drnovsek] The Slovene stands in this respect are clear and proceed from our sovereignty. The Croatian views, however, about the Piran Bay have so far been somewhat different. The way in which this issue will be solved depends on how all the other problems are solved. Regarding the nuclear power plant's debts, the government expects the Croatian side to begin settling the debts. In case this does not happen, some technical measures are already being prepared in the nuclear power plant, but this may not be necessary. Slovenia will also guarantee the rights that ensue from the Croatian share in the nuclear power plant. Dr. Drnovsek also touched upon the decision that Slovenia will no longer directly pay part of the debts of the former Yugoslavia to the group of commercial banks until an agreement is reached on the division of these liabilities. There is still no reaction on the part of the creditors to the Slovene decision. Our side expects this decision to speed up negotiations and that the (?solidarity) clause and the freezing of assets of the receiver of the loans will not be implemented. According to Dr. Drnovsek, the decision will not affect the promised loans that Slovenia, among others, should receive from the World Bank. Regarding this year's budget, the prime minister said that the government will submit the document to the parliamentary procedure within the next 10 days. The deputies should adopt it at a session in March. The government will continue the present orientations concerning the volume of the budget, which should not exceed 402 billion [currency not specified], Prime Minister Drnovsek said. The coalition partners should coordinate all key questions before the parliamentary debate. For example, the coalition will try to agree, among other things, on the fact that all [word indistinct] funds will come within the framework of the budget. [Drnovsek] Concerning money for gasoline, the Army, and education, it is important that solutions be coordinated within that joint framework of 402 billion. It is in this direction that we seek coordination, which means that funds earmarked for defense, for example, should not exceed the funds for education and that the education funds should not, conditionally speaking, exceed the Army funds. These are two spheres, and there are also other ones, but there should be a rational solution available that is reasonable and which can be argued for and put into the framework of these 402 billion. Regarding the social agreement on the basis of which all partners, including the trade unions, will accept their share of responsibility for Slovenia's future, the prime minister said that in case the social agreement is not adopted, the government will adopt the appropriate measures -- above all, on the regulation of wages. According to him, administrative measures will not be involved, but the paying of wages will be regulated by law as it is regulated by the current collective agreement. [Word indistinct] of the mentioned wages is fatal for the Slovene economy and could lead to its bankruptcy, said the prime minister. The government will wait for the decision by the coalition partners for approximately two more weeks. Let us also mention that the Association of the Free Trade Unions yesterday rejected the draft social agreement. Dr. Drnovsek comments on that decision: [Drnovsek] If it is true that this is their response, then what I just said also holds. The real assessment is that a social agreement is not possible at this time, that obviously not all partners are ready, that some of the partners are not ready to accept responsibility or cannot accept the responsibility ensuing from such an agreement. In that case, all this responsibility would have to be taken over by the government, along with all the difficulties that would ensue from that.
