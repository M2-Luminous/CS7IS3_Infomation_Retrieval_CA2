He said he is the victim of machinations aimed at preventing him from becoming the possible president of the Senate office. Sen. Dupiton demanded overt evidence of his participation in any plot aimed at physically eliminating Mr. Izmery. Let us listen to the report by Daly Valet. [Begin recording] [Valet] "On Saturday, 11 September 1993, at 0925, several armed civilians burst into the Sacred Heart Church in Turgeau where a mass was being celebrated to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the Saint-Jean Bosco slaughter that caused the deaths of 13 people in 1988. [passage omitted] ``During this news conference, Sen. Dupiton presented himself as innocent, having had nothing to do with Antoine Izmery's assassination. Sen. Dupiton accused Sen. Rony Mondestin of participating in a plot that he said the United Nations is hatching against him. ``Furthermore, Sen. Dupiton insisted that Sen. Mondestin provide an explanation regarding the assassination attempt on Sen. Raoul Remy, [who was shot three times in Cap-Haitien]. According to Dupiton, Sen. Mondestin had threatened him, so he is the chief plotter. All of these things will come to an end, he said, because Colin Granderson must provide an explanation of the UN report involving me in the assassination of Antoine Izmery. These were Sen. Dupiton's statements.'' [Dupiton] I am speaking of Sen. Rony Mondestin, who was identified by Sen. Raoul Remy as the one responsible for the attempt on his life because Remy identified Mondestin's driver and because Sen. Rony Mondestin had threatened the senator here during a session, in the presence of the assembly of senators. "He had told him: I will get you in Cap-Haitien; I will get you in Cap-Haitien [repeats]; I will settle my disputes with you when I get to Cap-Haitien. Well, you see that Remy fell when he arrived in Cap-Haitien. Of course, Remy accused him personally, and all the documents were brought to me as president of the justice commission. Since then, he decided to give me a hard time. But this matter will come to an end because the United Nations must now explain where this report came from and what special committee participated in the preparation of this report, who was questioned, who saw people in my home." I welcome all of this. I am waiting for Mr. Granderson's answer. [Valet] "Sen. Ebrane Cadet sat at the conference table with Sen. Thomas Eddy Dupiton. Cadet has already written to Colin Granderson, current UN representative in Haiti, to ask for an explanation of the referenced report and a copy of that report because, according to Cadet, Dupiton's name is cited in it." [passage omitted] [Cadet] "We just wrote a letter to the United Nations, to Butrus Butrus-Ghali so he can provide us with precise, clear, explicit information not only on this case, but also on the case relating to the assassination attempts on Sen. Pierre Raoul Remy and Sen. Thomas Eddy Dupiton, because I would like to have all this information so justice can be set in motion. It is time for dishonesty to end in Haiti." [Valet] "So, according to what you just said, if Sen. Dupiton is guilty, you would like the justice department to prosecute him, would you not?" [Cadet] "If Sen. Dupiton is guilty, the justice department must prosecute him. If we could catch all other senators or all other people involved in crimes in the country, we would be very happy to institute legal proceedings against them." [passage omitted]
