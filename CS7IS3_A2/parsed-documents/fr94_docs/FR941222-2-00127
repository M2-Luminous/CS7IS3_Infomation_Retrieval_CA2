SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Paperwork Reduction Act Statement The information collection requirements contained in this notice have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501&hyph;3520), and assigned OMB control number 2535&hyph;0084. I. Purpose and Substantive Description A. Authority This competition is authorized under the Community Outreach Partnership Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. 5307 note; hereafter referred to as the ``COPC Act''). The COPC Act is contained in section 851 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (P.L. 102&hyph;550, approved October 28, 1992) (HCD Act of 1992). Section 801(c) of the HCD Act of 1992 authorizes $7.5 million for each year of the 5-year demonstration to create Community outreach Partnership Centers as authorized in the COPC Act. The Act also required HUD to establish a national clearinghouse to disseminate information about the program. The Community Outreach Partnership Centers program was transferred to the Office of Policy Development and Research on August 15, 1994, as part of the Departmental reorganization which created the Office of University Partnerships. This new Office is responsible for four of the Department's grant programs for institutions of higher education_Community Outreach Partnership Centers program, Joint Community Development program, Community Development Work Study program, and the Doctoral Dissertation Grant program. In addition, the Office is responsible for a variety of new outreach initiatives to involve these institutions in local community development and revitalization partnerships. B. Allocation and Form of Award The competition in this NOFA is for $7.125 million to fund the second year of the Community Outreach Partnership Centers (COPC) Program authorized as indicated above. HUD has made $7.5 million available for the program for FY 1995. $210,000 has been taken off the top to correct a mathematical error in the funding of one of last year's grantees and $165,000 has been taken off the top to fund the clearinghouse in FY 1995. Thus, $7.125 million is available under this NOFA.
