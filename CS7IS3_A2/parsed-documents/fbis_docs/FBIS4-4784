Peter Collins, assistant deputy representative of the USTR, said this at the ROK-U.S. trade talks held in Washington that day. He said that regarding international unfair trade practices, the United States will first make an effort to solve the dispute through the World Trade Organization (WTO) and will be as prudent as possible in the application of the Super 301. In the first-day sitting, the two sides discussed the pending issues, such as the easing of regulatory measures for the ROK automobile market, the term of distribution for heat-treated refrigerated sausage, the annual antidumping investigation of ROK-made television cathode-ray tubes by the United States. The U.S. side positively appraised the action taken by the ROK Office of National Tax Administration deleting the space in the taxation data form requiring the foreign car owners to fill in the type of their cars, and demanded again that the tariff be lowered for foreign cars. The U.S. side also claimed that because of the ROK Health and Social Affairs Ministry's alteration of interpretation of regulations on the heat-treated refrigerated sausage, $1 million worth of U.S. sausage awaiting customs clearance at Pusan port is about to be dumped as inedible. In this connection, the U.S. side protested the abrupt alteration of regulations. The United States has been exporting the heat-treated sausage to the ROK with a 90-day distribution period in refrigeration, but the ROK Government claims that the heat-treated sausage should not be allowed to be distributed in refrigeration after 30 days. The ROK side made an issue of the U.S. delay in its annual investigation of ROK-made television cathode-ray tubes, thereby delaying the opportunity for the revocation of the antidumping charges. Hence, the ROK side demanded an early annual investigation.
