Environmental protection in the European Community has long meant a search for the smallest common denominator. The Maastricht Treaty has introduced a change of course: the individual countries are no longer tied to minimum standards. European environmental policy has always been an enigmatic discipline. Usually only lawyers, administrative specialists and confirmed Eurocrats could find their way in the confusion of guidelines, regulations, deadlines and exceptions. Nearly always, however, the simple rubric "Environmental policy [based] on the smallest common denominator" went to the heart of the matter. The Maastricht Treaty rewrote this formula. In future decisions the vote of the majority will count, unanimity among member countries is no longer necessary. Second, the treaty strengthens the jurisdiction of the European Parliament. For example, in the future a new guideline on waste policy will no longer merely have to be noted by the EP but will require the approval of the Parliament. This can easily lead to confusion as the discussion on the long-planned guideline on packaging and packaging waste shows. In December of last year the Council of Ministers on the Environment reached an agreement on collection and disposal quotas which are lower than the German quotas taken from the packaging regulations. "First rate stupidity," Heinrich von Lersner, President of the Federal Office of the Environment in Berlin, says angrily whenever the subject comes up. Should the collection-happy Germans just throw away more trash again? No, since a compromise reached shortly before Christmas provides that the--relatively low--EU quotas may be exceeded throughout at the national level. This does not yet, however, bring the matter of the EU packaging guidelines to a close. "It is certainly possible," Dr. Jan C. Bongaerts, Director of the Institute for European Environmental Policy in Bonn, suggests, "that the European Parliament will not agree to this compromise." The consequence: the negotiations would have to begin again from scratch. Is Brussels more progressive than Bonn? Or are the Germans more environmentally conscientious than the rest of the EU? There have always been discussions about these questions. Gudrun Lammers, EU representative from the environmental group Greenpeace, laments a "clear democracy deficit" in the environmental policy from Brussels. "Naturally, much remained behind German standards," agrees the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] Europe delegate Klaus Haensch. His colleague Dagmar Roth-Behrendt suggests on the contrary that "70% solutions are still better than if several countries were to do nothing at all." Dagmar Roth-Behrendt chips away at the image of the Germans who all too gladly see themselves as the paragons of environmental protection. "Instead, the European Union accelerated German legislation on environmental protection," she made clear at an SPD function last week in Berlin. Even more: Germany, too, has already had to suffer defeats before the European Court; for example, for the tardy implementation of the guidelines on environmental compatibility testing as well as on drinking and ground water protection. Brussels environmental policy may possibly become more effective from the change in the trend. However, SPD Bundestag, or Federal Parliament, member Liesel Hartenstein notices in Brussels a "clear tendency toward a weakening of environmental standards." As one piece of evidence she mentions the drinking water guidelines, which would again make higher nitrate values permissible in Germany in the future. Also, the herbicide atrazine, which is forbidden here, could theoretically once again be available on the market in Germany. Additionally, Great Britain wants to make the mixed dumping of household trash and industrial waste possible with a guideline on waste dumping. And France is petitioning before the European Court against the prohibition currently in force in Germany banning pentachlorophenol (PCP), an active ingredient in wood preservatives. No one can say whether European environmental policy will become more lucid. In any case, in the future the European Union will in many cases only provide the outline [of a policy] which the member countries will then fill in. In this way the individual countries will be permitted greater flexibility. There is already a great deal of concern from the Germans that the rubric "as much Community as necessary, as much independence as possible" is more likely to cement distortions in competition in the EU than to tear them down. This discussion can be best followed at the current time from the planned guideline for the Integrated Avoidance and Reduction of Environmental Pollution (IPC). The guideline establishes standards for the approval of industrial facilities. [By following the standards], it shall thus be determined which environmental option is best at any given time in an individual case. This [approach] provides flexibility in two respects: since the totality of the environmental effects of a facility are taken into account, a disproportionately low level of air pollution, for example, can balance out higher levels of toxins in waste water or large amounts of waste materials. In addition, the preexisting level of pollution in a region is taken into consideration. In the case of lower initial pollution with maintenance of specified emission limits, there may in individual cases be a deviation downward from the state of the art [in pollution control policy]. The environmental policy makers in Bonn have difficulty with this new thinking. "There are no standards for comparison and no standard values for various environmental mediums," objects Kurt Schaefer, Director of the Emission Protection section in the Federal Ministry of the Environment. Bonn, therefore, has absolutely no intention of approving the IPC guidelines as they are currently formulated. Another reason for German opposition lies in the planned change in the practice of granting approvals. The guideline will in general streamline the approval procedure for [industrial] facilities; in the so-called spoke system, a single authority shall have overall control of granting the authorization. That means that individual approval [processes] conforming to various laws would be combined together. That would be a fundamental departure from the German practice of granting authorizations. Until now several specialized authorities would decide on an approval--this basic tenet would be invalidated by the IPC guideline. And thinking does not yet extend this far into European dimensions. As Schaefer says: "The integrated concept is not compatible with the German system and is therefore difficult to implement." FIGURE
