Karadzic is in Moscow to receive the Mikhail Sholokov prize for literature which has been awarded to him by the Association of Russian Writers. In a statement to reporters at Moscow airport upon his arrival on Monday, Karadzic said that no-one can expect Bosnian Serbs to accept something in whose creation they did not take part, including maps which do not take into consideration the actual situation in the field, without respect for the historical factors and especially the vital interests of the Serb people. Under the plan of the contact group which consists of representatives of the United States, Russia, and the European Union, the territory of the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia- Herzegovina will be divided into two parts, 51 percent for the Moslem-Croat federation and 49 percent for the Serb republic. Some U.S. circles are behind the beginning of the Bosnian war and its prolonging, Karadzic said, emphasizing that he was not blaming the entire U.S. administration for this. Pointing out that the Moslem-Croat federation in Bosnia- Herzegovina was created without the participation of Bosnian Serbs, Karadzic underscored that the federation was created only by respecting the military factor, in the sense of forming an anti-Serb coalition. Representatives of Bosnian Croats and Moslems and Croatia signed a preliminary agreement in Washington on March 1, under strong pressure from the U.S., on the forming of a federation of the two peoples in the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina which would later enter into a confederation with Croatia. Political analysts believe that Washington is again trying to isolate Bosnian Serbs with this initiative and pressure them into making territorial concessions more easily at the conference table. Despite the embargo, Moslems and Croats in Bosnia are arming themselves, so that the decision adopted by the House of Representatives of U.S. Congress last week to exempt Moslems from the embargo on arms sales to former Yugoslavia actually has no major significance. I would like such a decision to be adopted, because in that case I expect Russia would lift the sanctions against Yugoslavia, Karadzic said. The United Nations Security Council imposed an embargo on arms sales to all republics of the former Yugoslav federation in the autumn of 1991, and two years ago, also comprehensive and tough sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, unjustly accusing it of having the greatest responsibility for the outbreak of the civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Karadzic concluded that Moslems in Bosnia-Herzegovina are not interested in the establishment of peace, but urge the war option, because they have the support of the United States. The Bosnian Serb president said that he expected he would meet with Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and other ministry officials. He expressed hope that he would meet also with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin.
