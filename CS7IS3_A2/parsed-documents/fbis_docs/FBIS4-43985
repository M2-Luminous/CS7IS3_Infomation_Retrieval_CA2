Yesterday, Wednesday [22 June], Transportation Minister Viktor Klima (Social Democratic Party of Austria) made a corresponding statement at a press conference in Vienna. His specific plans: In addition to the already valid regulations, unified "ecological minimum standards" -- also for cars from East Europe -- are to be introduced. Already at the next EU transportation ministers' conference on 22-23 July he wants to become active on the "emissions front." Austrian preparations for EU membership provided the occasion for the press conference by Chancellor Franz Vranitzky, Klima, and European Affairs State Secretary Brigitte Ederer in Vienna yesterday. In autumn a government white paper -- similar to the EU white paper -- is to be presented. Its contents: economic and structural policy activities so as to contribute Austria's ideas "at the touch of a button" already at the state of discussions in the EU. Against Unemployment For the time being, these are just declarations of intent. Ederer cited the following key concerns after joining the EU: strengthening European employment policy, including a more intensive struggle against unemployment; efforts to raise environmental standards in the EU; final negotiations on the EU's regional subsidies; a "peace policy" in the form of social and economic policy integration; use of Austria's experiences as an intermediary for East Europe. Ederer's motto for Austria's role in the EU: "Small but important." Air Traffic Control in Vienna? Klima announced further specific activities. One of the main concerns refers to air traffic: Vienna would like to get superivision of air traffic control for southeastern Europe. Klima is also trying to further develop Austria as an international business location. Agreements, which have already been concluded with individual countries, are being transformed into "Euroagreements." Regarding subsidies, the main focus will be on technology and innovation.
