Seminario pointed out that the Huarangal center has enough production capabilities, but its main duty is to promote research and development among Peruvian University professors and students. Seminario said IPEN does not have any mortgage obligations or indebtedness to Argentina, whose technicians installed the "Racso" Nuclear Center. The current debt is between governments and is handled normally. [passage omitted] Concerning the Santa Anita irradiation plant, Seminario said 65 percent of the infrastructure has been completed. The equipment's arrival will be authorized when 85 percent of the infrastructure has been completed. A 1.7 billion-sole appropriation is required to complete the infrastructure and purchase the complementary equipment. The plant's main equipment is under construction in Russia. It will cost $1.2 million. This equipment will be donated by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The IAEA also has sent a purchase order for $160,000 for the cobalt-60 the plant will require. Perishable foodstuffs will be irradiated at the plant in order to preserve them for export. Roots, for example, may be preserved for eight months without spoiling. According to their natural properties, fruits have different preservative lives.
