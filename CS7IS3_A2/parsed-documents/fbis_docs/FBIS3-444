President Mangope called on the striking workers to outline their problems, but they insisted that he should address them first. The strike, which has paralyzed most of the essential services in the territory, has resulted in cancellations at the many luxury hotels in the area, and Sun City has admitted that it is being badly affected. One of the demands by the strikers is the reincorporation of Bophuthatswana into South Africa. Earlier today the Bophuthatswana cabinet decided that the territory would not take part in the election.
