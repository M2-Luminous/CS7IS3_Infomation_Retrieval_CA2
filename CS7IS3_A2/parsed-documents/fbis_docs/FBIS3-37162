The immediate reason for calling the press conference was the situation at the TV. However, there are many other problems to be discussed. Journalists, who are considered the fourth power in Russia, insist that the government should keep the promises it gave to them, specifically, the January resolution dealing with providing support for the publication and circulation of mass media organs. Oleg Poptsov, head of the Russian TV company, said that by today the government had decided to allocate to state-owned TV companies 51 per cent of the money they need. However, the Ministry of Finance allocated 18 per cent of what they need, without taking into account their debt to communication services in 1993. Poptsov regards the step taken by communication workers as a call for a general political strike and is sure that three days without radio and TV will be enough for the country to get out of control. According to Anatoliy Yezhelev, chairman of the Committee for Emergency Measures to Protect the Press, journalists intend to display solidarity, defending their professional interests and the right of citizens to information. It is quite probable that another stoppage of TV and radio broadcasting will be followed by a call for the information boycott of the government's work. Measures, suggested to the government by the Federal Committee for the Press, may change radically the economic situation of the press. According to chairman of the committee Boris Mironov, these include tax privileges, the granting of easy-term credits, the exemption from customs duties of the imported printing equipment and paper, etc. Vsevolod Bogdanov, chairman of the Russian Journalists' Union, believes that the state should take upon itself the legal protection of journalists and guarantee their access to information. Heads of journalists' unions are going to insist on the keeping of promises. Editors-in-chief will have a meeting tonight with press secretary of the president Vyacheslav Kostikov, where they will discuss problems of journalists, Bogdanov told ITAR-TASS.
