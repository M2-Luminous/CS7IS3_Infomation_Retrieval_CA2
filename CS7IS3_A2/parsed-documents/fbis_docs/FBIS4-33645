Today he defended the creation of a public broadcasting company reaching from "Oiapoque [Amapa State] to Chui [Rio Grande do Sul State]," and asked, referring to the owners of the television networks: "How is it that one citizen alone can speak to 80 million Brazilians?" Lula mentioned the "TV Cultura" station of Sao Paulo as an ideal model for the new public station. "I want a television channel transmitting serious reports to counterbalance the large television networks, a channel that will broadcast something more than commercial programs." The PT candidate criticized the excessive violence shown on television, and said that in Brazil 90 percent of the media is in the hands of nine families. He also criticized the rules used to grant television station licenses. "Every town in the interior has a former deputy, a former governor, who owns a radio or television channel," he complained. Lula guarantees that the new television channel -- which would be created by reformulating TV Educativa -- would not be just another public television station serving merely to increase the federal government's payroll. "I want to take advantage of what already exists in several states, and transmit a uniform national programming," he said.
