To this end, brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, Presidential Council chairman and supreme commander of the Armed Forces, issued repeated instructions to the forces of legitimacy and unity to abide by the cease-fire, and he set specific hours for that. The latest decision in this regard was conveyed to brother Lakhdar Brahimi, representative of the UN secretary general, who expressed appreciation for this new attempt and hoped that it would be complied with. However, the apostate and secessionist gang deliberately and premeditatedly insisted on aborting all those decisions in the hope that it would be able to peddle its criminal scheme against the homeland. To put an end to this gang's plotting and treason, and out of concern to enable brother Lakhdar Brahimi to fulfill his mission successfully, the brother chairman of the Presidential Council and supreme commander of the Armed Forces set a new date for the apostate and secessionist gang to comply with the cease-fire, starting Friday midnight, 10 June. That decision was accompanied by the new initiative of entrusting the Yemeni military officers of the military committee, which had been set up by a decision of the supreme commander of the Armed Forces, with the mission of supervising the cease-fire. The committee had been slated to meet at 1100 yesterday, Saturday, 11 June. Although the mischievous secessionists' knew that that initiative and new date for their compliance with the cease-fire was conveyed to the United Nations, the permanent UN Security Council member states, the Gulf Cooperation Council states, and the Arab League, they persisted in their arrogance, exposing their ill intentions, of which we had been aware. Thus, they violated the UN Security Council resolution, hoping they would able to continue their plotting against the homeland's unity and safety. In this context, they have been continuing their ground, naval, and air bombardment of the positions of the forces of legitimacy and unity in the Aden Governorate up to the time this statement was drafted. Persisting in defying the will of the Yemeni people and international legitimacy, the elements of apostasy and secession declared rejection of the military committee's supervision of the cease-fire implementation. They demanded that international forces be sent to the homeland. The Government of the Republic stresses that this is merely a new attempt to violate the homeland's sovereignty and independence, and that that demand has exposed premeditated intentions against UN Security Council Resolution 924. They want to abort the basic element of that resolution, which is ceasing fire in preparation for holding a dialogue. The Government of the Republic of Yemen has informed the UN envoy of its absolute readiness to start a dialogue immediately. However, the apostate and secessionist elements' ill intentions have been proved by the fact that they have demanded that international forces be brought in. Concluding his statement, the source said: The criminal, conspiratorial schemes concocted by the plotting and agent gang will be confronted. This gang's continued cease-fire violations, which aim to achieve treasonous objectives, will be confronted firmly and forcefully. This gang must bear the consequences of its conspiracy. Seeking to dismember the homeland and shed the Yemeni people's chaste blood, this conspiracy proves this gang's treason and subservience. And soon will the unjust assailants know what vicissitudes their affairs will take [Koranic verse].
