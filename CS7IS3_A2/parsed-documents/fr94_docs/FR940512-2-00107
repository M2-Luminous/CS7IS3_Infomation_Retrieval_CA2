FR940512-2-00107 FR940512-2-00055 3. In 1988 Valley Bank was replaced by a new independent fiduciary, the Trust Company of Knoxville (the Trust Company). Also, in July, 1988, significant improvements of a capital nature were made to the Clinch Property. The applicant represented that these improvements cost approximately $102,685.76, and were paid for by the Plan. 5 The applicant also represented that immediately after the improvements were installed, the Clinch Property was appraised. The appraisal did not result in an increase in value of the Clinch Property, and therefore, in accordance with the Past Lease, no rental increase was made. Nevertheless, it is represented that the Trust Company demanded an increase in rent from the Employer, in order to amortize the expenses sustained by the Plan. A rental increase of $2,000 per month was agreed to in May, 1989, and by letter of agreement dated June 9, 1989, between the Trust Company and the Employer, a new rental rate was set for the next five years until May, 1994. 6 This modification of the Past Lease by the applicant caused the Past Lease to extend beyond the original ten (10) year term specified under PTE 82&hyph;162. Under PTE 82&hyph;162, the Past Lease was to expire October 15, 1992. 7 5 In addition to these improvements, the Employer has made additional improvements to the Building at their own expense. 6 The applicant represents that as of September, 1993, the expenses sustained by the Plan for the improvements made to the Clinch Property, have been fully amortized. 7 The above-referenced changes to the Past Lease were outside the scope of exemptive relief provided by PTE 82&hyph;162, and, as a result, as of June 9, 1989, that exemption was no longer effective. In this regard, the applicant has agreed to file forms 5330 with the Internal Revenue Service and pay the appropriate excise taxes for the period beginning June 9, 1989, to the date when this proposed exemption, if granted, is published in the Federal Register , within ninety (90) days of the publication date.
