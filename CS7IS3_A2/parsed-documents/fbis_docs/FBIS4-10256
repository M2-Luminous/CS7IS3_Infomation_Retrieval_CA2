Asked about possible negotiations for the sale of British arms to the Brazilian Armed Forces, Hurd said in a news conference that "no agreement has been made by the two governments in this area, but there has been ongoing, steady aid" by private companies. Hurd said that he and the Brazilian Army minister, General Zenildo de Lucena, discussed the development of "joint work" that would enable Great Britain "to help meet the needs of the Brazilian Armed Forces." Hurd added that there are "promising areas" for cooperation, and that as a British official it was incumbent upon him to persuade his Brazilian counterparts. A senior British military official also attended the meeting between Hurd and Gen. Lucena. Hurd said he has promoted in Brazil a privatization process similar to that which was successfully implemented in his country. He added that in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo he discussed the possible participation of British businessmen in the privatization of state-owned electricity and water companies. Hurd's entourage consists of British businessmen from the trade, construction, generator and electricity distributor, arms, and fire equipment sectors. Hurd emphasized the need for the two countries to reach agreements that would promote trade and economic relations, such as the elimination of double taxation, the mutual protection of investments, and the solution of controversies. Hurd added that there is heightened interest in Brazil among British investors. He also said that he had conveyed to Mines and Energy Minister Alexis Stepanenko the desire to transfer British know-how to the area of privatization to Brazil. In his meeting with Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero, Hurd discussed the Brazilian stabilization program to eradicate inflation. Hurd believes that the economic plan formulated by Ricupero's predecessor -- Social Democratic presidential candidate Fernando Henrique Cardoso -- is popular in Brazil. He conveyed his hope that the plan might be instrumental in defeating inflation, which currently stands at 45.7 percent monthly. He added that in light of Brazil's potential, its economic prospects are "fantastic." Brazil is the largest market for British exports in South America. Brazil is also the fifth largest recipient of British investments, with an estimated total of $2 billion. According to official figures, Great Britain has a deficit in its bilateral trade with Brazil, because in 1993 its exports totaled $662.5 million while its imports of Brazilian products totaled $1.3545 billion. British exports increased by 52 percent in 1993 compared with 1992.
