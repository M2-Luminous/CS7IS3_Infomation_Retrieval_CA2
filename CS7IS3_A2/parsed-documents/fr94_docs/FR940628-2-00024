FR940628-2-00024 FR940628-2-00017 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission [Docket Nos. CP93&hyph;618&hyph;000 and 00] Pacific Gas Transmission Company; Intent To Prepare an Environmental Assessment for the Proposed PGT Expansion II Project June 22, 1994. On November 17, 1993 the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or Commission) issued a Notice of Intent to Prepare a Joint Draft Environmental Impact Report/Environmental Impact Statement (EIR/EIS) with the California State Lands Commission (SLC) for the above proposed PGT Expansion II Project and a related project proposed by Tuscarora Gas Transmission Company in Docket CP93&hyph;685&hyph;000 (Tuscarora Pipeline Project). The purpose of the Notice was to request comments on environmental issues. On May 31, 1994, PGT filed an amendment to its original application. In a June 8, 1994 response to a FERC staff data request, PGT confirmed that no expansion of its mainline facilities is required to provide service to the Tuscarora Pipeline Project. From the standpoint of the environmental analysis, the important changes to the PGT Expansion II Project are: •The elimination of the additional compression originally proposed at the Sandpoint, Idaho and Rosalia, Washington Compressor Stations; •The removal from the above proceedings of three meter runs inside PGT's existing Malin Meter Station in southern Oregon; the meter runs will still be necessary to serve the Tuscarora Pipeline Project, but will now be proposed under section 157.208(a) of the Commission's regulations (18 CFR 157.208(a)). •The elimination of one meter station proposed in Klamath Falls, Oregon; •The addition of two service taps on the Medford Extension Lateral; •Route realignments that increase the total miles of the Medford Extension Lateral (pipeline) to be constructed from 84.17 miles to 86.5 miles (see Table 1) 1 ; and 1 The table and appendices are not printed in the Federal Register , but have been mailed to all receiving this notice. Copies are also available from the Commission's Public Reference Branch, Room 3104, 941 North Capitol St., NE, Washington, DC 20426. •Route realignments that increase the total miles of the Coyote Springs Extension Lateral (pipeline) to be constructed from 17.71 miles to 18.5 miles (see Table 1). Prior to this amendment, the PGT Expansion II and the Tuscarora Pipeline Projects were being processed concurrently because of the inclusion in Docket No. CP93&hyph;618&hyph;000 of additional system compression and the meter runs at Malin needed to deliver gas to the Tuscarora Pipeline Project. However, the proposed amendment to eliminate the compression and the proposal to build the meter runs under separate authority make the PGT Expansion II Project a stand-alone proposal which can be considered separately from the Tuscarora Pipeline Project. Based on the above changes, we have determined that an environmental assessment (EA), rather than an environmental impact statement, is the appropriate document for analyzing the potential environmental impacts associated with the PGT Expansion II Project. We are now preparing this document. Since the PGT facilities will be located outside the State of California, the SLC will not be a cooperating agency in the preparation of this EA. We are proceeding with a joint EIR/EIS with the SLC for the Tuscarora Pipeline Project. The three meter runs inside PGT's existing Malin Meter Station will be addressed as a related facility in that joint EIR/EIS. The EA Process The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires the Commission to take into account the environmental impacts that could result from a major Federal action whenever it considers the issuance of a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity. The EA we are preparing will give the Commission the information it needs to do that. If the EA concluded that the project would result in significant environmental impacts, the Commission would prepare an environmental impact statement. Otherwise a Finding of No Significant Impact would be produced. NEPA also requires us to discover and address concerns the public may have about proposals. We call this ``scoping''. The main goal of the scoping process is to focus the analysis in the EA on the important environmental issues, and to separate these from issues that are insignificant and do not require detailed study. Although the scoping of the original project has already been completed, we are now asking for any additional comments only on the relocated or new portions of the project as currently proposed. Local scoping meetings have already been conducted for the original project. Additional scoping meetings are not anticipated. The EA will discuss impacts that could occur as a result of the construction and operation of the proposed projects under these general subject headings: •Geology and paleontology. •Endangered and threatened species. •Visual resources. •Water resources. •Vegetation. •Land use. •Air quality and noise. •Wetland and riparian habitat. •Cultural resources. •Fish and wildlife. •Socioeconomics. •Soils. We will also evaluate possible alternatives to the project, or portions of the project, and make recommendations on how to lessen or avoid impacts on the various resource areas. Our independent analysis of the issues will result in the publication of the EA which will be mailed to Federal, state, and local agencies, public interest groups, interested individuals, affected landowners, newspapers, libraries, and the Commission's official service list for these proceedings. Public Participation You can make a difference by sending a letter with your specific comments or concerns about the projects. You should focus on the potential environmental effects of the new portions of the proposal (see Table 1). You do not need to re-submit comments if you have already done so in this proceeding. We are particularly interested in alternatives to the proposals (including alternative routes), and measures to avoid or lessen environmental impact. The more specific your comments, the more useful they will be. Please follow the instructions below to ensure that your comments are received and properly recorded: •Address your letter to: Lois Cashell, Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol St., NE., Washington, DC 20426; •Reference Docket No. CP93&hyph;618&hyph;001; •Send a copy of your letter to: Ms. Alisa Lykens, Project Manager, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol St., NE., Room 7312 Washington, DC 20426; and •Mail your comments so they will be received in Washington DC on or before July 28, 1994. Becoming an Intervenor In addition to involvement in the EA scoping process, you may want to become an official party to the proceedings or an ``intervenor''. Among other things, intervenors have the right to receive copies of case-related Commission documents and filings by other intervenors. Likewise, each intervenor must provide copies of its filings to all other parties. If you want to become an intervenor you must file a Motion to Intervene according to Rule 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214) which is attached as appendix 1 2 . You do not need intervenor status to have your scoping comments considered. 2 See footnote 1. Environmental Mailing List If you don't want to send comments at this time but still want to receive a copy of the EA, please return the Information Request (appendix 2) 3 . If you have previously returned the Information Request you need not do so again. 3 See footnote 1.
