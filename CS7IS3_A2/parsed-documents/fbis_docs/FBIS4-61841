Commenting on this report, Lieutenant General Anatoliy Chechulin, commander of Russian border guards in Tajikistan, said that recently, the hard-line Tajik opposition, which has gone to ground in the northern provinces of the Islamic State of Afghanistan, has markedly stepped up its provocative sallies in the zone patrolled by the Moskovskiy and Pyanj border detachments. During the past week alone Russian border guards manning these sectors had thwarted four attempts by small but well-armed groups to infiltrate Tajikistan from Afghanistan. The Russian general noted that border guards, using artillery, had destroyed all these groups. He also declared that Russian border guards would suppress any further provocations with all the firepower at their disposal.
