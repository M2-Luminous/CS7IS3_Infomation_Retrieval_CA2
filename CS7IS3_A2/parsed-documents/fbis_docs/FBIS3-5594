Business Economics Department deputy director-general Khanitson Nawanukok said the conclusion was reached after an evaluation of the Indonesian tariff reduction program that was implemented on January 8. He said the department found that Thailand is theoretically qualified to enjoy the preferential AFTA rates for 69 percent of the 1,941 items because it has already cut its tariffs on those items to 20 percent or lower, the condition required for AFTA members to be eligible to utilise the benefits of other countries' tariff cuts. But Thailand would benefit from cuts to only 8 percent of the products because most of the cuts were granted to items which Indonesia does not import from Thailand, he said. Indonesian imports from Thailand accounted for only 1.3 percent of total Indonesian imports in 1992. Mr Khanitson said the items on which Thailand would immediately receive benefits were rice milling machinery and liquid measuring equipment of which Indonesia imported 33 million baht from Thailand in 1992. He said there were some items which Indonesia imported of significant value from Thailand but Thailand did not receive benefits from the tariff cuts because the Thai tariff rate was still high, such as cardboard and mineral water for which Thailand has tariffs of 40 percent and 45 percent respectively. Indonesia imported cardboard from Thailand worth 57 million baht and mineral water worth 25 million baht in 1992. Other Thai products which Indonesia imports huge amounts of, such as nylon synthetic yarn and machinery, did not receive tariff cuts. Indonesia plans to reduce the tariff on these products in 1995-96. Mr. Khanitson said Singapore and Brunei benefitted from 100 percent of the Indonesian tariff cuts, compared to 70 percent for Malaysia and 58 percent for the Philippines.
