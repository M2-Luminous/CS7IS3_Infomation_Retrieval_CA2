He took notes while listening to opinions and suggestions voiced by deputies about his report on government work. During the past eight days, the premier has attended discussions by seven deputy delegations. According to one of his aides, 18 pages of the premier's notebook have so far been filled, with the opinions and suggestions of 34 deputies. Said the premier: "The National People's Congress provides a good opportunity for government officials to learn about popular concerns." During the same period, Vice-Premiers Zhu Rongji, Zou Jiahua, Qian Qichen and Li Lanqing, and other members of the cabinet also joined deputies in their discussions and listened to their opinions. On many occasions, the premier made a point of inviting deputies from grassroots units to speak up, and those invited did not refrain from speaking their mind. Li jot down the main points of whatever they said, be they criticisms or suggestions. The premier said: "Some problems raised by the deputies cannot be solved immediately, but their opinions are good for revising the government work report and reducing errors in our work." No matter how busy he is during the day, the premier always sorts out his notes at night, the aide said. As early as when he worked in the former Ministry of Water Conservancy and Power Industry, Li Peng had the habit of taking notes, according to those familiar with the premier. Since he took office as premier, Li Peng has always carried a notebook wherever he goes, even on his visits to foreign countries. Besides the notebook, the premier has an electronic calculator with him, which he uses to check figures and amounts for "quantitative analyses."
