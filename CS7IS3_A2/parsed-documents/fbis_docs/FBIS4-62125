This May Enable Kebich To Get Rid of Main Rival in the Race for Presidency"] [Text] The "Belaya Rus" Slavic Assembly was the first and the biggest political organization to have spoken up in support of the candidacy of Aleksandr Lukashenko in the race for the presidency and to have actively joined the campaign to collect signatures for his nomination. It is this pan-Slavic organization that formed the backbone of Mr. Lukashenko's initiative group. Its supporters lead the election campaign in the provinces -- they were heads of a number of rayon groups that collected signatures. It became known late on 10 May that some 100 Slavic Assembly activists suddenly declined to support Mr. Lukashenko further and that they would stop collecting signatures for his nomination. The move is being motivated by Aleksandr Lukashenko's alleged retreat from his earlier declared principles of joining Russia in a confederative state and his taking the liberty of voicing critical remarks about the recently signed Russia-Belorussia [Belarus] treaty merging their monetary systems. Besides, Lukashenko brought into his ranks people who, in the opinion of the Slavic Assembly's leaders, far from help the candidate's election program to be ideologically consistent. In particular, helping to put together its economic part is Valeriy Tsepkalo, former economic adviser to ex-speaker Stanislaw Shushkevich. The sudden split in the camp of Mr. Lukashevich's supporters may have an appreciable influence on the outcome of the campaign to nominate candidates for the presidency. Aleksandr Lukashenko has lost a sixth of his initiative group, and chances are that he may be short precisely this number of votes to be registered as a candidate. The collection of signatures ends 15 May, several days from now. Many observers believe that the sudden difficulties plaguing Mr. Lukashenko did not arise without some help from the team of Premier Vyacheslaw Kebich. Aleksandr Lukashenko's rating, according to recent sociological polls, was much higher than the prime minister's. Getting rid of a rival before taking the issue to the polls would be in this situation the more effective and logical move on the part of Mr. Kebich.
