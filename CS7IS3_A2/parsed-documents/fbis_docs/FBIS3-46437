The minister listened to a criticism by former Finance Minister Boris Fedorov, who said that Zaveryukha's demand for more money for the complexes he is in charge of is "excessive." such criticism was "absurd," Zaveryukha said. However, Zaveryukha stressed that the situation may even worsen if the country's agriculture industry isn't funded properly. Referring to the 1993 harvest, when Russia realized a total of 100 million tons of grain, Zaveryukha said that the crop did not reach the expected output due to climatic and financial problems. Zaveryukha said that the government will continue to carry out the reforms and impose its tough financial policies, pointing out that the new cabinet is conforming to the needs of the times.
