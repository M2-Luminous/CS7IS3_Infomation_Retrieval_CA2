FR940318-2-00141 FR940318-2-00079 The new-formula allocation of $16,801,818 is based on the number of initial placements in each county during CY 1983_September 30, 1993. Welfare dependency rates were not used as a factor in this portion of the formula. VII. Proposed Allocations Table 1 lists the participating counties, the number of placements in each county during CY 1983_September 30, 1993, the amount of each county's proposed allocation which is based on the old formula, the amount of each county's allocation which is based on the new formula, and the county's total proposed allocation. Although Table 1 shows an amount for each county, the Director proposes, in the case of a State which contains more than one qualified county, to continue to permit the State to determine (in accordance with the requirements set forth in this notice) the appropriate allocation of the State's targeted assistance award among the qualified counties in the State. If a State chooses to make allocations which are different from the notice, the State, as in the FY 1993 TAP, would be responsible for determining an appropriate and equitable basis for allocating the funds among the qualified counties in the State and for including in its application a description of this allocation basis, the data to be used, and the allocation proposed for each county. Table 2 provides State totals for the proposed county allocations set forth in Table 1. Table 3 indicates the areas that each participating county represents.
