Minister of Posts & Telecommunications Wu Jichuan said today that the Ninth 5-Year Plan (1996-2000) for telecommunications development has been initially drafted. He said that in the new plan priority is given to construction of long-distance optical cable networks. According to major targets set in the plan, the ministry's total business volume will have an annual average growth rate of 23.7 percent, while the annual average growth rate for its business income will be 24.2 percent. Wu said that fulfillment of the plan will bring the national telephone capacity from the present 42 million lines up to 140 million lines, and the national telephone availability rate will reach 8 percent, while that for urban areas will reach 30-40 percent. In addition, mobile telephones will cover all the country's large and medium-sized cities, as well as most of the towns, basically realizing national automatic roaming. The ministry will establish its own air postal routes and improve other postal facilities to shorten mail delivery time. Meanwhile, computer networks will be established for EMS [electronic mail system] inquiries, issuing of publications, postal management, postal deposit and other business. Posts and telecommunications have been experiencing the fastest development among all the country's industries in the past few years. Last year its growth rate reached 59 percent, exceeding the development speed of the national economy for the ninth successive year. An official from the ministry predicted that this year the sector will maintain a development speed of about 50 percent. To ensure that the targets set in the plan be fulfilled, the ministry has drafted a huge budget of 360 billion yuan for the construction of posts and telecommunications infrastructures. At present, China's telecommunications capacity ranks seventh in the world; if all these targets are met, it will be able to edge into the world's first three positions.
