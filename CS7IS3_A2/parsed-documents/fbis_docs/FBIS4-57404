The Colombian businessmen worked on identifying investment possibilities in the tourism, sugar, pharmaceutical, and biotechnology industries, the agricultural-livestock sector, and basic industries, among others. Representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Investment and Economic Cooperation, and the Cuban Chamber of Commerce provided the visitors with extensive information and debated the ideas proposed by the Colombian delegation on future joint projects. The Colombian delegation also learned of Cuban legislation regarding foreign investments and preparations for the eventual approval of a law for mutual promotion and protection of that type of business. Part of the group participated in the Cuba-94 tourism convention which is being held in Varadero, since that sector contains immediate possibilities for bilateral cooperation.
