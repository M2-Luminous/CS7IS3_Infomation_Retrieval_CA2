On behalf of Poland, Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy suggested that a CE regional office be established in Warsaw, which would be designed to suit the needs of Central and East European countries. The issue of accepting Russia as a CE member was one of the main topics of a meeting of the CE Commission for Political Affairs. Miguel Martinez, chairman of the CE Parliamentary Assembly, stated during a meeting with Polish President Lech Walesa that it is precisely Poland from which the CE expects an opinion concerning the incorporation of Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine, among others, into European structures. Ernst Muehlemann, the commission's rapporteur, told journalists that there will be no preferential treatment or a less rigid application for Russia. He stressed that Russia's joining CE is possible "after the necessary, democratic reforms are implemented. We have no more than a year's time to come to a decision on this issue," he added. The commission has also considered the possibility of accepting eight other countries that have been striving for membership, among them Ukraine, Moldova, Latvia, and Albania. Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy said that "involving Russia in European structures is in the interest of Poland and Europe; it is beneficial from the standpoint of the stability of the entire continent. Poland is leaning toward accepting Russia's application for membership." While suggesting on behalf of Poland that a regional CE office be established in Warsaw, which would be especially oriented toward the needs of Central and East European countries, Jozef Oleksy said that "these needs require a better than heretofore knowledge of them and an improved meeting of them." Poland has extensive knowledge of the realities of the region, as well as experience in reforming an economy and the state. Commenting on the proposal, E. Muehlemann said that the issue will definitely be a subject of debate. Because it would mean major expenditures, it is only the CE Committee of Ministers that is authorized to make a final decision. The CE, a political intergovernmental organization that has been active for the sake of European unification, was established in 1949. It comprises 32 European pluralistic democracies, including nine Central and East European countries. Right now, the candidacies of eight other countries are being debated, among them Russia, Latvia, and Estonia. Poland became the 26th member of the CE on 26 November 1991. The CE Parliamentary Assembly holds plenary sessions four times a year at its Strasbourg headquarters, and it also holds a fifth session--the spring meetings--in one of the member countries.
