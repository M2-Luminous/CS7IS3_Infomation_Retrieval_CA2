In a letter to the United Nations Security Council, the minister of external affairs, Alhaji Babagana Kingibe, refuted Cameroon's claims that Nigeria violated its territorial integrity and annexed its land. Nigeria expressed surprise at the steps taken by Cameroon to internationalize the issue before the commencement of summit talks by the two countries to resolve the issue. Such steps, Nigeria said, included the invitation of French troops to the area, initiating a process with the International Court of Justice at The Hague, and bringing the matter to the attention of the OAU chairman. Giving the background to the dispute, the letter explained that on the 31st of last December, Nigerian troops were dispatched to the Nigerian Bakassi Peninsula to avert a violent clash between communities in Akwa Ibom and the Cross River States who were laying claim to the Bakassi settlements, but following the concern expressed by Cameroon on the Nigerian troops' movement, the minister of external affairs visited Yaounde to explain the troops' movement to President Paul Biya. The Cameroonian foreign minister also visited Abuja with a message from President Biya, and both sides agreed to resolve the issue peacefully. The Nigerian note said that surprisingly, while peaceful dialogue was proceeding, Cameroonian soldiers from their position launched an attack on the Nigerian troops first on 14 February and again on the 18th and 19th of the same month. The Nigerian troops felt obliged to defend themselves, but they were ordered to cease fire as soon as the attack on them stopped. The letter expressed the hope that the Security Council would encourage the initiative for a bilateral resolution of the dispute. Nigeria called on all third parties to refrain from acts which could internationalize or aggravate the situation.
