Due to open in the summer, the China Academy for Research in Reform will study ways to bring the Chinese economy into line with international norms. The State Commission for the Reform of the Economic Structure vice-minister, Wu Jie, will be the academy's first head. Mr. Wu, 58, a leader of the liberal faction of the party and a former vice-governor of Shanxi province, is the son of the late vice-president Ulanfu. Economic sources in Beijing said Mr. Wu was recruiting senior staff for the academy, which will be affiliated with the commission. They said Mr. Wu, who spent two years researching economics and information technology in the United States, was mainly looking for young academics and cadres with exposure to Western economies. The sources said while the academy was a ministerial-level unit its operations and methodology would be different from similar institutions such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS). "The new academy accepts funding and research grants from foreign institutions and foundations and has reportedly collected pledges of US$50 million (HK$385 million)," said a social scientist close to the new institution. "It may have a more liberal policy than either CAS or CASS in inviting Hong Kong, Taiwan and overseas scholars to teach and do research there." Aside from economic reform, the academy will look into ways to modernise the political structure, social policy, education and culture. However, analysts in Beijing said it was unlikely it would devote itself to studies of Western-style democratic institutions. They said the Research Institute for the Reform of the Economic Structure was dissolved after the Tiananmen Square crackdown because of its advocacy of political liberalisation. The research institute was also a primary thinktank for ousted party chief Zhao Ziyang. Analysts said, however, that the new academy enjoyed the backing of patriarch Deng Xiaoping, who earlier this year did the Chinese calligraphy for its official plaque. The establishment of the academy coincides with the decision by the leadership to roll back those market reforms that would exacerbate social problems. It is understood that the liberal wing of the party, including former associates of Mr. Zhao and the late party chief Hu Yaobang, have backed the academy. Mr. Wu, who is tipped for further promotion, and his associates have recently made trips to the coastal areas to learn more about the prospects of market reform.
