The reduction of jobs in large enterprises is continuing and cannot be balanced by new jobs in small and medium-sized enterprises, Rexrodt said at the opening of the 46th International Trade Fair (IHM) in Munich (until 20 March) on Saturday [12 March]. The end of the employment crisis can be expected in 1995 at the earliest, with a presumable growth of 2 to 2.5 percent. Rexrodt, Trade President Heribert Spaeth, and Bavarian Minister President Edmund Stoiber (Christian Social Union) paid tribute to the latest wage agreements and the first step toward more flexible working hours as a step in the right direction. Labor costs are too high, it was stated. [passage omitted]
