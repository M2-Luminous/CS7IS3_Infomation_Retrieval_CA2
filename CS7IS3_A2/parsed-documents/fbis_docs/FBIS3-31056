FBIS3-31056 "dreeu031_b_94005" FBIS-EEU-94-031 Document Type:Daily Report 15 Feb 1994 BULGARIA DPS Council To Continue Support of Cabinet AU1302210494 Sofia Khorizont Radio Network in Bulgarian 1700 GMT 12 Feb 94 AU1302210494 Sofia Khorizont Radio Network Language: Bulgarian Article Type:BFN [Text] Synchrony must exist between the parliamentary group of the Rights and Freedoms Movement [DPS] and the government, as well as in the vertical link between the DPS Central Council and its parliamentary group -- this was what the participants in today's DPS conference decided. An official proposal will be made to the deputies who left the DPS parliamentary group that they should leave the National Assembly as well. The DPS assesses the work of the government to date as unsatisfactory, but considers that it should wait until the budget is adopted before deciding the issue of what personnel changes in the cabinet should be proposed. Here is a brief interview with DPS leader Ahmed Dogan by our reporter Mariya Tsankova: [Begin recording] [Dogan] We support the government, we support it, so to speak, as its godparent, although we have a number of very serious critical remarks to make. However, these critical comments do not relate to the status of the government, but rather concern the possibility for more radical actions. We have some hopes regarding a cabinet shuffle, but Prime Minister Prof. Lyuben Berov is the man who has to decide this matter. [Tsankova] Did you discuss a code of regulations for the DPS parliamentary group and the relations within it? [Dogan] Yes, the subject did come up, a number of principles for a code were suggested. I personally proposed that the leadership should be rotated, the post of leader, and so on. [Tsankova] Did you discuss the allegations of corruption that prompted Mehmet Hodja to leave the DPS parliamentary group? [Dogan] I would very much like to know the facts about at least one case of corruption from the person who posed this issue. I would very much like to know one such fact, and would be very glad if someone could provide me with such information. However, if we talk about corruption in the broad sense, perhaps this is a matter for parliament. [end recording] Discussions will no doubt be provoked by the decision adopted at today's DPS meeting to propose to the government that representatives of the tobacco producers appointed by local DPS leaderships should serve on the managements of the 22 companies controlled by Bulgartabak Holdings.
