In an interview with SAT 1 this morning, Bohl stated that the Federal Government has made efforts to intervene in the Turkish-Kurdish conflict within the framework of what is possible. However, Germany cannot accept "violent actions on German soil to settle the inner-Turkish conflict at the expense of German citizens." Bohl stressed: "We must adopt tough measures to prevent that." The deportation of Kurdish offenders is possible because they are not facing persecution "in all parts of Turkey." Bohl expressed the hope that the majority of the Kurds living in Germany ensures that the reputation of the Kurds in Germany is not damaged.
