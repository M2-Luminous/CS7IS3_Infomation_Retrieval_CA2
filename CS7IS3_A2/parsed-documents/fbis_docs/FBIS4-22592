Naymushin, chief of the Novosibirsk Oblast Center for the Employment of the Population Department of Labor Market Analysis and Employment Programs: "The Number of Unemployed Is Growing (Analysis of 1991-1994 Data From the Oblast Center for the Employment of the Population)"] [Text] The number of unemployed people is growing in the rayons of the oblast. In 1993, 13,500 unemployed were put on the rolls there, and in the preceding year, 7,000. Last year, 7,600 unemployed were put on the rolls, compared to 9,300 in 1992. For the January-February period of 1994, the number of unemployed put on the rolls, compared to the corresponding period of last year, came to 155.7 percent in the rayons of the oblast, 122.0 percent in Novosibirsk, and 142.4 percent in the oblast as a whole. The competition among the unemployed for vacant jobs is growing, especially in the rayons of the oblast. As of 1 March 1993, 21 unemployed claimed each vacant job in the oblast rayons, compared to six; as of the corresponding date of last year in the city of Novosibirsk, accordingly, one and three, and in the oblast as a whole, three and four unemployed per vacant job. The proportion of unemployed residing in rural areas increased in 1993 (from 12.7 percent as of 1 January to 21.7 percent on 31 December). Those who had previously worked in the national economy accounted for 86 percent of the total number of unemployed. On the whole, the following dynamics of the qualitative composition of the unemployed people has been registered: 1-1-93 1-1-94 a) by reason for unemployment (percentages): --laid-off employees 62.8 45.0 --quit of their own will 22.4 39.3 --dismissed for violations of 0.7 1.6 labor discipline --college graduates 9.2 11.3 b) by age: --young people between 16 and 32.1 34.5 29 --individuals close to 5.3 6.7 retirement age c) those who have had a break 12.5 22.6 in work of more than one year and those who have not previously embarked on labor activities d) those without profession 7.2 12.7 or occupation e) by the duration of unemployment --eight months or longer 3.9 31.6 Higher requirements by employers with regard to the level of qualification of the employees and newly hired citizens have hampered job placement activities on behalf of the groups of population in particular need of social protection. It is obvious that the number of parents rearing minor or congenitally handicapped children, single parents, and parents of many children increased in 1993 among the unemployed precisely in conjunction with this. Last year, the number of unemployed parents rearing minor children, as well as congenitally handicapped children, in the oblast increased from 4,300 to 5,500 people, and that of parents of many children, from 312 to 524 persons, respectively. This growth occurred only in the rayons (cities) of the oblast, whereas the number of such persons in Novosibirsk virtually did not change (2,400 people). The proportion of parents who have minor children or congenitally handicapped children, in the total number of unemployed is greater in the rayons of the oblast than in Novosibirsk, and comes to 42.4 percent and 41.6 percent, respectively. Refugees and Forced Resettlers In 1993, the employment service of the oblast registered a total of 145 such citizens, including 103 women. Thirty-five persons were placed in jobs, including 24 women. The Size of Unemployment Benefits The average annual size of unemployment benefits in Novosibirsk Oblast, with payments for all dependents (including children), came to 2,385 rubles [R] in 1992, and R24,627 per unemployed person in 1993. The allowance for each dependent comes to 10 percent of the size of the benefit. The Results of the Implementation of the Main Provisions of Employment Programs for 1993 A certain relaxation of strains on the labor market of the oblast in 1993 was the main result of carrying out the program for facilitating the employment of the population. Last year, the employment service operated on the labor market more effectively than in the previous year. The number of nonworking citizens placed in jobs by the service increased by 12.8 percent, the number of those referred for vocational training--by 263 percent, and the number of those enlisted in public works--by a factor of 30.
