FR940208-0-00107 FR940208-0-00031 Summary of Comments and Recommendations In the August 30, 1993, proposed rule and associated notifications, the Service requested all interested parties to submit factual reports or information that might contribute to the development of this final rule. The public comment period was open from August 30, 1993, to October 29, 1993. During that period, the Service conducted three public hearings on this issue at the following locations: Riverside, California, on October 6, 1993; Las Vegas, Nevada, on October 12, 1993; and St. George, Utah, on October 14, 1993. The Service accepted testimony from the public from 1 to 4 p.m. and from 6 to 8 p.m on each of those days. The Service announced the dates, times, and locations of the public hearings in the August 30, 1993, proposed rule (58 FR 45748). Appropriate State agencies, county governments, Federal agencies, scientific organizations, and other interested parties were contacted and asked to comment. In addition, the Service published notices in the Kingman Daily Miner, Las Vegas Review Journal, Las Vegas Sun, Barstow Desert Dispatch, The Sun, and the Press Enterprise on September 23, 1993, and in the Daily Spectrum on September 16, 1993, announcing the publication of the proposed rule and the dates, times, and locations of the public hearings. During the 60-day comment period, the Service received approximately 270 written comments. In addition, 147 people testified at the three public hearings. The Service received comments from the BLM, the Bureau of Mines, other Federal agencies, military installations, State and county agencies, town boards, environmental organizations, the mining industry, recreational enthusiasts, and the ranching industry. Comments are part of the administrative record and are available for public review. Issues raised during the public comment period announced in the August 30, 1993, proposal, whether written or oral, are discussed below. Issue 1: One respondent requested that the Service adjust the boundaries of CHUs to reflect the boundaries proposed for the East Mojave National Park, as depicted in Senate Bill 21. Service Response: The Service cannot assume that the legislation for the East Mojave National Park will pass or what form it will take. The boundaries proposed for the East Mojave National Park in Senate Bill 21 reflect the balancing of a variety of concerns, both biotic and abiotic, and should not be expected to resemble boundaries reflecting habitat critical to the recovery of a single species. Should the East Mojave National Park be established, the Service will reevaluate the designation of critical habitat, if appropriate. Issue 2: The Service received several comments regarding the presence of unsuitable habitat within proposed CHUs. Examples of areas already developed that were included in the proposal were golf courses, buildings, towns, and existing mining operations. Many stated that these areas should not be included even for the ease of writing legal descriptions. Service Response: The Service identified large contiguous blocks of tortoise habitat containing the primary constituent elements that support nesting, foraging, sheltering, dispersal, and/or gene flow, primarily on Federal lands. To the extent possible, the Service adjusted boundaries to exclude peripheral areas that do not support primary constituent elements. However, it was not possible to exclude all areas of non-habitat via boundary revisions. In some cases, CHUs contain small towns, farms, or human-made structures. These areas, although physically located within the boundaries of critical habitat, are not included in critical habitat designation because they do not contain any of the primary constituent elements of desert tortoise habitat. Areas not currently containing all of the essential features, but with the capability to do so in the future, may still be needed for the long-term conservation of the species, particularly in certain portions of the range. Issue 3: Some respondents stated that the Service should use natural landmarks for critical habitat boundaries and legal descriptions rather than section lines. Use of section lines instead of natural or human-made boundaries will make enforcement difficult, if not impossible. One letter stated that, in a majority of cases (according to the BLM), documented sheep trespasses during the 1993 grazing season occurred where there were ambiguous boundary lines. Service Response: In designating critical habitat, the Service is required to legally define boundaries. In this effort, the Service has primarily used section lines. The Service also used major roads to legally define some of the CHUs.
