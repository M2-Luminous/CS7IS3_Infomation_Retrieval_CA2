They discussed with him the recent Zionist assaults on the Ba'labakk area. Al-Hariri sent Lebanese Minister of State for Finance Fu'ad Sinyurah to the headquarters of Hizballah's Consultative Council. Sinyurah, speaking for the Lebanese Government, affirmed that the government support for the resistance will continue until the occupied territories are liberated. Sinyurah announced: We express our appreciation for Hizballah's martyrs who gave their lives to defend the homeland and confront Israeli arrogance. Meanwhile, Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz described the Zionists' recent brutal attacks on Ba'labakk as an attempt to damage Syrian-Lebanese relations. Speaking to the newspaper AL-SAFIR, Buwayz said that Israel has lately been exerting pressure on the Lebanese Government to make it halt the resistance operations against the Zionists in south Lebanon. He pointed out, however, that the Lebanese Government believes that as long as the Zionists occupy parts of the Lebanese territory, resistance is the people's legitimate right. The Lebanese foreign minister referred to the total backing that the Lebanese public and their various political factions are giving to the resistance movement. He accused the United Nations of weakness and inability to adopt firm resolutions to halt the Zionist attacks on Lebanon.
