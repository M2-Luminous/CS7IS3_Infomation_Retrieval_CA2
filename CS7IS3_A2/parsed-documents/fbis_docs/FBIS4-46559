It showed (down to the pain of an exposed nerve) to its participants and thousands of visitors interested in the country's technical progress what a critical state of development we are at today. Around a hundred scientific production associations and special design bureaus from the CIS and twenty leading engine building firms from the far abroad presented their products in the Forum pavilion of the exhibition complex on Krasnaya Presnya. "The idea of assembling specialists in creating engines for different applications in one exhibition is valuable," said Russian Federation Government First Deputy Chairman Oleg Soskovets, "in that for the first time it enables scientists and designers, production engineers and industrial workers to become mutually enriched by know-how and foremost technologies, coordinate ways of mutually advantageous cooperation, and find new partners and new spheres of the market for their products." Time will tell how much the opportunities presented were used. Nevertheless, it is already possible to tell about certain results. The sensation of the exhibition was the cooperation agreement of the Russian Aviadvigatel and Permskiye motory joint-stock companies and the United Technologies/Pratt & Whitney corporation (USA). Just a few years ago engine builders from Perm affirmed their authority in the industrial world by certifying the powerful, reliable PS-90A aircraft engine. Unfortunately, the state's economic troubles did not permit realizing technological improvements in it and expanding the operating horizons. But it is common knowledge that nature does not tolerate emptiness. The Perm engine builders found a way out of a critical situation: they concluded an agreement with Pratt & Whitney (USA) to create two joint companies for production of aircraft and industrial engines. A German firm, Motoren und Turbinen (MTU) also is participating in the project. The goal is to create a more advanced engine for Il-96, Tu-204 and Il-76 aircraft using the experience of Russian and foreign engineers. The first model, PS-90P, was shown at the exhibition and drew the specialists' attention. As Viktor Chuyko, president of the Union of Aircraft Engine Building and a doctor of technical sciences, said, all the best of what was being created by the mind and hands of man was combined in it. The Dvigateli-94 exhibition gladdened Russia's aviators with one other event--the announcement of the creation of a trainer aircraft for the Air Force. For long years pilots had been learning to fly in imported L-29 and L-39 aircraft. As a pilot who has mastered these aircraft, I confirm their insufficient reliability because of the presence of one engine and dependence of the air fleet on politics. The Special Design Bureau imeni Mikoyan created a domestic MIG-AT multipurpose aircraft. And again there was an example of survival under conditions of a lack of money: cooperation with the French company SNECMA. Two LARZAC 04Y3 jet engines (photo [photo not reproduced]) will be placed on the aircraft. Of course, this alliance has its fine points, but their solution is a matter for statesmen. I believe they also should spend money to produce a domestic engine. For example, specialists from Ufa are ready to set about making it. The exposition of enterprises of the missile-space industry and the motor vehicle, tractor, and ship engine makers was interesting. The technical exhibition was able for the first time to satisfy the interest of specialists in different areas. In addition, one of the most important problems of mankind was being solved at the exhibition: how to preserve living nature under conditions of intensive development of high technologies and in the long run not permit ourselves to perish under the "umbrella" formed by exhaust gases.
