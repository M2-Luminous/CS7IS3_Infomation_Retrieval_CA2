[Correspondent] In your capacity as prime minister, what do you think about reports concerning the ongoing peace talks? Is peace still far off? [Moco] I believe that what I think is what any Angolan thinks: we must fight for peace. Let it be noted that our government has never behaved in a way to leave the Angolan people or the international community in any doubt that we are fighting for peace. The National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] has been the aggressor. It has attacked the country's integrity. It has been destroying the country and it has been doing so for no justifiable reason. Now, we all hope that pressure from the international community at large -- and in particular those countries which are able to exert pressure on UNITA -- will be enough to ensure that a peace accord will be signed in Lusaka or some other city as soon as possible. What I have been trying to convey over the course of my tour is that it is easy for us to reach peace on paper. It is far more difficult to achieve real peace that will serve the Angolan people's interests rather than UNITA's and Mr. Savimbi's greed for power. [Correspondent] You talked a great deal about peace during your tour. We would like to ask whether peace is near or whether there is just a possibility than an accord will be signed? [Moco] I think that real peace will hinge on how the Angolan people organize themselves. As for peace on paper, that may happen soon. [Correspondent] When you held meetings with the provincial governments, some specific guidelines were issued. Do you think it will be possible for the provincial governments to follow those guidelines, principally with regard to food security and returning people to their areas? [Moco] I do recognize that it will be very difficult, but it is possible to do something. We must perfect organizational mechanisms in a situation of war. This is a guideline I issued and I believe it can be implemented. An improvement in the [20-second break in transmission] is necessary and I will assume a stand concerning that matter. Very often governmental organizations have been much too kind toward UNITA. There are many people who have been fleeing UNITA-held areas. UNITA carries out ambushes on the roads. It even prevents aircraft from providing help to war-displaced people in a number of districts, notably Benguela and Huambo. I feel quite often that nongovernmental organizations and the UN representation in Angola do not apply enough pressure on UNITA to encourage it to allow humanitarian aid to be extended to every part of Angolan territory. [Correspondent] Mr. Prime Minister: this will likely be the last question from the People's Television of Angola, TPA, and it is connected with the first question I asked. Will you not be making changes in your governing apparatus before the peace accords are signed? [Moco] That depends. At this point, I fail to see the need, but the government (?faces) some difficulties and it has to fight for a good image. The head of government and the president of the republic must ensure that each member of government is made aware of his responsibilities in his particular field and that is not achieved through dismissals alone. Dismissals are often spectacular moves, but there are other ways to go about it. Nonetheless, dismissals and resignations are only natural in any government at any time. Obviously, we have not planned such moves and they are not our principal concern either. Our principal aim is to build, to help, and to provide support for officials in government. Though people may think otherwise, they are only human and they experience the same difficulties all Angolans face. In fact, that is the way we must act so we can improve the mechanisms of government more and more. [Correspondent] How did the government react to the UN proposal concerning the search for peace corridors so that humanitarian aid can be extended to people in areas [words indistinct]? [Moco] I believe you must put that question to UNITA. It began the war and it has continued to make war. You are perfectly well aware of the fact that it was UNITA that began the war, so it is UNITA that must be asked about opening peace corridors or whatever you may call them. The fact is that the government has never raised problems concerning supplies to the people or aid to war-displaced people. We have never raised that problem, so I believe that is one question that must be put to UNITA. It began the war and it has continued to make war. As you know, Chongoroi, here in Benguela, and Ebo were recently occupied. So, UNITA began the war and it has continued to be on the offensive. It is UNITA that must be asked such questions.
