On 31 May, the state debt amounted to 9,183.4 billion Belgian francs [BFr], or 128 percent of 1993's GDP. The debt in Belgian francs represents 83.6 percent of the total, in other words 5 percent less than the previous year. This is due to the rise in interest rates at the end of last summer. We borrowed in German marks to avoid the high rates and counted on the franc's recovery. The short-term debt increased from 30.5 percent to 33.4 percent of the total. This is the result of very high long-term interest rates, a fact which leaves the finance minister puzzled. The debt continues to grow at an excessively high rate. Instead of the 5.8 percent stipulated, the debt rate reached 7.2 percent in 1993. "In view of the recession, this is not a bad result by comparison," Maystadt commented. "But it is not adequate. Even outside of the European constraints, we must rapidly return to close to 3 percent in order to reduce the stock of debts and regain room to maneuver." The 1994 target is a 5.5-percent deficit. It should be possible to achieve around 5.7 percent, the slightly higher figure due to social security and the regional authority expenditures rather than from the state. "We are ending a debate with the communities and regions," Maystadt said, "to establish a normal level of growth in spending for each." If spending is controlled at all levels, the prospects for improvement are serious because the revenue is coming in: Up 13 percent for the first five months of 1994, compared with the same period in 1993! Maystadt sees several causes for this: The increase in taxes, the economic recovery, a speeding up of VAT [value-added tax] revenue, and the struggle against fraud. "Following the hiring of specialized staff, several big companies have paid tens of millions in additional tax. In the banking and insurance sector, back tax amounted to 1 billion. And they are paying!" The medium and long-term debt is changing face. So-called classical loans, negotiated with the banking consortium, are giving way to state bonds (which amount to BFr1,000 billion), and especially linear bonds (hitherto reserved for banks and institutions but which will shortly be offered to the general public). At the beginning of 1994, in view of the "calls" (early repayments to take advantage of lower interest rates), BFr1,618 billion in loans came to term. A record! "More than 70 percent are already refinanced," Maystadt said with satisfaction, "without disrupting the markets, at a lower cost, and with an increase in the average duration." In 1993, average interest rates weighted on the debt dropped from 8.8 percent to 8.1 percent. The state paid BFr699.4 billion in interest. Each Belgian therefore paid an average of BFr70,000 to the Belgians holding state bonds. Revenue from capital is taxed at 13.39 percent, in other words much lower than revenue from labor. "One of the priorities of the coming German presidency," Maystadt announced, "is to arrive at a more equitable taxation of this revenue at a European level." In Germany, the tax on capital revenues is 30 percent. An agreement on between 15 and 20 percent is plausible if Europe can avoid the risk of a mass exodus of capital to other countries like Switzerland.
