FR940426-2-00089 FR940426-2-00057 The proposed changes associated with the ``loss-of-function'' checks ensure a plant configuration which would have the capability to automatically actuate the respective system/valve(s). These instruments are designated to mitigate the consequences of previously analyzed accidents. Failure of these instruments cannot increase, and is independent of, the probability of occurrence of such accidents. As a result, the proposed changes cannot increase the probability of any accident previously evaluated. The proposed changes do not involve a change to the plant design or operation and do not degrade the capability of the system(s) to perform its required function. Further, these functions or tripped channel(s) in an isolation logic are not considered as initiators for any accidents previously analyzed. Therefore, these changes do not significantly increase the consequences of any accident previously evaluated. 2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. The proposed changes do not result in any change to the plant design and no new mode of plant operation is introduced. As a result, the proposed changes can at most affect only accidents which have been previously evaluated. Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety since the required safety function of the inoperable channel(s) will be fulfilled. The allowable Outage Time (AOT) for several trip functions have been increased but only in conjunction with the incorporation of the loss-of-function check which ensures a plant configuration which would have the capability to automatically actuate the respective system/valve(s). Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However, should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the Federal Register a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take this action will occur very infrequently. Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and should cite the publication date and page number of this Federal Register notice. Written comments may also be delivered to room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville, Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555.
