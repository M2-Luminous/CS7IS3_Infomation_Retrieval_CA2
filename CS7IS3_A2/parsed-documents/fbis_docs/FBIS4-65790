A description of the situation is given in the comment by Major General Hannu Sarkio, commander of the Turku-Pori Military Province, after the official news release: "A sigh of relief is being breathed in many a unit today." The artillery brigade in Niinisalo is one of the units that is satisfied with the results. "We are especially pleased with the description: a large and multipurpose training center," said Colonel Esa Tarvainen, the brigade commander. "We have already begun developing in that direction." The artillery brigade trains almost half of the artillery conscripts, and the Kankaanpaa Battery trains approximately 70 percent of the reservists with this military occupation specialty. This is about 2,000 men annually in each group. "Already at this time we could train all of the artillery reservists, or about 3,000 men per year," said Tarvainen. Niinisalo was changed into a training center last year when all of the units at the base were consolidated into an artillery brigade. There are about 500 persons on duty there, and that is sufficient for the current mission. The changes will be toughest for instructors at the UN training center operated under the supervision of the Defense Ministry. The responsibility for training international military observers, for example, has grown enormously. When the course was initiated, there was one class per year, and now a total of 200 officers in five different classes are trained yearly. The biggest problems for the brigade involve maintenance and supply. The buildings are old, built at various times, and operating the mess hall and the central warehouse, for example, is expensive. Building a mess hall is in the ministry's plan. Tarvainen estimates that modernizing supply and maintenance facilities will cut expenses considerably, and that as many as 30 persons could be transferred from maintenance to training duties.
