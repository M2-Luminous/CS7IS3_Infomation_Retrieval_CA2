Cuban Finance Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez made the above statement during a conference of Higher Education Ministry officials, who have been meeting since last Monday with government and Cuban Communist Party officials. Different economic mechanisms based on new laws are being applied, which, in addition to the changes made to the domestic economy such as the increase in self-employment (with nearly 145,000 people participating since Decree 141 was passed last September), are a solution to the decreasing number of jobs, Rodriguez said. Rodriguez explained that the changes (including the suspension of penalties for possessing dollars, opening to foreign capital, and other changes) could lead to a better year for Cuba from an economic viewpoint, especially a halt to the violent fall experienced between 1989 and 1993. Rodriguez pointed out that the strongest of the measures adopted by the government in this stage is the introduction of agricultural cooperatives. He explained that the exploitation of extensive areas of land using a large amount of imported fertilizers could not be continued following the collapse of the socialist bloc and the disappearance of the USSR (the nation's leading trading partners). We had to make a political decision. We had to link man directly with his work by creating basic cooperative productive units, which are socialist formulas that allow peasants to feel like co-owners of the land. We have reached the conclusion that certain unproductive factories cannot continue to operate, that we must review the payrolls, and that we must make a series of decisions to see that economic mechanisms are successful and that the country's financial situation improves. The minister said all the monetary-fiscal reforms that have been applied and that are being studied are aimed at achieving a stimulating [estimulante] relationship between work and salary now that the country is facing the dual problem of an excess of national currency and foreign exchange. Nevertheless, he predicted that with a change in economic mentality, a halt of the current crisis if not progress in the solution thereof should be observed in the second half of the year. He based his optimism on the possibility of having a superior sugar harvest (or a less costly one), the increase in the price of sugar and nickel (and a recovery in the production of this mineral, which is in high international demand), the substitution of imports, and a significant increase in agriculture. In this regard, he also mentioned oil exploration, restoring electricity to previous levels, revising storage methods for agricultural products, and labor reforms, which are essential to control a relative or absolute labor force surplus. He said that Cuba has not abandoned its full employment policy, but to avoid identifying it with labor idleness, alternatives for state, cooperative, or self-employment work have been opened, accompanied by strict order and discipline. Rodriguez said Cuba's degree of economic opening to the outside will always be high, with tourism as the basic program, followed by the export of nontraditional products, the export of established products like sugar, nickel, and tobacco, and with expeditious changes to reincorporate the country into the world economy. Rodriguez said the country will remain open to foreign capital and stated that 129 associations with this type of financing are currently operating in Cuba. He said that the most serious obstacle in the way of this program is the embargo that the United States has been applying to the country for more than three decades. To this must be added the country's foreign debt, which equals approximately $7 billion. There are solutions, but they are extremely complex, Rodriguez concluded.
