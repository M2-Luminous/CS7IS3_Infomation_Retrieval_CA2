Then there were some other security incidents, preoccupying the Government and the security services. Will these incidents affect the security measures that were decided on at a series of meetings, and will they also affect the counternarcotics campaign? Salim: There is a difficult drug problem all over the world. However, we in Lebanon have decided to confront it, no matter the cost. Some states are better equipped than we but they still have a drug problem, whether in regard to the quantities of the drugs or the numbers of addicts and users. These states include the United States, France, Switzerland, and Germany. Despite our modest resources, in 1993 we in Lebanon seized large quantities equal to half the amount seized in the whole of Europe. Last year we seized about 22 tons of hashish. This is three and a half times the 6 tons that was seized in the previous four years -- 1989, 1990, 1991, and 1992. These figures show that a great effort was made last year, in which we also seized 292 kg of cocaine, compared with 37 kg seized in the previous four years. We also arrested 1,400 drug merchants and traffickers. Sarkis: Does this mean that the counternarcotics campaign is continuing? Salim: Naturally. Especially in the Southern Suburb [of Beirut]. Let us be frank and realistic. This is not the first time we have entered this area. We have entered it before and arrested wanted persons. Ordinary citizens do not know this because of the lack of media coverage. We work far from the limelight. The suburb is part of Lebanon and we reject any special status for it. Last time an incident occurred in which two judicial police were injured by a hand grenade tossed from a distance in a place crowded with people. However, the incident did not prevent the policemen from continuing their searches, seizing a quantity of hashish, and arresting four dangerous wanted persons. We cannot prevent a citizen from tossing a hand grenade while we are carrying out our duty, whether in the suburb or elsewhere. Sarkis: Why? What do you mean? Salim: Because we work in silence. We do not speak. We cannot broadcast that so and so deals in narcotics and we will arrest him. The media here would cause harm and not benefit. Sarkis: Naturally you do not announce such news. However, announcements have been made on the seizure and destruction of narcotics. Salim: Yes, last year we carried out five operations to destroy narcotics seized in Lebanon. The destruction of the narcotics took place in the presence of liaison officers who had come from Cyprus at our request. Sarkis: Why this presence? Salim: Cyprus is a liaison center for officers from Europe and the United States. We asked them to come so they could see for themselves the seized quantities. Rumors circulated in the past that cocaine had been seized but that what was being destroyed was milk powder or white cement or something else resembling cocaine. We insisted that they come and inspect the material destined for destruction. This actually occurred. We put a small quantity of these drugs in a plastic bag containing a liquid. When the drug is mixed with this liquid, it shows what kind of narcotics it is. There are three colors marked on the bag. Violet means heroin, black means morphine, and blue means codeine extracted from opium. Last time, I told them when we arrived at the destruction site that I had the testing bag with me. They answered that they too had a testing bag. They were embarrassed to use it in front of us after we insisted that they do so. On departing Lebanon, they said they were expecting that only half of their questions would be answered. They, however, left Lebanon fully confident that we are completely doing our duty. Yesterday, I received a telephone call from a U.S. officer in Cyprus. He congratulated us on the seizure of the hashish haul in the Southern Suburb. Let us be frank, in the past the Suburb sheltered outlaws and no one could enter it. We entered it. We did not meet any resistance from the patriotic organizations, who care about their reputation because we all agree that drugs are an epidemic we must fight. Those who are confronting our personnel are not [Hizballah] Party or [Amal] Movement elements, but criminals. Sarkis: What is the role of the Syrian Arab Forces and the other Lebanese forces in fighting narcotics? Salim: The Syrian brothers have greatly helped us in combating narcotics. They still do so. The most important help was their destruction of narcotics in al-Biqa' Valley, where an estimated 200,000 dunams [one dunam equals 1,000 square meters] planted annually with poppies, yielding a crop of 800 tons of hashish and 700 kgs of heroin. Thanks to cooperation with them and with the Lebanese Army, the State Security Department, and the Public Security Department, we got results. We are all one team fighting this epidemic, because everyone suffers from it. It is a very dangerous disease that is worrying the whole world. [passage omitted] Sarkis: Several drug-trafficking operations have been foiled. Does this mean there are still drugs around, even if in smaller quantities than before? Salim: I know this question is still being asked. I have already said that a large hashish crop was produced annually in al-Biqa'. For two years now, the area has been clear of opium and hashish plantations. Last year they tried to cultivate 8.5 percent of the area they formerly cultivated but they were caught and the crop was destroyed. However, part of the hashish crop of two years ago is still around and has not been marketed. Sarkis: How much of the original crop? Salim: About six or seven percent, I think. Stored hashish decays with time. It is not long-lived and the oily narcotic substance in it evaporates, diluting the drug. We proved this by conducting laboratory analyses on some confiscated specimens. Over some period of time we found that the narcotic was diluted by a ratio of 11 to 4. Sarkis: Will a day come when the stored hashish will run out completely? Salim: It will end. We have received information that they are burying the hashish underground or hiding it inside wall cavities. This means that the drug is not as plentiful as before and I expect this reserve to be used up in one year. I wish to point out that hashish was first cultivated in Lebanon in 1976. The opium poppy was first planted here 19 years ago. Two years ago Lebanon became practically clean as a result of a decision by the highest authorities to combat the narcotics trade. As a judicial police force, we made efforts to achieve this objective on the instructions of our superiors. [passage omitted] Sarkis: Are there any statistics on the number of addicts in Lebanon? Have decreased since the counternarcotics campaign? Salim: We must distinguish between an addict and an occasional user. The latter uses drugs only occasionally; this is a pre-addiction phase. I believe a user eventually turns into an addict. On this point I differ with the psychiatrists who say that whether a user becomes an addict depends on his receptivity. In Lebanon there are occasional users and also addicts. No definite number is known. There are many occasional users. According to statistics, in some villages 70 in every 1,000 citizens are occasional users. If we consider the quantity of drugs that enters Lebanon and is then reexported, we will realize that the number of addicts is not very large. In my personal estimation there are 50,000 occasional users and addicts in the country. This is a relatively small percentage of the population compared with other countries. [passage omitted] Sarkis: Does anyone active in the narcotics trade enjoy protection? Salim: The instructions of His Excellency the President and other officials are to combat narcotics. No Lebanese drug trafficker has protection, no matter who he is. Anyone involved in the drug trade will be penalized. These are the orders of the highest authorities. [passage omitted]
