Uzbekistan at the Crossroads..."] [Text] To criticize the actions of the government is an ignoble deed, especially if the government is Central Asian. Therefore one can only guess why Uzbek entrepreneur Rustam Usmanov is forgiven for any negative statements he makes against the government. Moreover, he is the president of the only private bank in the republic (Rustambank) and also deputy chairman of the Republic Commission on Control of Economic Reforms, whose edict on conducting them was recently signed by Islam Karimov. [Polupanov] What does Uzbekistan's economic reform consist of? They say that it is oriented toward the Turkish model. [Usmanov] Since the first days of the republic's independence our president has been travelling through various countries. He visited Turkey and then discussed the Turkish version. When he arrived home from Germany he discussed the German model. But our local journalists, not understanding that Karimov was simply discussing the experience of these countries, decided that we want to follow Turkey's path. As of today there are certain bad subordinates in the president's inner circle and they are doing him a disservice. In the autumn I travelled through the fields of Andizhan, Fergana, and Namangan Oblasts. It was raining and the children were picking cotton. They were experiencing "percentomania" again. I spoke with the leaders of certain oblasts. They said that Tashkent was forcing them to do this. Nothing of the kind. Islam Karimov has said that the oblast authorities should not intervene in the affairs of agricultural workers. The economy stands only to lose when enterprises are closed and the people are working in the fields. Losses will not be covered from the sale of this costly cotton. [Polupanov] The administrative-command system of management is being retained in the republic as it was before. Under these conditions, how is it possible to switch to the market? [Usmanov] I agree, our system is authoritarian, but with a human face. Today it is our only chance of preserving political stability in the republic. We do not want a Karabakh and we do not want a Dniester region. Conditions are not yet ripe for transition to the market in Uzbekistan. Gradually a new foundation will be placed under the old edifice of the economy. Regardless of how much our friends and enemies may say that Uzbekistan has no democracy, that will change nothing. Today we have the kind of authority we need. [Polupanov] The first thing that strikes a Muscovite arriving in Tashkent is the absence of a broad network of commercial stores. [Usmanov] All our goods used to be distributed through state structures. And the people sitting there were able to line their pockets fairly well from this. Therefore they first gave permission for private entrepreneurial activity and then they banned it, understanding that they were being deprived of easy money. Today under the laws I have the right to open my own commercial store. But at the same time there is in force a telegram from the republic's deputy prime minister prohibiting me from selling certain groups of goods that are produced in the republic. There are certain other stores in Tashkent, but in the rayons they have closed them down, blaming the telegram. Therefore the commercial stores have lost their opportunity to trade legally and have gone underground. Of course, nobody pays taxes. [Polupanov] And how are they now? [Usmanov] Very high. Entrepreneurs have to pay a total of up to 70 percent of their profit. But I know of merchants who operate illegally whose monthly turnover reaches a billion rubles. Many of our businessmen leave to do business in neighboring republics and the majority of them are working in Moscow. I am very sorry that the republic is losing these people because today it is necessary to spend a considerable amount of money on training personnel like them. But perhaps Karimov's recently signed edict will motivate these people to work in the republic. Until 1 July 1995 customs duties have been removed from imports of all kinds of goods brought into Uzbekistan, and the conditions for issuing licenses for trade have finally been abolished. [Polupanov] There has been a lot of discussion of the sum-coupon recently. Among people there is the opinion that Uzbekistan was forced to change over to its own currency and that Russia is to blame for this. They say that anti-Russian sentiments in Uzbekistan have grown stronger because of this. [Usmanov] There can be no anti-Russian sentiments in the republic. Because our people are international by nature. Regardless of who our neighbor may be, the Uzbek will respect him under the condition that he is a good neighbor. Our republic uses somewhere around 50 percent of its national income for subsidies in order to maintain prices for gasoline, bread, and so forth. That is why we held back for a certain amount of time. After Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan introduced their own money, all the mass of rubles rushed to us. These monetary notes are the obligation of the Central Bank of Russia to us. After issuing us this money, Russia received goods from us. Therefore it was simply obligated to exchange this money for new money. Or return our goods to us. But, on the other hand, the requirements the Russian Government established for creating a ruble zone I consider to be just. [Polupanov] Are you speaking about the gold reserve? [Usmanov] Both about the gold reserve and about the fact that our Central Bank must report to the Central Bank of Russia. But the exchange rate of 1:3 at which Russia suggests we exchange our money I consider to be illegal, there is no such exchange rate. Four months ago the buying power of the Uzbek ruble was much greater than the Russian one. Today Russia is playing dirty. It is giving 1993 Russian money to Tajikistan in order to pump out our resources more cheaply through this republic. They want Tajikistan's help in bringing the Asian republics to their knees before Russia. It is not difficult to guess where the breaking of ties among the republics will lead. Even today some of our entrepreneurs are working three or four days a week. We are losing Russia as a supplier of raw material and a market for selling our goods. But Russia does not understand that its own situation is getting worse too. The Central Asian region includes about 60 million people. This is a large market for selling Russian goods, which cannot compete in the West. But we will not get down on our knees before Russia, we will find other partners. Today this is Turkey, and tomorrow it could be China and the Arab countries. But the Russian-speaking population in Uzbekistan would be placed in a situation where they are cut off from Russia. This cannot be allowed, because 50 percent of the population in Kazakhstan is Russian-speaking, Uzbekistan--20 percent, Tajikistan--30 percent, and Kyrgyzstan--40 percent. If all these people wanted to leave Central Asia for Russia, imagine how much money it would take. [Polupanov] Anyway, how did you manage to legalize your capital (if this is not a trade secret, of course)? [Usmanov] In 1987 I was one of the first people in Uzbekistan to open up my own cooperative, Mechta, after borrowing 500 rubles from my neighbor to invest in the authorized charter capital. During the first year we received 18,000 in profit, and the next year--200,000. Then, when our bureaucratic apparatus began a mass attack on the cooperatives, I reorganized my enterprise into a kolkhoz. But still I was having constant conflicts with the banking system. I was forced to study the instructions of the State Bank much more deeply than bank employees do. At that time many of us were making money and going underground. But I spent all my money on the development of my own enterprise. Now I have more than 100 trucks, a whole fleet of passenger cars, and several plants for processing agricultural products. Therefore last year when the government suggested that I open a bank there was no problem about where to get the money. I put up all my property. The audit service came and inspected it. And that made up the bank's authorized charter capital. Today I have an opportunity to help children's homes and homes for the elderly. And the main thing is that I create all the proper conditions for my workers to work. I read this sentence about myself in a magazine: "The capitalist Usmanov has created communism for his workers." There is a point in working for this.
