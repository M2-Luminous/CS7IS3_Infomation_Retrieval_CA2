FR941025-0-00035 FR941025-0-00008 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;40&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;9045; AD 94&hyph;21&hyph;03] Airworthiness Directives; Jetstream Model 4101 Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Jetstream Model 4101 airplanes, that requires installation of a placard near the decouple control handle for the elevator control system to ensure that the pilots are made aware that maintenance action is required to reset the disconnect unit once the decouple control handle has been pulled. This amendment is prompted by a report that, if the decouple control handle for the elevator control system is pulled, the lock linkage will remain unlocked until it is reset during maintenance. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent reduced controllability of the airplane due to loss of the mechanical linkage between the pilots' elevator controls, and each pilot having control authority over only one-half of the elevator control system. DATES: Effective November 25, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of November 25, 1994. ADDRESSES: The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Jetstream Aircraft, Inc., P.O. Box 16029, Dulles International Airport, Washington, DC 20041&hyph;6029. This information may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, Rules Docket, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William Schroeder, Aerospace Engineer, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056; telephone (206) 227&hyph;2148; fax (206) 227&hyph;1320. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Jetstream Model 4101 airplanes was published in the Federal Register on May 18, 1994 (59 FR 25843). That action proposed to require installation of a placard on the left forward trim panel of the center console in line with the decouple control handle of the elevator to ensure that the pilots are made aware that maintenance action is required to reset the disconnect unit once the decouple control handle has been pulled. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the single comment received. The commenter supports the proposed rule. After careful review of the available data, including the comment noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. The FAA estimates that 8 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 1 work hour per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $440, or $55 per airplane.
