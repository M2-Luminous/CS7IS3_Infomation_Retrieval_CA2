Trouble began over two weeks ago, when a section of the Army demanded a huge pay increase. Since then, there have been clashes around Maseru. A number of soldiers have been killed, and fears of a coup against Ntsu Mokhehle's government are in the air. There has even been talk of this other southern African peacekeeping force being sent in. On the line to Maseru, Timothy Ecott asked one of the Commonwealth envoys, Max Gaylard, how they had got on today. [Begin recording] [Gaylard] Well, we had a very long day. We spent all of the morning with one of the two groups and spent all of the afternoon with the second group. Each group consists of 10 persons, soldiers, NCO's [noncommissioned officers], and junior officers, and that was the modus operandi. [Ecott] And what did the two groups have to say to you? [Gaylard] Well, we encouraged them in each case to talk to us and let us know their grievances and try to get to the bottom of the current difficulties. [Ecott] And can you now, having met the two factions, explain what the problem is within the Lesotho Army? [Gaylard] Well, I think it is a little bit early for me to pronounce on that. We have been here three days as you know, and I think some of the problems go back a bit further than that. But it was a constructive day, because I think we got two or three--not I think--we did get two or three quite strong commitments from both delegations, and I think the most important commitment to mention was the unequivocal commitment to the democratically elected Government of Lesotho. [Ecott] But does that mean, though, that they will stop fighting each other, or is that a separate problem? [Gaylard] Everything is connected, I suppose, in one way or another, but I was going to go on to say that a second common commitment from the two of them, there is no doubt that both sides don't want to fight anymore. They have stopped in the last three or four days. There is no guarantee right now that they won't start again, but I think it is less likely because the tensions have lessened. They are now into a procedure of talking. And, eventually, not in the near future, hopefully we will bring the two delegations together [word indistinct] the government, but they are committed to talks, there is no doubt about that. [Ecott] But, at the moment, presumably, the two factions are still well armed, and they are still facing each other with the potential to start fighting if they feel that you are not solving their difficulties. [Gaylard] Yes, yes, they are certainly armed. They are not exactly facing each other. I suppose, if you want to be technical, they are separated by four or five miles, the two main groups. But as I said, the tensions have lessened. We are hoping in the next one or two days that we will be able to control the talking process. [Ecott] Can you, though, exactly explain in simple terms what the fight is all about, because that doesn't seem to have been adequately explained by anyone? [Gaylard] It is a little bit early to give you a definitive answer on that, but I can say that it is a fight between two factions of the Army. What I am suggesting is that it is not an antigovernment problem, as far as we can see. In fact, today, as I say, both were at pains to tell us that they supported the government. [Ecott] And what is the government's role and view of the situation now? [Gaylard] Well, you would want to talk to government itself about that, but our position is that our bottom line is that we are here to support the government in its efforts to resolve the problem. Now, what they have done is facilitate our role as facilitators, if you like, and that has been no easy task, even just getting into barracks--that had to be arranged by government and has been done. Of course, in our early meetings with the troops, we accompanied a minister from government who addressed the troops in both camps. [end recording]
