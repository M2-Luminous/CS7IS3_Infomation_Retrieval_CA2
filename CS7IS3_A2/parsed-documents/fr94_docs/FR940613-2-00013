FR940613-2-00013 FR940613-2-00006 III. Availability of Funds Funds are available on a competitive basis to any public or private university, qualified public or private institution, individual, or coastal state (including Great Lakes States, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Northern Marianas Islands) to conduct research within National Estuarine Research Reserves. Because NOAA has substantial involvement in the research, NERRS research funds are normally awarded through a cooperative agreement. NOAA may be involved in the project in the following manner: The Sanctuaries and Reserves Division (SRD), Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management, reserves the right to immediately halt activity on this project if it becomes obvious that the project is not fulfilling the mission of the National Estuarine Research Reserve System goals. Day-to-day management is the responsibility of the Principal Investigators, however, frequent guidance and direction is provided by the Federal Government for the successful conduct of this project. Non-compliance with a Federally approved management plan may result in immediate halting of the project. It is our intention to review and approve each stage of work before the next begins to assure quality scientific progression and results that will produce viable information on which to form valid, productive coastal management decisions. Managers, Research Coordinators, and all other staff at NERRS sites are ineligible to submit competitive research proposals under this Announcement. In FY92 through FY94, SRD provided funding in the amount of approximately $700,000, each year, for research in the NERRS. The approximate range of funding per successful project in recent years has been between $30,000 and $70,000. In FY95, it is expected that approximately $700,000 will be available for funding new one- and two-year projects at similar levels. Federal funds requested must be matched by the applicant by at least 30% of the total cost of the project. For example, it the total project cost is $10,000, the Federal share is $7,000, the non-Federal match is $3,000. Note: The match requirement was decreased from 50% to 30% by Coastal Zone Act Reauthorization Amendments of 1990. The required match must be with cash or the value of goods and services directly benefiting the project in accordance with 15 CFR part 24, ``Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements with State and Local Governments,'' and OMB Circular A&hyph;110, ``Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements with Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals, and Other Nonprofit Organizations.'' It is anticipated that projects receiving funding under this announcement will begin in the spring/summer of 1995. Earliest anticipated start date is May 1, 1995. Applicants not familiar with the requirements of a cooperative agreement or who need additional information on application requirements are encouraged to contact SRD. IV. Purpose and Priorities Research funds are used to support management-related projects that will: enhance scientific understanding of Reserve environments; provide information needed by Reserve Managers and coastal zone decision makers; and improve public awareness of estuaries and estuarine management issues. Research projects may be oriented to specific Reserves; however, projects that involve or benefit more than one Reserve in the national system will be given higher priority. The primary research objective for the NERRS is the study of the causes and effects of natural and anthropogenically-induced change in the ecology of esturaine and estuarine-like ecosystems. All research funded through SRD should be designed to provide information of significant value to the development and implementation of resource management policy governing the U.S. coastal zone, for which NOAA's Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management has management and regulatory responsibilities. Beginning in FY93, SRD established a series of two-year research priority categories to serve as foci for the SRD competitive research program (see below). The FY95&hyph;96 research priority, which is the subject of this notice, is habitat restoration. Every two years, SRD will review future research needs and establish the next two-year research priority.
