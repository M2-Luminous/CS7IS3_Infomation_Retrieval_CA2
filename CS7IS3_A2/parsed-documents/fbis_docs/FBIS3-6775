Soldiers from the SLORC [State Law and Order Restoration Council] defense services have the habit of forcefully abducting villagers from Shwekyin Township, Pegu Division with various reasons, and sometimes none. Some of those abducted died in prison, while others have been jailed for prolonged periods without any charges. Ko Soe Min will present the news as reported by Ko Hnin Wai, a Democratic Voice of Burma [DVB] journalist from the Manerplaw Bureau. Dear listeners: On 11 April 1992, Lieutenant Chit Swe Myint and group, a SLORC military column, from Regiment 57, forcefully arrested U Shar Maung, 57, from Mingalar Village for collaborating with insurgents. U Shar Maung was jailed in the Shwepyinyein camp in Shwekyin Township and then transferred to the jail in Pegu. Although his wife, Daw Daung, had to pay a bribe of 20,000 kyat for the release of her husband, U Shar Maung died in the Pegu jail on 11 October 1993 because of injuries he received during his arrest and lack of food while in jail. On 5 November 1992, Company Commander Lt. Myint Zaw and group from Regiment 349 came and arrested (Tatlulu), 26, son of U (Toeyoto) in (Mar Gauk) village -- a red faction Pa-O village -- in Shwekyin Township. During the arrest, the soldiers also destroyed the (?curry pots) which were meant to be sold to woodcutters. (Tatlulu) was jailed in Shwekyin, where he died on 18 October 1993. On 1 May 1992, woodcutter U Po Pein, 52, from Myetnu Village, Shwekyin Township, was wrongfully arrested by Deputy Regimental Commander Major Hla Nyunt and group from Regiment 350 and he is detained in Shwekyin jail till now. Similarly, on 1 May 1992, while U Kyaw Myint, 27, from Shansu village, Shwekyin Township, was on his way to cut firewood, Company Commander Lt. Thein Win and group from Regiment 350 tied him up and took him away, accusing him of being a hardcore insurgent. U Kyaw Myint is still in the Shwekyin jail today. On that same day, U (Khawtaw Ne Oo), 22, from the same village, was taken into custody by a group led by Sergeant Sann Myint from Regiment 350, and he is believed to be in the Shwekyin jail. Similarly, Ko Kyaw Shwe, 27, from the village of Shansu, was arrested by Company Commander Lt. Thein Win and group from Regiment 350.
