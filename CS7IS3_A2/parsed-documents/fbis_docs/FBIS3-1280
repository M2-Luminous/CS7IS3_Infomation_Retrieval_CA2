Speaking at a press conference at South Africa's Ciskei Embassy in King William's Town on Wednesday, leader of a Transitional Executive Council [TEC] task force Mr Zam Titus also said the SADF [South African Defense Force] was fully aware of the situation in all parts of Ciskei and ready to take action at a moment's notice. He declined to say whether the SADF was already in the territory. He said he understood that Brig Gqozo was still at the presidential palace in Bisho, but busy packing. Earlier Ciskei's minister of foreign affairs, Mr Mickey Webb, said he had had a glass of grape juice with Brig Gqozo in the palace that afternoon. "He's packing his suitcase. His wife is arranging his belongings." Mr Titus said Ciskei's ministers were no longer in power or in control. "We will be talking to them tomorrow about how they move out...they are out and that is the situation and that is quite clear." The TEC team met representatives of the territory's civil servants on Wednesday evening and a follow-up meeting would be arranged within the next fortnight. The task force said in a statement after the meeting that a process to look into the grievances of public servants had been established. Grievances already identified would be given urgent attention. A member of the TEC task force on the civil service, Philip Dexter, said Ciskei government workers should not be concerned about their pensions. The task force was going to ensure "real transparency" on issues such as this. He said the safety of pensions was guaranteed in the constitution -- the strongest guarantee one could get. The new administration, headed by joint administrators Piet Goosen and Rev Bongani Finca, would ensure that all civil servants would have the right to join the union of their choice. He said the TEC team would have to move into the government offices in Bisho as soon as possible to establish a physical presence there. On Thursday the team would be review the positions of department heads. Mr Titus said he would be in charge of reviewing the territory's laws, in co-operation with a larger team. "For starters we simply have to provide that all existing laws will continue," he said. However, unjust laws would be changed. The joint administrators of Ciskei would review Ciskei's representation on the TEC. Steps would be taken on Thursday to ensure a proper inventory of public property was compiled. People asked Mr Titus whether stability could be restored to Ciskei within two or three days. He was confident that the territory was moving towards this situation. "We already have the co-operation of everyone that matters. The TEC, working hand in hand with the South African Government, are in effective control of the situation."
