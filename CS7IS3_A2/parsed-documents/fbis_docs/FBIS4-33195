The Army spokeswoman has said the guerrillas are the only ones capable of placing such bombs, which endanger the lives of the people, as what happened the night of 31 May when they exploded in the urban sector. The explosions caused damage to Climat, a boutique located at No. 13-70 7th Avenue, Zone 9, and the residence of lawyer Fernando Quezada Toruno, the brother of Monsignor Rodolfo Quezada Toruno, president of the Civil Sectors Assembly. The URNG could be responsible for the two bombs at the two locations, Government Minister Danilo Parrinello Blanco said yesterday. We knew of a terrorist escalation, but we cannot ascertain the guerrillas are responsible for the bomb explosions, although, by logic, we can surmise they did it, the minister said. There is no other reason to think this was an action by another group, but the investigations under way will confirm it, Parrinello Blanco concluded.
