The Cuban foreign minister thus disclosed to Uruguayan representatives the fact that "the time was not ripe" to institute political changes in his country "due to a still prevalent foreign pressure," an obviously allusion to the trade boycott imposed by the United States on the island's communist regime. Furthermore, Robaina commented on the alleged violations of human rights in his country, noting that "the only argument those who are waging a human rights campaign against Cuba can cling to (sic) is the issue of political liberties and party affiliation." The Cuban foreign minister has therefore openly paraded his lack of familiarity with current democratic thinking, according to which his remarks sound, if nothing else, surprising. Indeed, his mere admission that the U.S. trade boycott is used as the underlying reason for the Cuban regime's systematic refusal to open the gates of freedom of expression in Cuba constitutes the clearest acknowledgment of the essentially arbitrary nature of the Cuban dictatorial regime. Havana has cunningly devised a well-orchestrated attempt to present the U.S. boycott as a "blockade," an "embargo," or a kind of "sanitary cordon" that is virtually driving Cuba to famine. It should be clearly asserted that this is not the case. The United States has imposed a trade boycott on Cuba, thus severing all U.S. trade relations with this island. In the eyes of any stalwart supporter of Castro's regime, this ought to be simply a welcome gesture of consistency on the part of the United States. Not in vain has Castroism been preaching to the hemisphere, for nearly 40 years, about the most drastic rupture possible with the United States. What is still more serious, however, is the attempt by Fidel Castro and his followers to construe this international political reality as the cause for their adamant refusal to allow Cubans to have access to democracy. This means, in the strictest sense of the word, that Cuban citizens are truly hostages to the communist regime. Within this context, Minister Robaina's utterances concerning the campaign denouncing human rights violations -- which can "only cling to" (sic) the systematic contempt for political freedom, including freedom of association -- are even more revealing. It is obvious that the Cuban diplomat brushes aside this area of public liberty as insignificant, and we have reason to believe that the regime he represents shares his views. In fact, it would be very interesting to listen to the commentaries of such a eulogist of Castroism, for whom the name of General Pinochet in Chile is, for example, anathema. He ought to explain right now, and clearly, what makes this repression desirable in Havana and yet revolting in other parts of the Americas. This explanation will surely not be forthcoming for a long time, because even though Castroist leaders and their sidekicks are not familiar with democratic values, they really know the dark side of the system they represent. Otherwise, Minister Robaina's efforts in Montevideo to express his wish to see a reality in Cuba which "in the not too distant future would involve living together under a multiparty system in that country" would become incomprehensible. These remarks are particularly auspicious in that they were uttered by a government official who until very recently labelled multiparty systems as "multi-rubbish." Despite the praiseworthy attempts by the young Cuban foreign minister to present his country's political regime in the light of the promised economic changes -- or at least to concede the clearly critical situation in Cuba -- his remarks are neither convincing nor timely at a point when the island is facing a shodown on its path toward freedom. For all the persuasuve attempts to disguise its actual makeup, the Cuban dictatorship is a reality that has outlived its useful life and is doomed to end up in the dusty attic where the sad ideology that once inspired it is already languishing.
