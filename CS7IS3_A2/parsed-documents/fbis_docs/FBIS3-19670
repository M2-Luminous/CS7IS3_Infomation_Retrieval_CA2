"This is also true for ethnic conflicts, which should not be neglected. After all, NATO membership is also a declaration of support for basic democratic values and thus the guarantee for stability within the member states. This also applies to the new Partnership for Peace [PfP]." [Stoeger] Is the Partnership, which was adopted in January, and which even Russia now intends to join, to be regarded as a step-by-step extension of NATO? [Woerner] Partnership for Peace is intended to extend stability further to the East, but must not be regarded as an antechamber to NATO or as waiting room for accession to the community. A step-by-step extension of NATO is quite possible -- and also desirable. However, not all countries that want to can immediately join NATO. It requires coordination. For some countries that participate in Partnership for Peace it is certainly the path toward NATO membership, while for others it is not. [Stoeger] Austria is also free to join the partnership, but it has so far shown little interest. What will NATO do to convince the Austrians of the advantage of such accession? [Woerner] Nothing. The Austrians know themselves what they have to do and they are free to decide. Moreover, Partnership for Peace is only an offer that may or may not be taken up. NATO will certainly not force its friendship upon anybody. All I can say is if you do not want to, well, then you do not have to. We have enough applicants. [Stoeger] Some former East Bloc countries initially rejected this offer as insufficient, but ultimately accepted it. Why? [Woerner] Because there is no efficient alternative. Why is everybody trying so hard to get into NATO? Because of our beautiful blue eyes? Certainly not. It is because we offer absolute security. This is not only hot air but the essence of the security concept. NATO will certainly not stand idly by in case a partner is attacked. Still I will not say what we would do. That is also part of deterrence. [Stoeger] Both Greece and Turkey are NATO members; nevertheless, the Cyprus problem remains unsolved. [Woerner] The Cyprus problem is not within NATO's responsibility, but within that of the United Nations. Yet, NATO membership certainly prevented escalation, because there is still more dynamite around. If the two countries involved were not members the problem would be much worse. [Stoeger] As in the former Yugoslavia? What has NATO been able to do in this conflict? [Woerner] First of all, I would like to emphasize that in this conflict the responsibility does not lie with the United Nations. An earlier use of limited military power would have been better, as could be seen by the example of the Sarajevo ultimatum. NATO has long since been ready, but the UN order did not come. Now one is able to regain credibility. After all, peace securing includes three main points: first, the necessary means to deter the aggressors, second, the will to use these means fully if necessary, third, also to make that clear to the aggressor. [Stoeger] Still, particularly in the case of the Balkan war, there are still some deficits, especially regarding the Serbian embargo. [Woerner] By and large, the sea embargo is working. Here there are no problems. NATO units have virtually sealed off the coast. The NATO-monitored no-fly zone is also being respected. Still, as far as efficiency is concerned there are still deficits, particularly regarding coordination between the United Nations and NATO. In many cases UN orders to take action take too long. NATO would be able to react much faster.
