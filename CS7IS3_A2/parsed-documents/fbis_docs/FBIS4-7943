Meciar was speaking at a meeting of his Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) which was marked with strong criticism of President Michal Kovac and especially of Jozef Moravcik's government. Meciar said that "Peter Weiss is playing a big game going beyond the borders of his party, and this even at the cost of the SDL's disintegration," Meciar said referring to the unsuccessful talks between the HZDS and the SDL on the formation of a coalition government before Meciar's government fell on March 11. Meciar claimed that during his meeting with President Bill Clinton last year, Carnogursky presented a three-point plan aimed at disintegration of the HZDS with the help of Milan Knazko (fired by Meciar from the post of foreign minister in March 1993), to be followed by the restoration of Czechoslovakia. Meciar also said that present Premier Jozef Moravcik and Deputy Premier Roman Kovac "would have had to leave the government because they had made gross mistakes." Moravcik was foreign minister and Kovac held the same post as now. Meciar today accused both of them of inactivity and of telling lies. "In the material which he had prepared for me before my trip to Rome, Moravcik called the Vatican the center of ideological subversion," Meciar said.
