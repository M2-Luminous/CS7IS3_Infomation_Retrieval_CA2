But One Should Not Expect To Earn $20 Billion"] [Text] Last week, the INTERFAX news agency reported: "Viktor Samoylov, general director of the state-owned "Rosvooruzheniye" company, believes that Russia could potentially sell $20 billion worth of arms and military hardware in 1994." General Samoylov has said in an interview for SEGODNYA, however, that "he was quoted not quite accurately." In 1993, arms exports amounted to around $2 billion, so a drastic ten-fold increase in exports is impossible in principle." "The signing of a military-technical export contract usually requires a few years of preparatory work, whereas our company has just been set up." In 1994, the "Rosvooruzheniye" state company expects to achieve better results than it had in 1993, but not to increase exports "ten-fold." Gen. Samoylov also stressed that "Russia is by no means going to violate UN sanctions against Iraq, Libya, and Yugoslavia. Any such statements, whoever might make them, will only undermine faith in Russia as a trade partner." A drastic reduction in state military orders has been prompting defense industry managers to demand that they be given a free hand in foreign trade. Many arms manufacturers have been conducting talks with various foreign middlemen for a number of years already, but not a single large contract has reached the signing stage. Gen. Samoylov said that "`Rosvooruzheniye' has perfect relations with all the main arms manufacturers. As for the claims that the state company is a monster that may stifle the military-industrial sector, they come from those whom the presidential edict on setting up the `Rosvooruzheniye' state company has prevented from carrying out their effectively semi-criminal activity -- attempts to export state-of-the-art weapons in small consignments or in single pieces."
