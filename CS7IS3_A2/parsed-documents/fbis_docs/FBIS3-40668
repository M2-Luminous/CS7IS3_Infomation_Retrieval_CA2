The Karnataka Government does not know what to do about him and simply ignores him. But, for thousands of anti-Dunkel Draft (now anti-GATT activists, he is a hero. Instead of restricting himself to merely holding seminars, carrying banners and shouting slogans, Karnataka Farmers' Association President M.D. Nanjunda Swamy has achieved the seemingly impossible: his supporters twice attacked and destroyed facilities belonging to the multinational seed company, Cargill Seeds India Limited. And even though his hand has been clearly indicated in the attacks, the authorities have neither the courage nor the inclination to take action against him. Now with the General Agreement on Trades and Tariffs becoming reality, Nanjunda Swamy intends taking his anti-GATT show on the road. Starting this month, he will deliver lectures at various universities urging the youth to stay away from products manufactured by multinational corporations (MNCs). This lecture tour will begin at Hyderabad and will continue with Banares, Aligarh and Ahmedabad. On January 1, he will hold farmers' meetings at Dharmapuri to spread the message about how GATT is going to destroy them and their way of life. Tamil Nadu is a sore point with Nanjunda Swamy because he claims the Jayalalitha Government has used repressive measures to prevent anti-Dunkel Draft meetings in the past. "As an old student of socialism, I look at MNCs as the last vestiges of capitalism. I call them last vestiges because they will be wiped out by people's movements," he says. "People in all countries are unhappy with GATT. That is why I believe there will be a global people's movement. Before the treaty, the people had a chance to elect their own governments which took care of their interests. After GATT, the role of Governments will be reduced in favour of the free trade regime, in other words the MNCs." What about any more gung-ho attacks like the ones on Cargill Seeds facilities at Bangalore and Bellary, in North Karnataka? "Definitely," he says, adding that his next target will be the American W.R. Grace and Company, which has set up a neem extraction plant at Tumkur, near Bangalore. According to him the farmers have stayed away from W.R. Grace till now as the company used hexane, an explosive, in its extraction process. However, they are working on how to get around this. According to Nanjunda Swamy, W.R. Grace is attempting to patent the pesticidal properties of neem, an accusation which has been denied several times by the company. Unfazed: Denials have never fazed him; he simply ignores them and prepares a new line of attack. Nanjunda Swamy is a shrewd politician, using a combination of truths and half-truths to whip up passions. For instance, his first attack against Cargill Seeds centered around the accusation that seed patenting, as laid out in the Dunkel Draft, would mean that farmers would not have the right to re-plant the seeds they have harvested. When this was proved false, he came up with another accusation -- that Cargill seed producers had destroyed 500 acres of sunflower fields in Dharwad district of Karnataka. This story too proved to be false. On another occasion he accused Cargill of paying its seed producing farmers only Rs 3 per kilo of sunflower seeds acquired by them and selling it at Rs 85 per kilo. In reality, Cargill pays Rs 45 per kilo. Cargill now conducts its operations under heavy police protection. But this will not deter Nanjunda Swamy. He says. "What are a few cozen policemen against us? I could bring 6 lakh farmers to Bangalore, you think I can't take care of Cargill?" Along with W.R. Grace, Nanjundaswamy, intends to attack other multinational seed companies operating in Karnataka -- Pioneer Seeds, Continental Seeds and Sandoz India Limited. "I want to drive them out," he says. On a larger scale, the Association will link up with other regional groups to fight multinationals like Pepsi, Coke, MacDonald's, Burger King and Kentucky Fried Chicken. The Association is also opposing Madonna's tour of India next year.
