Now, in a twist of fate, those two men are on the same side, pushing the Hong Kong democracy barrow. The Labour man, Dr Jack Cunningham, a scientist-turned politician, is Britain's shadow foreign secretary, in Beijing this week to tell China his party won't be taking its side against the British Government. And the man he is lining up with, whose roof he slept under in Hong Kong, is none other than his old campaign foe, now the territory's Governor, Chris Patten. "Someone asked me a very funny question at dinner the other night," says Dr Cunningham in his broad Geordie [northeastern] accent. "If Labour had won the election but I'd lost my seat would I be Governor of Hong Kong?" He doesn't know the answer. And, strictly speaking, he cannot say for sure whether Labour will keep the present government's Hong Kong policy--and its choice of Governor--if it wins the British election due before 1997. But he thinks it unwise to dump either, and unlikely: "It's difficult to conceive of wiping the slate clean and starting again, especially if it's 1996," Dr Cunningham says. "A Labour Government in the future is not something I can make declarations about now but, speaking personally, my commitment is to these proposals and it is difficult to conceive of circumstances in which we would throw the whole lot out. And, for my own part, I don't think it would be sensible for us to come in and remove the Governor, put someone else in." Dr Cunningham says a member of Mr Patten's family was amazed to hear him saying nice things about the Governor in a television interview: "I said yes, you wouldn't have seen me doing that two years ago." But two years is a long time in politics and Dr Cunningham, who represents Copeland in Cumbria and has been a member of parliament for 23 of his 54 years, is well accustomed to a system in which your former foes become your hosts. He and Mr Patten previously crossed swords when Mr Patten was environment secretary and he was Labour's spokesman. He sees their present roles as a curious twist of history. He is quick to dismiss the notion that Mr Patten's high Hong Kong profile may be aimed at furthering his political future back home. He says a total breakdown of the China-Britain talks on Hong Kong, withdrawal of Mr Patten's reform package, undermining both him and Prime Minister John Major--perhaps fatally wounding the government-- would not be a good result for Labour. "The outcome of that is a Labour Government that has to resolve this problem and I don't think you can do that just by taking China's side," he says. In fact, contrary to speculation that Chinese Embassy lobbying of MPs in London may be weakening support for Mr Patten's reforms, Dr Cunningham has made it clear to China he will not be backing it against the Tories. Asked if he had been lobbied in London, where he has met Chinese Ambassador Ma Yuzhen and Chinese Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji, he said: "Not overtly," then added, "no, that's not quite true." China's view during those talks was that the Patten plan should be withdrawn. "I think they hoped we would come to that point of view but we did not and we have not and nothing that happened in Peking (Beijing) would lead me to recommend that course of action to my colleagues in London. "I regard the proposals as very modest. It is a bit difficult to concede that this is some huge gulf that cannot be bridged." So, what achievements from his three days in Beijing, his first visit, does he have to report at today's shadow Cabinet meeting? Dr Cunningham says he learned a lot (references to his meetings with "Mr Rongji" at his Friday press conference showed there was definite scope to expand his knowledge of China) but says he did not know before he went why the Sino-British talks broke down; and he still does not know. Those he met in China included Vice-President Li Lanqing, Vice Foreign Minister Jiang Enzhu, and director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office Lu Ping. He has asked them to explain, in writing just how the Patten plan conflicts with the Basic Law and what amendments they want. "I just wanted to try to get a clearer understanding of the Chinese reasons for this stand over Hong Kong, the breakdown, and to make sure the Chinese were absolutely clear about my position and that of the British Labour Party, and to establish good personal relationships and contacts." As a long-time politician, strategist, and media performer, Dr Cunningham could hardly be dubbed a straight talker. But he is willing to be blunt where it seems due. Like Mr Patten, he sees a conflict in the Chinese position: President Jiang Zemin says trade and politics should remain separate, yet China is dragging the airport issue into its political negotiations over Hong Kong. To allow this standoff to lead to a series of protracted economic and trade disputes would be "pretty silly" he says. The end result? "A series of self-inflicted wounds." And while he says it is never too late to take up the issue of Hong Kong democratic rights, he concedes that should have been done years ago. But to be fair, it was not just that British Governments did not take the initiative--the incentive to do so in Hong Kong was also lacking: "There's little doubt the approach of 1997 was the single biggest stimulus," he says. It is not certain Dr Cunningham would become Foreign Secretary in a future Labour Government. He was given the shadow post despite coming just 12th out of 18 in the shadow cabinet poll. But he is a strong supporter of the Labour Leader John Smith and obviously has hopes of getting the job "if I was lucky enough to," he says. If his entry in Who's Who is any sort of litmus test, Dr Cunningham has at least one qualification for taking a key role in the resolution of Hong Kong's future: Along with fly fishing, fell walking, and folk music, his hobbies include "listening to other people's opinions".
