It is a new date, published for the first time, of the active launching of the largest Czech nuclear power plant. After the decision was made about the final stage of completing two JETE units, the fuel charge was considered for the end of 1995. According to JETE press spokesman Josef Vita, the new date stems, above all, from the substantial, very time-consuming changes that are now being implemented at the construction on the recommendation of the International Atomic Energy Agency and expert analyses and the subsequent audit by the U.S. firm NUS Haliburton. Examples of this are the system of automatic control of the technological processes, the change of the nuclear fuel and related safety analyses, the new radiation-monitoring system, the completely new diagnostic systems, etc. The first 1,000-MW unit is now 96-percent completed regarding the actual construction, and 55-percent from the technical angle. The second 1,000-MW unit, which is expected to be put into operation approximately 18 months after the first, is now 80-percent completed regarding the construction, and 30-percent technically. The total cost of the construction remains at the level of 68.8 billion korunas. After all of these changes, the power plant is supposed to fully satisfy all West European operational and safety standards. At the same time, the JETE management would welcome it if the parliament finally adopted the so-called atomic law and related legislation. "It is better for us if we know under what conditions we operate than if we are to respond post factum to new legislative decisions," Vita says. The changes at JETE are supposed to be settled legislatively this year in accordance with the construction law, and all of the subcontractor transactional relations are to be settled as well. The $317-million credit approved by the U.S. EXIMBANK has not yet been used. Nothing will be done before the signing of the credit contract that is to specify the conditions for drawing the funds, including the terms for repayment. "It is in our interest that it be done as soon as possible," Vita concluded.
