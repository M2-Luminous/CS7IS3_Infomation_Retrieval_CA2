This was proposed at the provincial meeting on launching a special struggle against the law-breaking and criminal offenses of forging, reselling, and stealing receipts held in Xingcheng on 18-20 May. Directors of tax bureaus of 14 cities across the province attended the meeting. The participants summed up and exchanged experiences in dealing blows to fake receipts during the previous stage and defined tasks for launching this special struggle in the near future. Five models, including Shenyang, Anshan, Dandong, Fuxin, and Chaoyang, introduced their experiences. The meeting pointed out: If we fail to properly manage special-purpose receipts, direct and big losses of taxation of the state will inevitably be created and reform of the tax system will be a failure. Therefore, tax departments at all levels should regard the management of special-purpose receipts as an important means for guaranteeing the smooth implementation of the tax system reform and enhance the sense of responsibility and urgency. Certainly, strengthening management over special-purpose receipts does not mean to slacken efforts in the management of receipts that are not related to the value-added tax. Contrarily, we should step up our efforts to strengthen management and inspection in an effort to stop up the loophole in the management of tax revenue and financial affairs and guarantee that the state taxation and property will not be infringed. The meeting held that at present the most serious and harmful thing reflected in the problem on receipts is the forging, reselling and stealing of special-purpose receipts related to value-added tax. Using receipts to engage in law-breaking and criminal activities such as tax evasion has become a social nuisance in society. It affects many sectors, and most of these law-breaking and criminal activities are carried out covertly. It is not easy to discover and solve this problem by relying only on the inspection of tax departments. It is necessary to maintain close coordination with the public security, judicial, and procuratorial departments and take joint actions. Tax departments at all levels, when they discover the law-breaking acts of forging, reselling, and stealing receipts during their inspection and when these acts constitute a crime, should promptly transfer the persons involved to the judicial organs for punishment. The meeting stressed: Like we treat the banknotes, we should consider strengthening management over receipts as a major affair and grasp it firmly and well. We should investigate and handle each and every law-breaking and criminal activity of forging, reselling, and stealing receipts we discover, resolutely check the law-breaking acts of using receipts to bring a series of harm to society, and create a good environment for the smooth implementation of the new tax system.
