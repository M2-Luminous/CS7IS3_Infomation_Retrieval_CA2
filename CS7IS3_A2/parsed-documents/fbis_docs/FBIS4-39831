According to the report presented by the joint military command, the situation of the controlled zone was stable last week. There were cases when the control performed by military experts failed but this was not their fault. According to the report, the Dniester presidential representative Tom Zenovich impedes the military observers from controlling the Tighina fortress, where a Dniester motorized infantry battalion is located, thus breaching the Convention of 21 July 1992. The joint military command obliged the observers to signal the cases when the agreements are violated and assure the removal of obstacles. The session pointed out that the sides reduced the number of peace-keeping forces. To solve this problem, Moldovan, Russian and Dniester military departments were proposed to hold consultations regarding the number of peace-keeping soldiers and the weapons they should carry.
