Representatives of the Rostov, Bryansk, Kursk, Voronezh and Belgorod regions of russia, and the Kharkov, Lugansk, Sumy, Chernigov and Donetsk regions of Ukraine have established an executive committee of the council of leaders of frontier regions and elected co-chairmen. During the first year the work of the executive committee will be coordinated by Vasiliy Ryabykh, head of the department in the administration of the Belgorod region. One of the main documents signed by participants in the meeting is a package of proposals on inserting amendments in standard acts of the two states regulating frontier relations. The status of frontier regions envisages real business cooperation between neighboring regions. On the basis of this document import and export of industrial commodities manufactured there and intended for the use at plants located in neighboring regions, must be exempted from customs duties and taxes. Participants in the meeting also discussed the mechanism for the implementation of the Ukrainian president's decree "on measures on the development of economic cooperation among regions of Ukraine and frontier regions of the Russian Federation" which provides for the possibility for students of one republic to study in educational establishments of the other republic. It was noted at the meeting that positive experience in this field was accumulated, for instance, by the Rostov and Donetsk regions which are carrying out the exchange of students. The meeting also considered a question of setting up an association of economic cooperation called the "Russian-Ukrainian Union". However, participants in the meeting stressed that all these documents just as cooperation between separate regions of the contiguous states would remain only good wishes if the aspiration for neighborliness was not legalized by corresponding inter-state acts. In this connection participants in the meeting appealed to the presidents of Russia and Ukraine to speed up the working out and signing of a treaty on friendship, cooperation and partnership between the two states.
