There are no tumultuous political conflicts, nor is there a standoff between authorities, and a treaty on social accord has been signed. But before rejoicing at the "stabilization," it would be wise to think: What is actually being stabilized? And by what methods? Let us look carefully: The key elements of the old, Soviet system of socioeconomic life still exist and operate. Monopolies and the former structure of production are still in place. Real private property and a competitive environment are lacking. No land reform has been carried out. No democratic procedures of public control over authorities have been worked out, nor has a local self- government system been formed, there is no real division of powers.... The stabilization of such a system is not an asset. It means that Russia will remain an oligarchic and supermonopolized state, only with a new "political superstructure": without the CPSU, but with a distinct criminal tinge. This system cannot be run by normal, democratic methods. Under Soviet power, the most effective means of government were Politburo decisions. Passed by a narrow circle of people without any discussion in society, without consideration for democratic "convention," they were subject to unquestioning implementation. Unfortunately, it is precisely those decisions that the recent presidential edicts are closely reminiscent of. In his economic edicts, the president is encroaching on the State Duma's jurisdiction, demonstrating that it is incapable of creating economic legislation on time and that the government is unable to run the economy in a correct and prompt fashion. However, government by decree will hardly succeed, either. When a law is being created, a mechanism for its enforcement must be worked out simultaneously. Here we do not have any mechanism at all. The "infrastructure" for the edicts will be added by the government, and it is anyone's guess how much the ideas they contain may be distorted. Moreover, the edicts, while often expressing correct economic ideas -- which are not new, as a matter of fact -- nonetheless inevitably suffer from being unfinished, incomplete, not comprehensive. Some of them are really populist in nature. Naturally, cutting taxes is okay, but so far it is only an instruction to the government (to all appearances, only for the next year). Undoubtedly, quotas and licenses should be lifted, to say nothing of benefits. But whom will the president rely on in solving this problem? Entirely justified fears have been expressed that various political forces may use the edicts as a pretext to crank up tension, hunt for enemies, and indulge in political intrigues. But this is not the main danger; the danger is that there is a clear emphasis on antidemocratic, illegitimate, and even unconstitutional methods of government. The departure from earlier stated principles has culminated in the edict "On Urgent Measures To Protect the Population From Gangsterism and Other Forms of Organized Crime." It violates everything that can be violated: human rights, a number of federal laws, even the Constitution. Of course, at a time when the people are totally intimidated by rampant crime it is easy to evoke positive emotions by promising tight measures. But everyone must realize: Tomorrow, if not today, he himself may become a victim of legalized lawlessness. Yes, lawlessness, because there is no other name for a situation where it is laid down that crime is to be fought by unconstitutional and unlawful methods. A perfect opportunity for settling scores with rivals and for staging inter-group political showdowns.... It is entirely unclear what will now happen to our courts. How will judges act when they have, side by side before them, the edict and the laws and the Constitution it violates? However, this scenario was predetermined by the very method of preparing and adopting the Constitution. Was it not clear even at the time that we were in for a struggle against crime? If the Constitution had been discussed in society in a normal fashion, if the professionals had been given a say, would they not have warned that in our conditions 48-hour pre-trial detention is absurd? Then it would not have been necessary to "correct" the 48 hours to 30 days by edict. Before the very eyes of the entire country the very "letter," not only the much-invoked "spirit of the law" is being violated. Moreover, it is being violated by the sole guarantor of the Constitution -- the president. So does the established "system" whose stabilization some are ready to welcome allow itself to be run in this way? It is becoming clear that we did not have profound reform, what we experienced was nothing but perestroyka. "How can it be that we did not have reform?" advocates of the course will retort. "The market is filled with goods; true, they are very expensive, and more often than not they are not for all...." But nor were they meant for all formerly, and more often than not those for whom they were meant were the same people. "But formerly we did not have any democracy at all...." But it is manifestly clear especially in the light of the recent edict that we do not have it now, either. So, what's up "in the country" nowadays? For most people it is more of the same.
