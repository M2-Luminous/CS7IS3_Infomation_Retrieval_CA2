Serdykovskaya, N. Kuindzhi, ``We Are Behaving Like Comprachicos''] [Text]One of us has already written in Retsept how for many decades we have built--and are continuing to build!--school buildings which do not meet hygienic standards and how the health of many generations is affected by it. Our Institute of Child and Adolescent Hygiene (the only such science establishment not only in Russia but in the entire CIS) is engaged in research in many directions, studying the health of children and adolescents in all its diversity. Some of such studies are unique. In examining one of the biological criteria of women's health, we examined the case histories of the school period of today's first-time mothers [primapara]. They were interviewed in one of Moscow's maternity wards. Data from the questionnaires administered to each woman were complemented with information about the course of her pregnancy and the gynecological diagnosis of labor activity. The resulting studies made it possible to establish the relationship between the course of pregnancy and birth and the characteristics of their lifestyle as children and adolescents. Thus, the first year of menstrual age in 78% was accompanied by various specific manifestations of yet-unformed menstrual cycle whereby 43% of the respondents indicated a general deterioration of health or academic activity during menstrual periods. Approximately 20% of the women identified the menarche year as the most difficult year of learning at school. Among these data, the following highlights are the most interesting. Only about 20% of today's first-time mothers had normal course of pregnancy and physiological delivery. The lowest percentage of unfavorable social and biological factors during the school years was identified in this group of respondents: excessive intellectual or athletic stress, chronic pathologies, and complications during the child-bearing age. The most numerous (approximately 40%) was the contingent of women whose pregnancy and delivery pathology was due to the presence of extragenital processes in the organism as a result of an explicit or, evidently, latent chronic pathology. Allowing for the time factor, we have established that chronic pathology formed in more than 30% of first-time mothers in their childhood and adolescence. Among those under considerable intellectual stress (students at specialized schools of varying intellectual orientation as well as those combining education in a conventional school with training in a music or art school), the frequency of pregnancy complication by anemia increased by threefold and by hypotonia--by tenfold; labor activity anomalies were noted 1.5 times more frequently and surgical intervention during labor compared to the frequency of these indicators among the entire contingent of respondents was more frequent by threefold. The total number of pathological manifestations during pregnancy and labor in each of the women who, during childhood years, combined chronic pathology with considerable intellectual stress was especially significant. In this contingent of first-time mothers, the proportion of various complications in the infant status increased by almost twofold: fetal hypoxia, hypertrophy, and asphyxia. At the same time, moderate athletic activity which was evaluated in women who since childhood participated in extracurricular activities with physical stress in public schools, clubs, palaces of culture, etc., ensured the lowest incidence of pathological manifestations with respect to the course of pregnancy and labor and did not lead to complications in the state of the infant. In this first-time mothers' contingent, all indices characterizing the progress of pregnancy and labor were most favorable. We would like to report one more extremely important fact recorded by anthropological researchers from our institute. Some time ago, the public was well informed about the spread of acceleration among the young generation. But no one has written anything about the phenomenon of retardation. Yet it does take place. Especially among our girls. In recent decades, they have become not only shorter in height but also lighter in weight and began menstruating later which, in women, is the principal indicator of biological maturity. We promised to present the conclusions at the end of this publication--they are alarming if not tragic. The regimen of academic life has a negative impact on the health of our children, especially girls. And if in the case with school building construction much can be attributed to our constant poverty, how can one explain the unjustified and hygienically unsound prevailing conditions? This does not require any capital outlays but rather an investment of heart, mind, and after all--concern. Are we also short on that too? We picked up the pen with the intention of focusing attention once more on the fact that the five-day week cannot and should not be a universal feature.
