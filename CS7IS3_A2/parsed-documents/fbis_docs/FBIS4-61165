It is several centuries since there have been visitors of this kind here. The burden of history weighed heavy on the leaders of the two states. [passage omitted] But there now seem to be signs of change. Lech Walesa unexpectedly proved more peaceable than Algirdas Brazauskas. In his speech the former spoke about the future. While the latter engaged in diplomatic license: "Even now Lithuania is not abandoning its principled position that Vilnius and the Vilnius region only belonged to Poland between the wars de facto but not de jure, and in 1939 Vilnius and the neighboring territory was legally returned to Lithuania." This statement was made in order to gratify his opponents who are demanding that the fact of the Poles' occupation of part of Lithuania's territory be recognized. Nevertheless, a Polish-Lithuanian treaty was nevertheless. The main point therein being recognition of the inviolability of borders and the legality of the capitals "regardless of past borders." That is, Poland has officially renounced its claims to Vilnius and the Vilnius region and Lithuania has officially secured its right to them. This can be seen as a great success for Lithuanian diplomacy. Lech Walesa's visit occurred without any excesses. That may have been facilitated by his calm firm position: He has repeatedly told Poles living in Lithuania that Lithuania is their homeland, while Poland is their motherland. Thus, the centuries-long misunderstanding between Lithuania and Poland is being resolved. Lech Walesa said that by the year 2000, Polish-Lithuanian borders will cease to exist, and Lithuanian Poles, indignant that Lithuanians have stopped relaying Polish television, have been advised to simply buy satellite dishes. Petty thieves celebrated this remarkable date in their own way: They stole the Lithuanian interior minister's official Mercedes in broad daylight.
