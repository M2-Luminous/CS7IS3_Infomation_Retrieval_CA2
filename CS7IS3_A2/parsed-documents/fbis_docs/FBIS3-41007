FBIS3-41007 "jptac001__l94035" JPRS-TAC-94-001-L Document Type:JPRS Document Title:Arms Control 22 February 1994 CENTRAL EURASIA RUSSIA Program Profiles Operations, Readiness at Missile Base LD2901234494 LD2901234494 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in Russian at 1920 GMT on 29 January carries the regularly scheduled Top Secret program presented by Arten Borovik. Reception is good. Today's program--The Nuclear Button--is devoted to nuclear weapons in Russia and the United States. Borovik starts the program by saying the nuclear threat still exists: the video shows a button on which is written "To execute the launch" [Russian: proizvesti pusk]. Borovik continues, noting that several weeks ago he visited a Russian nuclear missile base located not far from Moscow. The video show a rocket launcher aimed at the (?Warren) missile base in Wyoming. Borovik notes that in 30 minutes Russian missiles could reach the Wyoming missile facility. At this point one General Gribov is identified as the commander of this particular Russian missile division. Borovik says that all officers and soldiers who work at the Russian base are regularly examined by doctors because the fate of out planet is in their hands. Borovik notes that none of the personnel know what the targets are for the Russian missiles; however, they know exactly whether a particular order is a training or an operational order. The video continues with Borovik noting that there are many such nuclear missile bases throughout Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan. He notes that all these facilities are united in one single nuclear command center located approximately 25 minutes driving distance from Triumfalnaya Arka in western Moscow, in a place identified as Vlasikha. At this point in the show, Colonel-General Igor Sergeyev is identified by caption as the commander of this enormous nuclear facility, itself a legacy of the former Soviet Union. Col-Gen Sergeyev is cited as the commander in chief of the strategic missile troops. Borovik notes that Sergeyev was born in 1938 and has been in missile troops since the initial days of inception. At this point in the show, Borovik has a few comments about the nuclear weapons program in the United States. In particular, he notes the recent visit by a top Russian military delegation, led by Col-Gen Sergeyev. Borovik says this was the first meeting of professionals in this field. He goes on to describe in detail key aspects of the meeting: the video shows Col-Gen Sergeyev with other members of the Russian military delegation in the Pentagon. Next in the program, Borovik incorporates an interview with scientist Aleksey Arbatov, identified as an expert for the Top Secret program. Arbatov is heard making several remarks regarding different aspects of nuclear weapons in Russia as well as in the United States. Borovik then is seen asking Col-Gen Sergeyev about the position of the Russian nuclear missile troops during the coup in 1993. Col-Gen Sergeyev says: "I can only say that this was a very difficult time for everybody, including us. Our main task, whatever was happening, was to continue our guard duty, to be completely prepared, to professionally inspect operational posts, and to carry out measures for increasing protection and defense of operational launching positions in order to avoid the situation in which nuclear weapons become a card which somebody suddenly would like to play. This was out of the question: not because we are so good but because our lifestyle, our understanding of the dangerous and destructive weapons in our hands, our sense of responsibility in this difficult situation with respect to the fate of our people, for nuclear security, for strategic stability--I think all of these issues ensured that our missile specialist, as he is now and who, in these difficult conditions, is continuing to fulfill his duties." Throughout the program, Borovik touches upon a very important question: who will give an order to push the nuclear button in case of war? Col-Gen Sergeyev states: "The command will be given in the established order. It must come only from the president." At this point, scientist Arbatov states: "According to our constitution, in the case of the incapability of the president, all his functions revert to the head of the government or the prime minister. Thus, this button, or better to say this difficult mechanism, will go to his legal successor." Concluding the 50-minute program Borovik expresses his gratitude to the leadership of both the Russian and American Defense ministries for their help in preparing the program.
