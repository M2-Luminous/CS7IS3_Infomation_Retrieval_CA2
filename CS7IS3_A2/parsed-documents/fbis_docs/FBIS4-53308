Karimov, who is on a four-day visit to Japan, said at a news conference that Japan can use advanced technology and know-how to help Uzbekistan, a former Soviet republic, develop its vast mineral resources such as gold, copper and oil. "We are having talks with Japanese leaders of various fields here. I think bilateral economic cooperation will increase at a rapid pace," he said. As one effort to promote economic cooperation, Karimov said Uzbekistan is ready to open air links with Japan. In talks with Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata on Tuesday, Karimov said that both leaders discussed the possibility of opening an air route between the two nations. On domestic issues, Karimov said Uzbekistan, which became independent in August 1991, will hold a parliamentary election in December to elect 150 new legislators. Rejecting the view that his government has oppressed opposition groups, Karimov said under the constitution all existing parties in Uzbekistan can take part in the election, to which he said the United Nations did not raise any objection. The president also stressed the importance of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) as having served to prevent the former Soviet republics from falling into civil war. "I see the future of CIS depends on its power to integrate (its members) economically," Karimov said. Karimov will leave for home on Thursday after visiting the ancient capital of Kyoto in western Japan.
