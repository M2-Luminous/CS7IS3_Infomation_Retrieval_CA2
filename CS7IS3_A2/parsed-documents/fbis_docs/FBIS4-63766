Leningrad Nuclear Plant Workers Picket Oblast Administration Seat"] [Text] Workers of the Leningrad Nuclear Power Plant (LNPP), wearing working uniform -- white overalls, special caps, and foot gear -- are picketing the building of the Leningrad Oblast Administration and the Leningrad Electric Power Department. The picketers demand that wages be paid to LNPP workers that have not been forthcoming since February. Although Leningrad Oblast governor Aleksandr Belyakov has promised to discuss the problem with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, the financial situation of the Leningrad nuclear power plant workers has not changed. According to Aleksandr Yeperin, LNPP general director, the power plant has been plunged into very severe financial straits by the intervention of the Russian government, which has prohibited the nuclear power plant from imposing financial sanctions on its debtors; hence, the LNPP often has to supply customers with electricity virtually for free. Despite the possibility of signing a contract for delivering electricity from Sosnovyy Bor to Finland -- to be paid in hard currency -- this is unlikely substantially to ease the LNPP's financial plight, because the plant management has to make regular payments for nuclear fuel (earlier the plant had a one-year reserve, but this has now been used up). For the time being, the plant management is not going to take extreme measures and spend the money earmarked for fuel purchases on workers' wages, because a shutdown of the plant's reactor could become the first step toward a general power crisis in Russia. Plant workers themselves, who took to the street to picket administration buildings, think that the government should drastically change its policy with regard to the nuclear power industry. They believe that the shortage of money in the industry could bring about not only a power crunch, but also even more serious consequences.
