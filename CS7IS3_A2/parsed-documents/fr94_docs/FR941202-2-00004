FR941202-2-00004 FR941202-2-00001 Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq. ), pesticides added to raw agricultural commodities generally are considered to be unsafe unless a tolerance or exemption from tolerance has been established. Foods containing unsafe pesticides are deemed to be adulterated. Residue tolerances for pesticides are established by EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) enforces the tolerances set by the EPA. Monsanto has also submitted to the EPA a pesticide petition (PP 3F4273) proposing to amend 40 CFR part 180 to establish a tolerance exemption for residues of the plant pesticide active ingredient Btt CPB control protein as expressed in plant cells. On December 8, 1993, EPA announced receipt of this petition [58 FR 64583-64584]. Consistent with the ``Coordinated Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology'' (51 FR 23302-23350, June 26, 1986), APHIS and the EPA are coordinating their review of these genetically engineered potato lines to avoid duplication and assure that all relevant issues are addressed. FDA's policy statement concerning regulation of plants derived from new plant varieties was published in the Federal Register on May 29, 1992, and appears at 57 FR 22984-23005. Monsanto has notified the FDA that they have completed their food safety and nutritional assessment as required under this FDA policy statement. In accordance with ยง340.6(d) of the regulations, we are publishing this notice to inform the public that APHIS will accept written comments regarding the Petition for Determination of Nonregulated Status from any interested person for a period of 60 days from the date of this notice. The petition and any comments received are available for public review, and copies of the petition may be ordered (see the ADDRESSES section of this notice). After the comment period closes, APHIS will review the data submitted by the petitioner, all written comments received during the comment period, and any other relevant information. Based on the available information, APHIS will furnish a response to the petitioner, either approving the petition in whole or in part, or denying the petition. APHIS will then publish a notice in the Federal Register announcing the regulatory status of Monsanto's CPB-resistant potato lines BT6, BT10, BT12, BT16, BT17, BT18, and BT23 and the availability of APHIS' written decision. Authority: 7 U.S.C. 150aa-150jj, 151-167, 1622n; 31 U.S.C. 9701; 7 CFR 2.17, 2.51, and 371.2(c). Done in Washington, DC, this 25th day of November 1994. Lonnie J. King, Acting Administrator, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;29713 Filed 12&hyph;1&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3410&hyph;34&hyph;P
