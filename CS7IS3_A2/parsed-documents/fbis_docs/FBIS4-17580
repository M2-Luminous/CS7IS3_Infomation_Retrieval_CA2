Perhaps none of the spheres of the market infrastructure is developing as swiftly as the credit-monetary sphere. There is a total of 2,041 banks in Russia today, with over 4,000 branches. And sizeable funds are in circulation in them -- the total assets of commercial banks exceed 110 trillion rubles [R]. However, both the association's President Sergey Yegorov and the bankers from the localities who addressed the congress spoke less about the prosperity of financial affairs, and more, strangely enough, about the threat to them posed by the state. Such as, for example, the recent directive on increasing income tax fivefold in comparison with the first quarter of last year. Thus, we are not far from utter ruin. Businessmen are also skeptical about the authorities' decision to increase the minimum amount of the authorized capital for new banks to R2 billion. Such money is not available, particularly in the provinces, which is precisely where there is an acute need for the creation of new structures. Speaking at the congress, First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets announced a project which envisages a significant increase in banks' contributions to investment purposes. And Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko promised to reduce the discount rate in the near future, although admittedly on certain conditions.
