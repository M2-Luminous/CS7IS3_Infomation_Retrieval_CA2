Based on reliable I SIMERINI information, the first document, which contains suggestions and observations on specific aspects of the package, is at the foreign minister's office and the National Council members can pay a visit for a briefing. The second, nine-page document has been given to the National Council members in light of their scheduled meeting next Tuesday. The confidential document entitled "Basic Principles and Positions on the Confidence-Building Measures" does not answer any concerns stemming from the UN proposals. Referring to the issue of recognition, the document points out that in order for there to be recognition of the pseudostate, our side must first give its consent. It goes on to suggest that our side reiterate its position that it does not intend to recognize the pseudostate is added at this point. The document refers extensively to passages from UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's report (July) and his recent letter to the two sides. The document lists the following as our side's basic positions on the confidence-building measures: First: Cyprus' sovereignty will be maintained and implementation will not contain elements of direct or indirect recognition. Second: UN authority over Nicosia Airport and Varosha will be temporary and its orders will be in line with the international organization's resolutions. Third: Settlement in these two areas is strictly temporary. Fourth: Neither side will change positions. Fifth: An agreement and implementation of the confidence-building measures does not imply a Cyprus solution. The first document, which has not been given to the political leaders, is lengthy and in general describes the Greek Cypriot policy and approach on the talks. The documents were prepared by a group of government experts (Triandafillidhis, Soulioti, and other officials) as well as Brownling and Aimiliou, who work in London. The three documents were sent to Brownling last May, when they were submitted to the sides, and he decided that there was no issue of recognition. The government then sought a second opinion from Greek specialists, who warned of the dangers. Following this development, a group of experts was formed to study the confidence-building measures in detail.
