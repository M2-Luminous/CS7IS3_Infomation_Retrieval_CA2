According to official information, in order to equip their "operations with greater efficiency," the institution purchased in 1993, 260 Hummers -- a purchase that caused a storm -- 1,471 vehicles, 549 machine guns, approximately 29,000 grenades of diverse types, and 2,478 grenade launchers for automatic rifles. In addition, to guarantee the timely supply of weapons to the Armed Forces and furnish support to its security forces, the defense industry in 1993 manufactured 70.8 percent more equipment than in 1992. A total of 1,725 automatic rifles, 164 machine guns, 1,640 light machine guns, and 3,390 automatic pistols were manufactured. The Armed Forces have earmarked a 5.493 billion-new-peso budget. This amount is equal to the health sector's budget for this year, although it is less than the Secretariat of National Education's -- approximately 24 billion new pesos -- and that of the Secretariat of Agriculture and Hydraulic Resources, with approximately 11 billion pesos. Sedna reported that the Weapons' Unification Program achieved "significant progress" in 1993 by incorporating the functional reuse of rifles and light automatic rifles. This allowed the weapons supply for operational units in Military Regions 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, and 10 to be supplemented. In addition, the current updating of the Army and Air Forces strategic plans has resulted in improved operational control and coordination of the diverse territorial mandates and military units. This includes air as well as land forces. In 1993, the Army's regional deployment was reorganized with the creation of the 37th Military Zone, the jurisdictional restructuring of Military Region 1 and of the 1st and 22d Military Zones. This has enhanced the operational coordination of the units assigned to these zones. According to the National Development Program, "the great national tasks" require the participation of the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force. In addition to its "primary responsibility" -- the defense of the nation -- the Armed Forces must participate in the overall development of the nation. This is accomplished by safeguarding democratic institutions and protecting natural resources and the strategic installations for security and the nation's economy. The plan holds that in terms of political issues, the Army's mission is to defend the principles of sovereignty and nationalism, respect for liberty, support for democracy, the rejection of intervention, and defense of the peoples' right to self-determination. With regard to the economic sector, it will support the nation's overall development. In the social sector, the Army will share the commitment to raise the people's level of well-being. The document highlights that for the Army "to accomplish its missions with greater efficiency," permanent revamping of its organization, equipment, and military capabilities will be necessary. When Antonio Riviello Bazan, national defense secretary, recently referred to the purchase of military equipment, he assured that the riot units and the Hummer vehicles had been ordered "some time back." These, he said, will be used "solely for defense," within the limits outlined by "the law on respect for human rights."
