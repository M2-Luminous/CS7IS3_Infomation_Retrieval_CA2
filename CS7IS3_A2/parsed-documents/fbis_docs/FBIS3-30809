Regardless of how much politicians for both parties try to minimize the conflict in their public statements, a situation where a deputy prime minister responsible for the economy resigns in the midst of proceedings in the Sejm on the budget is certainly not a usual occurrence. The introduction of Bank Slaski shares on the stock market, as a series of inconsiderate statements coming from Sejm deputies for the Polish Peasant Party's [PSL], a hurried search for the guilty parties (or, rather, a scapegoat), led to the dismissal of Deputy Finance Minister Stefan Kawalec. He heard about his dismissal on the radio. It is worth recalling that the dismissal followed Deputy Prime Minister Borowski's statement, where he took upon himself responsibility for the case of Bank Slaski in a way that, it should be admitted, was worthy of recognition. The crisis was slowly brewing, but not much could be said about its consequences. Things gathered momentum after the return of the prime minister from Brussels and Aleksander Kwasniewski from Davos. Some explanations were made but their contents were not revealed to the public completely. The Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] set some conditions for continued coalition cooperation. The prime minister refused to approve of the conditions. Deputy Prime Minister Borowski resigned. The prime minister failed to explain whether he accepts the resignation. Instead, he went to visit some fire brigade units. Problems Despite Excess It would seem that the current coalition is in the most luxurious situation possible. A huge and overwhelming advantage in the Sejm and the capability of enacting into law anything the government wants gave rise to assumptions concerning the current configuration's durability. But the crisis appeared rapidly and quite unexpectedly. It revealed differences that exist between the coalition members not only with regard to the understanding of some points contained in the joint program, but primarily with regard to philosophy and the way of ruling. Differences in approach to the economy, which are big and clear, are probably not the basis of the current conflict. The recently introduced taxes, additional payments, subsidies for the Food Management Bank [Bank Gospodarki Zywnosciowej] and other institutions linked to rural areas give rise to suspicions that the PSL was successful in imposing on the coalition partner a lot of its own ideas concerning economic policies. Many moves by the government undertaken in recent months seem beneficial for rural areas and peasants. But the point is that decisions giving preference to just one professional group--farmers--are implemented at the expense of other groups. Protection of the obsolete Polish agricultural system makes food prices rise. That in turn has the most disastrous impact, first of all on the poorest and weakest--those who constitute the SLD's election clientele. Beyond any doubt, the PSL cares more for its electorate than the SLD when it comes to implementing election promises. The SLD tries to make it appear that nothing bad is happening. It talks about difficulties associated with the transitional period or about future implementation of election promises. TRYBUNA, which before the elections wrote about the dramatic situation of starving senior citizens, right now is using enigmatic phrases to describe the budget difficulties. But these kinds of concessions to peasants must be cause for concern for some SLD politicians, especially given the fact that other preelection declarations are not being implemented for now, either. The concordat, abortion, the participation of women in places of authority--these issues were very ostentatiously raised during the election campaign, but now their solution is being put off until the future. The SLD refuses to deal with difficult problems, ones that could give rise to conflicts. The "Who Shall Be Better" Method So the peasants noticed that they can force a lot on the coalition partner, which after all won the elections. The means to achieve this is a secondary issue. The first signal of this style of conducting politics took place even before the government was sworn in. Prime Minister Pawlak went to the Belweder with a slightly different list of ministerial candidates than what he had agreed upon with the coalition being formed. The attempt ended in failure. Principles of coalition cooperation were signed. Today, according to the SLD, these principles are being violated. Local governors are being replaced according to PSL criteria, and there are no consultations regarding some decisions. It looks as if the PSL wants to be smarter that its coalition partner. Or perhaps it wants to react the way it used to. Perhaps the heir to the United Peasant Party wants to show the heir to the Polish United Workers Party that there has been a reversal of roles. The peasant party will not be under anyone's heel, as it was in the times of the Polish Peoples' Republic. That Must Offend the SLD But what must really irritate it is the information policy of Waldemar Pawlak's Cabinet and his attempts to explain what is happening. The prime minister, always looking frightened, running from journalists and trying to get rid of them; Minister Strak, who is aggressive and not nice to press people; and Miss Wachowicz [press secretary to the prime minister], who keeps issuing communiques to the effect that she has nothing to say--all of these make up the picture of the Cabinet's information policy. But that is an information policy of the government, not just of the PSL. Such a trio cannot possible arouse positive reactions, not just from the media but also from the coalition partners who, in some cases, are not without sin but who have many communicative politicians who have traveled to different countries and who like being in touch with the press. They also want the current team to come across in the public eye as an open, European-style government made up of social democrats. That disharmony became visible again during the current crisis. The SLD has been holding press conferences and the leadership of its main party an urgent session; it explains its position to journalists. SLD members frequently appear on television. But the PSL is quiet. It does not issue statements or declarations; it takes no position. Only once did we have [Deputy Sejm] Speaker Zych speaking on television and making an appeal to listen to what the prime minister has to say on the whole issue. But the point is that the prime minister gives no one a chance to listen to him. It is hard to tell today whether this is a conflict that will pass and that is typical for any coalition's initial phase, or whether it is the prelude to a divorce. It is hard to tell whether the differences are surmountable and a consensus possible, or whether they are too deep and radical to be able to eliminate them. In the beginning, the whole issue was being minimized. Right now the SLD is trying to make it less radical. But many words were spoken and the breaking of the coalition agreement was mentioned, as well as the PSL's "buddy policies" and mistakes with regard to information policies. If the SLD, while using the argument of lack of an alternative to the coalition, tries to make the conflict less radical, if it encounters the PSL's harsh resistance and therefore decides to give up what has been described as "terminal conditions," the PSL will strengthen not only its position but also its style of ruling. The PSL will simply prove more efficient.
