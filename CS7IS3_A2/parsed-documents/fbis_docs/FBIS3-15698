That's what Estonian political parties archive chief Valdur Ohmann would like to know. Ohmann says the Estonian parties' archive houses close to 60,000 of the remaining records: less than a quarter of the estimated total, he says. The files in the archive attest to Stalinist repressions: the mass deportations of Estonian citizens in 1941 and 1949, the persecution of clergy, and charges against people involved in Estonia's pre-Soviet government. More recent files consist primarily of criminal records and "tourism" records, which trace every person who traveled abroad. Administrative records, including correspondance, accounts, and personnel files are missing, Ohmann says. The KGB files' disappearance may be traced back to the dramatic events of August 1991, when the Estonian Kodukaitse (home guard), took control of the KGB building at Pagari Street in Tallinn. Hardo Aasmae, Tallinn's major at the time, personally sealed the door to the KGB archives. Witnesses remember seeing clouds of smoke over the KGB building and heard rumors that trucks loaded with documents were pulling out from behind the building. Soon after, the government rebuffed the archive department's attempt to join a commission created to take over the KGB documents. In October 1991, the archive building was opened and the records handed over to the police department, essentially to the body that cooperated with the KGB. By giving the KGB files to the police, "former Estonian Prime Minister Edgar Savisaar's government violated its own rules," says Peep Pillak, state archive department director. A law passed August 16, 1990 states that the archives of all liquidated organizations must be transferred to the archive department. "Or was the police department considered the legal successor to the KGB?" Pillak asks. A year-and-a-half passed before Prime Minister Mart Laar ordered the police department on April 19, 1993 to transfer immediately the KGB records to the archive department. The records now occupy the archive for Estonian Political Parties, formerly the Estonian Communist Party archives. The so-called Savisaar-Bakatin agreement, made at the end of 1991, promised the return to Estonia of all KGB records that had been carried to Russia. On December 4, 1991, 500 kilos of the estimated 5 tons of records were returned, Estonian news agency ETA reported. The KGB also housed records in other Estonian towns, but the archive department has not received them, Pillak comments. Pillak suspects that part of the KGB archives were destroyed or hidden during the year-and-a-half before Laar ordered the records to go to the archive department. The rest may still be in Russia, he says.
