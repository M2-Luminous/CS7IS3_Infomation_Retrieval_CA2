['Arafat] I am tired. I spent a whole night on my feet to find out what was happening in Ramallah. [Arafat Ends] At Ramallah a pregnant 18-year old Palestinian woman was killed in her kitchen by a stray bullet and a Palestinian building was blown up; fortunately there was nobody in it at the time. For many years 'Arafat accused the West of enmity toward the Palestinians. He would say: "The West thought that Palestine was a land without a people that could be given to a people without a land in order to lessen its feeling of guilt over the Jews massacred by the Nazis." Or: "The West has ascribed to Israel all the virtues of the only civilized state in the Middle East and to the Palestinian people every kind of wickedness." [Zambonini] What will your Palestine be like when peace comes? ['Arafat] A holy land with three religions, divided into two states -- the Israeli and the Palestinian -- within a new Middle Eastern order. We will be able to start from scratch with international aid, by means of a plan similar, on a smaller scale, to the Marshall Plan, which rebuilt the defeated nations after World War II. If that does not happen, we will lapse into chaos, into a Balkanization of the Middle East. History shows us that wars start when justice is not implemented. To fail to resolve the problems means providing the fanatics and their groups with a pretext for violence. [Zambonini] But do you not have the power to curb the extremist fringes? ['Arafat] I cannot do anything before I enter Jericho. The authority is in Jericho. Today is 13 April. Can I say: This is the day of the Israeli withdrawal? No. It should have been. Instead, here I am. Yes, it is delays such as these that are the cause of the killings. [Zambonini] In Cairo you signed an agreement with the Israelis for the establishment of a Palestinian police corps comprising 9,000 men armed with automatic rifles. Where are they? ['Arafat] The police force exists only in theory, too. Arab countries have loaned me 10 Hercules aircraft to transport the policemen to the occupied territories, but hitherto not one of them has been able to enter. I wanted some of them to go immediately to Hebron, where people cannot move about freely and have to suffer a curfew because of the presence of 42 settler families. Yes, 42 Israeli families are keeping 120,000 inhabitants of Hebron prisoner. The same applies in Gaza, where 1 million Palestinians are the hostages of a mere 1,000 settlers. It is situations such as these that inflame the fanatics on both sides, and the Palestinian people and the Israeli people are paying the price of their violence. Meanwhile, we produce declarations of condemnation instead of promptly implementing the agreements reached. It does not take courage to make war; it takes courage to make peace. [Zambonini] Do you think that the Vatican could have a role to play in the peace talks? ['Arafat] We consulted the pope to advance the peace process. We maintain contacts and meetings with Vatican representatives at all levels. Personally, I had the privilege of meeting with Monsignor Jean Louis Tauran, the Vatican foreign minister, and that meeting confirmed to me that the Vatican's role as a mediator between us is a very influential one. [Zambonini] Do you think that the presence in Hebron of 160 international observers, including 35 Italians, is useful? ['Arafat] I have full confidence in them and in the task that has been assigned to them. I wish that there were many more, not only in Hebron, but also in Gaza, Jericho, and the rest of the territories. I pleaded on bended knee for the West to send out the international force envisaged by UN Security Council Resolution 904 to protect the Palestinian people during this difficult transition period. The United States said "no," as did many European nations. So hitherto only three countries have sent out observers -- Denmark, Norway, and Italy. Their presence, albeit small, is important as a sign of confidence and security. [Zambonini] According to the agreements, there will be an election four months after the Israelis' withdrawal. Do you think that the PLO will be successful? ['Arafat] I feel reassured by previous results. In the latest municipal elections 96 of the 116 people elected were on the PLO lists. Last month there were three elections on the Gaza Strip -- those for the medical, legal, and engineering councils -- and we achieved excellent results. Our democracy has asserted itself amid a forest of rifles. When at last we have peace -- a dream that I pursue without giving in to the difficulties -- free elections will be the culmination of a long revolutionary path.
