FR940429-0-00074 FR940429-0-00010 Changes: The term ``unannounced site visit'' has been replaced with ``unannounced inspection,'' and the purpose of the unannounced inspection has been defined as indicated in the Discussion section. Section 602.25␣Additions to or Substantive Changes in Educational Programs Comments: The Secretary received numerous comments regarding this section. Many commenters felt that there was no substantive change requirement in the statute so the requirement should be eliminated from the regulations. Other commenters, however, cited a different reason why the requirement should be eliminated: most accrediting agencies already have substantive change policies so there is no need for the Department to regulate the content of those policies. A host of commenters observed that, as worded, the requirement placed an undue reporting requirement on both accrediting agencies and institutions and an unnecessary burden on agencies by requiring them to grant prior approval to even the most insignificant of program changes or additions. Many also noted that the prior approval process would severely inhibit institutions' ability to respond in a timely manner to changing needs, as, for example, in health-related fields. Finally, commenters noted that many programs, such as those in community colleges, were routinely reviewed and approved by various State review boards before they could be offered, so requiring additional prior approval by accrediting agencies would only increase costs without any added benefit. Discussion: The Secretary firmly believes that an agency cannot be a reliable authority as to the quality of education or training offered by an institution if the agency does not have a substantive change policy that requires prior approval by the accrediting agency before a substantive change can be included in the agency's grant of accreditation to an institution. At the same time, the Secretary acknowledges the burden the requirement proposed in the NPRM imposed on institutions and accrediting agencies. While the least burdensome approach would be to allow agencies simply to use their existing substantive change policies to meet this requirement, the Secretary believes this is unworkable and does not adequately protect the public interest because there is considerable variation among agencies as to what constitutes substantive change. Furthermore, as the NPRM documents, there have been several significant abuses in this area because of an agency's unwillingness to evaluate an institution's substantive change before including that change in the institution's grant of accreditation. Consequently, the Secretary believes that the Federal interest, as well as the interest of the general public, is best protected if a common core of changes that must be considered substantive is defined in regulation. To determine what should constitute this common core, the Secretary examined the topics institutional accrediting agencies typically include in their list of substantive changes that require prior approval and has included in this section only those that reflect the Secretary's principal concerns regarding institutions that undergo substantive change. The Secretary believes that the revised substantive change policy, which now applies only to institutional accrediting agencies, considerably reduces the burden on both accrediting agencies and institutions at the same time it provides adequate protection to the public. The Secretary recognizes that there are many variables that must be taken into account in determining the type of review that an agency conducts before granting prior approval to an institution's substantive change. For this reason, the Secretary has decided to give accrediting agencies the flexibility to determine the procedures they will use in granting prior approval to an institution's substantive change. In some instances, this may involve a full-scale on-site evaluation of the entire institution. In others, it may involve a focused visit to examine the particular circumstances surrounding the change. In still others, it may involve simply a thorough review by agency staff of the institution's report on its ability to implement the substantive change without adversely affecting the institution's ability to continue to meet the agency's standards. Changes: The substantive change requirement has been modified to limit the types of changes that must be given prior approval by an accrediting agency. The requirement now applies to institutional accrediting agencies only. Section 602.26␣Required Accreditation Standards Comments: The Secretary received numerous comments about the required accreditation standards. Most commenters felt that the Federal government should not mandate how accrediting agencies defined their standards. They also felt that the proposed regulations intruded on the autonomy of accrediting agencies, exceeded the statute, and were contrary to Executive Order 12866. In their opinion, the Secretary overreached his authority by specifying anything in this section that went beyond a mere restatement of the law on the required standards. These same commenters applauded the removal of the language on curricula, faculty, facilities, equipment and supplies, and student support services that had appeared in early drafts of the proposed regulations and urged the Secretary to do the same for the other eight standards specified in the law.
