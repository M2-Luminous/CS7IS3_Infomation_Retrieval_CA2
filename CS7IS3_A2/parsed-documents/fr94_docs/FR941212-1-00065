FR941212-1-00065 FR941212-1-00016 Several habitat types are also used by the pygmy-owl in the eastern portion of its range. These include coastal plain oak associations in south Texas (Tewes 1992, Wauer et al. 1993), Tamaulipan Thornscrub in the lower Rio Grande valley and other lowland areas, and thick forest and second-growth forest in Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas. 1. Texas The pygmy-owl's historical range in Texas included the lower Rio Grande valley, where it was considered a common resident of dense mesquite-cottonwood-ebony woodlands and Tamaulipan brushland (Griscom and Crosby 1926, Bent 1938, Friedmann et al. 1950, Stillwell and Stillwell 1954, Oberholser 1974, Millsap and Johnson 1988). The pygmy-owl also occurs in coastal plain oak associations between Brownsville and Corpus Christi (Oberholser 1974), where it has recently been found in significant numbers (Wauer et al. 1993, S. Beasom in litt. , P. Palmer in litt. ). The pygmy-owl has declined throughout a significant portion of its Texas range (Oberholser 1974, Johnson et al. 1979, Johnson and Haight 1985a, Millsap and Johnson 1988, Tewes 1992). It appears to persist in relatively high numbers in coastal plain oak associations north of the lower Rio Grande valley (Wauer et al. 1993). The pygmy-owl was described as a common breeding bird in the lower Rio Grande valley near Brownville in the early 1900's (Griscom and Crosby 1926, Friedmann et al. 1950), but was considered to have become rare in that region by mid-century (Wolfe 1956, Oberholser 1974). Pygmy-owls have been seen less frequently in recent years and in fewer numbers (Oberholser 1974, Hunter 1988, Wauer et al. 1993). Tewes (1992) found no pygmy-owls in a 1991 survey of the lower Rio Grande valley, but sporadic reports of single birds continue. Habitat has been, and continues to be, lost and modified along the lower Rio Grande valley, chiefly through agricultural development and urban expansion. Since the early 1900's, approximately 95 percent of native Tamaulipan Brushland in the lower Rio Grande valley has been cleared for agriculture, urban development, and recreation (Jahrsdoerfer and Leslie 1988). By reducing river flow, water development has further altered or destroyed brushland in riparian areas. Impacts on coastal oak associations are less well known, but appear to be lesser. Limited oak clearing has taken place, but extensive habitat remains. Little net quantitative change in this habitat appears to have occurred in the last 100 years, and the habitat may have increased in the late 1600's and early 1700's (Wauer et al. 1993, P. Palmer in litt. ). Pygmy-owls are currently found in this habitat in their greatest numbers in the U.S. Other causes of habitat decline in Texas include alteration of water regimes and overuse by livestock, both of which have degraded the riparian ecosystems of the lower Rio Grande (see discussion of these factors under ``Arizona'', above). However, in a nonriparian grassland/woodland mosaic in Texas, Wauer et al. (1993) believed livestock grazing may have increased pygmy-owl habitat by suppressing grasslands and allowing encroachment by oak associations. Potential future threats to pygmy-owl habitat also exist. In coastal Texas, placement of spoil from offshore dredging operations may impact coastal oak associations. Expanding human populations in the border region are expected to continue to increase impacts and threats discussed above. Further, extensive industrial, municipal, and agricultural developments facilitated by the North American Free Trade Agreement are anticipated along the U.S.-Mexico border. These developments may result in accelerated habitat loss and demands on groundwater. 2. Eastern Mexico The pygmy-owl occurs in lowland regions [below 330 m (1,000 ft)] along the Gulf Coast of northeastern Mexico (Friedmann et al. 1950), in the States of Tamaulipas and Nuevo Leon. Its primary habitat in this region is Tamaulipan thornscrub, forest edge, riparian woodlands, thickets, and lowland tropical deciduous forest (Webster 1974, Tewes 1992, Enriquez-Rocha et al. 1993). The pygmy-owl is absent or rare in the highlands of Mexico's central plateau (Friedmann et al. 1950), where the least and northern pygmy-owls occur. In the mid-20th century, the pygmy-owl was generally described as having been common in eastern Mexico (Friedmann et al. 1950, Blake 1953). Current information on the status of the pygmy-owl and its habitat in eastern Mexico is incomplete. In 1976, the pygmy-owl was reported to be ``fairly common'' in the Sierra Picachos of Nuevo Leon (Arvin 1976). In 1991, Texas (1992) located pygmy-owls at 13 of 27 survey sites in northeastern Mexico. Tewes (1992) believed expansion of the human population could reduce available habitat in the region surveyed, but also noted that pygmy-owls were found within larger towns in the region. Wauer et al. (1993) believed no populations in northeastern Mexico appeared to be sizable enough to provide recruitment for other areas. Christmas Bird Count data from 1972 through 1992 from Rio Corona and Gomez Farias, both in Tamaulipas, indicate the pygmy-owl was not uncommon, but detections varied widely from year to year (National Audubon Society 1972&hyph;1992). Christmas Bird Count data indicated the same for ferruginous pygmy-owls at El Naranjo in San Louis Potosi, at the zone of probably intergradation between G.b. cactorum and G.b. ridgwayi. It is possible that the factors causing declines in Texas are also having effects in Mexico (Deloya 1985, Hunter 1988). However, further information on the subspecies is needed before determining whether it should be listed in eastern Mexico. B. Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes. The pygmy-owl is highly sought by bird watchers, who concentrate at several of the remaining known locations of pygmy-owls in the U.S. While limited, careful bird watching is probably not harmful, excess attention by bird watchers may at times constitute harassment, affecting the occurrence and behavior of the pygmy-owl (Oberholser 1974, Tewes 1992). For example, in early 1993, one of the few areas in Texas known to support the pygmy-owl continued to be widely publicized (American Birding Association 1993). The resident pygmy-owls were not detected at this highly-visited area after early in the breeding season. The Service is unaware of any other overuse, for any purpose, which constitutes a threat to the pygmy-owl.
