The town was quiet Monday [28 March] following the clashes between Krahns and Mandingos which erupted Friday and raged around the headquarters of ULIMO, one of Liberia's armed factions. Some sporadic automatic weapons fire was audible from the bush nearby around mid-day. Forces loyal to ULIMO leader Alhaji Koromah had regained control of the town after Krahns, loyal to ULIMO military commander General Roosevelt Johnson, seized control from Kromah's Mandingo supporters following a dawn attack on Friday. The final toll of the fighting could be much higher, with many decomposing bodies uncounted and strewing the streets of the town centre and outlying districts. The Krahns and Mandingos are the two major ethnic groups within ULIMO. Earlier this month a series of violent incidents between ULIMO members of the two rival clans left around 200 dead.
