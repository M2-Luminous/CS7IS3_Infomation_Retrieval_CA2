SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Authority for the Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) Program is contained in Section 163 of the Revenue Act of 1978, Pub. L. 95&hyph;600, (92 Stat. 12810), November 6, 1978. Regulations were published in the Federal Register at 44 FR 72113 on December 13, 1979. Section 163 gives Internal Revenue Service authority to enter into cooperative agreements with private or public non-profit agencies or organizations to establish a network of trained volunteers to provide free tax information and return preparation assistance to elderly individuals. Elderly individuals are defined as individual age 60 and over at the close of their taxable year. Cooperative agreements will be entered into based upon competition among eligible agencies and organizations. Because applications are being solicited before the FY 1995 budget has been approved, cooperative agreements will be entered into subject to appropriation of funds. Once funded, sponsoring agencies and organizations will receive a grant from the IRS for administrative expenses and to reimburse volunteers for expenses incurred in training and in providing tax return assistance. The Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) Program is referenced in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance in Section 21.006. Beverly P.
