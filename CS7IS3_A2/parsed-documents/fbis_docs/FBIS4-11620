In its regular session this afternoon, the Comptrollership Committee will begin an investigation based on the request by Deputy Luis Manuel Esculpi.

I had already announced on an early morning television program that the Comptrollership Committee was going to immediately open an investigation. Regardless of whether I or Deputy Esculpi made the request, this is a case that falls strictly under the purview of the Comptrollership Committee. [end recording]
