FBIS4-12105 "drnes066dd_94007" FBIS-NES-94-066 Daily Report 2 Apr 1994 Palestinian Affairs Paper: Hebron Agreement Does Not Provide Security Paper: Hebron Agreement Does Not Provide Security TA0504190794 Jerusalem AL-NAHAR in Arabic 2 Apr 94 pp 3, 7 TA0504190794 Jerusalem AL-NAHAR Arabic BFN [Editorial: "We Demand That Our Delegation Be Clear and Frank"] [Excerpts] Some believe that the crisis caused by the Hebron massacre has been resolved by the dispatch of international observers to this ill-fated town. Palestinian and Israeli negotiators are expected to resume their talks in Cairo on Sunday to discuss the next steps of implementing the Gaza-Jericho First stage. Palestinian officials have said that Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat agreed to the formula reached by Palestinian envoy Nabil Sha'th with Israeli negotiator Amnon Shahaq after obtaining "a private Israeli commitment" that Israel will gradually remove the settlers from the center of Hebron. This is what reports from the Palestinian side indicate, but Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres have categorically stressed that the evacuation of settlers from the center of Hebron is not included in any clause of the announced Palestinian-Israeli agreement nor are there any secret clauses. Here is the contradiction between what has been agreed upon and how each party interprets it! It is certain, however, that the accord did not overcome the Palestinian people's concern for their safety or that agreement was reached to provide protection for them. Our people do not feel more secure today than before. If the agreement and the dispatch of international observers seek to deflect the anger against negotiations, what is taking place in the Palestinian territories reflects not only the dissatisfaction in Hebron but that of the entire Palestinian people with any agreement that is not preceded by the evacuation of settlers from the center of Hebron. This ordeal proves once again that the Palestinians faced Israeli and U.S. pressure alone, as well as that applied by some of the Arabs, while the other Arab states sat in the spectator's seat as if what is happening does not concern them at all. Here, we cannot but mention the stance of Dennis Ross, the U.S. coordinator of the peace process, in his meeting with President 'Arafat and the methods of pressure and warning that he used to force the Palestinians to return to the talks and refrain from inflating the Hebron massacre, as he put it! [passage omitted] The Security Council tried to laugh at us with a resolution in which there was condemnation, denunciation, and high-sounding words. The result was that the Palestinians were forced to accept an agreement on Hebron that fails to respond to the minimal Palestinian aspirations for security and safety. What is the value of the international community's condemnation if it is not accompanied by unceasing work to implement international legitimacy's resolutions, foremost of all that which considers the establishment of settlements in the occupied territories illegal and an obstacle to peace? We are facing a grave and delicate stage. The Palestinian orientation toward a settlement and peace does not mean that the road will be easy. There will be many stations that will confront our people with difficult tests, but Israel and its allies should not regard their methods as some kind of a sport where our people will accept what is unacceptable. The Israeli leadership should respond to the sincere Palestinian inclination to end the conflict so that each party will secure its rights, security, and stability.
