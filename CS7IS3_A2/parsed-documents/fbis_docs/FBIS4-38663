Brazauskas welcomed the guest who is representing an international organization, which is little known in Lithuania, but which is important to its future. Striving for integration in the European community, Brazauskas said, I have taken measures to coordinate the steps of Lithuania and of other Eastern and Central European states and proposed to arrange a meeting of the leaders of the Baltic states and the states of the Visegrad group. I have taken some steps lately to realize the ideas of this cooperation. The president dwelled on the complex development of relations between Lithuania and Russia, especially with Kaliningrad region. He expressed concern over obstacles in the processes of independence of Ukraine and Belarus. It is imperative to seek a solution in relations between Russia and Estonia, with a view to foreign troops being withdrawn from this Baltic state, too, by the end of the summer. Describing Lithuania's domestic scene, Brazauskas said that political passions have somewhat subsided in the one and a half years which have elapsed since the elections to the Seimas. The economic situation is difficult, however. Lithuania especially lacks foreign investments. Western countries should pay more attention to the Eastern and Central European states and help to consolidate their stability. Klepsch supported the idea of cooperation between the Baltic and Visegrad states. The European community, he said, is concerned about the stability of the Northern and Central European states, especially of those with whom it is preparing to conclude agreements of associated membership. Welcoming the Lithuanian-Polish treaty, the guest drew attention to the importance of normalizing relations with Russia. The guest also gave a positive assessment to the fact that there are no problems of national minorities in Lithuania, that the process of their integration is taking place. This is well known in the European parliament, he said. The meeting lasted for one hour instead of the planned 40 minutes. "We had to explain our attitude to current Russian policy, relations of that country with Ukraine and Belarus, ELTA correspondent was told by President Algirdas Brazauskas. Egon Klepsch met the chairman of the Seimas, Ceslovas Jursenas, today. During the meeting, the guest expressed the view that positive processes in Lithuania are taking the country closer to the European structures. "The first meetings with members of the Seimas factions created an impression that various political forces in Lithuania have similar foreign polity aims, and they differ only in detail. A state wishing to join the European Union is facing corresponding demands. After the signing of a free trade agreement with the European Union Lithuania will come closer to this European structure. Klepsch supports long-term and close cooperation between the Lithuanian and European parliaments. Ceslovas Jursenas noted that his meetings with Klepsch in Paris and Brussels and the present visit by the president of the European Parliament show that such contacts are very useful to our state advancing along a complex path to the European Union. Accompanied by the Seimas chairman, the guest inspected the building of the Lithuanian parliament, a fragment of the barricades, and crossed himself at the Smutkelis crucifix. Today, Egon Klepsch met the chairman of the Lithuanian Bishops Conference, Vilnius archbishop Metropolitan Audrius Juozas Backis.
