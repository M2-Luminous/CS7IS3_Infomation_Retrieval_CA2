No such plans have been made in the Russian Ministry of Fuel and Energy for the next few years either," Russian Minister of Fuel and Energy Yuriy Shafranik said. In an interview with BUSINESS-TASS on Wednesday, Shafranik said that "the results from oil sales should cover the expenses. This is what the ministry has been guided by while holding consultations with its partners and OPEC and assessing the European Market." OPEC, Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, plans to discuss at its session in Geneva on March 25 the possibility of a five-per cent cut in export quotas for member countries. If approved, Russia will be offered to cut its oil export by five per cent. "The European market is saturated, but we will fight for it," Shafranik said. Russia cannot transport all the oil extracted by joint ventures. Additionally, the ministry has many requests from Western partners for additional oil supplies. With this in mind, the ministry plans to suggest establishing a Baltic oil consortium in the Timano- Pechora region in order to penetrate the Baltic and Finnish oil markets. The Russian oil industry also plans to expand operations to tap new oil deposits in the Irkutsk region, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan and Nigeria and boost activity in Vietnam where Russia extracts about 20 million tonnes of oil annually.
