He said the government has facilitated the entry of extremists from various countries of the world into Sudan. Addressing the Ansar al-Sunnah group, whose mosque was attacked last week, al-Mahdi said that the government has opened the country's doors to extremists who only believe in violence and reject any dialogue to resolve differences. In statements published by the Algerian French-language paper EL WATAN today, al-Mahdi added that this incident, which left 16 people dead, is regarded as the most serious in Sudan since the military coup carried out by 'Umar al-Bashir in 1989. He noted that Sudan has become a place of refuge for all the extremists from the various countries of the world, including the Egyptian Islamic groups, the Tunisian Islamic Ennahda Movement, the Moroccan al-'Adl wa al-Ihsan Group, and the Algerian Islamic Salvation Front, as well as leader of the Sudanese Islamic Front Hasan al-Turabi. The Algerian EL WATAN said that 50 leaders of these groups will form a council that will meet regularly in Sudan. There is already a smaller council consisting of 15 top leaders, including Algerian FIS leaders Abbassi Madani and Ali Belhadj. The paper noted that after their arrest, Rached Ghannouchi, leader of the Tunisian Islamic Ennahda Movement, has become the most important figure in this council. The paper wondered whether the extremists admitted into the country by the Sudanese Government were behind the armed attack that took place against the mosque of the Ansar al-Sunnah group, which is opposed to the government and is being persecuted by the Sudanese authorities.
