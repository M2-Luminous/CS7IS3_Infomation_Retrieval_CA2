In a bid to urge Japan to increase imports of Canadian timber and other products, the letter has asked the Japanese Government to incorporate the request into a deregulation package, which will be compiled by the end of June. Touching on the BSL, the letter claims: "Canadian-produced timber products are capable of satisfying fire prevention standards the same as those for nonwooden buildings." It requests the easing of building standards to enable the following: 1) construction of three-story wooden apartment houses in fire zones and semi-fire zones; and 2) construction of three-story wooden hotels using the 2- by-4 method. The JAS bans the use of coniferous plywood for a concrete mold and strictly restricts the use of North American timber as structural wood such as pillars and beams. The letter has demanded the review of such restrictions. With regard to the Plant Protection Law, it has requested that negotiations on import agreements be shortened.
