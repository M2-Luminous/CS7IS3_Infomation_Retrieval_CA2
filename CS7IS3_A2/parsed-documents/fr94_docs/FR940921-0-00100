FR940921-0-00100 FR940921-0-00016 (3) The specification range of the fuels to be used under paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section shall be reported in accordance with §86.094&hyph;21(b)(3). (d) Mixtures of petroleum and methanol fuels for flexible fuel vehicles. (1) Mixtures of petroleum and methanol fuels used for exhaust and evaporative emission testing and service accumulation for flexible fuel vehicles shall be within the range of fuel mixtures for which the vehicle was designed. (2) Manufacturer testing and service accumulation may be performed using only those mixtures (mixtures may be different for exhaust testing, evaporative testing and service accumulation) expected to result in the highest emissions, provided: (i) The fuels which constitute the mixture will be used in customer service; and (ii) Information, acceptable to the Administrator, is provided by the manufacturer to show that the designated fuel mixtures would result in the highest emissions; and (iii) Written approval from the Administrator of the fuel specifications must be provided prior to the start of testing. (3) The specification range of the fuels to be used under paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section shall be reported in accordance with §86.094&hyph;21(b)(3). (e) Natural gas fuel. (1) Natural gas fuel having the following specifications will be used by the Administrator for exhaust and evaporative emission testing of natural gas-fueled vehicles: ␣ 1Item 1␣ 1ASTM test method No. 1 Value Methane min. mole pct. D1945 89.0 Ethane max. mole pct. D1945 4.5 C 3 and higher max. mole pct. D1945 2.3 C 6 and higher max. mole pct. D1945 0.2 Oxygen max. mole pct. D1945 0.6 Inert gases: Sum of CO 2 and N 2 max. mole pct. D1945 4.0 Odorant1 1The natural gas at ambient conditions must have a distinctive odor potent enough for its presence to be detected down to a concentration in air of not over 1/5 (one-fifth) of the lower limit of flammability. (2) Natural gas representative of commercially available natural gas fuel which will be generally available through retail outlets shall be used in service accumulation for natural gas- fueled vehicles. (3) Other natural gas fuels may be used for testing and service accumulation provided:
