This is the clear warning delivered by a study by Luis Barata of the central planning department of the state secretariat for regional planning and development published last week. The study details the risks and defects of industrial specialization in the Portuguese economy. The study also presents a number of disquieting conclusions on the future of some industries with regard to specialization. For instance, it emphasizes the probability that industries such as textiles, electronic components, and pharmaceuticals will witness the deterioration of their industrial specialization in the medium term. The scenario is no more encouraging for metallurgy, armaments, telecommunications, and machine tools, given increasing competitiveness. In addition, the horizon is clearly unfavorable for data processing equipment, cereals, organic chemistry, base minerals, optics, and photography. On the basis of indicators culled from the end of the 1980's and the beginning of the 1990's, the author argues that Portugal "continues to present a weak industrial structure" at a time when specialization is seen as the name of the game. [passage omitted] According to the study, the recent evolution of the nation's industries "has not brought significant changes to its basic characteristics, maintaining an imbalance in which the textile and forestry sectors have a disproportionate weight." The fragile aspects of the Portuguese economy are also defined: a weak industrial infrastructure that is too polarized, be it by regions or by sectors, and rests on the "old, superseded" standard of cheap labor. Therefore, new methods of production, improved quality, and the establishment of a good image are considered decisive for those sectors in which the Portuguese economy traditionally maintains comparative advantages: textiles and clothing, ceramics, wines, and forestry products. [passage omitted] The foreseeable trend for the three large categories in which the author divides the Portuguese economy (internationally specialized, dependent and relatively self-sufficient) are as follows: in the activities that were specialized in the past, there are good prospects for beverages, leather and footwear, canned fruits and vegetables, and consumer electronics, because of previous investments [passage omitted]. For dependent industries, increasing specialization is foreseen in six fields: electrical equipment of various types, aeronautics, nonferrous metals, transportation and public works equipment, and oleaginous products. Strangely, the study maintains that specialization in the production of auto parts will tend to stagnate. Despite the increased auto production foreseen for this sector--mainly because of the Ford-Volkswagen project--the study believes that "imports will tend to increase unless companies furnishing both products for the Portuguese market and a majority percentage for direct export establish themselves in Portugal." For the relatively self-sufficient industries, there are positive prospects for industrial electrical equipment, ceramics, cement/stone, commercial vehicles, nonferrous metals, furniture, light vehicles, plastics, and boiler equipment. In spite of positive signs for the future of these activities, the study warns that real results depend on the evolution of the Portuguese and Spanish economies, contrary to the other two groups, where problems are of a "European, or even world dimension."
