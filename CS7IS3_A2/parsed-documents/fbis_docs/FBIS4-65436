This "change in policy" is "politically completely unacceptable", Kanther said in Bonn on Wednesday [18 May]. The SPD is "obliged for the sake of social peace within Germany" to continue to put the asylum compromise agreement of 1993 into practice. Kanther warned that the behavior of Rhineland-Palatinate and Schleswig-Holstein is "really an invitation to illegal immigration". The impression is being created in the countries of origin that the German asylum procedure is "meaningless because deportation will not be carried out anyway." The interior minister said it is "quite clear" that the Kurds are not threatened "with persecution in most areas of Turkey." The Federal Administrative Court has confirmed the possibility of finding safe havens within Turkey itself.
