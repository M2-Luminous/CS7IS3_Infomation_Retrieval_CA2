The Paraguayan Government today formally rejected the U.S. State Department report on human rights violations in our country. After meeting with Foreign Minister Luis Maria Ramirez Boettner, U.S. Ambassador Jon Glassman noted, however, that the report is completely objective. The report, which has revealed worldwide that human rights continue to be violated in our country, was formally rejected by the government. To this end, Foreign Minister Ramirez Boettner summoned Ambassador Glassman. The details of the rejection have not been disclosed because Ramirez Boettner continues to be reluctant to answer reporters' questions, and Glassman, for diplomatic reasons, declined to elaborate on the subject. He displayed, however, his disagreement with our government's position because, in his opinion, the report is quite objective. [passage omitted]
