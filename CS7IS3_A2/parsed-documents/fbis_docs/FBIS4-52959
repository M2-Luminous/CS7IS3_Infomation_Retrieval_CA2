"We cannot but lodge our regrets," said one Foreign Ministry official. But the official said Seoul will wait to make a formal response until after IAEA inspectors can determine the status of the reactor and how much of the process has been completed. "We note the fact that despite North Korea's declaration that it has gone ahead with the discharge, it said there is still an opportunity for random selection and preservation of the fuel rods, " said the official. "It would be inappropriate for us to declare a stance before the IAEA judgement." North Korea had notified the United States at their working-level contact Friday and the Vienna-based IAEA that it could no longer defer removal of the nuclear fuel rods from its 5-megawatt reactor due to technical reasons. But the letter to the IAEA said Pyongyang has "just begun" the process and the agency still has time to choose the rods and place them under inspection for future measurement. Seoul, Washington and the IAEA have repeatedly warned that changing the rods without IAEA supervision would end the dialogue phase and push the North Korean nuclear issue toward the U.N. Security Council. But some sources here called North Korea's declaration more of a "bluff" aimed at dragging Washington to the negotiating table for further high-level talks. It is still unclear whether North Korea went ahead with the core activities of the discharging process, which takes a considerable amount of time. "The fact that Pyongyang said there is still an opportunity for random selection and securing of the rods seems to indicate the process is in a very rudimentary stage," said one source. Others believe that North Korea is intent on gaining the upper hand in negotiations with the United States when high-level dialogue does resume.
