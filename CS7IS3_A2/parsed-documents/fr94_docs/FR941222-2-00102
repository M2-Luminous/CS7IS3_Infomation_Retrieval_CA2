FR941222-2-00102 FR941222-2-00089 [Docket Nos. 50&hyph;387 & 50&hyph;388] Susquehanna Steam Electric Station Units 1 & 2; Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating License Nos. NPF&hyph;14 & NPF&hyph;22 issued to Pennsylvania Power & Light Company for operation of the Susquehanna Steam Electric Station, Units 1 and 2, located in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania. The proposed amendment would add the Special Test Exception 3/4.10.6, ``Inservice Leak and Hydrostatic Testing,'' that allows the performance of pressure testing at reactor coolant temperature up to 212 ○F while remaining in OPERATIONAL CONDITION 4. This special test exception would also require that certain OPERATIONAL CONDITION 3 Specifications for Secondary Containment Isolation, Secondary Containment Integrity and Standby Gas Treatment System operability be met. This change would also revise the Index, Table 1.2, ``OPERATIONAL CONDITIONS,'' and the Bases to incorporate the reference to the proposed special test exception. Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations. The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The proposed changes are requested to allow inservice leak and hydrostatic testing, with the reactor in OPERATIONAL CONDITION 4 and the average reactor coolant temperature up to 212 ○F. The change to allow inservice leak and hydrostatic testing in OPERATIONAL CONDITION 4 will not increase the probability or the consequences of an accident. The probability of a leak in the reactor coolant pressure boundary during inservice leak and hydrostatic testing is not increased by considering the reactor in OPERATIONAL CONDITION 4. The hydrostatic or inservice leak test is performed water solid or near water solid, and temperatures less than or equal to 212 ○F. The stored energy in the reactor core will be very low and the potential for failed fuel and a subsequent increase in coolant activity above Technical Specification limits are minimal. In addition, secondary containment will be operable and capable of handling airborne radioactivity from leaks that could occur during the performance of hydrostatic or inservice leak testing. Requiring the secondary containment to be operable will ensure that potential airborne radiation from leaks will be filtered through the Standby Gas Treatment System, thus limiting radiation releases to the environment. Therefore, the change will not significantly increase the consequences of an accident. In the event of a large primary system leak, the reactor vessel would rapidly depressurize allowing the low pressure ECCS systems to operate. The capability of the systems that are required for OPERATIONAL CONDITION 4 would be adequate to keep the core flooded under this condition. Small system leaks would be detected by leakage inspections before significant inventory loss occurred. This is an integral part of the hydrostatic testing program. Therefore, this change will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. Allowing the reactor to be considered in OPERATIONAL CONDITION 4 during hydrostatic or leak testing, with a reactor coolant temperature of up to 212 ○F, is an exception to certain OPERATIONAL CONDITION 3 requirements, including primary containment integrity and total Emergency Core Cooling System operability. The hydrostatic or inservice leakage test is performed water solid, or near water solid, and coolant temperature less than or equal to 212 ○F. The stored energy in the reactor core will be very low and the potential for failed fuel and a subsequent increase in coolant activity above Technical Specification limits are minimal. In addition, the secondary containment will be operable and capable of handling airborne radioactivity from leaks that could occur during the performance of hydrostatic or inservice leakage testing. The inservice leak or hydrostatic test conditions remain unchanged. The potential for a system leak remains unchanged since the reactor coolant system is designed for temperatures exceeding 500 ○F with similar pressures. There are no alternations of any plant systems that cope with the spectrum of accidents. The only difference is that a different subset of systems would be utilized for accident mitigation from those of OPERATIONAL CONDITION 3. Therefore, this change will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. 3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed change allows inservice leak and hydrostatic testing to be performed with a reactor coolant temperature up to 212 ○F and the reactor in OPERATIONAL CONDITION 4. Since the reactor vessel head will be in place, secondary containment integrity will be maintained and all systems required in OPERATIONAL CONDITION 4 will be operable in accordance with the Technical Specifications, the proposed change will not have any significant impact on any design bases accident or safety limit. The hydrostatic or inservice leak testing is performed water solid, or near water solid, and temperature less than or equal to 212 ○F. The stored energy in the core is very low and the potential for failed fuel and a subsequent increase in coolant activity would be minimal. The reactor pressure vessel would rapidly depressurize in the event of a large primary system leak and the low pressure injection systems required to be operable in OPERATION CONDITION 4 would be adequate to keep the core flooded. This would ensure that the fuel would not exceed the 2200 ○F peak clad temperature limit. Also requiring secondary containment integrity will assure that potential airborne radiation can be filtered through the SGTS. This will assure that offsite does remain well within the limits of 10 CFR 100 guidelines. Small system leaks would be detected by inspections before significant inventory loss could occur. Therefore, this special test exception will not involve a significant reduction in safety margin. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However, should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the Federal Register a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take this action will occur very infrequently. Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and should cite the publication data and page number of this Federal Register notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville, Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC. The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.
