The statement says: The South Korean authorities block a wide-range dialogue involving various strata of society. This shows they do not want national reconciliation and unity, peace and reunification. It reveals their sinister political intention to isolate and stifle the Korean-style socialist system centred on the masses in conspiracy with outside forces. The South Korean authorities must act with discretion, mindful that if they persistently refuse the proposed national conference and take the line of confrontation and war, they will face a grim judgement by the nation. The Central Committee of the Union of Agricultural Working People of Korea will continue to make all sincere efforts for the convocation of the national conference and remain faithful to its mission for the nation.
