The meeting is a significant meeting to display the militant spirit of our people and the working people of the coal industry sector who are vigorously advancing along the road of the revolution's victory by demonstrating the invincibility of our-style socialism under the chuche revolutionary banner unperturbed by the imperialists' vicious challenge. The Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] Central Committee sends warm congratulations to the participants in the meeting and all the functionaries and coal miners of the coal industry sector who have registered great labor exploits in implementing the party's chuche-oriented coal industrial policy by waging a devoted struggle for the growth and prosperity of the socialist fatherland and the happiness of our people with high loyalty to the party and the leader. The coal front is one of the most important fronts for our people's economy, and a lifeline for bringing a breakthrough in the struggle to implement the revolutionary economic strategy put forth by our party. The party members and working people of the coal industry sector have actively contributed to the enhancement of the country's wealth, power, and development and the people's happiness with a devoted struggle and creative labor under the wise leadership of the party and the leader with firm faith in socialism, and have attained great success in developing the country's coal industry. The functionaries of the coal industry sector and the coal miners have reconstructed and expanded in a modern way the large-scale coal mines in Anju, Sunchon, Pukchang, and Tokchon districts within a short period, displaying an indomitable fighting spirit with high self-awareness befitting the master of the revolution. Developing numerous coal mines in promising districts, they have registered a proud exploit of drastically increasing coal production capacity. The functionaries and working people of the coal industry sector built strong mining facility production bases and coal prospecting and coal mine construction force all over the country highly displaying revolutionary enthusiasm and creative enterprising spirit. By so doing, they attained brilliant success in strengthening the coal industry's material and technological base. The workers and technicians of the coal industry intensified their creative cooperation so that they could enhance the mechanization standard of coal mining work and extensively introduced advanced technological processes and work methods. By so doing, they are modernizing coal mines and producing more coal while working more joyfully. Today, the coal industry of our country has great production potential capable of smoothly satisfying the need of the people's economy for coal. At the same time, it dependably ensures the strengthening and development of a self-reliant socialist national economy and invincible might. This proud success attained by the coal industry sector is the noble effort of the coal industry sector functionaries and coal miners who are working diligently in underground pits thousands of fathoms deep devoting their clean conscience and sincere labor in upholding our party's coal industry policy for the party, the revolution, the country, and the people, irrespective of whether someone recognizes their hard work. The WPK Central Committee highly appreciates the great labor exploits of the functionaries and working people of the coal industry sector that were attained in the struggle to increase coal production by implementing the party's coal industrial policy of upholding the leadership of the party and the leader. The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: Coal plays a very important role in the country's industrial development and the people's livelihood. The struggle to attain great upsurges in coal production today is a very important and honorable struggle to accelerate overall socialist construction by implementing the party's agriculture-first policy, light industry-first policy, and trade-first policy. At the same time, it is a sacred struggle to crush [chitpusida] the maneuvers of the U.S. imperialists and reactionaries who are going wild to blockade [pongswae] and stifle [chilsik] our country-- the fortress of socialism--and to defend, adhere to, and add further luster to our country's socialism centered on the popular masses. All the functionaries and working people of the coal industry sector should protect the party by increasing coal production as the steel fighters upheld the party by increasing the production of steel during the difficult post-war period and defended the line of socialist economic construction. In so doing, they should protect the party with coal production, and defend our-style socialism more firmly and add further luster to it. The functionaries and coal miners of the coal industry sector should firmly arm themselves with our party's chuche idea, uphold the party wholeheartedly and loyally. With firm faith that our socialism, enjoying the great party's leadership, will certainly be victorious, they should thoroughly implement the party's coal mining policy on the principle of absoluteness and unconditionality. Highly displaying the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude that overflowed the majestic Mt. Paektu during the period of anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle, all functionaries and coal miners should courageously overcome all kinds of difficulties and barriers facing them in coal production. With a firm determination to resolve everything with one's own strength, even if the higher echelons do not supply the necessities--although it would be better if the higher echelons did supply them--they should wage the struggle to increase coal production earnestly and persistently, filled to overflowing with revolutionary optimism. They should actively wage the struggle to reinforce the repair and maintenance bases at coal mines and ensure, on their own, the necessary conditions for production of facilities, parts, supplies, and light tools necessary for coal production. They should accelerate the modernization of coal mines and achieve endless upsurges in coal production by more forcefully carrying out the technological revolution. They should put effort into the replacement of facilities with large, modern, and high-speed ones in carrying out the technological revolution and into the mechanization and comprehensive mechanization of the work inside mining pits, and diversification of transport. They should widely accept advanced mining methods and technological procedures while producing more modern machine units fit for our country's coal fields and revamping the structure and framework of mine pits in this connection. They should try to actively solve scientific and technological problems arising from developing and introducing modern machine units and production methods while putting forth more innovations of new technologies, creative designs, and rationalization plans by bringing together the wisdom and efforts of workers and technicians, introducing them into production on a timely basis, and decisively enhancing the role of scientists. The functionaries in the coal industrial sector should have the production proceed in accordance with the production process by conducting well the technological management of facilities, increasing their utilization rate, dovetailing the production processes with each other in a thorough-going way, and solving pending problems on a timely basis. The functionaries in the coal industrial sector should increase the coal production per coal mining site and build more of new coal mines and mining pits by reconstructing and expanding the mining pits of the existing coal mines, focusing on production, and simplifying the transport system. Giving priority to exploring, digging, and mining is an inviolable rule in the development of coal industry. The functionaries in the coal industrial sector should create more new coal fields by carrying out scrupulously the work to increase exploring capability, reinforce technological equipment, and to introduce advanced exploration methods, thereby endlessly increasing the efficiency and speed of exploration, securing more coal deposits, and forcefully carrying out the high-speed digging movement. Much attention should be paid to conserving coal resources and making an effective use of them. With a deep understanding of the justness of our party's policy to develop the economy in a chuche-oriented way on the basis of coal resources, coal mines should wage an active struggle to dig coal thoroughly without loss, completely dig the shallow coal bed, and widely use low-calorie coal. The functionaries in the coal industrial sector should pay great attention to the labor security and safeguard in conformity with the characteristic of the work inside the mining pits and solidifying the indoctrination of labor security and safeguard for coal miners, thus having them strictly abide by standard manufacturing procedure and labor security and safeguard. Rear-area services for coal miners should be further improved. Thoroughly realizing the party's intention not to spare anything for the coal miners, the functionaries should give priority to supplying coal miners with (?workers' supplies) and subsidiary food on a priority basis, and firmly manage the rear-area bases of supplies including meat, eggs, and vegetables at coal mines, produce more subsidiary food of various kinds, on their own, and supply them for the coal miners. They should help give top priority to supplying facilities and materials so as to normalize coal production at a high level, to give solid priority to the coal industry, and to further accelerate the country's overall economic development. Various sectors of the people's economy, such as metal, machine, and forestry industries, should also carry out well the work of insuring the necessary conditions for production of various machine units including compressors, (?electric cars and railroad ties) on a timely basis, and of supplementing (?labor force) and technicians to coal mines. The party work in the coal industrial sector should be further solidified in conformity with the demands of the developing realities. By firmly putting together functionaries and workers around the party and waging the organizational political work in a fresh fashion, the party organizations in the coal industrial sector should foster all coal miners as coal warriors endlessly loyal to the party and have all of them become creators of exploits and innovations in the implementation of the party's coal policy. Along with this, in conformity with the demands of the Taean work system, they should further improve the management and operation of coal mines, firmly build the production system in which the mining pits are the basic battle units. They should strengthen the party- oriented guidance so that all problems arising from production can be solved on a timely basis under the unified command of the planning staff of mining pits. Today, the coal industrial sector is facing a heavy and honorable duty. Our party is expressing much confidence in and expectation to the functionaries and workers in the coal industrial sector. The WPK Central Committee firmly believes that all functionaries and coal miners of the coal industrial sector will wonderfully repay the party's great confidence and expectation by achieving fresh revolutionary upsurges in coal production and giving solid priority to the development of coal industry, upholding the party's revolutionary economic strategy.
