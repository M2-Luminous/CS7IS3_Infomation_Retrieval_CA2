The deadline for coalitions and parties to file their respective petitions expired at 1900 today. The TSE will review the documents submitted by the presidential hopefuls before officially approving their candidacies. The electoral timetable provides that the TSE will have to rule on petitions and appeals by 20 July. The candidates are: Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva (PT) [Workers Party], Fernando Henrique Cardoso (PSDB) [Brazilian Social Democracy Party], Orestes Quercia (PMDB) [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party], Leonel Brizola (PDT) [Democratic Labor Party], Esperidiao Amin (PPR) [Popular Renewal Party], Flavio Rocha (PL) [Liberal Party], Eneas Carneiro (PRONA) [Party for the Redefinition of the National Order], Hernani Goulart Fortuna (PSC) [Social Christian Party], Walter Queiroz (PRN) [National Reconstruction Party], and Caetano Matano (PT do B) [Brazilian Workers Party -- Partido Trabalhista do Brasil]. They represent 18 of the 21 parties -- most of which have formed coalitions -- that are qualified to nominate presidential candidates. The PP [Popular Party], the PRP [Progressive Republican Party], and the PMN [National Mobilization Party] are staying out of the race. Only the PSDB and PDT candidates personally appeared before the TSE to submit their documents. All other candidates were represented by members of their parties. Two petitions to register party names that are not legally constituted were also processed even though they do not have a provisional register. They are the PNSDC [National Social Democratic Christian Party -- Partido Nacional Social Democratico Cristao] and the PTRB [Brazilian Labor Renewal Party -- Partido Trabalhista Renovador Brasileiro]. In principle these petitions comply with legal provisions. They will be reviewed by TSE members at the beginning of next week. They must decide if the parties, the coalitions, and the candidates for president and vice president fulfill the requirements established by the party and electoral laws and the Constitution.
