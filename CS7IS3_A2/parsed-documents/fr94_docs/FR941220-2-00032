FR941220-2-00032 FR941220-2-00024 NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION [Docket No. 50&hyph;219] GPU Nuclear Corporation; Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating License No. DPR&hyph;16, issued to GPU Nuclear Corporation (GPUN/the licensee) for operation of the Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station (OCNGS) located in Ocean County, New Jersey. The proposed amendment would revise Technical Specification 5.3.1.E to allow 2645 fuel assemblies to be stored in the fuel pool. This is an increase of 45 fuel assemblies from the current limit of 2600. The 45 additional storage location currently exist in the racks in the fuel pool. They were included in the re-racking project allowed by License Amendment No. 76 but were not incorporated in the Technical Specifications since, at the time, it was believed they would not be needed. Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations. The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 1. The operation of the Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. There are no changes in the existing provisions for load handling in the vicinity of the spent fuel pool associated with the proposed increase in licensed storage capacity. OCNGS Technical Specification 5.3.1.B limits the loads carried over the spent fuel pool to no greater than the weight of one fuel assembly. Therefore, accidents involving the mispositioning or drop of a fuel assembly establish the extent of accident probability or consequences. The Abnormal Positioning of a Fuel Assembly Outside the Storage Rack and the Dropped Fuel Assembly accident scenarios are addressed as follows: a. The probability of occurrence of the above accidents is not affected by the racks themselves or the stored fuel. Since no physical changes are being made to the racks, an increase in licensed storage capacity cannot increase the probability of these accidents. b. The consequences of abnormal positioning of a fuel assembly outside the storage rack were evaluated. Since the storage rack criticality calculations were made using an infinite array of storage cells with no neutron leakage, positioning a fuel assembly outside and adjacent to the actual finite rack can add reactivity, but would, because of neutron leakage, result in a lower K eff than the K oo calculated for the infinite array. Thus, additional stored fuel assemblies will not increase consequences of this type of accident than those previously evaluated. c. The consequences of a dropped fuel assembly striking either the base of the rack or the top of a storage location and the reactivity effects were also evaluated in the licensing report supporting Amendment 76. In all cases, the evaluated integrity of the racks was not exceeded. Also, the dropped fuel assembly did not constitute a criticality hazard because the infinite multiplication factor of the fuel storage racks was not materially altered. An increase in fuel enrichment does not increase consequences since the GE&hyph;9 assemblies' mechanical specifications are bounded by previous designs and consequences are not dependent on U&hyph;235 enrichment. Thus, since no physical alteration of the storage racks is necessary to store 45 additional fuel assemblies the consequences of this type of accident are not increased. 2. The operation of Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The increase in licensed spent fuel pool storage capacity involves the addition of 45 fuel assemblies. The increased structural loading has already been accounted for in the analyses reviewed by the NRC staff in support of Amendment 76. There are no physical changes to the fuel pool cooling. These systems are capable of handling the additional duty originating from the additional fuel. Criticality accidents or malfunctions also do not change because the analysis assumes an infinite array of fuel and Boraflex gaps have been conservatively accounted for. Therefore, there is no possibility for an accident or malfunction of a different type than previously evaluated. 3. The operation of Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The margin of safety, when applied to a storage expansion, needs to address nuclear criticality, thermal-hydraulic, mechanical, material and structural adequacy. Nuclear Criticality The acceptance criterion for criticality as established in Technical Specification 5.3.1.A, is that the neutron multiplication factor shall be less than or equal to 0.95, including all uncertainties. Since the increase in licensed capacity to 2,600 storage locations, the maximum allowable average enrichment was increased twice. The original analysis was for 3.01% U&hyph;235 enrichment fuel with no credit for Gd 2 0 3 . Subsequent analyses increased the maximum allowable enrichment to 3.8% and then 4.0% U&hyph;235. Both analyses take credit for Gd 2 0 3 requiring a minimum of 7 (seven) rods containing 3.0% or more Gd 2 0 3 . Subsequent to the rack installation, an industry concern was raised with the discovery of the formation of gaps in Boraflex panels. The problem of gap formation in the boraflex and its impact on criticality has been addressed. The criticality analysis was updated to take into account the presence of gaps, including projected gap formation is coplanar. The fuel pool K eff for the 4.0% U&hyph;235 enriched fuel with at least 7 (seven) Gd 2 0 3 rods at peak reactivity is 0.9174 and increases to 0.945 with 3.9 inch coplanar gaps in the Boraflex which is below the 0.95 limit. Oyster Creek maintains a Boraflex surveillance program to ensure the assumptions used in the analysis remain valid. Since all criticality analyses were performed with an infinite lattice, it is valid for a spent fuel pool capacity of 2,645 fuel assemblies. Therefore, there is no decrease in the margin of safety.
