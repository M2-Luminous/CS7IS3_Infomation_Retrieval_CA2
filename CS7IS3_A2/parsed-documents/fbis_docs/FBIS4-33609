Canadian Government sources in Ottawa have said that Christine Stewart, minister of state for Latin America and Africa, will make the announcement during an economic conference in Havana on 20 June. Canadian aid will not be between governments but will consist of assistance to nongovernmental organizations that work in Cuba. The Canadian Government gave approximately $576,000 in urgent assistance to humanitarian organizations in Cuba last year, including the Red Cross. Ottawa never broke diplomatic relations even though it suspended all governmental aid to Havana in 1978. The same source stated that the lifting of the aid embargo on Cuba has been generally well received.
