In 1953, he quit his studies at Tokyo University's Law Faculty to work at the Foreign Ministry. Before assuming his current post as ambassador to the United Nations in February 1990, Mr. Hatano served as head of the Personnel Division of the Minister's Secretariat, head of the Middle Eastern and African Affairs Bureau, and ambassador of Japan's UN delegation in Geneva.] Some say that the United Nations entered a new era after the Cold War ended, when it was faced with an upheaval in the international situation, i.e., the Gulf war. The advent of this new era was marked by the appointment of Butrus Butrus-Ghali as UN secretary general (January 1992). We asked Yoshio Hatano, UN ambassador, who has played a role in the "history of the new United Nations" for three-and-a-half years, including the two years in which Japan was a non-permanent member of the Security Council (until 1993), to describe the current situation at the United Nations. Mountains of Requests for PKO Missions [EKONOMISUTO] What effects have the recent cataclysmic changes, including the collapse of the Berlin Wall, had on the United Nations? [Hatano] During the Cold War, the United Nations did not reach agreements on any political problems. Nor did it reach agreements on economic problems either, since the interests of advanced nations and developing nations conflicted. Ultimately, the United Nations managed to justify its existence by handling social problems like refugee aid and human rights. When the Cold War ended, the Security Council began to agree on political problems as well, and to lay the groundwork for world peace and security. I first became clearly aware of this change during the Gulf war. The United Nations had acquired the confidence and the assertiveness to establish a "just peace" by intervening in disputes. [EKONOMISUTO] Do you mean that the UN Secretariat has gained confidence? [Hatano] No, I was referring to all the member nations. Furthermore, expectations of the United Nations are overly high. Now the prevailing notion is that the United Nations will intervene to establish a just peace any time a dispute occurs anywhere in the world. Consequently, the United Nations now has no choice but to respond to these expectations. Even when it cannot expect to be successful, it cannot just stand back and do nothing. In particular, requests are beginning to come in from all over the world for PKO [peacekeeping operations] missions. The atmosphere is such that the United Nations cannot refuse requests from other regions, because it dispatched PKO personnel to Cambodia. The United Nations has received mountains of requests for PKO missions. Many of them have been rejected, but the United Nations will have to take action in response to some of them. [EKONOMISUTO] Some say that the United Nations has reached the limit as far as PKO is concerned. [Hatano] Apparently, Secretary General Butrus-Ghali thinks that UN intervention will, of necessity, increase in the future. Then we have the question of how the United Nations will intervene, but that will depend on the effectiveness of previous Security Council resolutions. Therefore, nations that are not members of the Security Council have a difficult time making their influence felt. [EKONOMISUTO] Does that mean that the Cambodian operation was successful? [Hatano] Some members of the Security Council are of the opinion that the lessons learned from the Cambodian operation can be applied to Somalia as well. One of those lessons is the merits of having refrained from using armed force. Furthermore, Japan sponsored a Cambodian aid conference, without waiting for the dispute to be resolved. The parties involved in the dispute realized that peace would bring them many tangible benefits. Another is the benefits from having maintained a cooperative relationship with local leaders, like Prince Sihanouk. That approach has been praised by members of the Security Council as well. [EKONOMISUTO] But the financial burden on member nations, including Japan, seems to be ballooning, with no end in sight. [Hatano] Two years ago, at a Security Council meeting at which the advisability of a particular PKO mission was being discussed, I asked, "Where will the money come from?" The reply I received was something like, "We are discussing peace and security. One cannot attach a price to peace and security." But recently, all member nations have begun to give serious consideration to the financial problem. This sort of awareness is increasing. [EKONOMISUTO] Does that mean that some members are having second thoughts about PKO, now that the expense has risen so high? [Hatano] I think it means that every nation is on the verge of being unable to shoulder its share of the PKO budget, which is three or four times the UN general budget. For instance, if a peace agreement is reached in the former Yugoslavia, the cost of PKO in Yugoslavia alone will amount to three or four times the UN general budget. This is higher than what had been anticipated. It has become difficult for the members to justify the expense to the financial and taxation authorities at home. However, there is the argument that the alternative, war, would be far more costly. [EKONOMISUTO] Do a majority of Security Council members, who rule on PKO missions, feel that the financial limit has been reached? [Hatano] I don't think the limit has been reached yet, but we are approaching the limit as far as contributions are concerned. The situation is becoming difficult for the United States, whose share is so large, and even if Russia wanted to contribute, it doesn't have any money. [EKONOMISUTO] Is there some regret over the Security Council's having authorized so many PKO missions over the past two years? [Hatano] Secretary General Butrus-Ghali has often mentioned something to that effect, but I'm not sure he would be able to say no to a request. For instance, Japan has been criticized by other nations for being unenthusiastic about PKO: "We cooperated with you in Cambodia. Don't you care about Africa or the former Soviet Union?" The secretary general, too, may find it difficult to refuse one request after granting another. Japan and the Reformation of the Security Council [EKONOMISUTO] Then there is the problem of reforming the Security Council. Does the international community feel that reform is necessary? [Hatano] I think that it does, without question. I have often said that the world is losing confidence in the Security Council in its present form. I think that doubts about the legitimacy of the Security Council, as it is now, have become a world issue. The Security Council is set up so that a mere 15 nations now decide the fates of 184 member nations. All the non-permanent member nations have questioned the Security Council's current state. The more vocal criticisms have been voiced by developing nations which became members after the United Nations was established. In other words, even though the North-South balance of the United Nations has changed, the North-South balance in the Security Council has not, and they want to see that corrected. In the second place, Japan and Germany have become major powers, both economically and politically. One questions the advisability of keeping these two nations out of the Security Council. Another problem is the lack of transparency of the Security Council -- the opinion that more member nations should be able to participate in the Security Council's decision-making process, even indirectly. [EKONOMISUTO] The permanent member nations of the Security Council say that if it acquires more members, it will be less efficient. [Hatano] At first glance, one gets the impression that the Security Council is efficient because its membership is small. But one might question how many of the decisions made by the Security Council, which is now being subjected to criticism, have been effective. During the past two years, it has issued many resolutions and president's declarations, but the truth is that many of them did not produce the desired results. On the other hand, there is no point in making the Security Council an organization with dozens of member nations, one that has difficulty reaching a conclusion. This is a question of balance, so some have suggested keeping the current 15 members, and adding a few. [EKONOMISUTO] How has Japan's status in the United Nations changed? [Hatano] Japan is now a major presence at the United Nations. Secretary General Butrus-Ghali said so himself when he visited Japan. In material terms, Japan is the second-largest contributor to the United Nations, after the U.S. Japan ranks high in providing human resources as well. Japan has provided five top-ranking officials in UN organizations, including Special Envoy to Yugoslavia Akashi, High Commissioner for Refugees Ogata, and WHO Chairman Nakajima. Secretary General Butrus-Ghali has said that the only nations having so many of its citizens in key positions at the United Nations are the United States and Japan and, in actuality, Japan is viewed as a major force there. Furthermore, Japanese who are members of important committees were elected to those committees with huge majorities of votes. It is probably not my place to determine whether Japan is a major power at the United Nations. However, an objective point of view is that Japan has already become a major force within the United Nations. Despite that status, people are saying that Japan's political aspirations are those of a middle-sized nation, so we will probably hear more accusations of avoiding responsibility. [EKONOMISUTO] Is it appropriate to assume that Japan desires to become a permanent member of the Security Council? [Hatano] All the members are aware of Prime Minister Hosokawa's address to the UN General Assembly, and of media reports. They also know that until now, Japan has not declared its intention to establish equality with other nations. That is why the secretary general expressed his wish for Japan to become more active, on his second visit to Japan, by saying "the United Nations would benefit from Japan's becoming a permanent member of the Security Council." The UN Bureaucracy [EKONOMISUTO] The members' opinions of Secretary General Butrus-Ghali seem to vary wildly. [Hatano] I think he's a strong leader. He's been called stubborn, and an autocrat, but he will not go against his beliefs. He says, jokingly, "I'm past 70 now. At this point, my character is not going to change," so he seems to be aware that he has been criticized in various ways. The members recognize the secretary general's strong leadership and his ability to get things done. Furthermore, he has a great affection for Japan. [EKONOMISUTO] Even a man with such strong leadership ability may find it difficult to reform the bureaucratic structure of the Secretariat. The United States and other nations say that there is too much inefficiency. [Hatano] It could accurately be called an inefficient organization. But it is the member nations who are to blame, not the secretary general. The developing nations are opposed to the reform and rationalization of economic development, which the secretary general feels should be given top priority. The secretary general has himself criticized the bureaucratic structure of the United Nations, and is doing his utmost to reform it. Nor are the member nations at all happy with the bureaucratic structure, but they protest when personnel reductions are suggested. No nation wants one of its citizens to lose his UN job. The advanced nations are guilty of this, too. They say rationalization is necessary, but they don't want any of their people to be laid off. The same goes for Japan. [EKONOMISUTO] Is the United States an exception? [Hatano] The United States is hoping that the United Nations will rationalize its headquarters, and downsize it. Since the United States is the host country for UN headquarters, and bears 25 percent of the burden of the UN general budget, and 30 percent of the PKO budget, the United Nations has been quite cautious in its relationship with the United States. [EKONOMISUTO] At a time when the roles of the United Nations and its Security Council are growing in importance, Japan is not one of the (nonpermanent) members of the Security Council. [Hatano] I think this will put us in a very difficult position. If, by some chance, the United Nations decides to augment the PKO in the former Yugoslavia, then we'll be told, "All right, Japan's share is $500 million." Japan is unable to voice its opinions during the decision-making process at the Security Council. Then, there is the problem of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula. If, in the worst case, a proposal for sanctions against North Korea is brought before the Security Council, we will have to wait outside the Security Council hall until the member nations' ambassadors come out and tell us how the debate is proceeding. Of course, we would hold thorough discussions with the United States and other nations on the subject before it is debated in the Council. But that is quite different from being able to participate directly in the discussion. Three-and-a-half years ago, when I arrived in New York to assume my current position, my first experience was the Gulf war problem. I waited outside the Security Council until the member nations' ambassadors emerged, and asked them, "What happened? What happened?" That scenario was repeated, and the result of the debate was that Japan was presented with a bill for $11 billion, and was criticized, to boot.... A situation like this would be unthinkable in Western Europe. The conventional wisdom there is "no taxation without representation." Japan's Status in the United Nations [EKONOMISUTO] Nevertheless, has Japan's importance increased over the past three tumultuous years? [Hatano] Until PKO's increased scale, until the PKO budget reached three or four times the UN general budget, Japan's contribution to the general budget was 12.45 percent, or $1.1 billion. Now that our assessed contribution has risen to more than 12 percent of a PKO budget of more than $3 billion, Japan's status has certainly risen. Furthermore, Japan is popular with the member nations. The developing nations count on Japan to act as their representative, to convey their views to the advanced nations. They feel this way partly because Japan provides economic aid, but their overall expectations of Japan are quite high. On the other hand, the advanced nations view Japan as a nation that espouses the same value system as they do. There aren't many occasions on which the advanced nations and developing nations form separate opposing blocs, but in committees, the Human Rights Committee for example, the difference between the two groups is marked. I receive requests such as, "Japan is the representative of the Asia group, isn't it? Please explain Asia's position to the advanced nations, and try to convince them." On the other hand, the advanced nations will tell me, "Please explain our position to the Asia group." The good side of this situation is that Japan might be said to be acting as a bridge between the two blocs of nations. The bad side is that we can find ourselves at a disadvantage, caught in the middle. Once, when we were deciding upon candidates for an election within the Asia group, one of the ambassadors said, "Japan's views are not representative of Asian views, and its people run for election too often. The best thing Japan could do for the Asia group would be to leave it. That would also be in Japan's best interest." I was quite shocked by that statement, but I learned a lesson from it. When we continue to gain favor with the advanced nations and the developing nations, and are viewed by both groups as a nation that is doing a good job, we know that Japan has a very visible presence. In other words, Japan has become a major power. It is time for Japan to assert its own opinions. Even if we make enemies, it's time for us to follow through. We may end up making enemies temporarily but, in the long term, Japan will become a nation that is respected and trusted.
