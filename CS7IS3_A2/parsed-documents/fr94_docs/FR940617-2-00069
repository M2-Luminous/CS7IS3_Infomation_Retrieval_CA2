In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's regulations, 18 CFR part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 FR 47910), the Office of Hydropower Licensing has reviewed the licensee's post-licensing filing that proposes modifications to project facilities and operation. Staff's initial evaluation of the proposed modifications was issued on May 31, 1994, in a draft environmental assessment (DEA). The transmittal letter for the DEA stated our intent to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS). A draft EIS will be issued and circulated for review by all interested parties. All comments filed on the draft EIS will be analyzed by staff and considered in the final EIS. Staff's conclusions and recommendations will then be presented for the consideration of the Commission in reaching its final decision. Scoping Meeting A scoping meeting will be held on Wednesday, July 13, 1994, at Cavanaugh's, 20 North Main Street, Kalispell, Montana. The meeting will begin at 2 p.m., adjourn at 5:30 p.m., reconvene at 7:00 p.m., and continue to midnight. All interested individuals, organizations, and agencies are invited to attend and assist staff in identifying the scope of environmental issues that should be analyzed in the EIS. The DEA will be considered the initial scoping document. Copies of the DEA have been mailed to all entities who have expressed interest in this proceeding. The DEA is also available in the Commission's Reference and Information Center, room 3308, of the Commission's offices at 941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426 and will be available at the scoping meeting. We encourage all interested parties to read the DEA prior to the scoping meeting.

Procedures The scoping meeting will be recorded by a stenographer and all statements (oral and written) will become part of the Commission's public record for this proceeding that was noticed on September 21, 1990. Interested persons who are unable to attend, or do not choose to speak at the scoping meeting, may submit written statements for inclusion in the public record.
