What can one say? Yesterday afternoon, when I came to the office to discuss a topic for "Today's Halt" column, the editor suggested I should write about the carnage, but I was not yet over the shock. I said no and left. What kept preying on my mind was that the crime will be folded, rolled up like a carpet and consigned to a dusty corner. It is expected the peace process will resume after a short pause. Yasir 'Arafat will return to work on the "only alternative" and try to fully utilize the "historic opportunity" furnished by the shameless Gaza-Jericho agreement. Yes, this is the greatest grief and ultimate humiliation. 'Arafat said that the crime was one that should not be forgotten. But it will be. They will say that the culprits are not connected with the Israeli Army and probably describe them as hysterical and mentally deranged. 'Arafat was publicly wondering about the position of the United States, as a cosponsor of the peace process. It was President Clinton who orchestrated the signing of the Declaration of Principles. 'Arafat also wants to know the reaction of European and nonaligned countries. What if you get an answer to that, 'Arafat? What will change? Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid, secretary general of the defunct Arab League, said that the massacre will endanger the peace process. The French Foreign Ministry voiced outrage. The White House also expressed mild indignation. The UK Government did not denounce the massacre but criticized the events that followed and expressed--is not this great, 'Arafat?--its hope that the massacre will not impede negotiations between the Arabs and Israel. The Spanish Foreign Ministry expressed its "profound dismay" and called on--this is a good one too--the concerned parties to continue peace efforts. The German Foreign Ministry described the incident as a "bloodbath" and called on--what else can you ask for, 'Arafat?--the various sides not to allow the peace process to be derailed. The International Committee of the Red Cross merely expressed alarm and called for "respect for the rights of civilians" So, everyone and his cousin have denounced the massacre in strong or not-so-strong terms. They also called for talks and the continuation of peace efforts. Is this what you wanted, 'Arafat? Were you worried that, in the absence of condemnation, the sacred blood of the Palestinians would fail to change into negotiable water and dust? What is degrading is that Western foreign ministries despise you, 'Arafat, as much as they despise Palestinians, dead or alive. The massacre that you yourself described as "a crime that should not be forgotten" will, after all, be forgotten. After all expressions of outrage have receded, after the call to get on with our lives--read: let the massacre go unpunished--is heeded, the process of forgetting will set in. For more than 40 years, we and the rest of world have been denouncing and condemning the "Zionist entity," but the Palestinians continued getting killed and liquidated; the chorus of condemnation may as well have been the drone of a fly. How can you confront your people with a straight face while Palestinian bloodshed in the Ibrahimi mosque covers you from head to toe? And, what about earlier Palestinian blood? Have you consigned that to your archives as well? You, 'Arafat, more than anyone else, should see to it that the crime is not forgotten. The least you could do is listen to the advice of Fatah dissident, Munir Maqdah, who said: "In the past, we called on 'Arafat to step down. But now, stepping down is not good enough. The best thing 'Arafat can do is to commit suicide."
