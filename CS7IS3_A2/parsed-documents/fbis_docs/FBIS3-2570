According to statistics, the Guangdong Commodity Inspection Bureau last year checked over 400,000 batches of imported and exported goods worth US$60.8 billion, more than 8,000 batches of which were imported goods valued at US$32.3 billion. According to the bureau, the commodity quality problems discovered by the bureau mainly focused on equipment, steel products, processed oil, grain and chemical products. Of these imported goods with a quality problem, most of the equipment coming under this description was out-dated and imported as investment by foreign businessmen with their technical performance failing to meet an acceptable level or even failing to have the basic technical requirements. Some of such equipment had been assembled with bad parts and components and were in an incomplete state. Some five percent of steel products imported via ports in Guangzhou last year were found to have quality or quantity problems.
