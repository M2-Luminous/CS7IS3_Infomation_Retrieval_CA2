Accord cannot be achieved by the mere signing of an ostentatious document without specific commitments to society by the authorities, a statement adopted by the movement yesterday at an enlarged session of its council says. The document was circulated yesterday at a press conference of its leaders. The following participated in it: Gennadiy Zyuganov, leader of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation; Vasiliy Lipitskiy, chairman of the Board of the People's Party Free Russia (the party of Aleksandr Rutskoy); Mikhail Lapshin, leader of the Agrarian Party of Russia; Sergey Baburin, chairman of the Russian National Union; Stanislav Govorukhin and Sergey Glazyev, representatives of the Democratic Party of Russia faction; Aleksandr Prokhanov, chief editor of the newspaper ZAVTRA; and Aleksandr Tsipko, political scientist. The authors of the statement consider that it is necessary first and foremost to agree on a change in the government course and on measures to save Russia, including "restoring the effectiveness of state power," preventing further growth in crime, and instilling order in the management of state property. The initiators of the "Accord for Russia" movement issued a statement, which says in particular: We are ready to seek accord through specific actions rather than participating in another act of propaganda where correct slogans and words merely serve to conceal an inept and destructive policy. Subscribing to it would mean agreeing to the destruction of the country's scientific and industrial complex, the mass plunder of state property and embezzlement of state funds, the degradation of our people, and the destruction of national spiritual values and culture. All of us today have to agree first and foremost on a change of government course and on immediate measures to save Russia, including -- restoring the effectiveness of state power; -- preventing any exacerbation of crime and corruption and taking tough measures to ensure citizens are really safe and their property secure; -- instilling order in the management of state property and finances, preventing the economic bankruptcy of the state, achieving economic stabilization, and implementing progressive structural changes in the economy; -- ensuring proper social protection and fair distribution of the hardships involved in overcoming the crisis among all strata of society; -- searching for ways to meet the state's commitments to millions of depositors in view of the depreciation of their savings, instilling order in privatization, and ensuring the real protection of the interests of ordinary shareholders; Accord and unification of society are only possible on the basis of these specific objectives and specific actions by the authorities. We advocate accord in action rather than mere words. We can see a way of extricating the country from socioeconomic catastrophe and saving the Russian state and are ready to pool our efforts to further this great aim. [dated] 27 April 1994.
