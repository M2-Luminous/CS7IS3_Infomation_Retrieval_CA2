FR940318-0-00164 FR940318-0-00023 (c) HCFC&hyph;22/HCFC&hyph;142b. The HCFC&hyph;22/HCFC&hyph;142b blend is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;12 in extruded polystyrene boardstock and billet foam. The blend offers an alternative with significantly less potential to deplete ozone than CFC&hyph;12. Users must be in compliance with section 610 Nonessential Products Containing Class II Substances. (d) HFC&hyph;134a. HFC&hyph;134a is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;12 in extruded polystyrene boardstock and billet foam. HFC&hyph;134a offers the potential for a non-ozone-depleting alternative to CFC&hyph;12 blowing agents in extruded polystyrene boardstock and billet foam. HFC&hyph;134a, because of its low flammability and encouraging performance in toxicological testing, exhibits definite advantages from the standpoints of environmental risk and worker and consumer safety. However, HFC&hyph;134a has relatively high thermal conductivity, is costly, and has the potential to contribute to global warming. In addition, the compound has poor solubility in polystyrene polymer, which could limit its usefulness as an alternative blowing agent from a technical standpoint. HFC&hyph;134a also has a relatively high global warming potential compared to other available alternatives. (e) HFC&hyph;152a. HFC&hyph;152a is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;12 in extruded polystyrene boardstock and billet foam. HFC&hyph;152a offers the potential for a non-ozone-depleting alternative to CFC&hyph;12 blowing agents in extruded polystyrene boardstock. However, the high flammability of HFC&hyph;152a when combined with its properties of high thermal conductivity, low solubility in polystyrene polymer, and high permeability through polystyrene limit the extent to which HFC&hyph;152a is likely to replace CFC&hyph;12. Plant modifications may be needed to accommodate the flammability of HFC&hyph;152a, and foams blown with HFC&hyph;152a will need to conform with building code requirements that relate to flammable materials. (f) Saturated light hydrocarbons C3&hyph;C6. Saturated light hydrocarbons C3&hyph;C6 are acceptable as substitutes for CFC&hyph;12 in polystyrene boardstock and billet foam. Of the Saturated Light Hydrocarbons C3&hyph;C6, pentane, isopentane, butane, and isobutane have been demonstrated as feasible blowing agents in polystyrene. In fact, saturated light hydrocarbons C3&hyph;C6 have been used for years in the manufacture of extruded polystyrene sheet products. However, saturated light hydrocarbons C3&hyph;C6 have several disadvantages as blowing agents in extruded polystyrene boardstock and billet foam. Replacement of CFC&hyph;12 blowing agents with Saturated Light Hydrocarbons C3&hyph;C6 may reduce the insulating efficiency in this end-use. Controlling the flammability of saturated light hydrocarbons C3&hyph;C6 may entail significant investment in plant conversion to accommodate them as alternatives to CFC&hyph;12. Foams blown with saturated light hydrocarbons C3&hyph;C6 will need to conform with building code requirements that relate to flammable materials. Finally, saturated light hydrocarbons C3&hyph;C6 are VOCs and must be controlled as such under Title I of the CAA. (g) HCFC&hyph;22/Saturated Light Hydrocarbons C3&hyph;C6. Blends of HCFC&hyph;22/saturated light hydrocarbons C3&hyph;C6, for the reasons described and with the caveats outlined above for HCFC&hyph;22 and Saturated Light Hydrocarbons C3&hyph;C6, are acceptable substitutes for CFC&hyph;12 in extruded polystyrene boardstock and billet foam. (h) Carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is an acceptable alternative blowing agent for CFC&hyph;12 in extruded polystyrene boardstock and billet foam. (6) Phenolic insulation board. (a) HCFC&hyph;141b. HCFC&hyph;141b, for the reasons described in the section on rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock, is acceptable as an alternative to CFC&hyph;11 and CFC&hyph;113 in phenolic insulation board. (b) HCFC&hyph;142b. HCFC&hyph;142b, for the reasons described in the section on rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock, is acceptable as an alternative to CFC&hyph;11 and CFC&hyph;113 in phenolic insulation board. (c) HCFC&hyph;22. HCFC&hyph;22, for the reasons described in the section on rigid polyurethane commercial refrigeration foams, spray foams, and sandwich panels, is acceptable as an alternative to CFC&hyph;11 and CFC&hyph;113 in phenolic insulation board. (d) HCFC&hyph;22/HCFC&hyph;142b. Blends of HCFC&hyph;22/HCFC&hyph;142b, for reasons described above and with the caveats outlined above for HCFC&hyph;22 and HCFC&hyph;142b, are acceptable as an alternative to CFC&hyph;11 and CFC&hyph;113 in phenolic insulation board. (e) Saturated Light Hydrocarbons C3&hyph;C6. Saturated light hydrocarbons C3&hyph;C6, for the reasons described in the section on rigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate laminated boardstock, are acceptable alternatives to CFC&hyph;11 and CFC&hyph;113 in phenolic insulation board. (f) HCFC&hyph;22/Saturated light hydrocarbons C3&hyph;C6. HCFC&hyph;22/Saturated light hydrocarbon C3&hyph;C6 blends are acceptable as substitutes for CFC&hyph;11 and CFC&hyph;113 in phenolic insulation board. HCFC&hyph;22/saturated light hydrocarbon C3&hyph;C6 blends offer an alternative with significantly less potential to deplete ozone than either CFC&hyph;11 or CFC&hyph;113. However, extensive plant modifications may be necessary to accommodate use of these blends. In addition, there are concerns about the potential for significant increases in thermal conductivity resulting from the replacement of CFC&hyph;11 and CFC&hyph;113 with a blend. Also, foams blown with saturated light hydrocarbons C3&hyph;C6 will need to conform with building code requirements that relate to flammable materials. Saturated light hydrocarbons C3&hyph;C6 are VOCs and must be controlled as such under Title I of the CAA, and HCFC&hyph;22 is subject to the phase-out of Class II compounds under sections 605 and 606 of the CAA. (g) HFC&hyph;143a. HFC&hyph;143a is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;11 and CFC&hyph;12 in phenolic insulation board. HFC&hyph;143a has a higher global warming potential than other substitutes available. (h) 2-Chloropropane 2-Chloropropane is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;11 and CFC&hyph;12 in phenolic insulation board. At present, because 2-chloropropane is a proprietary technology. Moreover, 2-chloropropane is flammable and its use may require extensive modification of existing equipment. (i) Carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is an acceptable alternative blowing agent for CFC&hyph;11 and CFC&hyph;12 in phenolic insulation board. (7) Flexible polyurethane foam. (a) Methylene chloride. Methylene chloride (or blends thereof) is acceptable as a blowing agent in flexible polyurethane foams. Methylene chloride is already used as an auxiliary blowing agent in the manufacture of most flexible polyurethane slabstock foams and has proven adequate in yielding foams of many densities and degrees of softness. Replacement of CFC&hyph;11 or methyl chloroform blowing agents with methylene chloride can reduce the potential for stratospheric ozone depletion resulting from the production of flexible polyurethane foams.
