This occurred after he heard his recorded voice in a conversation with the alleged drug trafficker Edgar Fernandez who admits that the "situation is f......" [situacion j......] Eid testified today for three and a half hours before the Constitutional Committee of the Chamber of Deputies that is investigating alleged links between the MIR leadership and Isaac "Oso" Chavarria who is considered by the Special Antinarcotics Force, FELCN, to be the top trafficker in the country. Eid, who is Paz Zamora's right-hand man, surprised the committee by indicating that he was summoned by "high officials of the U.S. Embassy" in La Paz who handed him a questionnaire on the FELCN regarding an alleged trip by Paz Zamora and Chavarria to Cuba, and on the whereabouts of Fernandez. The committee members heard a tape recording of phone calls by Edgar Fernandez, Chavarria's aide, apparently late in February or early in March 1994 to Oscar Eid's house, and to the house of former President Paz Zamora in Tarija. Fernandez, in a desperate voice, asks Eid and his party for help "to disappear" before the police find him and make him appear before the Constitutional Committee because he was sure "I will be torn to pieces," in other words all his alibis would be discredited. "Please Oscar, please help me," and "get Jaime (Paz Zamora) to tell me where to go" Fernandez said in a pitiful tone. But in the face of Eid's evasive answer, Fernandez warned: "I have not said very much about you," adding "I will not continue to be f......" Eid refused to help Fernandez, admitting "we don't know what to do" and then repeated: "f....., f....., we are all f......" Eid very confidently confirmed before the committee that "those calls were made," adding that Paz Zamora told him that similar calls were received in El Picacho, Paz Zamora's ranch near Tarija. Eid said that the existence of the recordings confirmed his fear that illegal methods were being used to incriminate people. He told the committee: "This is not an accusation against the embassy" merely information to the deputies regarding his presence in the U.S. Embassy to answer a FELCN questionnaire. Eid not only answered the FELCN questionnaire through the U.S. Embassy but also traveled to Tarija to obtain Paz Zamora's personal confirmation that "he definitely did not go to Cuba" with Chavarria. During the three and a half hour interrogation, Eid admitted that Chavarria had provided small planes and a wagon during the MIR electoral campaign and that he went to Chavarria's farm to supervise the drafting of a communique regarding the "narco-photograph." This photograph shows Chavarria and Paz Zamora sitting on the wing of a plane. It was published in 1988, when Bolivian politics were shaken by another "narco-scandal" that affected two other political parties (the Nationalist Democratic Action and the Nationalist Revolutionary Movement). The photograph was used to reach an agreement to halt investigations into possible links between politicians and drug trafficking. The MIR leader asserted that, on Paz Zamora's instructions, he gave Fernandez $9,000 from party funds to pay Chavarria's medical bills in La Paz. Franco added that he never accounted for this money to anybody but the former president.
