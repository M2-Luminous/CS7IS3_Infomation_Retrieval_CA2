Prior to Mubarak's arrival here tomorrow, senior Chinese diplomats and trade officials expressed this conviction to XINHUA, saying they are looking forward to the trip. Reached by telephone, Chinese Ambassador to Egypt Yang Fuchang, who returned here for the visit, said Mubarak's 6th trip here will serve to enhance mutual understanding and be beneficial to each country's development. He described Egypt, a major country in the Arab world and Africa, as playing a significant and unique role in the Middle East peace process. As chairman of the Organization of African Unity, the Egyptian president also has an important role to play in African affairs, said Yang, who was vice foreign minister before he was appointed Chinese ambassador to Egypt. China and Egypt, two ancient civilizations, have always been very good friends. Since the establishment of diplomatic ties 38 years ago, the two countries have maintained cooperative ties of friendship in fields of politics, economy, culture and science and technology. "Egyptian Prime Minister 'Atif Sidqi once said that Chinese technologies suit Egypt and that the suitable ones are the best," he said. Therefore, there is enough room for the two countries to further their cooperation in economic, and scientific and technological fields, the ambassador said. China and Egypt are both striving to reform their economies and have achieved a lot, he said, adding that the two are faced with similar problems in the course of development. Mubarak's visit and the bilateral contacts at various levels will enable the two sides to exchange in-depth views, deepen mutual understanding and help to further the reforms and economic growths in the two countries, Yang said. An official from the Foreign Ministry's Asia and Africa Department echoed Yang's view, saying that the visit will serve to consolidate the friendly Sino-Egyptian cooperation and the traditional friendship between the two countries. Calling Mubarak a respected old friend of the Chinese people, the official noted that the Egyptian president has made important contributions to the development of bilateral cooperation. During the visit, Mubarak is scheduled to exchange views with Chinese leaders on the furthering of Sino-Egyptian ties, and regional and international issues of mutual concern. Touching upon Sino-Egyptian trade links, an official from the ministry of foreign trade and economic cooperation noted that there had been relatively rapid development in this regard in recent years. The two-way trade volume reached over 200 million U.S. dollars-worth last year, making Egypt China's second-largest trade partner in Africa. China exports to Egypt mainly food and cereals, chemical and light-industrial products, and machinery and electrical appliances, and imports iron, steel and aluminum. The two huge markets provide many opportunities for the expansion of bilateral trade, he said. China and Egypt are discussing ways to enhance their bilateral economic and trade cooperation, including the setting up in egypt of joint ventures and Chinese-owned enterprises. During Mubarak's visit the two countries' leaders will explore cooperation in these and other fields, he said. To facilitate investment and trade between China and Egypt, an agreement on the protection of investment between the two countries is expected to be signed during Mubarak's visit, he revealed.
