Russia is the joker in the European balance of forces. Formerly, in the Cold War, it was Russia's power that burdened Europe; now it is its weakness and inner conflicts. However, no matter whether it is strong or weak -- Russia was and remains a factor of uncertainty. Ironically, the West had an easier time in the past. No matter whether politics was marked by containment or detente -- its huge military potential made the Soviet Union the enemy, and every alliance planning was oriented by it. In the course of its history, NATO has wracked its brain over many other problems -- the pranks played by Charles de Gaulle or the dictatorship of the Greek colonels. However, what remained at the end of the day was always the same -- the classical problem of the balance. How to deter the Soviet Union or how to defend oneself against it if deterrence were to fail? The problem now is that the Soviet Union has committed suicide and abandoned communism, is experimenting with the market economy and democracy, withdraws its troops from Germany 1,500 km to the East, and removes approximately 2,000 warheads from its nuclear arsenals every year? Every reasonable person must want to see this process completed smoothly and end happily. However, the harvest is not yet saved; there are still a lot of ill weeds in the furrows. One problem is the chauvinists who believe the country is surrounded by old and new enemies intending to trouble and humiliate the country. Another problem is the classical symptoms of a society that is caught between the past and the future -- attempted coups and the growing gap between profiteers and losers of the change. One seed that is not bearing fruit is the economic reform. The production decrease of 25 percent that was reported recently shows a declining economic sector. "Weimar-Russia"? The idea no longer is as absurd as it was two or three years ago. The West does not have the power and ability to modernize Russia from outside. In foreign policy, a dilemma has developed for the West that was dramatized by Grachev's appearance at the NATO meeting. Russia has insisted on a special role on the European stage, which, at a closer look, shows fatal parallels with the attitude of the old Soviet Union. During the Cold War, Moscow always claimed a veto on the West's security policy. At first, Moscow did not want the West Germans to be rearmed, then it did not want NATO to be equipped with intermediate-range missiles. Today, the alliance cannot bomb Bosnia without specific permission from Moscow or take those Eastern European countries under its wings that wish to associate with NATO. "Special status" is the magic formula used by Grachev and Yeltsin when they talk with NATO. Even if Grachev after an unexpected turn suddenly accepts the "Partnership for Peace" program "without any condition," Moscow wants to be "more equal" than the Eastern Europeans, and behind this is the old claim to the guaranteed role of big power. NATO will have to consider this carefully if it wants to remain a functioning alliance and does not want to leave the new democracies on the other side of the Elbe river in a drafty "Central Europe." Cooperate with Russia, protect Yeltsin against his troublemakers at home? Yes, in any case. Open the door for Russia to the G-7 club of the rich industrial nations? Logic seems to forbid this because it would be tantamount to taking in the bankrupt into the group of creditors. Channel Moscow into NATO past the Poles, Czechs, and Hungarians? That would mean degrading those who are worthy of protection and privileging the country they fear. What basically holds true is this: Diplomacy can and even must cover up dilemmas by all sorts of compromise formulas; its principle is the "both...and" formula. But in the end, there is still the threatening "either...or" principle. If Russia does in fact become a NATO member, this will be the end of the alliance. It may still be called "NATO," but it would be nothing but a mini-CSCE, a rather noncommittal association open to all sides and incapable of making tough decisions. In Brussels, the Americans and the British have apparently held their own against the Germans and Spaniards who wanted to give the Russians ("a big power," according to German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe) more shining epaulets. This is better for NATO and better for the Eastern Central Europeans who are Germany's direct neighbors and do not need any discrimination for the benefit of Moscow. There are other means to satisfy Russia's status requirements, and the alliance does not have to give up its old identity. There are enough problems for Russia to demonstrate its role as a responsible big power -- in Bosnia or in the struggle against the spreading of weapons of mass destruction. Binding Russia by all sorts of measures is a long-term dictate of every Western policy. However, Russia's unpredictability and potential strength make the country not only a partner but also a certain risk in the wake of the Cold War.
