According to the latest poll by the National Consulting Center, the two candidates, who lead the surveys, are still neck and neck for the first and second round of elections. Samper and Pastrana are advancing neck and neck in their quest for the Presidency. For the first time in history, no bets can be made for either candidate in the electoral process. The polls have revealed such a small difference that it can be said technically they are tied. Figures speak for themselves. For the first electoral round Samper obtained 38 percent of the support over 37 percent for Pastrana; forty-five percent of those polled in the second round have said they would vote for Andres Pastrana and 44 percent for Ernesto Samper. Regardless of from where it comes, the opinion sector or the campaign team, the fact of the matter is in May each vote will be decisive. There are eight weeks before the election, however, and the result of the consultation within the Liberal Party and the reallocation of forces after the legislative elections can change things substantially.
