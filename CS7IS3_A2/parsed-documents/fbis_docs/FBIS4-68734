Attorneys, predictably, were immediately divided into passionate supporters or imperturbable opponents of the restored legal institution. After Igor Tsykunov's article "Jury Performance for Foreigners" was published in OBSHCHAYA GAZETA, No. 14/39 of 8-14 April, describing the first jury trial in Ryazan, people were irritated. It seemed to be just another campaign: First they came up with non-alcoholic weddings and now they are promoting jury trials. It is easy and safe to reject the new and unfamiliar (even when it did exist in the long-forgotten past), but paving the way for it, especially at a time of pervasive legal nihilism, is a different matter.... That is why we interviewed one of the "pavers"--Sergey Pashin, department head in the State Legal Directorate of the RF president's administration. [Sharov] Sergey Anatolyevich, it seems there has been enough criticism of the State Legal Directorate for the restoration of the jury trial.... [Pashin] More than enough. Furthermore, many of our opponents are doing this because of what might be called a historical bias. When they argue the inadvisability of juries, they make references to the trial of Vera Zasulich, who fired a gun at a tsarist official and was acquitted by a jury, and to Katyusha Maslova. The most erudite are also invoking the "Brothers Karamazov." Let us take a look, however, at the history of the Soviet courts. We could spend months recalling the unjust, immoral, and illegal verdicts of our judges. This was a system of injustice! It administered revenge. It was a conveyor belt. It killed people--and these were real people, not fictional characters. [Sharov] How is a jury trial better than a conventional trial? [Pashin] The jury is not encumbered by bureaucratic duplicity. Anything can be written down on paper: the presumption of innocence, adversary procedure.... But what is the reality? The conveyor belt I mentioned. The defense of strictly corporate interests. Who administers justice in our country? It is a bureaucrat! One of the fundamental principles of his existence is that one hand washes the other. The opinion of the procurator is much more important to a judge than the opinion of the accused. Here is what we always hear in the courts: Why are you so concerned about the guilty party! You see, the defendant is referred to as the guilty party. I know one judge who has been on the bench for 18 years and who was so surprised when she was told that there are no guilty parties in a trial court. After all, a person is guilty only after the verdict acquires legal force. Our procurator does not have to show up in court to support criminal charges. Many cases are tried in his absence. Then the functions of the procurator are assumed by the judge, usually involuntarily, but sometimes even by choice. Is this done in the interest of justice? If not, then what interests does it serve? It keeps the conveyor belt running smoothly. In a jury trial the procurator does not simply press charges; he has to prove the accusation. There were complaints after the very first trial by jury in Saratov and after the Ryazan trial with which the readers of OBSHCHAYA GAZETA are familiar: The punishment for these hardened murderers was too lenient, people said; they should have been sentenced to much longer prison terms, if not something worse. What was the reason for the mitigation of the punishment, and even the acquittal of the defendant in Ryazan? Why did the jurors arrive at these verdicts? Because the prosecution's investigators did not collect enough evidence, and the prosecuting attorneys did not present enough evidence to the court (take note of this: I did not say, to the judge). Would you want jurors to arrive at a guilty verdict on the basis of the "results" of the usual kind of investigation, basing their conclusions on a haphazardly prepared case? [Sharov] Wait a minute. Are you suggesting that jury trials will change the accepted system of proof in Russia? [Pashin] They will not change it, but they will introduce legal principles into the system. This will take the place of the notorious expediency we once had. Verdicts should be the logical result of the evidence presented. [Sharov] Yes, you could say that there is not much adherence to logic in our investigative agencies. The procuracy and the Ministry of Internal Affairs with its counterintelligence service will be facing a dilemma. It would not be an exaggeration to say that all kinds of mistakes, inconsistencies, and omissions can easily be found in ANY criminal case. [Pashin] It is not surprising that one of our chief opponents was Stepankov, the former procurator general. He expressed his fears: If the poor investigating official's signature is in the wrong place, will a criminal be released for this kind of inconsequential error? Valentin Georgiyevich was being devious. He knew that the people who worked for him were not accustomed to assuming the burden of proof. It is interesting, however, that this did have an impact. People in the procuracy began to worry. They began to learn how to base charges on the accumulated evidence. It is now common practice for the prosecution to start playing for time when a case is to be tried by a jury, and to initiate additional investigations of all the facts of the case. [Sharov] This is certainly encouraging, but it is not persuasive enough. After all, it will delay trials. People will be kept in custody longer and they will be miserable. [Pashin] Would you try to blame this on jury trials too? [Sharov] No, but I do believe that for everything good, there is also the "other side of the coin." Here is one of the main objections: You have launched an experiment for completely noble and ethical reasons, but is it right to experiment with justice--in the ideal sense of the term? The jury trial is a government institution in only five oblasts of Russia.... [Pashin] In nine now. [Sharov] But this still suggests that the inhabitants of other regions are second-class citizens. They do not have access to the more humane form of proceedings. [Pashin] Let us begin with the fact that the jury trial is a constitutional institution. Therefore, it is not an experiment, but a sequential fulfillment of the requirements of the Basic Law. Furthermore, in tsarist Russia jury trials were also instituted gradually, in one province at a time. Even then, not all of Russia was "entranced" by them. By the way, the institution of this form of legal proceedings is not possible in all regions even today. After all, we have to take ethnic, historical, traditional, and cultural factors into account. The simplest thing would be to announce that jury trials will be instituted everywhere tomorrow. The idea would be completely discredited. There would be overt violations of the principle. Our judges, our procurators, and our public defenders are people from the past, whether we like it or not. Their mentality was not shaped by current events. They have seen jury trials only in foreign films, but they learned the law from books in which trial by jury was reviled in the most vehement terms. That is why regional judicial authorities were simply asked to consider the new form of trial. I cannot deny that the regions which decided to institute jury trials expected some kind of bonus in connection with this, and we gave it to them as a reward. If the Ryazan judicial officials, as OBSHCHAYA GAZETA reported, received the magnificent Catherine Palace in place of their old shack for the institution of jury trials, more power to them! This is certainly a change for the better. Finally, I agree that people in different oblasts are not on an equal level, but it would have been much more immoral not to institute jury trials at all. [Sharov] Another significant objection concerns the high cost of jury trials. [Pashin] Yes, they cost money. For some reason, people believe that the judicial system is the only sphere of government activity that entails only expenditures. This is not true. Courts generate revenue by charging fees and court costs and by confiscating property. If even one-third of this income could be used for the maintenance of the courts, we might have a different judicial system, but everything goes into the budget. Anything deposited in the budget disappears, and subsequent allocations are minuscule. This gives rise to the "seditious" idea that the outrageous sums the government is spending on the renovation of the White House would be more than enough for the organization of jury trials everywhere. What more can I say? Cheap justice is...cheap justice. [Sharov] But trial by jury is also a complicated process. Just assembling the right number of people, providing them with hotel accommodations, arranging for the selection of jurors, explaining all of their obligations and rights to them, answering their questions about legal matters.... Then you have to wait for them to arrive at a verdict. I will repeat the opinion you "deplored": There will be even longer delays in the administration of justice. There will be a long list of people choosing trial by jury. These people will have to remain in custody for years, waiting and waiting for their trials.... [Pashin] All of that is true up to a point. Only the preliminary stages will delay the proceedings slightly: the selection of the jury, the administration of the oath, the possibility of challenges, and the explanation of rights and obligations to the jurors. You know that this will not take weeks or days, but just an hour and a half or two hours. The complexity of organizing the trial will force the services responsible for the normal progression of the proceedings to act more precisely and efficiently. The prosecution will not send a case to trial when it is full of holes, but will prepare the case carefully and conscientiously, in the knowledge that no one in the court will overlook its errors. If there is the slightest error, then the defendant will be acquitted. But the prosecution is bound much more strictly by the judicial calendar and the maximum terms of confinement for suspects. The unconditional appearance of witnesses, victims, defense attorneys, prosecutors, and experts will be the rule in jury trials, and some will have to be summoned by subpoena because this kind of "complicated process," as you called it, cannot be jeopardized by the failure of one or two people to appear in court. There will also be changes in escort services. The existence of jury trials will also speed up the resolution of some old problems: the protection of witnesses and victims, the guaranteed appearance of witnesses and victims, and the more precise functioning of escort units. Finally, there will be a new approach to the choice and use of measures to secure the appearance of the defendant. In any case, the 20 or so jury trials which have already taken place proved that local officials could begin solving these problems in earnest. There were no insurmountable obstacles. [Sharov] But these were mainly show trials. There was so much publicity, and the press, television reporters, foreigners, and observers from higher courts were invited to attend. I am afraid that everything will go back to normal when this becomes routine. [Pashin] This was not a publicity campaign, but the customary monitoring of a fundamentally new practice. In addition, it was propaganda. It was, you might say, a demonstration. The jury trial is not simply another form of judicial proceedings; it is a new level of legal awareness, a new mentality, even a new philosophy. We want the high standards of work which were reached in the first months to be maintained in the future and to become the routine. You object to the theatrical nature of the jury trial, but I do not see anything terrible about this. It is certainly a ceremonial proceeding, a ritual with many obligatory elements; it is only in Russia, which has been poisoned by legal nihilism, that it is seen as something superfluous or contrived. Its effectiveness and impact will not be diminished by the absence of television reporters and journalists, although I am certain that the latter will attend trials by jury much more often than ordinary trials. The main thing is that the proceedings held the interest of all of the parties involved in the trial--although this might sound cynical in reference to the accused or the victim. Something they never even dreamed of 5 or 10 years ago was coming to life before their very eyes. [Sharov] Was it interesting for the prosecution? [Pashin] You can imagine. Although prosecuting attorneys threatened to protest the jury verdicts after some trials, this made them look like people who wave their fists after a fight. The prosecutors felt like attorneys, instead of bureaucratic pawns making the prescribed moves. The institution of adversary procedure is a wonderful thing. It forces people to think. It involves professional risks. It was the same for the public defenders. They finally saw a way to get around the wall they kept running into at almost every trial in the past. The judge felt like an arbiter, and not a worker on an assembly line. Here it is, the new mentality we wanted. This, quite honestly, makes the job worthwhile. And just look at what happened: Igor Tsykunov's article objectively "promoted" the jury trial, because the observant reader will see that the trial in Ryazan acted like a searchlight, illuminating the true features of our wretched system of justice and revealing the road to improvement.
