The three are Sin Sun-u, director-general of the Agricultural Marketing Bureau, Kim Chu-su, chief of the Planning and Budget Division, and Choe Pu-kwan, of the Market and Price Policy Division, according to the spokesman. The three officials failed to devise measures to ensure the law's smooth execution and, therefore, took responsibility for the trouble in which thousands of middlemen at the Karak Agro-Fishery Wholesale Market paralyzed the distribution system by boycotting their business in protest against the revised law banning wholesale activities by middlemen, the spokesman said. The three will lose their jobs unless they are reinstated within three months. In a statement, Minister Choe instructed all ministry officials to develop agro-fishery industries, warning that he would severely punish those who fail to perform their jobs well.
