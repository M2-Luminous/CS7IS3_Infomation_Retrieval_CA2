FBIS4-55780 "dreeu098__a94027" FBIS-EEU-94-098-A Daily Report 19 May 1994 ANNEX Slovakia Stability Pact `Acceptable' to Republic Stability Pact `Acceptable' to Republic AU1905201894 Prague CTK in English 1726 GMT 19 May 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU1905201894 Prague CTK English BFN [Text] Bratislava May 19 (CTK) -- The European Pact of Stability, or the Balladur Plan, is acceptable for Slovakia in its proposed form, Igor Liska from the Foreign Ministry told CTK today. The acceptability of the working version of the pact was also confirmed by Slovak Ambassador to Geneva Jan Kubis who had led the Slovak delegation to the talks on the pact. The pact has also been supported by Premier Jozef Moravcik during his visit to France this week. Kubis said that the latest version of the document ruling out border changes suited Slovakia. Of late voices could be heard in Hungary urging a revision of the Slovak-Hungarian border to the benefit of Hungary. A strong Hungarian minority lives in southern Slovakia. Slovakia has also welcomed the deletion of that part of the text which bound Slovakia and Hungary to conclude an inter-state treaty under the auspices of the European Union. Bratislava sticks to the civic principle on ethnic minorities, which means that it would not recognise minorities' collective rights. Collective rights for ethnic minorities are also rejected by most Western countries. The Czech Republic rejects the principle as well. Kubis said on Wednesday [18 May] that the Czech and Slovak Republics had not coordinated their policies on the pact, because the Czech Republic unlike Slovakia did not have any minority problems. Kubis also pointed out Slovak diplomacy's effort to broaden the pact's goals to embrace economic, environmental and cross-border cooperation as well.
