Katrin Linde said in her statement that according to statutes of the headquarters of the Estonian Defence Forces, the head of the headquarters must also be head of the army. The head of the headquarters is Colonel Ants Laaneots. Nugis, the speaker of the Riigikogu, said the bill contradicted the constitution. Linde claimed that according to the law regulating military service of Estonian officers, any officer older than 60 must be discharged from armed forces. Einseln is 63. Linde also said that according to the same law, no officer could be granted higher military rank than he had had while serving in a foreign army. Estonian Riigikogu on May 4 last year adopted a bill making retired U.S. Colonel Einseln head of the Estonian army. President Lennart Meri later made him Major General.
