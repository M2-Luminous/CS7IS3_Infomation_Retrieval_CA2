Yermakov had been removed from the office of representative of the Ukrainian president in Sevastopol. An ITAR-TASS correspondent was told at the headquarters of the Black Sea Fleet that the decision coincides with the opinion of Yermakov himself, who previously occupied the office of head of an aircraft repair plant and has the rank of colonel in the Navy. Moreover, he never took the Ukrainian oath and did not express any desire to serve in the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The commander of the Black Sea Fleet has ordered the head of the fleet's personnel department to establish Yermakov in the post within two months in keeping with his wishes.
