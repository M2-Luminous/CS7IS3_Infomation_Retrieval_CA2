FBIS3-30306 "dreeu021__a94014" FBIS-EEU-94-021-A Document Type:Daily Report 1 February 1994 ANNEX Hungary Romanian Party Sends Message to MSZP AU0102090794 Budapest MTI in English 2033 GMT 31 Jan 94 AU0102090794 Budapest MTI Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Budapest, 31 January (MTI) -- The ruling Party of Social Democracy in Romania (PDSR) holds the view that sober-minded forces in Romania and Hungary may succeed in normalizing bilateral relations in the soonest possible time, including the conclusion of a basic treaty. This is contained in the message PDSR Chairman Oliviu Gherman has sent to the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP). The message was handed over to MSZP Chairman Gyula Horn by a delegation led by Romanian Ambassador Ion Donca today [31 January]. Horn told MTI that the message was a reaction to former MSZP statements on Hungary's relations with its neighbours. Signed by Gherman, the message stresses that the PDSR met with a great deal of satisfaction the Hungarian socialists' position calling for a historical reconciliation between Hungary and its neighbours, including Romania. In Gherman's view, this reconciliation should be confirmed by a basic treaty, which would recognize the current borders and, on the basis of international norms, contain mutual commitments to guaranteeing minority rights. The settlement and development of relations would promote the two countries' integration into the Euro-Atlantic system and facilitate their democratic transformation, runs the message. In reply to it, Horn confirmed that the MSZP was pressing for Budapest and Bucharest to conclude a basic treaty, declaring both the inviolability of borders and the full enforcement of ethnic minority rights. In the MSZP's view, Hungary and Romania are interdependent as far as their relationship with European integration organizations is concerned. Thus they should not act against one another, on the contrary, they should make every possible joint effort to enforce their interests in this field.
