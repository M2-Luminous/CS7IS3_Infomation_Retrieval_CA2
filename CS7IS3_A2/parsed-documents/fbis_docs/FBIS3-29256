Ho Chong, deputy chief of the North Korean mission to the United Nations, explained Pyongyang and the IAEA's agreement to Tom Hubbard, U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state for Asian and Pacific affairs, who welcomed the accord. C. Kenneth Quinones, North Korea desk officer at the State Department, and Han Song-yol, councilor of the North Korean mission to the world body, accompanied Hubbard and Ho. Details of the working-level talks were not known immediately, but diplomatic sources here said that the two sides agreed to continue meeting to negotiate the third round of high-level talks. The U.S. side emphasized, however, that a key precondition of the high-level talks is the IAEA's satisfaction with the results of its inspection of North Korean nuclear sites, according to the sources. After the talks on Tuesday, Ho said, "We will continue meeting (with the United States)." Sources expected the two sides to discuss the agenda, dates and preconditions of the third round of North Korea-U.S. high-level talks through frequent meetings in New York. Hubbard said he welcomed North Korea's acceptance of the IAEA inspections, but added that Tuesday's working-level talks are no more than a small departure. Ho said, "Today's talks were held in a friendly and productive atmosphere. I don't think there is any tension caused by the nuclear problem. The tension has been created by the United States and press of the West."
