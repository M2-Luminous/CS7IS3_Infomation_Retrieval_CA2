FR940506-0-00045 FR940506-0-00017 D. Yellowtail Rockfish Declarations Federal trip limits for yellowtail rockfish are found at 59 FR 695, paragraph IV.C. The States of Oregon and Washington have implemented declaration procedures that enable vessels that transit or operate north of Cape Lookout (where the trip limit currently is 14,000 pounds (6,350 kg) cumulative of yellowtail rockfish per month) to fish south of Cape Lookout and retain up to the southern limit (currently 30,000 pounds (13,608 kg) cumulative per month). Details of the declaration procedure are set forth in the respective state regulations. Therefore, specific descriptions of state requirements are being removed from the Federal Register notice at 59 FR 696 by deleting the following sentence from paragraph IV.C.(2)(c): ``For any vessel that takes and retains or lands yellowtail rockfish during the month, a declaration must be filed for each fishing trip that crosses the line at Cape Lookout during that month, must be made before leaving port on the fishing trip, and may not be changed once the vessel has left port.'' In the same paragraph, the reference to the ``Washington Department of Fisheries'' is changed to the ``Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife''. The other provisions at 59 FR 695, paragraph IV.C., that apply to vessels landing yellowtail rockfish are not changed. Vessel operators are cautioned that the States of Oregon and Washington are in the process of revising their requirements, and therefore the state where the fish will be landed should be contacted to ensure compliance with state law (Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, Newport, OR at 503&hyph;867&hyph;4741 or 503&hyph;867&hyph;0300; or Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, Montesano WA, 206&hyph;249&hyph;4628). E. Clarification of Yellowtail Rockfish Areas Two errors occurred in the 1994 groundfish fishery specifications and management measures in the description of the stock assessment and harvest guideline areas for yellowtail rockfish. The clarifications, explained below, cause no change in management of the fishery. (1) Footnote ``p'' to Table 1 at 59 FR 689 incorrectly states that the stock assessment for yellowtail rockfish divides the Columbia area at Cape Lookout, OR. The geographic scope of the yellowtail rockfish acceptable biological catch (ABC) is correctly described at 59 FR 690 in the third column_ABCs were determined for the areas north and south of Cape Falcon, OR. Therefore, the first sentence of footnote ``p'' should read: ``The yellowtail rockfish assessment addresses three separate areas: Vancouver, Columbia north of Cape Falcon, and Columbia south of Cape Falcon plus Eureka.'' (2) The text in the first column at 59 FR 691 incorrectly states that the harvest guidelines for yellowtail rockfish apply to the areas north and south of Cape Falcon. Cape Falcon divides a major fishing ground, making differential trip limits on either side of the line impractical. Instead, Cape Lookout, OR, which is 26 nautical miles south of Cape Falcon, was used for purposes of establishing the yellowtail rockfish harvest guidelines. Therefore, the harvest guidelines and trip limits for yellowtail rockfish apply north and south of Cape Lookout, as previously announced at 59 FR 687, Table 1, and at 59 FR 695, paragraph IV.C. F. Renumbering Paragraphs At 59 FR 697, paragraphs IV.G.(3) (i), (ii), and (iii) regarding open access limits for California halibut or sea cucumber trawls were inappropriately numbered, and are redesignated IV.G.(3) (a), (b), and (c), respectively. At 59 FR 698 in the first column, paragraph IV. on Recreational Fishing is redesignated as paragraph H. Classification The determination to take this action is based on the most recent data available. The aggregate data upon which the determination is based are available for public inspection at the Office of the Director, Northwest Region (see ADDRESSES ) during business hours until May 18, 1994. This action is taken under the authority of 50 CFR 663.23(c) and section III.C.1. of the Appendix to 50 CFR part 663. This notice is exempt from review under Executive Order 12866.
