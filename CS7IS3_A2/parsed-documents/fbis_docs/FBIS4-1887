The Afghan Ambassador to Pakistan Sardar Mohammad Roshan was summoned to the foreign office here this morning and handed over a diplomatic note urging the Afghan Government to intercede urgently for arranging the safe release of these people, said a Foreign Office press release issued here today. Mullah Salam, an Afghan warrior belonging to Ittehad-i-Islami of Sayyaf, the coalition partner of President Rabbani, kidnapped two Chinese engineers, Wang Qinbin and Zheng Gongbao in Bostan area, some 40 kilometers from Quetta, capital of Baluchistan Province on June 21, 1993. He has been demanding ransom, return of Stinger missiles allegedly captured by Pakistani troops and release of his relatives jailed in Pakistan for the release of these two persons which Pakistan refused. His men also abducted eight Pakistanis in March and April 1993 separately as well as the deputy commissioner of Baluchistan's Ziarat along with his driver and bodyguard in March this year. Besides kidnappings, Mullah Salam attacked Pakistan several times by firing from across the border with multi-barreled rocket launchers, mortars and automatic weapons resulting in a number of casualties and heavy damage to property, the press release said. The Government of Pakistan has been trying its best to secure the safe and unconditional release of the abductees and resolve the matter but unfortunately these efforts have not yielded a positive outcome, said the release. Pakistan called upon the Afghan Government to take urgent and meaningful measures not only to ensure the safe and unconditional release of the abductees but also to prevent the recurrence of such incidents, it added.
