FR940317-1-00165 FR940317-1-00014 In view of the provisions in the Act which require particular attention to low-income minority older individuals, this criterion is intended to ensure that the proposed formula will not divert funds from PSA's with the highest concentrations of such individuals, when applied to the same population data as the old formula. (2) to be approved, the formula may not allocate less funds, from the total amount subject to allocation, to each PSA with a high concentration of low-income minority older individuals that would be allocated to each of these PSA's if the formula submitted for approval were based solely on the factors of age, i.e., 60+, and greatest economic need, i.e., the proportion of older individuals below the poverty line. In view of the provisions in the Act which require particular attention to low-income minority older individuals, the introduction of social need factors in the formula should, if anything, increase funds distributed to PSA's with the highest concentrations of low-income minority older individuals to an amount no less than would go to the PSA based only on age and economic need. In no event may the introduction of social need factors decrease such funds. A standard procedure is proposed for identifying the PSA's with the highest concentrations of low-income minority older individuals. After the State ranks the PSA's based on the proportion of low-income minority older individuals to all older individuals in the PSA, those PSA's with the highest proportion of low-income minority individuals which, taken together, contain 51 percent of all low-income minority older individuals in the State shall be, for the purposes of this rule, considered the PSA's with the highest concentrations of low-income minority older individuals.
