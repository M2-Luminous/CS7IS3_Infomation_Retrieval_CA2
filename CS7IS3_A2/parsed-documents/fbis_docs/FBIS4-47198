This step inspired hopes for re-establishing collapsed ties and improving cooperation between our countries. Of what was outlined, what have we succeeded in doing? What is within the power of the Foundation? Vitold Fokin, president of the Foundation, answers these and other questions. [Dolzhenko] Vitold Pavlovich, first, a little history. How was the Foundation created, and what was the reason for its appearance? [Fokin] That is not a simple question, since it touches on the period of my work as Ukrainian prime minister. I was always an adherent of a well-considered economic policy, and definite calculation in interrelations with the union republics. This pertained particularly to Russia. We should not have severed the established economic ties in ill-considered fashion, and abandoned the ruble zone headlong. In defending this position, I made quite a few enemies at that time. Let us remember, what happened after the break-up of the USSR? Fifteen new states appeared on the political map of the Eurasian continent, having overnight turned from allies into competitors. Formally independent of each other, they were objectively tied by a common economic space. Except that now the system for coordinating and dividing up work has changed in principle, and the basic power, transport, raw materials and export-import flows have been destroyed. Price and financial relations have been deregulated. Customs barriers have risen in the path of commodity movement. So far, no system of legislative administration of the markets of the new states has been created, and indeed, is not being created. In struggling for formally recognized sovereignty, the countries will gradually convert the huge space of the former USSR into a zone of instability and numerous conflicts. Ukraine is by no means an exception. The disintegration of production, an unfortunate financial and export-import policy, and tremendous foreign debt have led to our economy being cut off from the economy of our neighboring countries. For a number of objective circumstances, the commanding state structures are incapable of putting matters right decisively. This naturally leads to the appearance of initiative on a different level. Our Foundation has become the expression of the will and striving of the leaders of our prestigious enterprises, scientific and social organizations, creative collectives, entrepreneurs and businessmen to seek and use non-traditional forms of cooperation among the CIS countries. The basis of this cooperation is economic expediency, mutual benefit and mutual trust and honesty. [Dolzhenko] Does it not seem to you that Russia has only gained from the fact that Ukraine decided to go "its own" way. The Russian economy, as they think, has gone forward, but would it have succeeded in this in combination with Ukraine? Hopes for agreement within the framework of the CIS are very slim: essentially, not one of them will be fulfilled. What do you think about this? [Fokin] I assume that 99 out of 100 of those polled would agree with you, complaining that reforms in Ukraine are "not moving." Although this is not quite so. They are moving, but every time in a different direction. It is this lack of sequence, the absence of continuity and the multitude of contradictions and mutual exclusions that are holding back progress. This instability is vicious. It makes increasingly perceptible the lagging behind Russia, blocking the already weakened ties between the enterprises of the two countries. Russia, for example, has long given up the practice of the state order, although, in my opinion, prematurely. The enterprises have become the owners of the products. Most of the production facilities have become joint-stock companies, the securities market is working actively, and the convertibility of the ruble is stimulating small- and medium-scale business. The main thing, though, is that the psychology of the people has changed. They are already thinking in new categories, and it will therefore be difficult for our state enterprise director to come to an agreement with the president of a Russian joint-stock company. He has completely different powers and interests. Here, you realize, everything rests on not severing ties or lack of desire to cooperate for political reasons. The different level of development of production relations proves to be the decisive factor. It is extremely necessary to overcome these differences, and not to let them become disassociated. Both the Russians and the citizens of Ukraine are interested in this. The more time that passes since the moment of the break-up of the Union, the more aware we become of the need for these actions. [Dolzhenko] The direction of the Foundation, in general, is clear, but all the same, just what are its specific goals and tasks? [Fokin] The goal of the Foundation is all-round furthering of Ukrainian economic and cultural progress through direct cooperation between the enterprises and organizations, and educational and cultural centers of the CIS, above all Russia, and promotion of the integration of the Ukrainian economy into the world system. Our organization is state-social, non-government, and in no way do we intend to duplicate or replace the actions of the government administrative structures. On the contrary, we will take on the functions that are not characteristic of the state under the new conditions. L. Kravchuk, President of Ukraine, fully understood and supported the idea of creating the Foundation. B. Yeltsin also supported it. [Dolzhenko] The other day we received information on the registration of the Russian Foundation for Humanitarian and Economic Cooperation with Ukraine. [Fokin] This is pleasing information. It will now be easier to solve the problems of cooperation. The Foundation was created through the efforts of well-known Russian state and public figures -- O. Lobov, Yu. Shafranik, Yu. Dubinin, L. Zapalskiy, Yu. Astayev, V. Kostyuk and others. The Russian Foundation, like ours, gained the status of a state-social organization. [Dolzhenko] What are the basic directions of the activity of your Foundation? The humanitarian theme is mentioned first in the title. [Fokin] We really are devoting a great deal of attention to humanitarian problems. Public health, ecology and, in particular, clearing up the consequences of the accident at the Chernobyl AES occupy a special place. For example, under the aegis of the Foundation, a project in the field of cytogenetics is being developed. The unique conditions for study, and the very rich base of data on a nuclear accident and its consequences, accumulated at 17 scientific-research institutes and scientific centers, will make it possible to carry out a set of measures to study the effect of radiation on man. Here, wide use will be made of the works of Aleksey Gostev, Russian scientist, a citizen of Ukraine. This courageous man, together with his wife and son, having been living in the 30-kilometer zone for 8 years. The Foundation also intends to gather and disseminate reliable, objective information, and to cover the subject of the two peoples in detail. Preparation for the publishing of Ukrainian newspapers in Russia has already begun, and links are being set up between the mass information media of our countries. [Dolzhenko] Considering your former position of prime-minister, and your profound knowledge of the Ukrainian economy, you can hardly watch its decline with indifference.... [Fokin] Naturally. The Ukrainian national economic complex today is fettered by the paralysis of the credit-financial system. After all, the bankruptcy of the economic constituents is, in the overwhelming majority of cases, organized. Holding back clearing accounts and exceeding the credit "oxygen," is the easiest way to destroy industrial enterprises, put them up for auction, and buy them for a song. Here it is no longer a question of decline, but of infinity. Our Foundation is doing intensive work on creating a multi-functional banking network, which will help to make it possible to set up the passage of payment documents of Ukrainian enterprises to their foreign partners and back. This will make it to a certain extent possible to avoid enslaving dependence on government financial structures and their unpredictable behavior. The participants in the Foundation are becoming the founders of our own bank, with a proposed charter capital of $5-10 million. Prestigious financial institutions of Russia and the Western countries are being drawn into cooperation. Because full-value cooperation is possible only with equal starting conditions, and a serious imbalance has been noted, inasmuch as Russia has already virtually completed privatizing state enterprises, the re-establishment of production ties in many ways depends on the rates of privatization in Ukraine. The Ukrainskiy Finansovo-Investitsionnyy Soyuz (UFIS) AO [Joint-Stock Company], working under the aegis of the Foundation, is assisting in this process. This firm possesses the necessary technology, and is staffed with fine specialists. They are helping to develop a privatization program for enterprises in sectors such as machine building, instrument making, petroleum processing, building materials, biochemistry and the light pulp and paper industry. At the same time, we are striving for a comprehensive approach, encompassing all stages of privatization, from assessing the property to issuing and placing securities, and after that, providing post-privatization service. In the future, the Foundation will take part in setting up trans-national corporations of technologically linked production facilities, through joint-stockholding. A dealer network of the enterprises of Ukraine and Russia, and vice-versa, is slated for development. We are seriously engaged in drawing in foreign investments. Our assistance to enterprises lies in seeking investors, preparing the documents for extending credit and developing business plans. Information on potential subjects for investment are being disseminated along Foundation channels to the West. [Dolzhenko] Vitold Pavlovich, when I listen to you, I keep thinking: why didn't you put such alluring ideas into effect before, in your days as premier? By the way, how did you, in your opinion, leave Ukraine's economy, and how do you assess it today? [Fokin] Spare me, I'm not going to give an assessment of either the activity of my predecessors nor my successors. This is an unworthy occupation. One thing I can say, quoting impartial statistics. By the autumn of 1992, distinct signs of stabilization appeared in all sectors of Ukraine's economy. In June, the depression came to a halt, and in July and August the increase in the average daily production volume was fixed, not in the ephemeral monetary expression, but in physical indicators. Wages were paid regularly, and inflation rates were cut to 8 percent. What is there to say? The exchange rate of the dollar was 161 karbovanets, and not 50,000, as it is today. The value of the fixed production capital was brought into conformity with the rise in prices and monetary incomes. So, as compared with today's situation, is this good or bad? As for converting ideas, the answer may prove to be unexpected: in the sphere of my actual activity, I have scarcely any more rights than in my days as premier. Allowing for the scale, of course. I am now surrounded by like-minded people, and not by dilettantes from parliamentary rostrums. It is not by chance that the preceding Supreme Soviet of Ukraine ended its activity in such an inglorious fashion. Having restricted the rights of the executive bodies to a nonsensical limit, parliament itself passed sentence. Thank God that it managed without tanks. For almost four years, the country was shaken by legal nihilism. The Cabinet of Ministers should have pursued an active financial policy, but for it, the National Bank was sealed off. The Supreme Soviet managed the Bank, it was preparing a monetary reform. The State Property Fund and the Anti-Monopoly Committee were under it. I came out in behalf of retaining the state order for strategic goods, since I realized that the brakes must be released gradually, but they accused me of conservatism. I proposed a soft system of state regulation and was branded an anti-marketist. I tried to maintain, in the transitional period, the basic structures of state administration, so that, as the forms of ownership changed, their functions would gradually be turned over to new formations. And what happened? At the beginning of March, from the voting in of one of the deputies, parliament carried out the decision to eliminate the leading sectorial ministries and departments. It was precisely then that the possibility appeared of mass awarding of state property, in general, to the technical personnel of the newly created structures. The story of Ukraine's exit from the ruble zone occupies a special place in the chronicles of our parliament's evil deeds. I hope that it is still the subject of a special investigation. Incidentally, your comment is reasonable, the Russian ruble has strengthened its position, by being relieved of a partner such as Ukraine. But enough about that. The difficult, tense work that lies ahead of us to re-establish the economy is incredible, and I have great hopes for the start of the new Supreme Soviet's activity. I wish it success with all my heart. [Dolzhenko] Do you not regret today your unrealized dreams, and certain plans? [Fokin] I have an urge to say: "No, I have no regrets." But this would not be true. Indifference is not inherent in me, nor is groundless optimism. I can clearly see what political ambitions and national arrogance can do to the economy. I regret the wasted efforts, the unrealized intentions. I will permit no thoughts of hopelessness, though. I often repeat the words of Chekhov's hero: "The deed must be done, Gentlemen."
