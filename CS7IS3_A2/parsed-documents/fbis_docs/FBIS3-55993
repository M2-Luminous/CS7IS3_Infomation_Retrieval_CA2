Air Force One is currently in flight. In 90 minutes, it will land at Vnukovo- 2 Airport. By the aircraft steps, Bill Clinton will be met by Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, and this will mark the start of the American President's official three-day visit to Russia. On his way to Moscow, President Bill Clinton visited Prague. Incidentally, he is flying on his own at the moment, without his family. His wife, Lady Hillary, no less well known than himself, and, possibly, his daughter Chelsea as well, will join him the day after tomorrow. Two-and-a-half hours ago, he should have had a brief conversation with Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk at Kiev's Borispol Airport. One day earlier, President Bill Clinton attended the NATO Council session. [Video shows a meeting in progress with an inset of a statue of an angel; Russian troops talking; man presenting a box of candy to a little girl; NATO Secretary General Woerner meeting Czech President Havel, then Polish President Walesa]. Apparently, the North Atlantic bloc advertizes itself so well in its publicity material, and Russia so dubiously in its elections, that our neighbors in Eastern Europe and the Baltic area are knocking on NATO's door like piglets running away from the wolf. Unlike the bold piglets, though, the Europeans won't hide from us anywhere: we'll get them wherever they are, if we want to. Both Clinton and the NATO leadership are well aware of that. The December elections in Russia frightened world public opinion with the prospect of a communist comeback or the reign of national- fascists -- the most unpredictable and, consequently, alarming consequences. There was also another apprehension. And then a man appeared who just talked, and that talking was enough to resurrect many old suspicions since the cold war and to excite politicians, and I do not rule out that now, like a tuning- fork, he says that's how one should be, and many rather unprincipled politicians may also follow that path. [Video shows Svanidze talking to Kozyrev] [Begin recording] [Svanidze] Are President Yeltsin and you, as foreign minister, not tempted now to strike a statuesque pose, adopt a facial expression that is as patriotic as possible and talk far tougher to Clinton than he talks to Russia? [Kozyrev] We shall do the same has we have been doing. We have always talked quite tough, it must be said. [end recording] [Video shows Yeltsin inspecting troops] Both Boris Yeltsin and the leaders of Western countries have displayed resilience in the situation that has arisen. The Russian president has raised his eyebrows. Everything is under way. There is no reason for hysterics. If the West adopts a fair attitude toward Ukraine's attempt to revise nuclear agreements and toward the massive panic-stricken exodus of the former brothers-in-socialism towards NATO, he, Yeltsin, won't understand that. [Video shows EC meeting; Kravchuk speaking; Lithuanian President Brazauskas talking to Yeltsin; Clinton joking with Havel] The subtle hint was taken. Clinton and other Western leaders, who were under intense pressure last week from those who favor a change in policy toward Moscow and, above all, toward Yeltsin, kept their nerve. In fact, the West was facing a dilemma. Either to throw the doors open to all-comers and thus build up a strong defensive cordon on Russia's western borders right now, in case the Russians want a bit of a fight. These tactics threaten to stiffen militarist sentiments and to bolster the extremist radical wing in Russia itself. Or to relax, not make a fuss, and realize that, if the Russians go mad and move their tanks in, Lithuania, Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia can't be saved anyway. And so, whoever is accepted into what, there will be no stable Europe without a stable Russia. Eastern Europe itself probably understands that and is relying more on monetary than on military assistance. But the West doesn't have a bottomless pocket. [Svanidze is seen talking to Kozyrev] [Begin Kozyrev recording] NATO has not been intimidated by the hasty demands for a quantitative expansion of its ranks. We were against that, and it must be said that the American "Partnership for Peace" blueprint actually envisages a lengthy stage, as they see it, of preparing the new states for entry to NATO. Here there is some difference of emphasis between us. We do not put the emphasis on preparation for entry to NATO, although we do not rule out the possibility that, at some stage, Russia itself may become a member of NATO. Why not? But the main thing is not that we shall be in some kind of preparatory class. The main thing for us is the actual period, a sufficiently lengthy and substantive period, of partnership. What is meant by that? Joint maneuvers, training of peacekeeping troops, let's say, for areas of conflict, and so on and so forth. [end recording] [Video shows Clinton next to Delors and other EC leaders] At the NATO session, the partners proceeded from the view that the hasty acceptance of East European countries into the organization would lead to the destabilization of Europe. This was reflected mildly in the adopted program "Partnership for Peace," which is open to Russia so long as we have the good fortune to observe one of the program's principles -- civilian control of the military. [Video shows Clinton at EC meeting; ship's guns firing; Georgiy Arbatov, academician, Russian Academy of Sciences, appears] [Begin Arbatov recording] Today we have less civilian control of the army than we had even before perestroyka. [end recording] [Video: another sequence from the Kozyrev interview] [Begin recording] [Svanidze] Has the influence of the military on the drawing up of foreign policy not grown stronger recently? [Kozyrev] No. People have usually said that ever since, let's say, the tragic events in October. Now they say that the president or the whole government are dancing to the tune of the military because they are obliged to them, and so on. No, there's no such thing. That's wrong. [Svanidze] There's no dancing? [Kozyrev] No. As for bearing them in mind -- yes. We bear them in mind. [end recording] It is beyond doubt that this whole collection of issues connected with Eastern Europe and NATO will be among the most important at the Moscow talks. A second substantial item is the problem of nuclear security and relations with Ukraine. The third is the problem of aid. President Boris Yeltsin will undoubtedly insist that it should be spelled out in detail. There will also undoubtedly be discussion here of the 43,000 million dollars that were earmarked for us by the G-7 and which are essential to the continuation of reform in Russia. [Video shows more of the Kozyrev interview] [Begin Kozyrev recording] We shall raise the question of its being in the form of help for our emergence on to the international market, and for the activation of our own economy, while we concern ourselves with our unemployed. [end recording] [Video shows back to Arbatov] [Begin Arbatov recording] I get the impression, quite frankly, and I think the Americans will think of it too, perhaps: was the game worth the candle? [end recording] Western Europe and the United States are following our reforms closely. But today, exactly a month after the parliamentary elections in Russia, the U.S. President is flying to see us, and it can confidently be said that one change in the American and Western approach to events in Russia has already taken place. Today they are more interested in our stability than in the pace of our reforms. [Video shows more of the Kozyrev interview] [Begin recording] [Svanidze] Do you equate the work of the president with work for Russia, work for democratic...? [Kozyrev, interrupting] Yes, because this president was elected by the people, and his mandate was confirmed by the people. Will the people vote for a different president? I don't know whether I will. It will depend on what that president's character is like. But, at any rate, he will personify Russia. The constitution says that the president is the head of state, and he determines foreign policy. [end recording] [Video shows Kozyrev standing beside Yeltsin] In fact, Kozyrev has recently been operating hand in glove with President Yeltsin, which is rare. He clearly has a subtle understanding of Yeltsin. [Video shows Clinton addressing an audience; brief clip of German President Kohl] Clinton seems to understand him, too. At the meeting in Brussels, when greeting Chancellor Kohl, a man of solid build, Clinton said: Helmut, I thought of you all night as I watched sumo wrestling on television. I wonder what Bill Clinton associates with President Yeltsin.
