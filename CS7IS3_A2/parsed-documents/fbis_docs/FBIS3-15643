Attempts by national democrats, whose standing in the region is higher than that of other parties to form electoral blocs with their opponents, have remained an unattainable dream in the oblast. As a result of this, about 10 different parties have registered for the elections, including communists and national socialists. The motley candidate lists and democrats' tactics of creating artificial competition within their own ranks, may produce unexpected results and grant unwanted people participation in the second round of elections. Although the probability of such an outcome is quite problematic given the majority electoral system, it cannot be disregarded. Speaking of different political blocs' chances in the current electoral marathon, those of the Rukh and the New Wave association seem more preferable. These two affiliated organizations (most New Wave nominees enjoy Rukh's support) can count on 60-70 percent of the seats granted for Lvov Oblast. The only people capable of changing this proportion are the new nomenklatura from the presidential administration and local councils. Some of these people have nothing against acting under the Rukh's umbrella. The unquestionable leaders of this bilateral (or tripartite) union are Yukhnovskyy, Pynzenyk, Kosiv, Lavrynovych, Kendzior, Boychyshyn, and Oblast Council Chairman Mykola Horyn. Only one member of the Congress of National Democratic Forces has a chance of winning a legislative seat, namely Mykhaylo Horyn's former deputy Oleh Pavlyshyn. Mykhaylo Horyn himself is going to face a fierce political showdown with his one-time partner Stepan Khmara. However, if the congress formed a bloc with Larysa Skoryk's Nationwide Movement and the anti-Chornovil democratic nomenklatura, such a right-center coalition could win as many as 30 percent of the seats. Democratic nationalists from the Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists can count on two or three seats in rural districts. The situation of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists is similar. The followers of Melnyk [nationalist leader of 1940's] can win one or two seats. The dramatic increase in the popularity of the ultraright National Independence of Ukraine [DSU], the Ukrainian National Assembly [UNA], and the national socialists is one of the unexpected phenomena of recent weeks. Promises to restore order and make Ukraine rich could grant them and the Conservative Republican Party victories in 30 percent of the districts. However under the current circumstances, this group can only expect two to four seats. If the rightist parties manage to discredit the democrats by accusing them of accepting bribes and noting the semitic origin of their capital and their readiness to betray Ukraine's national interests, their claims on legislative seats might become much more substantiated. However this camp too, has not rid itself of the democrats' disease of infighting. National Self-Defense candidate Vitovych has been nominated candidate in one district with DSU member Shcherbatyuk; national socialists Hodysh and Tyahnybok are going to fight against UNA's Shkil and Ostap Kozak respectively. Only the extreme left parties -- communists and socialists led by Ukrainian Communist Party Central Committee member Adam Martynyuk, are not experiencing any of these problems. Their chances to win the elections in at least one urban district are miserable. Yet, these people could receive some votes from naturalized immigrants in urban districts with a high percentage of Russian-speaking voters, and thus make it to the second round of elections. However this is everything they can dream of. The so-called independent candidates are in a similar situation and can count either on votes from their relatives and friends, or on their own capital.
