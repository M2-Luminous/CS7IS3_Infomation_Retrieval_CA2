Koivisto's reply was even briefer: "Unquestionably," he said. At that time the negotiations in Brussels had not yet been concluded, nor was the exact final result known. Koivisto stressed the fact that the differences of opinion that arose during the negotiations were not very important ones. On the following day, in the speech he delivered before the Eduskunta, new President Martti Ahtisaari said that Finland would secure its future best as a member of the European Union. The membership negotiations were only in the final stretch at that moment, and no one could have said exactly what the final result would be. How could two Finnish presidents so unhesitatingly voice a positive stand on EU membership even though they did not yet at that point know what might be agreed on in Brussels with reference to subsidies for Southern Finnish farmers or the cultivation of vegetables and cut flowers? The answer is an easy one. The presidents did not entertain the belief that seemed to prevail among most Finns: that the details of the agreement negotiated in Brussels will presumably be decisive when we estimate "whether it will pay" for Finland to join the EU. Of course, it was important for Finland's negotiators to successfully put the finishing touches to the agreement as well -- beyond any realistic hopes. Many different kinds of monetary values were involved. However, we should bear in mind that the most important and essential issue of all from the standpoint of Finland's membership is not included at all in the agreement concluded in Brussels. It was not even negotiated there. This is why the differences of opinion in Brussels "were not very important," as Koivisto put it. What is important is the fact that the opportunity has finally opened up to Finland to quite openly link itself with other Western-style democracies -- unless Finland itself decides to remain a no-man's-land between East and West in which our political and economic reference groups are the former Soviet states and satellites.
