Bosnian Croat troops (HVO) on Thursday afternoon recaptured a part of the Buhino Selo village near Vitez, taken by Muslims in the latest offensive, and found the bodies of 11 Croats, among them of massacred civilians whose hands were tied, Croatian radio said. Muslim troops have undertaken a new mobilization in Zenica since they plan to launch a new offensive, Bosnian Serb military sources said on Friday. The special instructions issued for the mobilization insist that as many as possible non-Muslims be mobilized, especially Croats, but specifies that their number in units of the so-called army of Bosnia-Herzegovina must not exceed five percent so that the Muslim character of the units would be preserved. According to Bosnian Serb military sources, Vitez and Novi Travnik will be the targets of the Muslim offensive. The steel plant in Zenica, a Muslim-held town in central Bosnia, has stepped up the production of mortars and artillery ammunition. The capturing of Vitez is vital for the Muslim side because of the very large quantities of explosives stored there and because it would mean the elimination of the last obstacle standing in the way of the Muslim side's full political and military domination in central Bosnia. It is said that the local bank in Zenica has received 10 million German marks from abroad for military purchases. The Muslim side is now seeking a channel for making the purchases and securing their delivery. Muslim forces in central Bosnia have been staging attacks on Croat positions around Novi Travnik, east of Travnik, and in the western section of the front, at Zepca, according to Croatian radio. According to Bosnian Serb military sources, fighting between Croats and Muslims continues also in the River Neretva Valley and the southern zone of Mostar. In the past 24 hours, Muslim forces continued attacking Bosnian Serb positions at Doboj, a town in northern Bosnia, on the front north-east of Teslic, in the area of Maglaj, on Mounts Ozren and Vlasic, also in northern Bosnia, along the upper and central parts of the River Drina in eastern Bosnia, in the area of Foca and the area of Cajnice, also in eastern Bosnia, Bosnian Serb military sources said on Friday. The movements of smaller infantry and reconnaissance Muslim groups, which have been trying to infiltrate the Bosnian Serb ranks, have been observed in eastern Bosnia.
