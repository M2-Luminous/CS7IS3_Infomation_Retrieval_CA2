Although President Kim Yong-sam and Yi Ki-taek, chairman of the Democratic Party [DP], agreed on the need for political reform, they were sharply divided on such issues as the DP's calls for abolition of the National Security Law and renegotiation of the Uruguay Round trade accord. Kim Yong-sam, also president of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP), rejected in no uncertain terms the opposition demands at a two-hour meeting at Chongwadae [presidential offices] Friday morning. The talks' outcome brought a critical, if not angry, reaction from the ranks of the Democratic Party. As a result, friction between the ruling and opposition parties is expected to rise as the DP plans to work against ratification of the Uruguay Round accord at the National Assembly, continue to press the DLP and the government to abolish the National Security Law, and highlight the sensitive issue of rising prices. DP Spokesman Pak Chi-won said Saturday that President Kim raised many issues such as his views on North Korea, his determination to realize clean politics and measures for the Uruguay Round agreement. "But there is such a wide gap between his views and those of the Democratic Party, we could not help being disappointed by them (Kim's views)," Pak said. "We detected the will to reform in the president's remarks but we could not also help worrying that (he) is heading toward a civilian dictatorship under the pretext of political reform," Pak said. Pak said the opposition party was particularly upset by an "unscruplous and intentionally arrogant" statement issued by Chongwadae on the Kim-Yi meeting. "How could they wish to conduct politics with the kind of attitude that demeans the (leader) of the other side," he said. "We do not wish to worsen relations between the ruling and opposition parties over such a matter and the Democratic Party has no plans to resort to action (against the DLP and the government)," Pak said. "But it (Friday's meeting) could become a reference point when we are formulating policies," he said, hinting that depending on how the issues are addressed, the opposition party will mount a strong offensive. One senior DP official said the party plans to push strongly for renegotiation of the Uruguay Round agreement and revision of the National Security Law. The government and the ruling party are also taking a lax attitude toward the problems of rising consumer prices and welfare of ordinary citizens, he said. In contrast to the opposition reaction, the ruling party gave high marks to the two leaders' agreement to work together to implement the newly adopted political reform legislation. DLP Secretary-General Mun Chung-su said, "it was an epochal event in the 50-year constitutional history that the president and the representative of the opposition party have agreed to realize political reform and a revolution in elections." Commenting on opposition complaints that Yi failed to get "a present (concession)" from the president, Mun said the past practice of an opposition party leader receiving such a gift is an anachronism. "It (such thinking) has to change," Mun said. Mun said, however, that the issues Yi Ki-taek raised at Friday's meeting can be taken up at various meetings or working-level negotiations. Mun thus indicated that the ruling party plans to actively negotiate with the opposition party on those issues in order to avoid a tense situation. DLP Spokesman Ha Sun-pong also said Friday's meeting was held not to give or take anything. "It was called to discuss how to carry out the political reform laws which are unprecedented in the political history of this country," ha said. "If the ruling and opposition parties had a confrontational relationship in the past, it is now time for them to forge a partnership," he said.
