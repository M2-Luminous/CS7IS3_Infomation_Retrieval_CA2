FBIS4-65078 "drweu092__a94019" FBIS-WEU-94-092-A Daily Report 11 May 1994 ANNEX Italy Fini: `Right Will Put Itself To Test In Government' Fini: `Right Will Put Itself To Test In Government' BR1105142394 Turin LA STAMPA in Italian 11 May 94 p 7--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY BR1105142394 Turin LA STAMPA Italian BFN [Interview with National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini by Mauro Anselmo; place and date not given: "We Shall Have Another Great Victory"] [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Anselmo] How did you feel when [Prime Minister] Berlusconi read out the list of ministers and it included men from the former MSI [Italian Social Movement]? [Fini] I was satisfied. I was satisfied, but I had my feet firmly on the ground. [Anselmo] Did you think that it would be difficult for the Right to govern because they have never governed? [Fini] No. Because I am a realist. I do not hide from difficulties. However, at the same time I am also convinced of one thing. It will be useful to govern, because the Right will put itself to the test in government and it will get rid of a lot of commonplaces. [Anselmo] What commonplaces? [Fini] That only the Left is sensitive to problems like the environment, work, our cultural heritage, and schools. [Anselmo] Mr. Fini, is the accusation that this government has fascist ministers also a commonplace? [Fini] It is the chorus of those who do not want to understand. Fascism ended in 1945 but the story continues. [passage omitted] [Anselmo] How were the ministers chosen? [Fini] I put forward the names of men who were sufficiently competent to handle some of the ministries well. Then I left it to the prime minister-designate. [Anselmo] Are you sorry that Tremaglia was not included? [Fini] I am very pleased that there is a Ministry for the Italians in the World. It is a battle that we have fought, and Tremaglia in particular, and we have obtained a result anyway. [Anselmo] Have you heard the joke going around the house? The right-wing Communists were in government first. [Fini] It is not a joke. It is the truth. [Anselmo] And do you take the merit for the Right getting into government, Mr. Fini? [Fini] I know my defects, and being presumptuous is not one of them. I do not need to reply. [Anselmo] What does the Right want to do in government? [Fini] We shall do something that is very simple with our five ministers. We shall guarantee the values of honesty, efficiency, and cleanliness. [Anselmo] When will you cast off the nostalgic pure hardliners, and take the rebirth of the Right to be a fact? [Fini] It is contradictory for people to tell me that I must be democratic, and I am, respectful of pluralism (and I certainly am), and sensitive to dialogue, and then to add that I must get rid of this person and that person. Oh no gentlemen, be a little coherent. Only dictators throw people out, and I am not a dictator. [Anselmo] Then how will you deal with right-wing members of your party when they challenge you? [Fini] I am going my own way, and you can be sure that I will go ahead. [Anselmo] Do you mean that you will not throw anybody out but that somebody should leave of his own accord? [Fini] The problem belongs to those who risk not being able to associate themselves with what I say and do. They will tell me and then we will see. [Anselmo] It was a businessman, Silvio Berlusconi, who pulled the MSI out of the refrigerator. Why? [Fini] Because only a man who was outside politics and its games could break the hard skin of ostracism that has kept the Right isolated for 50 years. [Anselmo] What did you find most disturbing about that ostracism? [Fini] The absolute lack of desire to try to understand us. One of the things that I found most entertaining and infuriating happened during the election campaign for the Rome City Council. For seven days the television transmitted my face-to-face meetings with Rutelli. And what did you hear going around? That Fini is saying things that are right too. However, I had not invented anything. I was there before, too. I had not done my makeup to go on television. However, people did not know us, because the television had ignored us and the doors had been barred. [passage omitted]
