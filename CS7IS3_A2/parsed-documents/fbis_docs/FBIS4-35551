Shaykh al-Sabah said they exchanged views on a number of issues, including Iraq-Kuwait relations and the ties between Kuwait and Iran, which he described as good. He noted that the Iranian president invited Shaykh Jabir al-Ahmad, amir of Kuwait, to visit Tehran. He said the visit will take place very soon. When asked about the altercation between the Kuwaiti and Iraqi delegations today, Shaykh al-Sabah said the Kuwaiti delegation was replying to the remarks of the Iraqi delegation concerning the Security Council resolutions that Kuwait, along with the entire world, demands be implemented. Regrettably, he said, Iraq always says that it closed the file the Kuwait issue. If Iraq really means that, the Kuwaiti minister said, then the Iraqi Government and National Assembly should send an official document to the Security Council telling it that they accept all its resolutions. He denied any Egyptian mediation to improve relations between Iraq and Kuwait. The Iranian foreign minister was asked about Iran's future relations with the PLO in light of Iran's opposition to the Palestinian-Israeli agreement. He replied that the PLO still operates its embassy in Tehran, and that the Iranian Government has good ties with the various Palestinian factions. He said his country is sympathetic toward the Palestinian cause, and it closed the Israeli embassy and replaced it with an embassy for Palestine. Velayati said there are plans for the presidents of Iran and Syria to meet in Damascus in July to discuss regional and international issues of mutual concern. The presidents will also discuss the situation in northern Iraq, which is called the Kurdish region, he said.
