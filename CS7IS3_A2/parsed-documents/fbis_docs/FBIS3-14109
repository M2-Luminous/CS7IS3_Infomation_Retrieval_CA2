The sources said that Ninawa Governor (for less than a year) Staff Major General 'Abd-al-Wahid Shinan Al Ribat was relieved of his post after a clash between, on the one hand, butchers and grocers in the Mosul market and, on the other, a Special Forces unit which tried to force them to cut their prices after the wave of disturbances which had swept Mosul. He was also blamed for the increase in the number of explosions and assassination attempts in the town. Babil Governor Lieutenant General Tali' Khalil al-Rahim al-Duri was relieved of his post, which he had held for three years after the Gulf war. He was the target of a press campaign accusing him of mismanagement. The fate of the two governors is not known, and there have been no appointments replacing them in these posts. Meanwhile, the Iraqi "Free Revolutionary Officers Movement" [IFROM] has revealed that there was an attempt to assassinate Iraqi Defense Minister 'Ali Hasan al-Majid 9 March. In a statement, a copy of which was received by AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT yesterday, the movement said that one of its units carried out the operation, in which 'Ali Hasan al-Majid sustained leg and hand injuries and his aide, Police Major Salih Arjah, and two guards were killed outside the Iraqi defense minister's home in Baghdad. The statement said that the nucleus of the IFROM was formed before Saddam Husayn's forces invaded Kuwait and that it includes a group of senior officers and soldiers, including prominent officers in important positions. The statement added that 136 IFROM officers and soldiers have been martyred in operations against the regime's forces and that in the first two months of this year it distributed thousands of antiregime leaflets in the camps of al-Rashid, al-Taji, al-Suwayrah, al-Rashidiyah, and Khan Bani-Sa'id. It urged the Iraqi opposition forces to unite and end their political rivalry, and it stressed that the desired change should emanate from within Iraq and from within the Armed Forces. It also said that it strives for a truly democratic regime in Iraq, for Iraq's return to the Arab fold, for fraternal and good-neighborly relations with the neighboring states, and for the reconstruction of a strong Iraqi economy.
