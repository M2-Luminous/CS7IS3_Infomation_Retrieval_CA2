ACTION: Notice of Agency Report Forms Under OMB Review. SUMMARY: The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled has submitted revised Annual Certification Forms to OMB for review and clearance under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 USC Chapter 35). DATES: Comments must be submitted on or before September 12, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments should be sent to: Dan Chenok, Desk Officer, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Room 3208, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503. Requests for information, including copies of the request and supporting documentation, should be directed to: Beverly L. Milkman, Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled, Crystal Square 3, Suite 403, 1735 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA 22202&hyph;3461, (703) 603&hyph;7740. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Committee has two annual certification forms, one for nonprofit agencies serving people who are blind and one for nonprofit agencies serving people who have other severe disabilities. The information included on the forms is required to ensure that nonprofit agencies participating in the Committee's program continue to meet the requirements of 41 USC 46&hyph;48c. Several modifications have been made to the form from the previous edition: 1. The language has been updated to reflect the current regulatory language; 2. The certification section has been revised to make it easier for the nonprofit agencies to fill out and to understand what they are certifying; 3. Instructions have been included for each item; 4. The order that the information is recorded has been revised to reduce errors and the input time in entering the data into the Committee's information database; 5. The only new information requested is that the previously reported JWOD Program sales be broken down separately into sales generated from services and products. Beverly L. Milkman, Executive Director. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;19606 Filed 8&hyph;10&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6820&hyph;33&hyph;P
