But he refrained from criticizing his predecessor Shigeto Nagano, who quit over his controversial remarks about the war. "As one of the Japanese I must have a feeling of deep remorse and apology for the numerous acts of aggression, including colonization," Nakai said in an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE at his office at the Justice Ministry. Nakai replaced Nagano, who resigned as justice minister Saturday to take responsibility for his remarks, which were published in a newspaper last Wednesday. He said the 1937 Nanjing massacre was a fabrication and that Japan's war with China and other countries was not aimed at aggression. "It's correct that the Imperial Japanese Army after invading Nanjing at the time massacred ordinary Chinese people," Nakai said. Unlike Nagano, who participated in the war with China as an army officer, Nakai, born in 1942 in China's Changchun, which then belonged to the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo, was still a child at the time the war ended. But as his family was repatriated in September 1946, Nakai said he is well aware of "the various implications Japan's utter defeat had." Nakai, who was in the middle of a meeting with his election committee in Nabari, Mie Prefecture, when Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata called Saturday night to offer him the cabinet post, said he accepted out of understanding for "Hata's feelings in this very difficult situation." Asked whether he plans to make use of his directional authority that allows the justice minister to intervene with the prosecution, Nakai said he "does not intend to take action to intervene in individual problems." He declined to comment on the ongoing debate about whether the United Nations should impose sanctions on North Korea to enforce its request for full inspections of the country's nuclear facilities, saying he first wants to study relevant reports currently being prepared by various government institutions. Stressing that the justice minister's duty is to maintain law and order, Nakai said he does not want to become involved in the discussion about the enactment of legislation covering emergencies and whether Japan should claim the right to collective defense. "It's quite right that everybody voices different views and standpoints, and that the Diet and political parties deliberate (this problem)...However, I don't want to anticipate this discussion," Nakai said.
