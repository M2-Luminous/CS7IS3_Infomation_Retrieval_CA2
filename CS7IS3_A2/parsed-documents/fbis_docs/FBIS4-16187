This is the position that our representatives have been expounding and defending at the talks with the Chinese side on border issues, the ITAR-TASS correspondent was told today by a senior Russian Foreign Ministry staff member. Moreover they have been and remain de facto under our control. The border talks with China, he said, are not hampering this territory being under our jurisdiction. The high-ranking Russian Foreign Ministry staff member elucidated the situation in connection with a report that a public committee to promote and consolidate the Russian status of these islands has been set up in Khabarovsk. The committee has sent an appeal to Federal Assembly deputies proposing that a demand be made that the Russian Foreign Ministry should "officially and precisely express the position of the Russian state on the immutable Russian status of the islands." The diplomat said the position of the Russian Foreign Ministry had been determined in accordance with the government's instructions for holding talks on demarcating the border with the People's Republic of China. The talks have been under way for 30 years now. They made it possible for the first time in the history of relations between the two countries in May 1991 to sign the agreement between the USSR and the PRC on the eastern section of the Soviet-Chinese state border. The document was ratified by the Russian and Chinese parliaments and afterwards signed by the Russian president and the PRC chairman. It therefore has the force of a treaty. At present the line of the border between Russia and China, which extends for 4,300 km, has been more than 98 percent agreed upon, excluding two sectors -- the islands near Khabarovsk and the Bolshoy island on the river Argun in Chita Oblast. As for the Chinese maps, which designate these islands as PRC territory, that is a matter for the Chinese side. Russia's representatives at the border talks have repeatedly mentioned these cartographical inaccuracies, but for quite understandable reasons we cannot make the Chinese designate the aforementioned islands as ours on their maps. Naturally on Russian maps they are shown belonging to the territory of Russia. By mutual agreement of the sides the border talks are strictly confidential. This is so work involving representatives of the Foreign Ministry, Defense Ministry and other departments may proceed in a calm atmosphere. The fact that the inhabitants of the Amur valley are insufficiently well-informed on these issues is to be explained precisely by this circumstance. According to the senior Russian Foreign Ministry staff member, a certain amount of concern locally has been produced by reports in the Japanese press claiming that the islands near Khabarovsk have already been handed over to China, which in no way corresponds to reality.
