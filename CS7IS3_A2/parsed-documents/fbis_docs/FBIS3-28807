Japan exercised a very marginal influence, and the influence of the rest of the countries was negligible. Fortunately, the principle of free trade was pushed through to the end. However, it cannot be overlooked that big powers were more persistent in promoting their national interests than in any previous negotiations. In his official message to the U.S. Congress calling for the passage of the UR agreements, U.S. President Clinton pledged that he will "see to it that U.S. interests will be protected" in future negotiations. What would the world trade organization [WTO] order be like? It would be the kind of order in which all countries, nay, all enterprises in all countries will compete with each other one-on-one. It will not only govern competition in commodity trade but also in services, brain power and knowledge, and ability among nations and enterprises. Expansion of competition will pose an awesome challenge to us. Underdeveloped countries might be able to hold their own in competition in commodity trade. But they will discover that there are many areas in the software field, such as technology, brain power, and knowledge, where they are no match for their competitors from the beginning. They will also discover that rules governing competition are not interpreted in a uniformly fair manner. Just as lions get their lion's share in the food chain, advanced countries will interpret the substance of the economic order in a way advantageous to themselves. While absorbed in exporting commodities, the underdeveloped might lose everything before they are aware of it, like a hunter too much absorbed in chasing a hare to see the mountain. During the recent UR negotiations, our country ran about in confusion like soldiers surprised by the enemy. The UR is concluded for now, and work will begin soon to work out details necessary to implement it. We should immediately revise a number of laws, regulations, and systems to prevent outsiders from unilaterally setting our national destiny without our knowledge. Economic policies under the WTO order cannot succeed with the conventional methods and ideas. If so, what should be changed, and how? First, the government's functions and roles must be changed. "Economic planning" by the government will become virtually meaningless. It will be practically impossible to make cyclical adjustments through Keynesian stop-gap government intervention. We come to keenly realize that globalization signifies a limitation on government economic policy-making. With the WTO order, the government will no longer be able to control and adjust the economy unilaterally and at will. For instance, as foreign capital moves from one country to another as a result of the liberalization of capital, currency authorities will not be able to maintain a certain volume of currency in circulation as they please. Needless to say, this does not mean that the role of currency authorities will be eliminated. In some areas, their role may even increase. But their role and meaning should change. The government should review and reorganize its roles and functions as soon as possible so that they may be adapted to the new environment under the WTO. Our government structure is a carryover from the era in which it was to help attain the growth targets under the closed economic system of the 1960's and 70's. Public understanding of its functions still remains at that level. With this structure it will be difficult to flexibly take up the challenge of the WTO era. The concept that prevailed in those says gave rise to a tendency to denigrate the role of the price mechanism and be overconfident of the control function of government agencies. All policies based on this is bound to end in failure in the WTO era. [28 Dec 93 p 1] Costly, Inefficient Structure Needs Urgent Revamping [Text] To adapt ourselves to the WTO era, we need to push for the establishment of an order founded on free competition as extensively and swiftly as possible. Needless to say, order under free competition does not simply mean laissez-faire. Order founded on free competition cannot take root in a vacuum. It needs rules for its preservation and development. Just as the old order founded on control was a "system," the order founded on free competition is similarly a "system" based on strict rules. The written part of these must be worked out and enforced by the government. If conventional economic planning becomes unnecessary and stop-gap fine tuning becomes impossible, the role of the planning authorities (the Economic Planing Board [EPB], for one) needs to be changed drastically. Until now the EPB has formulated macroeconomic plans and made an overall adjustment of economic policies to fulfill goals. But instead of setting macroeconomic goals, the EPB will from now on have to set goals for liberalization and competition and piece together and adjust all the directions in establishing systems necessary for their attainment. Still intact in our economy are so many systems that arbitrarily regulate, ban, punish, or watch private sector economic activity. Most of the high cost and low efficiency of our economy is their legacy. Will government ministries be able to fulfill satisfactorily the liberalization goals that reduce their own authority? It will be difficult to get an affirmative answer. But the flimsy supply system in the ROK economy characterized by high cost and low efficiency will not improve unless the government changes its ways. [passage omitted] For the ROK to be internationally competitive in the WTO era, it is necessary to select a sound direction for macroeconomic policies. The most desirable macroeconomic policy direction in improving the high-cost, low-efficiency economic structure is to do away with the the stop-and-go pattern and consistently build up the basis of economic stability. When prices rise and bubbles are formed while pursuing a growth policy, the government switches to retrenchment; and when this retards growth, it returns to a growth policy once again. Under this kind of "stop-and-go" policy, it is impossible to gain competitiveness. In the current condition of the ROK economy, it is difficult to adopt a strong retrenchment policy. But if the government unflaggingly pursues a determined policy of stabilization for several years while pushing reforms designed to establish an order founded on free competition, it will be able to attain desirable results without fail. This is the only way to win public trust and response. The majority want price stability more than anything. "Macroeconomic stability and microeconomic liberalization"--this will be the most appropriate policy mix at present. This mix will be accompanied by many difficulties. It will be difficult to expect immediate results. For this reason, it is very possible that it will come under attack from an impatient press and interest groups. That is why it will be difficult to pursue without economic vision and conviction. There is the danger of reverting to the old stop-and-go policy. Many desire easy growth; they want capitalism without cost. But no such capitalism has ever succeeded. Most important for the ROK economy now is monetary reform. The United States and other big powers are expected to press hard for financial liberalization in our country in the future. Should we fail to prepare for this pressure, we could find ourselves running about in confusion just as we did in the opening of the rice market. What kind of preparation do we need? The most essential preparation will be the "liberalization of the domestic financial market." We should move up Phases III and IV in the liberalization schedule as soon as possible. It is desirable to reduce or abolish policy-driven financing, liberalize all interest rates including those on bank loans, establish a responsible management system for banking organizations, and abolish all forms of window guidance. To this end, many statutes and regulations for financial control need be revised. When liberalization is pursued while curbing inflation, it will bring about increased savings, stable interest rates, and a turnabout in our high-cost, low-efficiency economy. Financial operations in the WTO era will require a high degree of expertise. Along with financial liberalization, it is desirable to revise the Bank of Korea Law so that the central bank may take charge of currency management. Only by so doing is it possible to put an end to the vicious "stop and go" cycle and insure expertise in financial operations. Inasmuch as the central bank is a government agency, there is a stark limitation on its "independence." Nevertheless it must be clear where responsibility for currency control lies in order to increase the effectiveness of economic policy. [30 Dec 93 pp 1, 2] Cultivate Intellect, Train Personnel With Foresight [Text] Following the conclusion of the UR negotiations, the government announced various measures designed to achieve an epochal development of our agriculture. What we need is not epochal measures, but epochal results. But it is questionable whether we will be able to easily find means to achieve epochal results. Inasmuch as our agriculture and rural communities are problems for our industry and society as a whole, it is impossible to find ways to achieve epochal development only in agriculture by divorcing it from the rest of the nation's economic policy. Many have pointed out, "Our agriculture is backward," or "Our rural communities are backward." But in my opinion, those who hold this perception labor under a misconception of what lies at the heart of the matter. True, our agriculture and rural communities are backward. But it is more appropriate to say that there has been a discrepancy between agricultural policy and directions of economic management in all other sectors. This was created because policies concerning agriculture and rural communities were always formulated independently of overall economic policy. As overall economic policy was being implemented with no link whatsoever to agricultural policy, the latter focused only on agriculture and persistently sought to increase production. As a result, development of non-agricultural rural income sources has been neglected and agriculture has continued to be wholly dependent on rice farming. It is impossible to reconstruct agriculture and rural communities so long as the dichotomy in policy described above remains unchanged. It is impossible to develop agriculture and rural communities alone by keeping agricultural policy separated from the economy as a whole. [passage omitted] It is often said, correctly, that our economic future depends on export. But now that we are at the outset of the WTO era, it is necessary to appropriately amend this perception. We must think more broadly and deeply. What drives export? Export depends on technology and business management efficiency. What drives these two factors? In the final analysis, they depend on man, namely, talent. If our civil servants are inferior to their American and Japanese counterparts, if our company employees are inferior to their American and Japanese counterparts, if the level of our knowledge is below that of other nations, it is obvious that we will be defeated in international competition. [passage omitted] In a sense the WTO era may be interpreted as one in which the United States and Europe, finding themselves shoved aside by Asians countries in commodity trade, will challenge their Asian competitors once again by shifting from commodity to knowledge and intellect as weapons of competition. [passage omitted] Unfortunately, we have achieved no great success in either. To begin with, the system for properly employing trained talent needs improvement as a short-term objective. The civil service system should be improved. It is well known that many of our civil servants are talented. But it is undeniable that there is ample room for improvement in the way they are employed if we are to achieve policy innovations to suit the tide of the times. [passage omitted] In our country civil servants rely on the each ministry's research institute for supplementing their deficiencies in their specialties. A similar system hardly exists elsewhere. It has merits, but it also has serious demerits. If civil servants depend too much on institutes, it may become an impediment to their "intellectual" development in the long run, and the institutions will fall into the trap of working for departmental interests while failing to produce good research for the national interest. It is desirable to increase researchers' autonomy and reduce civil servant dependence on research institutions. [passage omitted]
