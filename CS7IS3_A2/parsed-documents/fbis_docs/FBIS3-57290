NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the same subject: "The first round of struggle in the State Duma has ended. In a relatively peaceful way. The Duma has got down to work. What the results will be, good or bad, will be shown by the first laws which the Duma will pass." SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA carries an article by Gennadiy Zyuganov, chairman of the Russian Communist Party group in the State Duma. Zyuganov writes as follows: "To develop a legislative basis is undoubtedly an essential thing to do. But it is clear to any unprejudiced observer that the country's present-day problems lie on a somewhat different plane. "We suffer from a deficit of legality, not a deficit of laws. None of the existing laws is being properly enacted and, what is most dangerous, an example in this respect is being set by top executive structures with the president at the head... "The question is as follows: either legality is restored, or the country would plunge deeper and deeper into the quagmire of an economic catastrophe and a slugglishly proceeding civil war which threatens to develop into a full-scale one at any moment". IZVESTIYA on economic problems: "Since the position of Finance Minister Boris Fedorov has not yet been decided upon, it is unclear which matters of relationships with international financial organisations will be tackled by which ministry". New Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin, "judging by his remarks, is ready for a certain compromise. At the same time he said the Economics Ministry should be in control of the entire economic situation, including foreign economic relations". IZVESTIYA, in another article on economic issues, points out that Central Bank chief Viktor Gerashchenko "is really convinced that monetary injections and the restoration of old economic contacts would boost production and make it possible to move on to a market economy smoothly by state regulation methods." "'Smoothly' and 'state regulation' are exceptionally important from the personal point of view as well. Mr Gerashchenko has already staked out a claim for the job of a chairman of the interstate bank of CIS countries. "If the monetary system of Russia is combined, to begin with, with those of Belarus and Tajikistan. And the 'wrong' done to Messr Nazarbayev and Karimov is then 'redressed', it will turn out that Gerashchenko would again emerge as the head of an almost gosbank of the Soviet Union. If this office is approved by the parliaments of 5-7 countries, no Russian reformers would be able to topple the head of such an institution. This will be like the chief justice of the Supreme Court in America who is elected for life." NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA runs an exclusive interview with President Mintimer Shaymiyev of Tatarstan after his January 21 meeting with Russian President Boris Yeltsin. "We consider that Tatarstan should be represented in the federal parliament. But, in order to secure that the population of the republic show activism, it is essential to sign a bilateral treaty. It is simply naive to expect the electorate to be active without determining a relationship formula", Shaymiyev said. KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) on service in the Russian Army under contract: "Of course, a service under contract is to a large extent a solution to the problem of manning the Army and Navy. There are already 120,000 servicemen who have been enlisted under contract but this accounts for only 10 per cent of the needed strength." KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA carries an interview with prominent political figure Valentin Falin, the author of a book entitled "Political Reminiscences" which became a bestseller in Germany. In the book, Falin analyses the events which preceded the reunification of Germany. "A contemplating attitude is not for great powers. When German reunificaiton was knocking at the door, it was not enough to appeal to a future verdict of history", Falin emphasises. ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA on a presidential decree and a State Duma draft resolution on an amnesty. Leading experts from the Russian Interior Ministry's research institute, in comment on the decree and the State Duma draft resolution, explain that the issue of the presidential decree and the publication of a draft resolution on an amnesty do not at all mean that an amnesty has already been decided upon. Only a decree about bringing the draft resolution up for consideration by the deputies enters into force. The Duma has the right to and is certain to introduce considerable changes to the document. On the whole, the experts maintain, the draft resolution which is being suggested for discussion does not basically differ in any way from those which had been repeatedly passed before. The draft resolution has been drawn up competently from the legal point of view and can in no way make for an increased tension in society. The main positive aspect of it is that the suggested amnesty would not apply to habitual criminals but would concern only those convicted for offences which do not pose grave danger to society. IZVESTIYA on Lithuanian-Polish relations: "Over the past two an a half years, there has been no serious rapprochement in the slightest degree between the two neighbouring countries whose cultures, traditions and religion are very similar... Fear of Polish expansion compels the Lithuanian authorities to tackle problems concerning ethnic Poles by methods which are far from being democratic."
