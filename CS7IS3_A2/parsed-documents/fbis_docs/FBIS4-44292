Clinton was referring to Pyongyang's readiness to freeze its nuclear program, in exchange for which he has agreed to renewed negotiations. Tension on and around the peninsula has significantly decreased now that the United States has suspended its attempts to impose sanctions against North Korea. At a hastily organized press conference Clinton declared that North Korea was complying with U.S. conditions for the resumption of high-level talks between the two countries. During the talks no spent nuclear fuel will be reprocessed for the manufacture of nuclear weapons, no new fuel rods will be loaded into the nuclear reactor, and international inspectors can continue with their work. North Korea has also undertaken in writing to respect all the stipulations laid down in the Non-Proliferation Treaty. The United States agrees to begin talks from the beginning of July in Geneva on the nuclear issue, together with "all political, economic and security issues" of interest to the two countries. For the North Koreans this implies a promise that the Americans will not use an atomic weapon against them. They also want to discuss the replacement of their obsolete core reactors by light water reactors, the cost to be borne by the United States. In China, Clinton's decision met with approval. Beijing sees it as confirmation of the course it adopted throughout the conflict: no sanctions, but diplomacy. American reporters recently granted a rare visit to the Chinese-North Korean border have also been able to see how with such a porous border sanctions would not prove very effective in any event. In addition, the population of the Chinese border region is 40 percent ethnically Korean. It is uncertain where their loyalties would lie if a cordon was placed around North Korea. Prosperity The relief was particularly great in South Korea. After more than fifty years of hardship the country is finally enjoying considerable prosperity and, more recently, democratic freedoms. All these achievements threatened to be reduced to nothing by U.S. saber-rattling, increasingly backed up by West Europe and Russia. In the name of the principle of nonproliferation. Few people would deny that it is an important principle and one that is worth defending. In addition, North Korea may be seen as a test case for the treaty's renewal next year. But those who have been stating over recent years that the issue, in North Korea's case, was not worth going to war, have some powerful arguments. The evidence against North Korea is inconclusive. The country's exact intentions are unclear. The United States is also unable to present any global nuclear policy. Its position on countries such as Israel, South Africa, and Pakistan for example contrasts sharply with that taken on North Korea. And are countries such as India, that take offense at the difference between the recognized nuclear powers -- the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China -- and other countries, altogether wrong? Clinton, keen on a winner in the public opinion stakes after several humiliating defeats, also seemed all too ready to embark on confrontation. The visit by his predecessor Jimmy Carter to Pyongyang showed that the opportunities for diplomacy had not been exhausted. The conflict is not over and the President was right to point this out. But at least dialogue is being given a second chance. Hopefully the meeting between Kim Yong-sam and Kim Il-song -- the two Korean presidents -- will take place. It could bring a breakthrough on a number of points, such as the reuniting of families, or human rights in the North, all of which were brushed aside as attention remained focused solely on the nuclear issue.
