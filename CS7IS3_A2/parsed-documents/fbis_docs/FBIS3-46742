Japanese Communist Party legislator Masaharu Udo said former aides of the prime minister have told him that Hosokawa bribed Kumamoto prefectural assembly legislators from the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] with the Sagawa money to secure LDP endorsement of his candidacy for the governorship. He made the accusation at a question and answer session of the House of Councillors' special committee on political reform which resumed debate after an eight-day recess. Udo quoted one of Hosokawa's election campaign managers as stating Hosokawa used the money he accepted from Sagawa to bribe prefectural assembly legislators to secure LDP endorsement of his candidacy. He said his investigation showed that the 100 million yen was handed over to Hosokawa "in three installments" from October to December of 1982, when a few politicians were vying with each other to get LDP support. Hosokawa won the party's endorsement and went on to secure the governorship. In reply, Hosokawa denied the allegations, saying the loan had nothing to do with his political activities related to the gubernatorial election. In Japanese gubernatorial elections, candidates often have to grease the palms of LDP prefectural assembly legislators to win the local chapter's recommendation as an LDP candidate. The LDP's Tokyo headquarters often approves the local chapter's recommendation. An LDP endorsement is considered crucial in winning over conservative voters used to perceiving the LDP as the most reliable provider of stability and pork barrel projects. Hosokawa earlier acknowledged that he had borrowed 100 million yen from Kiyoshi Sagawa, then chairman of the Sagawa Kyubin trucking conglomerate, but said he had already repaid the loan. Udo renewed the opposition camp's demand that the ruling coalition allow the Diet to question Sagawa and Hosokawa's former political secretary Masatoshi Miyama by having them testify as sworn witnesses. Hosokawa has said he is not aware of the details of the deal, as it was handled by Miyama who was his secretary when he was a House of Councillors legislator in the LDP faction led by the late ex- premier Kakuei Tanaka. Udo questioned the truthfulness of Hosokawa's explanation that he borrowed the Sagawa money in October 1982, to buy a Tokyo condominium and fix the front gate and earthen wall of his spacious residence in Kumamoto. The legislator said such an explanation is irrational because evidence shows that Hosokawa bought the condominium three months before the loan and fixed the gate and wall long after receiving it. The long time lag between the loan and the repair is "irrational in view of the fact that Hosokawa would have had to pay interest of 1.8 million yen on the loan annually (if it were a loan)," he said. Hosokawa replied, "I borrowed the money one year before the gubernatorial election, so it has nothing to do with the election."
