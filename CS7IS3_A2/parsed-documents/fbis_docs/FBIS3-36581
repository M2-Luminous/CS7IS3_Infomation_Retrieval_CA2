The document called "On Offsetting Mutual Debts" says it is necessary to eliminate overdue debts of enterprises and organisations, to create conditions for a free flow of goods and stop production slump. The document promises a "principally new approach" to the offset of debts and instructs the government and the National Bank to "work out a mechanism of its implementation which would not allow a rise of infltaion and a fall of the national currency". The government was instructed to offset debts with reserve money and foreign loans. The offset will allow to determine those who are truly bankrupt and begin implementing the law on bankruptcy, according to the document.
