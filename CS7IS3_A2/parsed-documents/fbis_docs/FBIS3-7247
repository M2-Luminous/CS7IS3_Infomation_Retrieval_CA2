In the book, he puts forth his view on a realignment of political parties, proposing that members of the LDP, the Japan New Party, and Sakigake [Harbinger] with the same political belief form two new parties. His book is likely to become a sensation because his moves, including his ties with Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], are drawing attention. Commenting on the Hosokawa government, Mr. Watanabe points to its decision to scrap a plan for the national welfare tax and a delay in compiling the fiscal 1994 budget, and then definitely says: "The coalition government has no policies and is incompetent. Nothing can be done unless it is removed from power." In his book, Mr. Watanabe claims that the basic political belief will be shared by "politicians who seek public popularity" and "other politicians who attach importance to the public interest," and then says: "This book calls upon the politicians who attach importance to the public interest. I want to practice real politics by rallying forces who share my political belief and policies." Mr. Watanabe has written the book based on the result of a five-year study meeting that has been held by Koji Kakizawa and Bunmei Ibuki, members of the House of Representatives and bureaucrats. The two legislators will be named coauthors in the book. On policies, the book proposes to: 1) streamline or merge six government ministries and agencies by pushing for administrative reform; 2) introduce a federal system; 3) add 100 trillion yen to the 10-year basic plan for public investment and build a high-speed information network; 4) make Japan's vigorous international contributions by reviewing the five principles for Japan's participation in UN peacekeeping operations; and 5) shift to a single-seat constituency system. The book calls for a strong political leadership in Japan to deal with the post-Cold War economic and political situation. It shares many points with Ichiro Ozawa's book: Blueprint for Building a New Japan.
