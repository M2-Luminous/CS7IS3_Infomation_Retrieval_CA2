FBIS4-29257 "dreas116_d_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-116 Daily Report 16 Jun 1994 South Korea Foreign Ministry Views Approval Foreign Ministry Views Approval SK1606020894 Seoul YONHAP in English 0155 GMT 16 Jun 94 SK1606020894 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, June 16 (YONHAP) -- South Korea received the U.S.-drafted sanctions resolution on North Korea Wednesday and the president approved it, Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said Thursday. A unification and national security policy coordination meeting convened late Wednesday reviewed the draft received earlier in the day and agreed it was ready for United Nations consultations, he said. "The draft, if adopted as it is, will be very effective, exerting great pressure on North Korea," Han said at a press conference. "It appropriately reflects the position of South Korea." He predicted that it will take two to three weeks before the draft passes discussion within the Security Council and is finally adopted. Meanwhile, he left the door open for dialogue with Pyongyang, saying it all depends on North Korea's attitude in the coming days. "As we have said before, the purpose of the resolution is not sanctions themselves but to clear up the suspicion about North Korea's past nuclear activities and to secure nuclear transparency for the present," said Han. "Before or even after the resolution is adopted, the door remains open for dialogue if North Korea carries out its obligations under the nuclear safeguards accord and cooperates with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)," the foreign minister said. The draft gives the communist state a 30-day grace period to unconditionally comply with the nuclear safeguards agreement and to implement the inter-Korean accord on denuclearization. The U.S.-drafted resolution contains six points including a mandatory ban on weapons imports and exports, partial diplomatic sanctions, a ban on all flights except regular passenger services, and an embargo on any technological cooperation related to nuclear science. These are the first-phase sanctions, he said, with second-phase action to include freezing funds remitted to North Korea, Han said. The second-phase sanctions, including a freeze on all North Korean assets abroad, would be implemented immediately in the event of any negative behavior by Pyongyang such as withdrawing from the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT), he said. Asked about China's position on the draft, Han said it was probably given to Beijing late Wednesday and no reaction was yet forthcoming. He suggested that the next phase of sanctions could well include a ban on China's crude oil supplies to its neighbor and traditional ally North Korea, saying "a number of stringent actions can be included." "The resolution outlines clearly the conditions under which the sanctions will be abandoned before implementation and the conditions under which the sanctions will be stopped after implementation begins," Han explained. "Whether these conditions have been met sufficiently for the involved parties to engage in dialogue, the judgement of the IAEA is crucial," he said, suggesting that North Korea will have to negotiate with the U.N. nuclear agency to defuse the problem. The North announced earlier this week that it was quitting the IAEA in retaliation for the agency's own sanctions resolution on Pyongyang. The foreign minister did not go into detail about specific means of South Korean participation in the sanctions, although the first- phase U.N. measures include suspension of bilateral and multilateral development assistance. "If the sanctions go into effect, there will be much for us to do both bilaterally and multilaterally," said Han. He indicated negotiations have been held on what to do about inter-Korean trade activities at this point, saying "The government does have thoughts on this issue." "But the focus now is on U.N. measures. It would be improper to say what the thoughts are at this point," said Han.
