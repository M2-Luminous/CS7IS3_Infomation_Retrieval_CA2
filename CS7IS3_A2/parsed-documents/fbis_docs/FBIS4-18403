The multinational combat fighter, the Eurofighter 2000, is fighting on all fronts. So long as the high-tech plane, which is coveted by the military, did not manage to get off the ground, the project was criticized by both opponents and supporters. The latter targeted the billion-mark project because any delay makes the fighter more expensive and thus even more problematic in public. Hardly had the new bearer of hope completed its first flights over Manching in Bavaria, when the jet flew into even worse turbulence. For the opposition the first flight, which was two years late, was the starting signal to shoot the plane down. Just one day later Walter Kolbow, defense policy spokesman of the Social Democratic Party [SPD] Bundestag group, called for the attack. Surprised by the press release from Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) about the successful first flight, the German participant in the project declared stubbornly: An SPD-led Federal Government will do without a new fighter plane. "A plane that costs 100 million German marks [DM] apiece does not fit into the financial policy landscape." Furthermore, it has not yet been proven that a new combat fighter is needed in the first place. Suddenly the Free Democratic Party [FDP] Bundestag group also got a bellyache in view of the plane's steep climb into the white-blue [Bavarian] sky, after the FDP defense politicians had long remained silent about the Eurofighter; the party leaders were worried about relations in the coalition. FDP Defense Policy Spokesman Juergen Koppelin was the first to break cover and note critically that more partners should have been sought for the four-nation project (Germany, Britain, Italy, and Spain) to keep down costs. Koppelin also attacked the Defense Ministry. At the beginning of the week he complained it was outrageous that "at no time did the Defense Ministry know exactly what the new fighter would cost." The FDP politician is also angry about project partner Dasa: "Regarding the cost estimates, I get the feeling that we are being cheated by Dasa." Koppelin's suggestion for a solution: "We should have a group of neutral experts look into the costs." Such tones are nothing new for Dasa; the reaction is therefore rather calm. Spokesman Eckehart Rotter, responsible for aviation projects, said: "We do not participate in political discussions. The decisions about financing must be made by the Defense Ministry." The Ottobrunn headquarters has long adapted itself to political interference. Thus, the modern plane flew into heavy turbulence even during the stage of development, which almost caused it to crash. In the spring of 1992 Defense Minister Volker Ruehe (Christian Democratic Union), who at the time had just assumed office, cleared the way for the then Fighter 90 to be shot down. Industry cried out. Half a year later, however, the "slimmed down" version with the stylish name Eurofighter 2000 emerged. Dasa chief Juergen Schremmp pulled the thrift version "light fighter" out of his pocket. Money was saved regarding radar or the possibility of flying 10 targets simultaneously. Air Force jargon: The sports plane is coming. Volker Ruehe, still not exactly an ardent supporter of the new fighter, lost a few feathers, because he attracted the ire of his foreign colleagues, the fans of the fighter, and the armament lobbyists among his party colleagues. The metamorphosis of Fighter 90 to Eurofighter 2000 was incredible not only in the eyes of the opponents. Many deputies and experts think that the renaming is simply cheating. FDP security expert Koppelin: "This was and is pure deception." From the very beginning Dasa has been under pressure to succeed. With the successful first flight of the German prototype DA-01 last Sunday [27 March], the armament corporation made points -- just in time before the Bundestag elections in October. The Defense Ministry's decision about the acquisition of 140 planes is to be made in 1995. Before that, however, the question of overall costs for serial production must be clarified. This is not an easy undertaking in view of the threatening red pencil of Finance Minister Theo Waigel, who has demanded another DM1.25 billion in savings from the defense budget. Dasa provides information about the cost analysis in the same way as it pursues public relations work for the Eurofighter: bit by bit. Spokesman Rotter only reveals: "Our fly-away price is DM57.8 million." What he means is the purchase price of the "naked" fighter. Dasa does not like to talk about the additional costs for maintenance, armament, and personnel. Then -- according to security experts -- the new star in the sky will cost up to DM130 million.
