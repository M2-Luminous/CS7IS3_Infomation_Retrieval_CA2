During a 10 February television program, he said it was very important that the UN commanders on the spot be able, in agreement with UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali's representative, to decide quickly to request air support for their self-defense. In Parliament last week, Ter Beek labeled the possibility of requesting air support "an additional precaution for our ground forces." Organizations of draftees are concerned about the consequences the NATO ultimatum and the threat of air strikes could have for the Dutch military in Bosnia. They say that this threat involves a shift of tasks and powers, because the UN troops are no longer deployed exclusively for peacekeeping operations, but also for peacemaking operations. In Bosnia, there will soon be some 500 draftees out of a total of 2,000 troops. They volunteered for this mission. Ter Beek disagrees with the interest groups. The job of the Dutch military did not change after NATO's decision. The Dutch are deployed in Bosnia to carry out humanitarian tasks, and their assignment and rules of engagement are unchanged: Force can only be used in self-defense, and for defending the population of the "safe areas" of Zepa and Srebrenica when it is at risk. Should tension in the field rise as a result of the air strikes, ground forces can be concentrated in one place, so that they can defend themselves more efficiently.
