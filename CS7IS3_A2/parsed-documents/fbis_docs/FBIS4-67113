Many believe that it is unfair. How do you view that campaign? [Mashariqah] Some elements of the campaign the U.S. Administration launched against Syria were undoubtedly unfair. It sought to inflict harm on Syria and its policy through accusing it of failure to fight drugs. It also aimed to destroy Syrian-American relations and put pressure on Syria to dissuade it from taking the stance it is assuming on the peace process and its fixed principles. That campaign sought also to belittle the outcome of the Geneva summit meeting between Presidents al-Asad and Clinton and inhibit the impetus it gave to the peace process. The manifest fact is that Syria is making efforts in cooperation with the Lebanese authorities to fight poppy and other drug farming, particularly in the Lebanese area of al-Biqa'. Syria has issued many laws to fight drugs, including the infliction of the severest punishments on whoever farms, manufactures, or smuggles narcotics. Syria's drug-fighting efforts seemed very satisfying to the United Nations, as represented in the regional committee on fighting drugs, which selected Damascus as a venue for its 30th session. The committee's representative saw that Syria's drug-fighting efforts are worthy of praise. The goal of this campaign is to put pressure on Syria and force it to relinquish its solid stance and just issues, which were recognized by international legitimacy, that seek to establish a just and comprehensive peace in the region. But Syria's stance and its just claims cannot be the subject of oneupmanship. [Al-Sa'id] Can this campaign be viewed as a sign of pressure on Syria, particularly since it was launched just before Christopher's tour of the region? [Mashariqah] Putting Syria's name on the list of states that fail to fight drugs is merely extortion to drive it to accept Israeli conditions in the peace process. Syria always reiterates that it rejects extortion and will not tolerate oneupmanship when it comes to its basic issues. There is no way that Syria will relinquish its rights; it is determined to hold on to basic principles concerning Arab rights and claims. Pressure will only enhance Syria's insistence on these rights and on defending them. All methods and pressure will not succeed to force it off its course or make it back down on its approach to defend Arab rights and issues. [passage omitted]
