Trotting them all out also means telling the whole truth. Mostly, the value of a currency reflects the general situation, certainly if, what is more, interest rates are low internationally. Anyone who retains any doubts as to the durability of the strength of the Belgian franc, however, cannot deny the fact that our inflation is lower than that in Germany and the Netherlands, that our current balance of payments has a record surplus of 350 and 400 billion Belgian francs [BFr] in 1993 and 1994 respectively, that our level of unemployment, 10 percent, is lower than in the rest of Europe, and that the budget deficit is not 3.5 GNP points higher than the European average as calculated in 1988, but only 0.8 GNP points. That is a different way of describing our situation than the almost traditional "doomsday approach." Pessimism has been so predominant that a few months ago, when I said the recession was over, it seemed unbelievable. Over the last few weeks, however, the economic analysts have been upwardly revising their growth figures, so that even private forecasters are now talking about growth of 1.3 percent in 1994, as predicted, incidentally, by the European Commission. So the question is not whether Belgium still needs a plan for recovery. A shift toward recovery is already under way. Furthermore, in recent years, with the exception of 1993, the national economy has performed better than in the rest of Europe. It will yield an equivalent performance in 1994. Incidentally, if one compares 1982-1987 with 1988-1994, then it becomes evident that growth during the former period was slow, whereas growth during the latter period was somewhat faster. A more direct comparison with the Netherlands and Germany shows an average increase in GNP of 1.4 percent, compared with 1.5 percent for our neighbours, and 2.2 and 2.5 percent respectively during 1988-1994. If we only take data on the Flemish economy, then the difference between Belgium and the two countries already mentioned would be virtually indistinguishable. Edinburgh Economic recovery in other European countries too may partly be attributed to the European Union's recovery initiative that was launched at the Edinburgh summit and definitively sealed in Brussels in early December 1993. The Belgian presidency played a particularly important role in this context. Pointing out positive aspects does not mean to say that we deny the structural failings of our economy, in particular our not very labor-intensive economy and the high public debt. The liberal opposition says absolutely nothing about the labor-unfriendly character of our economy in its so-called recovery plan. Employment is not merely the result of higher economic growth or more investments. That is the reason the Global Plan so strongly emphasized reducing the social burdens for young people and for those with low qualifications. Moreover, that is why the real increase in incomes has been blocked for a three-year period. Nothing could be simpler than organizing recovery by increasing the deficit. That was the old Keynesian recipe, but that is something to fall back on when excessive hopes are placed on the so-called receipt effects of lowering taxes, even benefiting investments. For many years now, I have been hearing people clamor that certain tax breaks will generate more for the treasury than they cost. Things have never turned out that way. In order to avoid budgetary risks, in the Global Plan the government fully compensated the reduction of the social burdens. Moreover, supposing that some fiscal incentives are temporary, like the reduction in VAT [value-added tax] rates for construction and investment allowances proposed by the Flemish liberals, the only result will be to accelerate the speed with which certain investments are made, rather than achieve durable growth. For the construction sector, interest rates for mortgages have always proven far more important than any drop in VAT. Well, over the past few years it has been possible to bring interest rates down. For investments, profitability is a key determining factor, and it will increase as a result of wage restraint, among other things. Naturally, additional measures would be useful if the budgetary leeway permitted their implementation, but even then the effects should not be overestimated. Deduction at Source The federal government has reduced the tax deducted at source on dividends from capital increases (including for small- and medium-sized companies) from 25 to 13 percent. This is an important step in removing discrimination against risk capital. It binds the reduction to an economic activity and is therefore socially more acceptable than a simple reduction in the rate of tax deducted at source from 25 to 20 percent, which would mean that those with capital were the only ones whose income was improving while all other income groups were having to tighten their belts. The liberals claim that a reduction in company tax could be compensated by abolishing subsidies to companies. But the federal government no longer gives any allowances to private companies. This government is the first to privatize on a large scale. And yet the yields of privatization form just a small part of budgetary income. Of the BFr500 billion raised for 1994, only 11 percent is concerned. Like Germany, the Netherlands, and France, and like Belgium in 1987, the money raised is being used for the budget. In any case, the contribution of the private sector is essential if the present public enterprises are to withstand international pressures. In the case of a number of them, the government's majority position was simply given up. However, privatization here cannot be compared with what is happening in Latin American countries, as the VLD [Flemish Liberal Democrats] likes to do. Far less than 5 percent of the business stock is in public hands here. Little was ever nationalized and consequently we cannot privatize on a large scale. In any case, where is the time when the PVV [Party For Freedom and Progress] "nationalized" Cockerill-Sambre, not to mention the massive cut in working time (1983), the tax increase of BFr270 billion (in today's francs) due to the last three index jumps (1984-1987). But that sounds too polemical. Yet it is still correct. Personally, I am not against the possibility of more flexible wage formation, with a certain link to company results. In 1987, there was a draft bill about profit-sharing remuneration, but I do not expect any miracles from it. In addition, many workers work in the nonprofitmaking sector or for self-employed persons who know nothing of the concept of "company profits." The task of the federal government is not over. Constant vigilance is necessary over competitiveness, the budget, social security, and employment. A rising economic cycle will not be enough to gain fully satisfactory results. This task for the federal government will remain difficult, in a period when the general interest is not a self-evident idea.
