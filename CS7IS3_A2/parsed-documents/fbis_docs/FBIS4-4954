FBIS4-4954 "dreas066_d_94017" FBIS-EAS-94-066 Daily Report 6 Apr 1994 South Korea Security Policy Coordination Board Planned Security Policy Coordination Board Planned SK0604003294 Seoul THE KOREA TIMES in English 6 Apr 94 p 2 SK0604003294 Seoul THE KOREA TIMES English BFN [Text] Amid growing criticism of the confusing government policy on foreign affairs and national security, an interministry body on policy coordination in the area will be soon formed, a Chongwadae [presidential office] official said yesterday. The presidential office reached the conclusion there is a need for a coordinating body which will hold meetings on a regular basis as cacophonous views, especially on the North Korean nuclear issue, are being aired by ranking officials of the National Unification Board [NUB], the Foreign Ministry, the Agency for National Security Planning [NSP] and other security-related agencies, confusing the people. Chongwadae has conducted indepth studies on whether to strengthen the function of the presidential secretary for foreign affairs and national security or create a new policy coordinating council. The conclusion was that it preferred the formation of a coordinating body to the beefing up the role of the senior presidential aide. The policy coordinating body will be launched this week and meet every week to check and analyze the security situation on and around the Korean peninsula so as to tune the policy the government will pursue. A ranking Chongwadae official said yesterday, "We are studying whether the policy coordinating body will have the chiefs of government agencies dealing with foreign affairs and national security." He added, "The body will not be the same as the National Security Council of the United States in character. It will be only aimed at discussing and adjusting policies on diplomacy and national security." Currently, there are some similar conferences, including a meeting of security-related Cabinet members presided over by President Kim Yong-sam, a high-level strategy conference chaired by Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang and a unification-related Cabinet ministers' meeting presided over by Deputy Premier-National Unification Minister Yi Yong-tok. The Chongwadae official said, "Since the Chief Executive makes the final decisions on diplomatic and security policy, the coordinating body will act to assist the President." The body will consist of ministers of the NUB, Foreign Ministry, NSP director and ranking officials from the presidential office.
