"All the rest is indecent gambling. We have a large reserve of tolerance but it has its limits," he said. The Russian president's chief of staff, Sergey Filatov, told Interfax earlier that Russian-Chechen consultations involving representatives of the various political forces in the Chechen Republic would take place in Moscow. "Those called the Chechen opposition are criminals which settled in Moscow and are stirring up trouble to suit the interests of political profiteers. If Russia wants to negotiate with criminals, it is its own business," said Dudayev. At present there is no political force in Russia which would fully control the situation and bear responsibility for the decision-making, said Dudayev. As to Boris Yeltsin, who is, indeed, the last and the only stronghold of legality in Russia, he, regrettably, is virtually barred from effecting control over the development of the Russian-Chechen relationships, said Dudayev. That is why, he said, the Chechen government raises the question on the temporary moratorium for negotiations with Russia.
