The Czech Republic had clearly said several times that no arms were currently being supplied to Iran, Vondra said at a press conference upon his return to Prague from the trip on which he visited also Syria and Pakistan. For many years Iran had been one of the most trustworthy partners as regards payments, Vondra said, adding that only during the last half year had some problems appeared. It should, however, be noted that some minor problems had arisen due to the transformation of the Czech economy and partly also due to the inevitable change in Czech firms' behavior, Vondra said. There had been a considerable drop in oil prices recently and besides Iran had been handling the consequences of the war with Iraq. All this was leading Iran to adopt a new economic and budget policy which also concerned the Czech Republic as many Czech companies were developing busy trade contacts with Iran and participating in large investment projects there. Problems with payments for Czech activities had appeared recently, Vondra said. "These are things which the Czech private sector should be aware of and proceeding with utmost responsibility while entering the Iranian market, which is a large one with good prospects, " Vondra said. He said that the Iranian Government started to negotiate new payment relations with many countries at the beginning of this year. These problems would probably also be discussed at the May meeting of a Czech-Iranian joint commission established last autumn, Vondra said.
