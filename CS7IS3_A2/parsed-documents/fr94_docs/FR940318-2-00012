ADDRESSES: Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled, Crystal Square 3, suite 403, 1735 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, Virginia 22202&hyph;3461. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Beverly Milkman (703) 603&hyph;7740. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On December 17, 1993 and January 14, 1994, the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled published notices (58 FR 65970 and 59 FR 2360) of proposed additions to the Procurement List. After consideration of the material presented to it concerning capability of qualified nonprofit agencies to provide the commodities and service, fair market price, and impact of the additions on the current or most recent contractors, the Committee has determined that the commodities and service listed below are suitable for procurement by the Federal Government under 41 U.S.C. 46&hyph;48c and 41 CFR 51&hyph;2.4. I certify that the following action will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The major factors considered for this certification were: 1. The action will not result in any additional reporting, recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small entities other than the small organizations that will furnish the commodities and service to the Government. 2. The action does not appear to have a severe economic impact on current contractors for the commodities and service. 3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish the commodities and service to the Government. 4. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41 U.S.C. 46&hyph;48c) in connection with the commodities and service proposed for addition to the Procurement List. Accordingly, the following commodities and service are hereby added to the Procurement List: Commodities Cleaner, Water Soluble 7930&hyph;01&hyph;367&hyph;2959 7930&hyph;01&hyph;367&hyph;0989 7930&hyph;01&hyph;367&hyph;2968 7930&hyph;01&hyph;367&hyph;2970 7930&hyph;01&hyph;367&hyph;2964 7930&hyph;01&hyph;367&hyph;2907 7930&hyph;01&hyph;367&hyph;0988 6840&hyph;01&hyph;367&hyph;2913 7930&hyph;01&hyph;367&hyph;2909 6840&hyph;01&hyph;367&hyph;2912 7930&hyph;01&hyph;367&hyph;2967 7930&hyph;01&hyph;367&hyph;2961 7930&hyph;01&hyph;367&hyph;2962 7930&hyph;01&hyph;367&hyph;2963 7930&hyph;01&hyph;367&hyph;2910 7930&hyph;01&hyph;367&hyph;2908 6840&hyph;01&hyph;367&hyph;2914 7930&hyph;01&hyph;367&hyph;0987 7930&hyph;01&hyph;367&hyph;2966 7930&hyph;01&hyph;367&hyph;2965 Service Laundry Service McChord Air Force Base, Washington This action does not affect current contracts awarded prior to the effective date of this addition or options exercised under those contracts.
