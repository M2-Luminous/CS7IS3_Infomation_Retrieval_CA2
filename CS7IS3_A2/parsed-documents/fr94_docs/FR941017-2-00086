The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change 1. Purpose The purpose of the proposed rule change is to incorporate certain objective measures into the Exchange's SPEP. The evaluation program, using the BEACON system, 3 looks at all incoming orders routed to a specialist for execution. A record of all action on these orders is accumulated in a separate file, from which four calculations are run. 3 BEACON is the BSE's automated order-routing and execution system. BEACON provides a guarantee of execution for market and marketable limit orders up to and including 1,299 shares. In addition, BEACON can be used to transmit orders not subject to automatic execution. See BSE Rules, Ch. XXXIII. Sec. 5(a) and 7.
