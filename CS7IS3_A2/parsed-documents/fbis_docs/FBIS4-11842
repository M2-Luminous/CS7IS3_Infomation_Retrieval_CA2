In a statement it issued, the Council said that the panel of judges' choice of The Satanic Verses as an example of contemporary European literature is a shock that arouses feelings and shows a clear bias and vile prejudice on the part of the atheists and apostates. It appealed to the Austrian Government to reject the panel's choice. The Austrian Ministry of Education and Arts has proposed that the prize be not awarded publicly, while Arts Minister Rudolf Scholten refused to hand it over in secret and postponed the award ceremony.
