He was responding to a recent decision by the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP], which holds the majority in the legislature, to hold the sitting in Ulundi between June 28-30. Dr Sutcliffe said the interim constitution designated Pietermaritzburg as a provisional capital, and "under no circumstances are we going to Ulundi". He said it was "unconstitutional and unilateral" of the IFP to decide on Ulundi. Earlier this week, the three ANC MECs [members of the executive committee] boycotted an Executive Committee meeting in Ulundi, following calls by their organisation to refrain from acknowledging Ulundi. Dr Sutcliffe said the capital issue, and the ANC's full response to the IFP decision, would be discussed at an ANC caucus meeting on Friday. He said legislators should decide on the capital in an unemotional way, and consider what was in the best interests of the people and the province. Earlier the ANC warned of a constitutional crisis in the province if the capital issue was not resolved. The ANC said the province could not be governed effectively without "provincial unity".
