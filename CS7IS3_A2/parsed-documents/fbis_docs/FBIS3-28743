He told reporters that the Thai Government's consistent efforts to build economic cooperation with Vietnam and other neighboring countries was part of the impetus behind the U.S. private sector pressing their government to terminate the trade embargo. The deputy prime minister said that soon after it first assumed office, the government began promoting trade with Vietnam as if there was no U.S. trade embargo. The government has extended the Mekong River development program to cover six countries, and is considering inviting China to participate in the scheme. Vietnam and Thailand are in the process of establishing energy cooperation, and Thailand plans to buy natural gas from Vietnam. The government intends to open a Thai investment promotion office in Vietnam, and is encouraging Thai commercial banks to open branches there. The number of Thai commercial banks currently operating in Vietnam is second only to France. Officials are working on a plan to link the two countries' telecommunications networks and promote investment in Vietnam's tourism industry. Meanwhile, the Thai Government has also provided gratis financial assistance to Vietnam. Suphachai noted that the lifting of the U.S. trade embargo will help Thailand become the trade and investment center of the Indochinese region. Japan is using Thailand for that purpose. He said the private sector should realize the government cannot interfere in every matter. Its duty is merely to lay the foundation for them. He pointed out that the government only wants good investors to invest in foreign countries, not those who want to be brokers or middlemen and sell official permits to other investors.
