Nevertheless, since he clearly and explicitly is not in the mood to challenge the National Commission for Atomic Energy [CNEA], the energy secretary directly addresses the issue that actually worries him. Bastos says: "Here on my table I have a preliminary report by a consulting company, a survey that is not directly linked to CNEA because it just describes the state's function with regard to the nuclear power industry in those countries where the production of nuclear power is in private hands. There is also a report on the situation in the United Kingdom, a country that was unable to achieve nuclear privatization and whose experience we also are interested in learning." [LA PRENSA] But this is not all the "Group of Entrepreneurs" was asked to do ... [Bastos] This is a preliminary report. Afterward, there will be a summary on all the practical cases reviewed. With this material, the presidency of the nation (including presidential secretary Eduardo Bauza; President Menem; CNEA Chairman Manuel Mondino; and, probably, [Economy] Minister Domingo Cavallo, who will convey the Energy Secretariat's opinion) will decide if it would or would not be viable to open up the nuclear area for the participation of private capital. If it is indeed viable, a second step will be taken in which the consulting company would actually present some concrete privatization alternatives. [LA PRENSA] Why was CNEA not consulted on the decision to call this consulting company? [Bastos] Because we are not making decisions on CNEA. We are just trying to establish a basis, based on international experience, to determine which way to advance, if a decision is made on advancing. The nuclear issue is a field almost exclusively staked out by CNEA people. Not even all the nuclear scientists participate in it. Based on the survey requested, we just want to become acquainted with, to define what will happen with industrial security if the production of nuclear power is transferred to private hands; what will be done with the plants and nuclear waste when the nuclear power plants stop operating; and if the rates that will be approved for these companies will be regulated or will be established by market conditions. These are politico-economic issues that are independent from the way in which CNEA would be restructured. [LA PRENSA] The energy secretary said: "No one has a definite opinion on how CNEA will be restructured because no one knows how the entire industry will be restructured. For example, if the nuclear power plants are privatized, who will supply the fuel? Will foreign companies be allowed to supply it or will the participation be restricted to national companies? Will they be exclusive suppliers or will they have other deals? These are open questions." But if CNEA's future is raised again, it is because there is a definite opinion that things are not working the way they stand now. [Bastos] I am not saying that CNEA is operating well or poorly now. I am actually saying that there are general guidelines on streamlining the state. We, Minister Domingo Cavallo and I, have adhered to these guidelines with plenty of evidence. The state must be removed from entrepreneurial activities. The control of general interests in entrepreneurial activities alone must be left in the state's hands. [LA PRENSA] Is it a mistake, then, to claim that all nuclear activities must be in the state's hands? [Bastos] I don't know. I am not a specialized expert in this area. I actually know that our secretariat is responsible for the energy policy, in general. And we cannot stop voicing an opinion on the organization of the nuclear field that is involved in energy production. I do not want to get involved in an argument with Mondino or bring the CNEA under the Energy Secretariat's jurisdiction. I must insist, however, that we are entitled to voice an opinion on this issue. This industry obviously will be restructured. And it is important for the political power to hold the reins and decide on the nuclear area's role and the way it will be restructured. Maybe Mondino is unaware of the fact that the studies may recommend that it is not advantageous to privatize CNEA ... [LA PRENSA] Does the Energy Secretariat, then, believe that it is best to privatize CNEA? [Bastos] This is not the way in which the report requested from the consulting company should be understood. Maybe it has been misinterpreted because, for the time being, we do not intend to define the privatization of the power plants. We actually are trying to determine the role in this area that the state plays in other countries, the state's responsibility. At the moment, everything is in the hands of CNEA, a state organization that has superimposed activities and a single balance. The CNEA is a development and research center. And at the same time, it controls its own accounts and projects. It must be restructured. [LA PRENSA] Nevertheless, Mondino's proposal to transform CNEA into a corporation is precisely aimed at that ... What is your opinion? [Bastos] What I told Mondino is about a meeting that was also attended by Bauza. It is about a superficial change that does not propose basic issues such as how to integrate CNEA into the electric industry or security and the risks of a nuclear accident. The idea of separating the accounting was good but to do that there is no need for a decree; it can be done through an internal procedure. The project is up in the air. If he is asked what the state's role is, Mondino would say that CNEA is responsible for defining a policy for the industry. And this is not so. CNEA is not the state but an organization of the state. [LA PRENSA] Is there international capital interested in the nuclear industry? [Bastos] Practically all the international companies are interested in finishing the Atucha-2 nuclear plant. This is the business in which they are now interested. But some Spanish and Canadian companies have been asking about the eventual construction of a fourth nuclear plant. [LA PRENSA] What is the timetable for drawing up a plan for restructuring CNEA? [Bastos] The second report by the consulting firm will be ready before the end of this year; it is a synthesis of the experience abroad. With this information, we will begin to discuss the need to open up to private capital and in which areas to do it. I believe that by the middle of next year a decision already will have been made on the meaning and ways of restructuring proposed for CNEA. But this process, I insist, is not linked to an Energy Secretariat goal. It has to do with the state's reform.
