Military authorities agreed that the group has not achieved its goal because the armed services are made up of brave men who can bring up any issue. Both Defense Minister Antonio Cespedes and the military chiefs indicated that it has not yet been determined whether "Vivid Red" is a group or a single individual who has been issuing a series of pamphlets in an attempt to create unrest in the Armed Forces. Cespedes indicated that the Armed Forces cannot waste time trying to determine whether it is a group or an individual because they have more important things to do. The commander in chief of the Armed Forces, General Fernando Sanjines, said that this is not the first time that walls have been painted and pamphlets have been distributed in a bid to tarnish the military's image. "These sorts of actions by people who are trying to create unrest in the Armed Forces will not have the desired effect because military personnel do not accept the publication of anonymous messages," he added. He cautioned that if the people who are putting out the pamphlets are identified, they would be punished in accordance with the provisions of the Organic Law of the Armed Forces and the Code of Military Penal Procedure.
