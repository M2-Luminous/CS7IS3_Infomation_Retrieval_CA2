Take notice that on May 19, 1994, Colorado Interstate Gas Company (CIG), P.O. Box 1087, Colorado Springs, Colorado 80944, filed a prior notice request with the Commission in Docket No. CP94&hyph;556&hyph;000 pursuant to §§157.205 and 157.211 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (NGA) for authorization to construct and operate a two-inch delivery tap to provide interruptible service to Amoco Energy Trading Corporation (Amoco) under CIG's blanket certificates issued in Docket Nos. CP83&hyph;21&hyph;000 and CP86&hyph;589&hyph;000 pursuant to Section 7 of the NGA, all as more fully set forth in the request which is open to the public for inspection. CIG proposed to construct and operate a two-inch meter run and appurtenant facilities in Las Animas County, Colorado for the interruptible delivery of approximately 200 Mcf per day of start-up fuel gas to Amoco. CIG states that its FERC Gas Tariff does not prohibit the addition of the proposed delivery point. CIG also states that the proposed deliveries are within the certificated entitlements for the proposed delivery tap. Any person or the Commission's staff may, within 45 days after the Commission has issued this notice, file pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission's Procedural Rules (18 CFR 385.214) a motion to intervene or notice of intervention and pursuant to §157.205 of the Regulations under the NGA (18 CFR 157.205) a protest to the request. If no protest is filed within the allowed time, the proposed activity shall be deemed to be authorized effective the day after the time allowed for filing a protest. If a protest is filed and not withdrawn within 30 days after the time allowed for filing a protest, the instant request shall be treated as an application for authorization pursuant to Section 7 of the NGA.
