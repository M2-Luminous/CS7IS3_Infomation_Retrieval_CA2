The PNA minister, who asked not to be named, asserted that "there will be no official announcement of the government" that will run Palestinian economic and social activities in Jerusalem. According to the Palestinian source, the PNA "has stopped short of announcing the formation of the shadow government and announcing officially the creation of a special ministry for Jerusalem affairs in order not to embarrass the Israeli government or weaken its domestic political position." However, the recent Israeli statements on the future of Palestinian institutions in Jerusalem and the moves under way to pass legislation against these institutions "could prompt the Palestinian leadership to adopt steps to escalate the situation and prevent the Israeli government from changing the status quo of the city to weaken the Palestinian negotiating stance" before starting the final negotiations that will determine the fate of the city, as the Palestinian minister put it. The Palestinian official told QUDS PRESS the shadow government, which could be headed by Palestinian leader Yasir 'Arafat, will comprise several ministries, including "social affairs, housing, tourism and antiquities, education, sports and youth, health, and awqaf" in addition to any other ministries the PNA thinks are necessary to consolidate the Palestinian presence in the city. The official added that "the activities of these ministries will not be carried out in public unless the Israeli authorities adopt measures against Palestinian institutions in east Jerusalem." The Palestinian official further said the government's activities include renovating houses and supporting other activities that contribute to intensifying the Palestinian presence "to bolster the negotiating position" of the PNA. The official asserted that the PNA has decided to hold consultations with the Palestinian opposition forces in order to coordinate action to preserve the city of Jerusalem. The Palestinian minister added that "political views could be different but we are agreed on the need to maintain the Arab presence in Jerusalem." The source did not reveal when the consultations will begin which, he said, "might not be publicized in the beginning, taking into consideration the political position of the Palestinian forces."
