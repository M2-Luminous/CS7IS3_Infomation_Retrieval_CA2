This is a financial arrangement that combines the payment of debts with investments through the direct injection of fresh money, better known as the swap [preceding word in English] sytem. This system is being applied to three investment projects in priority sectors in Cuba: tourism, cement, and petroleum, as reported by the Mexican press. Concerning tourism and cement, the contracts have already been signed and are already operating. Approximately $50 million of the Cuban debt to Mexico was paid through this contract. It has to do with the Tuzpan Hotel in Varadero, where 50 percent of the shares were purchased through this channel by the DSC group from Guadalajara. The other is the Mariel Cement Plant, the operator and trader of which is the Mexican cement company, Cemex. The Petroleum agreement will be signed in May, and according to the magazine PROCESO, a letter of intent was already signed between Mexpetrol [Mexican Petroleum Company] -- the principal shareholder of which is the parastate company, Mexican Petroleum -- and (Cubec), the Cuban distributor of crude oil. This represents a joint investment of $200 million, to modernize and expand the refinery in Cienfuegos, the largest in our country. Cuba owes $310 million to Mexico. Through this procedure, the Cuban Government will pay another $50 million and will guarantee investment. Mexico is the first country with which agreements of this type have been signed, which, according to local analysts, accords Mexico the status of a nation favored by the Cuban Government.
