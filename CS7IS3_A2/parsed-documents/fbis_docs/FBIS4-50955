The committee's establishment will facilitate the improvement of the quality and reputation of environmentally labeled products, the development of domestic and foreign markets for such products, and the promotion of coordinated environmental and economic development. Environmental labels, also known as ecological or green labels, are a kind of corroborative trademark which indicates that the products in question meet specific demands for environmental protection during the entire process, from the development and exploitation of raw and semifinished materials to production, utilization, and recovery or scrapping; that they pose no harm to the ecology or cause little pollution; and that they facilitate the regeneration and recovery of relevant resources. At present, more than 20 countries or regions in the world have adopted these labels or are drawing up plans for adopting them. A leading environmental problem currently facing China is the serious wastage of resources and outmoded production technology. In light of its own national conditions and drawing on the experiences of foreign countries, China will first provide environmental label authentication services for environmentally harmful products which can be rendered significantly less noxious. Chief among them are products with low levels of toxicity and harm, energy- and water-saving products, products with low emissions, and recoverable, low-noise, and biodegradable products. Our country has prescribed and unveiled its first set of technological requirements for six environmentally labeled products. They apply to household refrigerators with low levels of chlorofluorocarbon [CFC], CFC-free aerosols (hair sprays and mousse), water-based paints, unleaded gasoline, recycled toilet paper, and silk products. The China Committee for Authenticating Environmentally Labeled Products, which was established by the State Environmental Protection Bureau with the authorization of the State Technology Supervision Bureau, is the only third-party authentication agency which verifies various environmentally labeled products on behalf of the state. The committee, which is composed of specialists from environmental protection departments, economic management departments, scientific research institutes and academies, quality inspection departments, and relevant mass organizations, is headed by Xie Zhenhua, director of the State Environmental Protection Bureau. The design of the Chinese environmental label consists of green hills, blue water, the sun, and 10 rings, signifying that "all people have joined forces to protect the environment on which mankind depends for survival."
