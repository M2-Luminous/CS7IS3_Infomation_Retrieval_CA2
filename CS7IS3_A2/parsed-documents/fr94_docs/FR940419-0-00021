FR940419-0-00021 FR940419-0-00007 Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing 24 CFR Part 941 [Docket No. R&hyph;94&hyph;1711; FR&hyph;3591&hyph;F&hyph;01] RIN 2577&hyph;AB39 PHA Acquisition of Single Family HUD/VA/RTC Properties AGENCY: Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, HUD. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This rule revises existing regulations to expedite public housing agency (PHA) acquisition of single family properties (with or without rehabilitation) that are secured by an FHA-insured or HUD-held mortgage or owned by HUD, VA, or RTC by eliminating the requirements for approval by the Assistant Secretary and allowing Field Offices to exercise more discretion in determining the nature and scope of required technical reviews. EFFECTIVE DATE: May 19, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Janice Rattley, Director, Office of Construction, Rehabilitation and Maintenance, Office of Public and Indian Housing, room 4138, 451 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20410, Telephone (202) 708&hyph;1800. A telecommunications device for speech and/or hearing impaired persons (TDD) is available at (202) 708&hyph;0850. (These are not toll-free telephone numbers.) SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The current regulation for public housing development provides, in part, at 24 CFR 941.206(c), that PHA acquisition of properties (with or without rehabilitation) that are secured by an FHA-insured or HUD-held mortgage or are owned by HUD may not be approved, except with the prior written approval of the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing. This rule amends ยง941.206(c) by removing the requirement for prior approval by the Assistant Secretary and by adding properties owned by the Veterans Administration (VA) or the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) as eligible for acquisition under this section. This rule also streamlines the procedure for acquiring such properties by expanding the limited proposal procedure for scattered-site projects to permit the PHA purchase of HUD/VA/RTC properties, any combination of such, and/or in combination with the purchase of eligible properties on the open market. The limited proposal procedure would be the same for any single family acquisition regardless of its ownership. This rule permits Field Offices to exercise more discretion in determining the nature and scope of required reviews. In order to enable a Field Office to have the ability to limit its reviews and expedite processing, the PHA is required to certify, either as part of its limited proposal or at the time the PHA identifies a property it wants to acquire and provides the proposed sales contract, that compliance with all necessary applicable requirements will be met: e.g., (1) Prevailing wages; (2) Nondiscrimination requirements; (3) Site and neighborhood standards; (4) Intergovernmental review; (5) Accessibility requirements; (6) Relocation requirements; (7) Minimum Property Standards (MPS) or Housing Quality Standards (HQS); (8) If replacement housing under section 18 is involved, that the housing to be acquired is consistent with the replacement housing plan approved by HUD; (9) Generally, properties constructed prior to 1978 should not be considered; however, if a proposed property was built prior to 1978, that lead-based paint testing and the determination of the cost feasibility of abatement will be done before the transfer of title to and payment of funds by the PHA or the contract is null and void; and (10) Any other Federal requirements listed under 24 CFR 941.202 through 941.209. These PHA certifications do not provide a basis for waiving or dispensing with the applicability of the aforementioned requirements, environmental assessments and other Federal requirements listed under 24 CFR 941.202 through 941.209.
