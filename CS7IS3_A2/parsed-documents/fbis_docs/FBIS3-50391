Upon his return from the airport, Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic, who led our delegation, stated the following about the content and results of today's talks. Here is a report by Senada Cumurovic: [Begin recording] [Cumurovic] Head of the ICRC [International Committee of the Red Cross] for former Yugoslavia Andre Collomb also attended the talks today. What was the reason? [Silajdzic] Collomb was there to point at the serious situation and express deep concern felt by the Red Cross due to the deterioration of the situation. Their concern is justified. We, of course, accepted that as it was. On the other hand, he [words indistinct] to initiate the process of POW exchanges. In brief, we agreed that what was possible to do in the humanitarian sphere should be done, what is impossible to do now should be left for later. [words indistinct] We shall try to speed up work on that as every day is important for these people. This is as regards Mr. Collomb's participation. After that we had bilateral talks. Of course, as regards the humanitarian situation, we first had talks on convoys in general, and then on a particular convoy which has been waiting in Zenica for a long time to pass through to Maglaj. If you can recall those two parallel convoys from Croatia which [Croatian Foreign Minister] Granic and myself agreed for Nova Bila and Maglaj. A part of the convoy is still waiting in Zenica to pass through; today we learned that the Serb side would not make problems for the passage of the convoy through the Serb-held territory. Of course, we have to obtain consent of the Croat side. We need not stress the importance of it. I think that the situation in Maglaj and Tesanj is dramatic. In addition to convoys, we shall try to parachute the aid there. [Cumurovic] The impression of our delegation members who took part in the talks is that the political negotiations were held in a more favorable atmosphere. Why do that feel that way? [Silajdzic] Simply because there was readiness to view all options equally. Certain specific agreements have been reached, and when concrete agreements are present the situation is always easier and it is possible to discuss everything in a different way. I will say it straight away. It was agreed to form a joint commission to go to Gorazde in order to spread the atmosphere concerning measures for building confidence; in Gorazde, Foca, and Cajnice. [We discussed] especially the supplies of water and electricity, therefore, the repair of power lines and, of course, the most difficult topic is always the exchange of prisoners (?on that side). The second topic which we seriously discussed are the possibilities of improving the communications between Sarajevo and other areas via Visoko or Hadzici. We held talks in principle, but they were held in an atmosphere which could lead to an agreement on improving communications links, on leaving and entering Sarajevo, the return to (?northern and) southern parts of the republic.
