The list has been submitted to the State Council for final approval. However, authoritative sources say not all are certain to go forward. The 22 have been strictly selected by the State Council's Securities Policy Committee, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), the State Economic and Trade Commission and the State Planning Commission, said CSRC Chairman Liu Hongru. And he said the list was weighted toward enterprises in energy, transport, telecommunications, raw materials and some key technical renovation projects. They were large industrial firms which have performed strongly in the past and continue to have great potential. The majority of them would apply to be listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange, Liu said, adding that some will arrange listings on other international exchanges such as New York. In 1993, the first nine Chinese enterprises were selected to list their shares in Hong Kong. Six of them had issued and listed 4.08 billion H shares by the end of last years pooling HK$8.49 billion [Hong Kong dollars] ($1.08 billion). And their performance since has been as good as some blue chip firms. The remaining three are expected to make their debut in the first half of 1994. To ensure the overseas listing develops smoothly, Liu urged the 22 firms to pay great attention to their transformation into standardized shareholding companies. He called on the firms to carefully appraise their assets and finance audits. Their staffs should be familiar with international accounting standards and laws. And he asked firms to carefully select their intermediaries, including accountants, law firms and assets appraisers. It was also crucial to select good underwriters, he said. Liu urged the firms to grasp the chance to enter the Hong Kong market early, as it is currently bullish. He said more foreign capital will continue to flow into the market as prices rise. The List of Candidates The 22 companies are: Wuhan Iron and Steel Works, Dongfeng Automobile, Tianjin Steel Tube, Qingling Automobile, Northeast China Electricity Transmission and Substation Equipment, Harbin Power Station Equipment, Jingwei Textile Machinery Plant, Huaneng International Power, Shandong Huaneng Power, Datang Power Plant, Shandong International Power Source Development, China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines, Foshan Ceramics, Guangzhou- Shenzhen Railways. Shanghai Haixing Shipping, Jilin Petrochemical, Luoyang Glass, Nanjing Panda Electronics, Chengdu Cable, Zhenhai Petrochemical and Xian Aircraft Manufacturing (International).
