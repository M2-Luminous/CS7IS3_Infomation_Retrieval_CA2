Hosokawa's planned reshuffle is expected to center on removing Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura from his post. The premier is likely to offer Takemura another ministerial post, the sources said. The prime minister aims to change a number of ministers in his 20-member cabinet in order to tackle economic and administrative reform, they said. Hosokawa formed his first cabinet in August to carry out political reforms, and he apparently thinks the cabinet will have accomplished its purpose when amendments to the political reform legislation are approved by the Diet on Thursday or Friday, the sources said. The legislation was enacted in January. Hosokawa on Tuesday will begin hearing opinions of ruling party leaders on his reshuffle plan and he wants to complete the shake-up before he delivers his policy speech to the Diet probably on Friday, they said. The seven ruling parties have split over Hosokawa's reshuffle plan, with the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ], the Democratic Socialist Party and Takemura's Sakigake [Harbinger] opposed to dumping Takemura, while Shinseito [Japan Renewal party] and Komeito [Clean Government Party] supporting the plan. Since the close of last year, Hosokawa and Takemura have differed on several important political issues, first on the partial opening of Japan's rice market, then on the handling of political reform bills, and on the imposition of a 7 percent "national welfare tax" in place of the 3 percent consumption tax, the sources said. Hosokawa is also likely to abolish the post of state minister in charge of political reform, now held by the SDPJ's Sadao Yamahana, but is considering installing new state ministers in charge of decentralization of power, deregulation, and external economy, they said. The premier wants to retain Justice Minister Akira Mikazuki because the Tokyo district public prosecutors office has been investigating a series of bribery scandals involving construction companies and politicians, the sources said. Hosokawa will allocate almost the same share of ministerial posts to the various coalition parties as they hold in the present cabinet, they said. On Friday, the cabinet will submit to the Diet the 73.08 trillion yen budget for fiscal 1994. Hosokawa and three cabinet ministers are expected to give policy speeches to both houses of the legislature the same day.
