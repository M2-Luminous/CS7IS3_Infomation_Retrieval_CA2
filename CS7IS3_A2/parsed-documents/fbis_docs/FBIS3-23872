The crux of the matter is in that difference which commentators for some reason prefer to omit in their presentations: In most cases, the "revanchists" will not be representing either the party of Zyuganov, or the party of Zhirinovskiy, no matter how one extrapolates the December breakdown of sympathies of the population onto the future voting. Nevertheless, if we recall the past, the December figures are sooner reflected in the regional elections not by the votes for one or another party list, but by the results of the race for seats in the Federation Council. This race, as we know, was triumphantly won by the local leadership. The current pre-electoral landscape is unusually monotypic throughout all of Russia: The "party of the communists" and the "party of the democrats" are trying either to agree or to oppose the "party of the administration." The henchmen of the former--either leaders or businessmen surrounding the leaders--are not difficult to recognize even in that amorphous bunch of candidates which is today gathering signatures for registration. (We might add that rarely are there less than about 20 aspirants for one mandate. Usually there are more). We need not explain that they have all the advantages in gathering signatures as well as in the pre-electoral propaganda. Moreover, as the recent letter from "DemRossiya" to Boris Yeltsin states, "at each new election, there are more and more falsifications." Specific party structures, hastily outfitted for the past all-people's expression of will, will not help either the LDPR [Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia] or "DemRossiya." As for the former, according to the astute expression of the ex-head of the Krasnoyarsk Kray Soviet, Vyacheslav Novikov, "everyone who is relatively healthy has already been elected to the State Duma." And as for the units of the latter, as the "Demoross" activists themselves admit, "the farther we go, the less we are capable of." The PRES [Party of Russian Unity and Accord] may expect a certain success for one reason: Where this party exists, it is firmly rooted in the "party of the administration." "Choice of Russia" cannot expect such a fate in most cases. From the moment of Yegor Gaydar's dismissal from the office of vice prime minister, the loyal sentiments of the governors do not extend to him. The winners in the local elections will be those who have been fated to be victorious in them. In the Fall, Boris Yeltsin increased their chances even more by farming out the organization of the local elections to the provincial administrators. It is interesting how, in his opinion, they intend to exercise these rights. However, the most important thing in this entire matter is the fact that the described "revenge of the party active membership" will not radically change anything in the current situation. The local dumas in their present variant will become amusing appendages of the administration not only because of their personnel make-up, but simply because of their construction. Moreover, their powers and authorities are rather notably truncated. Not in one of the new parliaments will there be more than two-fifths of the deputy corps working on a permanent basis. That is only about 10 people. We may expect that the goals of the dumas are already clear, and the tasks have been defined. Their decisions will give "representative weight" to the intentions and actions of the administration. The parties will not be able to influence even one of the parliaments, but the clans will dictate their will to all--just as the clans of agrarians, defense men or, say, raw materials exporters today dictate their will to the administrations. As for the effectiveness of their pressure on the government--it is defined not by the make-up of the re-elected Soviets, but by the readiness of the government to submit to this pressure. This constitutes the most important and inevitable result of the new elections. The nomenclature past of the new deputies, perhaps, hinders them in the eyes of the politicized public. However, it is not the former ideological (or career) obligations which define the consciousness, but only the present day subsidy-oriented (or, on the contrary, export-profit) existence. By the way, those who are generally considered to be reformers also were not members of the White Guard in their lives before perestroyka. The above-described "red revenge" merely reproduces the current state of affairs in the country. If we assume that everything is not yet lost for reform in Russia, then this revenge is not deadly. If we believe that everything is over--then everything was over even before the local elections. If the efforts of the Kremlin to re-schedule the elections are evoked by a desire to avoid these results, they are in vain. One way or the other, no matter how long they are postponed, the die comes up a winner for the "revanchists," because this die has only one side.
