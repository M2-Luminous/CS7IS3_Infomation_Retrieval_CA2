Parading self-assurance, Ioan Stoica says that work is going on "on the overall accounts of the scheme," which, once completed, will allow him to give "details on the normal way of shutting it down in all localities where the company has subsidiaries." Without being overly explicit about the way how he will pay back the investors' money, Ioan Stoica says in his letter: "I promise I will do everything in my power to close this scheme in such a way as to satisfy every person." The Caritas owner blames the failure of the scheme on the press, terming it "that important force that has savagely hit the Caritas." Caritas was started more than two years ago, in Brasov, as a limited commercial company, including in its activities also the pyramid money-spinning scheme which Stoica calls "financial mutual-aid circuit for charity purposes." Briefly, the scheme functioned like this: Intensely advertised, Caritas promised investors they would be able to collect eightfold the initial deposit after three months. Cluj-Napoca was the city where Caritas took on unsuspected proportions soon. The well advertised success of the first months turned the Caritas into a genuine social phenomenon. Chain-letter schemes of the kind mushroomed soon all over the country, with unscrupulous "enterprisers" cheating an impressive number of investors. Sooner or later, all ended up in courts of law. The longest-lived has been precisely the one that started this wide-scale scheme: Caritas. After being forbidden by court decision to open a subsidiary in Bucharest, the scheme became undesirable in almost all counties of Romania. The catastrophic failure of the money-spinning schemes, finally disclosed as a tremendous nation-wide fraud, also induced a concrete parliamentary reaction: the promotion of a bill to ban them. The Caritas also fuelled fierce political duels between the Romanian National Unity Party leader Gheorghe Funar and the Democratic Party/National Salvation Front leader Petre Roman, each blaming the other for having backed Ioan Stoica's "initiative." The press assesses that the Caritas' victims count some four million. It is hard to predict how this big scandal will end.
