According to several concerned people, those who attended the birthday celebration were Masako Goto, first secretary to lower house Speaker Takako Doi; SDPJ Chairman Murayama; former SDPJ Chairman Tanabe; Koken Nosaka, chairman of the SDPJ Diet Policy Committee; Akihiro Ohata; Kenji Taguchi; Yuzuru Shimazaki; Ichiro Hino; Issei Inoue; Tatsukuni Komori; Hajime Fukata; Tatsuo Yoshida; Eiko Mieno; Hisato Kishimoto; Atsushi Kameyama; Yutaka Shitoma; and Sumiko Shimizu. Reportedly, Goto attended on behalf of Doi because she had an appointment with a top foreign leader. About 300 senior executives of the major mass media--except for SANKEI SHIMBUN--attended the celebration. It is said that after a speech by the organizer, the attendants increased exchanges [koryu o fukameta] while standing around the food tables. President Kim Il-song's birthday celebration is an annual event held prior to the actual day of his birth; many SDPJ lawmakers attended. However, it seems likely the UNSC will adopt a resolution designed to impose economic sanctions against North Korea over North Korea's suspected nuclear arms development. Therefore, the U.S. Government is pressing Japan to cooperate in imposing sanctions. Moreover, the international community is criticizing Japan regarding the issue of remitting money to North Korea, saying it deviates from the trend of the international situation. Meanwhile, North Korean issues are becoming a focal point at the ruling coalition parties' policy meetings for the formation of a post-Hosokawa administration. Therefore, it is expected that having many SDPJ lawmakers attend the celebration will create a stir in the future.
