The answer remains silence. After 15 days away, Peace and Reconciliation Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis has returned to Chiapas. Chiapas Governor Javier Lopez Moreno seems worried because the situation is worsening with regard to the governability of the state. Juan Carlos Santoyo has this to report. [Begin recording] [Santoyo] It was a very important meeting, called to evaluate state governmental actions, to strengthen peace negotiations. What is the meaning of this meeting? Manuel Camacho Solis readdressed the Chiapas issue, especially its peace process, for the first time after 23 years, I mean, after 15 days. The first person to speak at the meeting was the Chiapas attorney general; the Chiapas Supreme Court of Justice president and the Chiapas Congress president also spoke. The three Chiapas Government officials pointed out that the main thing to do is to reform the Constitution, as well as state laws ranging from labor to agricultural justice. They also talked about the creation of an Indian Rights Ombudsman's Office. All these issues combined will make the Javier Lopez Moreno government submit more than 13 draft bills to the state congress. These drafts will probably be made public on 12 April. The meeting laid down the guidelines for the governor to air a panorama that, as you already mentioned, is very difficult for Chiapas. Lopez Moreno said: We are experiencing a crisis; better yet, the crisis already experienced us. This crisis can belittle or change us should we behave as we usually do; that is, should we behave as though nothing happened. Governor Lopez added: What we are currently facing is not the exception to what usually happens. The state government is reacting according to nonconformities, because we cannot halt legitimate rebelliousness, or at least, we cannot constrain social energy. Agricultural laws are about to be modified to improve the daily life of Chiapas residents. Searching for peace must mean that all Chiapas social sectors have to truly work hard. He said something very important: In view of what the EZLN [Zapatista National Liberation Front] did, it is imperative to humanize power in Chiapas. This will constitute a great lesson for all federal government and presidential candidates. Governor Lopez concluded that humanizing power means accepting that power must be shared and that people must be patiently listened to, especially those who complain and stage protests. However, for Javier Lopez Moreno, the important aspect of the meeting was the message he delivered to the peace commissioner: [Lopez] Mr. Manuel Camacho Solis: We are ready; we are already moving forward, and so are the commitments. This is how we are heeding social complaints to embark on an authentic agrarian justice, on flesh and bone human rights, on effective law enforcement, and on holding honest elections. These are democratic commitments that will lead us to reach genuine peace. We Chiapas residents will continue to comply with such commitments. Now, it is your turn. We ask you to resume negotiations with the EZLN as soon as possible; we ask Bishop Samuel Ruiz to resume his great efforts. The truce is good, but peace is urgently needed. Uncertainty and unfounded reports have saturated our atmosphere since the aberrant murder of Luis Donaldo Colosio; only peace will end ambiguity. No Chiapas resident wants hostilities to return. Reinstating war would be even worse, because we will lose everything, including our future, should weapons replace understanding. We refuse to accept the silence of rifles; we want them to disappear for good. This is why we are struggling for justice to reemerge. We have no time to waste. No one must lose the war; we all must win peace. Commissioner Camacho, you have the last word; it is your turn. [end recording]
