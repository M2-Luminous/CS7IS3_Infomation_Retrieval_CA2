ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: On February 2, 1994, EPA received an application from Northrup King Company for an Experimental Use Permit (EUP) for a transgenic plant pesticide. This is the fifth EUP application under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act for testing with a pesticidal substance that is produced in a plant. The Agency has determined that this application may be of regional and national significance. Therefore in accordance with 40 CFR 172.11(a), the Agency is soliciting public comments on this application. DATES: Written comments must be received by May 13, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments, in triplicate, should bear the docket control number OPP&hyph;50778 and be submitted to: Public Response and Program Resources Branch, Field Operations Division (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. In person bring comments to: Rm. 1128, Crystal Mall #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA 22202. Information submitted in any comment concerning this notice may be claimed confidential by marking any part or all of that information as ``Confidential Business Information'' (CBI).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On February 2, 1994, EPA received an application for an EUP from Northrup King Company, 7500 Olson Memorial Highway, Golden Valley, MN 55427. The application was assigned EPA File Symbol 67979&hyph;EUP&hyph;R. Northrup King proposes to test a d -endotoxin (expressed from a modified gene of the soil microbe Bacillus thuringiensis subspecies kurstaki ) as expressed in a series of corn lines from April 15, 1994 to May 1, 1995. Corn grown under this permit will not be permitted to enter commerce, therefore no petition for a temporary tolerance was submitted in conjunction with this EUP. Several small-scale field experiments have been conducted under permits granted by the United States Department of Agriculture. Further testing is now required in order to further assess the commercial potential of the transgenic corn. Specific testing proposed under this application include plantings in yield trials, efficacy trials, breeding nurseries, and production nurseries. A maximum of 45 acres are proposed for planting. The planted seed will contain approximately 0.013 grams of the d -endotoxin. Included in the program are the states of Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, and Wisconsin and the commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Upon review of the Northrup King application, any comments received in response to this notice, and any other relevant information, EPA will set conditions under which the experiments will be conducted. Any issuance of an EUP will be announced in the Federal Register . Dated: April 6, 1994. Stephen L. Johnson, Acting Director, Registration Division, Office of Pesticide Programs.
