The agreements, according to observers here, are expected to be sealed in the areas of insurance and government procurement, including telecommunications and medical equipment, in as soon as a month. Although they will do little to reverse the increasing U.S. wealth flow to Japan, the agreements will surely be greeted with relief by the group of seven leaders at their July meeting in Naples, Italy. This is despite the fact that no progress has been seen in the areas of auto and auto parts, which represent two thirds of the U.S. trade deficit with Japan, totaling 60 billion U.S. dollars last year. U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor and Undersecretary of Commerce Jeffrey Garten, speaking on Monday [6 June] respectively in Paris and Tokyo, stressed that Washington was ready for "realistic" trade agreements with Tokyo. The U.S.-Japan trade framework talks, which began in July, collapsed on February 11, when President Clinton, in his meeting with then Japanese Prime Minister Hosokawa, refused to accept partial agreements. At that time, sources said, agreements on insurance and telecommunications and medical equipment were already within reach, despite the stalemate in auto and auto parts. Soon after the failure, to the dismay of the recovering U.S. economy, came turmoil in the U.S. currency and bond markets, with the rise of U.S. dollar against Japanese yen and the climbing of interest rates. In Japan, support for the government's refusal to back up and to say "no" to Washington, for the first time in history as some reports said, remained strong among the Japanese public and in business circles. To the other parts of Asia and the European Union, which have their own trade disputes with the U.S., Washington's tough stand with Japan has been viewed negatively. Inside the beltway, some of the Clinton advisers stressed that the country should not let its trade disputes dominate its economic relations with Japan, viewed as Washington's most important tie in the post-Cold War era. Instead, they said, Washington should try its utmost to make Japan cut taxes and stimulate domestic consumption, and therefore increase general imports. In a compromise with Japan late May, Washington gave up its insistence on using "numerical targets" to measure Japan's market opening progress, and stressed that it never intended to control trade. "We are not going to wait to open up everything until we make deals in all sectors," Mickey Kantor told reporters on Monday. "If you are ready to reach agreement on a particular sector, you should go ahead and finalize that." In Tokyo, Undersecretary of Commerce Jeffrey Garten, speaking to reporters, cited "considerable hope" in the talks in the areas of telecommunications, saying that solid progress has been made over the weekend.
