Such enterprises founded after 1 January this year will no longer be entitled to the three-year tax exemption. Zhang Jiashou [4545 1367 1108], deputy head of the foreign affairs department of Shenzhen City Tax Bureau, pointed out at an exclusive interview with this reporter yesterday that in the past, the SEZ exempted enterprises engaged in three forms of import processing and compensation trade from business tax on their processing fees for three years. With the introduction of the new tax regime this year, this preferential policy has been canceled. Though it remains valid for factories that were previously eligible for this tax remission treatment, similar enterprises founded this year will no longer be entitled to the same treatment. He pointed out: This new measure has no impact on solely foreign-funded enterprises from Hong Kong and Taiwan, joint ventures, and cooperative enterprises. Because the recipients of processing fees are usually mainland factories, basically, this new measure is not expected to dampen the investment interest of Hong Kong and Taiwan manufacturers to any noticeable extent. He explained that Hong Kong and Taiwan manufacturers normally transport raw materials to the mainland for processing. The consigned processor may be a mainland factory. Once the products are finished, they will be handed over to the Hong Kong or Taiwan manufacturer for export. In such an operation, the taxpayer should be the mainland factory, not the Hong Kong or Taiwan manufacturer. He said: "Whoever is consigned processing, and receives processing fees for it, must pay business taxes. The rate of the processing fee is up to the manufacturers to decide and has nothing to do with the tax bureau." He emphasized: If, because of the implementation of the new measure, an enterprise engaged in three forms of processing and compensation trade attempts to understate processing fees, it will be considered a tax evader once discovered and will be called to account. This new measure may increase the tax burden on mainland factories and, in turn, may have an impact on the Hong Kong and Taiwan manufacturers to some degree. This policy can be seen as a sign that enterprises engaged in three forms of processing and compensation trade are no longer welcomed by the SEZ.
