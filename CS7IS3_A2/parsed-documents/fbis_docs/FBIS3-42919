The situation in Dagestan, however, has reached a critical point. This is attested to by the nature of the discussion of 18 January in the Republic of Dagestan Council of Ministers and by the resolutions that were passed there. The discussion topic was listed on the agenda as "Unregulated Migration Processes in the Republic of Dagestan." Chief Ilyasov of the personnel administration, who also heads a special commission on migration, reported that the number of Russians leaving the republic is increasing and said that around 4,000 Russians had moved permanently out of Dagestan in 1993. According to the 1989 census there were around 166,000 Russians in the Republic of Dagestan (approximately 9.2 percent of the republic population of 1.8 million, but in the middle of 1993 the figure was just over 7 percent). In recent years the process has acquired the characteristics of a virtual avalanche. As Ilyasov reported, a sociological survey indicated that the main reasons for Russian emigration were the socioeconomic instability, the rising crime rate, and the inter-ethnic friction. The speaker also mentioned other reasons: unemployment (4.9 percent at the end of 1993 in comparison with the republic average of 0.9 percent) and the failure of wages to keep up with the minimum subsistence level. According to Ilyasov, however, the main reason is the exertion of unlawful pressure on the Russian population. Representatives of law enforcement agencies reported that three criminal groups in Makhachkala had divided up the city's neighborhoods and were engaging in explicit acts of terrorism. There are reports of 102 families that were given 10 days to leave Makhachkala. Their documents were taken away from them, and the property owners among them were forced at gunpoint to sign sale authorizations. The republic Ministry of Internal Affairs received 21 official complaints, but 40 incidents were actually recorded. Twenty of these reports were substantiated, but only one case was turned over to the courts. Chairman Ramazanov of the Standing Commission on Interethnic Relations of the republic Supreme Council said that the roots of the problem include the erroneous policy of resettling highlanders in the flatlands, which began back in the 1950s. In a final settlement, Chairman Mirzabekov of the republic Council of Ministers reminded the gathering that the existence of the "Russian problem" had been acknowledged by the republic leadership, and this means that all government agencies should be taking measures to deter Russian emigration. He said he had set up a coordinating council for the Kizlyar zone, that the possibility of special status for the zone was being considered, and that funds were being allocated for the socioeconomic development of these regions. He said it was outrageous that government agencies were responding to the complaints of forcibly evicted citizens by advising them to take the matter to court. He reminded the gathering that no member of a native ethnic group in Dagestan had complained of eviction from a Russian city on ethnic grounds. According to Chief Palamarchuk of the Kizlyar municipal administration, the resolution of the problem will depend mainly on the activities of law enforcement agencies. Some local administrations are offering their services in the purchase and sale of real estate, but the Russians have had a mixed reaction to this.
