This will make it possible to measure the density of gaseous molecules in an ultra-vacuum domain. This technology is seen as useful for the advancement of atomcraft technology which designs and controls any structural material by manipulating atoms one by one. The successful research team was led by Shingo Ichimura, chief of the surface control section of the laboratory's ultimate technology department. The principle of imagery detection is that atoms and molecules in a vacuum are ionized by a laser and, using an ion detector, their distribution is investigated. In this experiment, an attempt was made to detect hydrogen molecules with a pressure of 1 ten-billionth of atmospheric pressure. In the experiment, the laser radiation used for ionization was focused in the vacuum by an optical lens. The distribution of the ion generation around the laser's focal point was magnified by an electrostatic laser, consisting of two electrodes, and reflected onto the top of the ion detector. The ion generation is at a maximum density at the focus of the radiation and the ionization rate diminishes in accordance with the separation from the focal point. For this reason, the form of the ion generation becomes spindle-shaped, having a maximum diameter in the vicinity of the focal point. In this experiment, the ionization domain's maximum diameter was about 50 microns. Previously, the ETL also ionized molecules and atoms by using a laser and is establishing atom counting technology which can count ionized gaseous molecules and atoms, one by one. The ETL, combining the current space measurement technologies, has opened the way for measuring molecular density inside an ultra-high vacuum.
