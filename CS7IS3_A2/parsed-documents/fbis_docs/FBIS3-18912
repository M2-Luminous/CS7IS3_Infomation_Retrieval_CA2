The continuing bad policies of the Surinamese Government are the cause of the country's deplorable state, the minister said on Sunday [6 March] on the "Meer op Zondag" NOS [Netherlands Broadcasting Foundation] television program. The time has come to review the entire development relationship with Suriname, Pronk said. Aid should be directed to a far greater degree toward combating poverty via private organizations, he said. Direct support to the Surinamese Government has proved ineffective, Pronk said in a frank examination of Surinamese politics. He said he was aware that there were still innumerable politicians and civil servants with good will in the country, "but they simply cannot get through." The development relationship which Pronk wants would bypass the Surinamese Government for a large part of the aid, the minister said. However, the current development treaty between the Netherlands and Suriname does not allow that. The minister wants to spend part of the money to which Suriname is entitled under the development treaty via nongovernmental organizations (NGO's, like the Novib [Netherlands Organization for International Development Cooperation] and its foreign partners). "Private organizations do not carry out the most work," Pronk said. "But they do the best work when it comes to combating poverty, providing health care, organizing activities for women, etc." "When we drew up the development treaty we said: You have many good groups who could do this work," Pronk said. "But it was pulled into the political field. The organization's political and ethnic background was examined, and that means sometimes waiting for years. That is not necessary, because in Suriname there is a structure which is separate from politics." Very recently the minister was far more positive about the resumption of aid to the Surinamese Government. Last November Pronk visited Paramaribo to discuss the matter with the Venetiaan government. The talks took place "in such an open and constructive atmosphere that I am optimistic about the possibility of finding a solution in the foreseeable future," he told Parliament three months ago. Pronk made it clear on Sunday that he no longer feels such optimism. "Suriname had a fantastic opportunity, but has made little of it," he said. "There has been a democratic regime for a substantial number of years now, there is a lot of support, but there are bad policies." Suriname could receive more emergency aid if the government carried out reform policies, Pronk repeated. "People know that, but nothing ever comes of it," he said. "Every time there is a new reason to not begin proper policies." The minister now regards the poverty problem in Suriname partly as a problem of distribution in Suriname itself. "Enormous wealth has grown up in parts of the population due to corruption and drug dealing," he said. "People do not want to abandon such self-interest."
