As TANJUG's correspondent has learned, the talks are difficult and tense, and it is completely uncertain whether the standpoints of the two sides will come closer, and whether a cease-fire agreement will be signed. The commander of the main headquarters of the Srpska republic army, Lt. Col. Gen. Ratko Mladic; the commander of the Muslim forces, Gen. Rasim Delic; and the UNPROFOR commander for former Bosnia-Herzegovina, Gen. Michael Rose, are holding talks behind closed doors. Today's meeting is a result of efforts made yesterday by Gen Rose to get both commanders to the negotiating table. However, their different standpoints on the peace agreement have not been reconciled and it could be said that bridging this gap will be the central topic of the talks. TANJUG has learned from reliable sources that the Muslim side arrived at the meeting with a 14-day cease-fire offer, insisting that Gorazde be the main topic. However, as Gen. Mladic pointed out at the meeting, the Serb side does not want to discuss partial and short-term solutions, but it has offered talks on an overall and unconditional truce along all demarcation lines in former Bosnia-Herzegovina. Thus the Serb side is not prepared to discuss any particular front outside the context of the overall situation; this is contrary to the standpoints of the Muslim forces' command, which is trying to give top priority, in achieving a truce, to those battlefields where which the situation is developing in a way completely out of keeping with its wishes and aims.
