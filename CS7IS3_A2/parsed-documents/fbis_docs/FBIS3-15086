Kondratiyev, commentator of this broadcasting network, said that the international community will undoubtedly welcome this. He said: The people have waited for this news for a year. Talks among IAEA, Washington, and Pyongyang representatives on international inspection of nuclear facilities in North Korea necessitated such a delay. North Korea withdrew from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] in March 1993 and refused IAEA inspection of its nuclear facilities. The negative results of such a decision by North Korea should not be emphasized as many of them are being removed with the beginning of the inspection. The affirmative results of Pyongyang's agreement to inspections are very clear. First, Washington and Seoul will suspend the Team Spirit joint military exercise, which was held every year. Second, talks for forming normal relations between the United States and North Korea will continue. A third round of talks will likely be held on 21 March. What is the most important result is the resumption of North- South talks, because no one but the Korean people themselves can solve the problems on the Korean peninsula, including the denuclearization issue. The North and the South of Korea had already reached an agreement on denuclearization of the Korean peninsula in 1991. The only thing remaining is the implementation of this plan. The resumption of working-level talks between the North and the South is scheduled on 3 March. We cannot (?assess) at this moment the result of IAEA inspections of DPRK nuclear facilities. The beginning of the inspection, however, will exercise good influence on the Korean peninsula and on the overall political situation in this area.
