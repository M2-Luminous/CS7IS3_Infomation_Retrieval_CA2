President Suleyman Demirel, Istanbul Mayor Kozakcioglu, and other officials welcomed Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport. President Aliyev inspected the guard of honor. Afterwards, Geydar Aliyev and Suleyman Demirel made statements to the press at the airport. Later the two presidents held a private meeting at Demirel's residence in Istanbul, after which Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev received British Foreign Minister Douglas Hurd, who is on a visit to Istanbul. Dear listeners, after this brief report on the president's visit, I now give the telephone to state adviser Kabil Huseyinli. [Huseyinli] Today Istanbul has been transformed into the epicenter of world politics. This is because, alongside the NATO countries, delegates from 41 countries who have signed NATO's Partnership for Peace program have gathered in Istanbul. Truly, the most important political problems of the world are being examined here. From this angle, Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev's participation in such a high-level ceremony is undoubtedly of great importance for explaining Azerbaijan's problems to the world and thus initiating a search for a political solution to these problems. It must also be noted that there were significant talks on these problems from the very first moments of the visit. Our president discussed a number of practical matters pertaining to a political solution in Daghlik-Karabakh [Nagorno-Karabakh] with Suleyman Demirel at Istanbul airport and during the meeting with British Foreign Minister Douglas Hurd. The noteworthy fact is that the view is gaining ground that a solution to this sore spot of the world might henceforth be achieved mostly through international organizations. This issue will be discussed in more detail during talks tomorrow morning, and practical ways to resolve the problem within the CSCE framework will be examined once more. The Azerbaijani president's participation in these high-level talks and the expected allocation of time to discuss the Daghlik-Karabakh problem at this meeting will undoubtedly bring a political solution of this problem closer. Dear listeners, we want to conclude our report from Istanbul with Suleyman Demirel's statement at the airport. Turkish President Suleyman Demirel said that it is a shame for the major world powers to turn a blind eye to these occupationist developments in Azerbaijan, and that he will discuss these matters with the U.S. secretary of state.
