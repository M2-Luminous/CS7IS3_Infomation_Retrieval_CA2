In addition, I want to publicly recognize and congratulate the president of the Republic for giving us peaceful, democratic elections, the likes of which we have not seen in many years. We wish Ernesto Perez Balladares and his new government team success. [Reporter] What will the political future of the Arnulfist Party [PA] and the Democratic Alliance be? [Moscoso] We had a wonderful campaign with the Democratic Alliance and have shown that opinion polls were completely manipulated here. The figures we are seeing today, which represent 90 percent of the votes, show that we are only 4 percent behind Perez Balladares and that we were the party in second place, that we were always behind the PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party]. We will remain united. This alliance will stay united. Of course we will have legislators in the next Legislative Assembly, and the Democratic Alliance will work together. [Reporter] How does the PA view the future of our country under a party like the PRD, which previously held the government in our country? [Moscoso] Of course the PA views the PRD with some concern after the experience of previous years. Nevertheless, we hope that Perez Balladares will be accompanied by the best men and that he will govern for the people and not for a party. [Reporter] Perez Balladares said he wants a government in coalition with all parties and urged them to participate. Would the PA be willing to participate in a PRD government? [Moscoso] First we would have to receive that invitation from Perez Balladares and then consult with the National Directorate of my party. I cannot answer that question now.
