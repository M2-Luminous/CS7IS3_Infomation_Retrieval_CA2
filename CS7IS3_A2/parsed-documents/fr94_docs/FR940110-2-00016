FR940110-2-00016 FR940110-2-00011 Petitioners assert that the Department specifically requested that Toyota submit corrections and reallocations in its supplemental questionnaire. Petitioners state that Toyota failed to submit this data as requested, but rather advised the Department that it would await the Department's decisions on these issues in the first administrative review before submitting a complete response. Department's Position: We agree with Toyota. In our supplemental questionnaire dated May 23, 1991, we requested Toyota to provide within a specified period of time a narrative explanation of its claimed adjustments to price after publication of the preliminary results. For the final results, we did not request additional information for ocean freight, TAL ISE, and value-added because we recalculated these expenses using information previously submitted by Toyota. See Comments 5, 7, and 8, respectively. We did request supplemental information for coop advertising. See Comment 6. Comment 5: Toyota claims that the Department's BIA recalculation of ocean freight and marine insurance is overstated because the Department misunderstood documents provided by Toyota in conjunction with sales preselected by the Department for a mini-verification of sales in Washington, DC prior to, or perhaps in lieu of, an on-site verification. One of the sales involved a forklift which had a ``mast swap'' in the United States. In other words, the truck was imported with one mast, but, prior to sale in the U.S., the mast was switched with that of another imported truck. Toyota provided one invoice, marked ``chassis'' showing the truck as imported, including its original mast, and a second invoice, marked ``mast'' for another truck, which included the mast which was subsequently fitted onto the first truck. Toyota contends that the Department erroneously calculated a per-truck ocean freight expense by adding the amounts on the two invoices, thereby yielding a per-unit figure for ocean freight equal to ocean freight for two trucks. Toyota argues that the Department requested pre-verification documents, not explanations of these documents, and that the documents were only provided to establish a paper trail for importation of the truck and not for calculation of ocean freight. Toyota requests that the Department recalculate ocean freight based on one invoice or the other, or perhaps an average, but not on two per-truck amounts added together. Toyota maintains that its original allocation of ocean freight is accurate and should be incorporated in the final results. Department's Position: We agree with Toyota. For the final results of review, we have recalculated the ocean freight expenses by averaging the invoices together to derive the per unit expense. Comment 6: Toyota notes a discrepancy between statements by the Department in the notice of preliminary results and the actual BIA used to calculate sale-by-sale U.S. coop advertising expenses. The notice of preliminary results states that the Department used the amounts Toyota reported for the first administrative review as U.S. coop expenses. See Certain Internal-Combustion, Industrial Forklift Trucks from Japan; Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review (Forklifts I), 57 FR 3164 (January 28, 1992). Toyota observes that the Department actually used the largest single reported U.S. coop expense from the second review and applied it to all sales as BIA. Toyota requests that the Department use instead the per-customer coop expense from the first administrative review, as described in the preliminary notice. Toyota maintains, however, that the appropriate allocation of this expense is over all sales, rather than by dealer. Petitioners contend that the BIA based on information from the second, rather than the first, administrative review is reasonable because it is based on data that is on the record in this proceeding. Accordingly, petitioners argue that the Department should continue to apply the largest single reported U.S. coop expense from the second review to all sales. Department's Position: In a supplemental questionnaire dated May 23, 1991, we requested that Toyota allocate by dealer U.S. coop advertising expenses on a sale-by-sale basis. In a letter dated March 30, 1992, we again requested that Toyota recalculate U.S. coop advertising expenses by dealer. On April 13, 1992, Toyota submitted this information in an acceptable form, and we have used it in lieu of BIA for the final results. Comment 7: Toyota claims that in calculating the TAL ISE incurred with respect to U.S. sales in Japan, the Department should have applied the ISE ratio to the TAL selling price, not to the much higher selling price of Toyota Motor Sales (TMS) in the United States. Because the Department applied the ISE ratio to the wrong value, it greatly overstated the expense. Toyota further contends that, as is evident from the information submitted and verified in the first review, TAL incurred the identical category of indirect selling expenses for HM sales as for U.S. sales. Toyota states that if the Department deducts TAL indirect selling expenses from U.S. price, it must also in fairness deduct the same category of expenses from HM price.
