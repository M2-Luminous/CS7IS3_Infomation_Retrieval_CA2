FR940224-1-00033 FR940224-1-00009 In the case of F/FAs with atypical elements, EPA is concerned that the requirement to reach a mass-balance steady state prior to generating emissions for testing might be too stringent. In fact, in some cases, a measured input-output mass balance might never be reached. Thus, EPA is considering a different approach for atypical F/FAs. The minimum mileage accumulation that vehicles/engines testing atypical F/FAs would be required to undergo would be 4,000 miles, the same mileage accumulation now proposed for the testing of baseline and non-baseline F/FAs. After completion of the 4,000 miles, the F/FA manufacturer would be required to identify and measure the atypical element(s) in the exhaust, if possible. Because the presence of the atypical species in specific emission fractions will be dependent on the nature of the particular atypical element, EPA would recommend examination of all emission fractions (i.e., vapor, semi-volatile, and particulate). If the atypical element(s) of interest are not detected in at least one of the emission fractions after 4,000 miles, the manufacturer would then need to continue mileage accumulation until the atypical element(s) are at high enough level(s) for accurate identification and measurement. The intervals at which the emissions should be examined for detection of the atypical element(s) is proposed to be left to the manufacturer's discretion. Once the atypical element(s) of interest are detected in at least one emission fraction, an additional 10,000 miles would be required prior to generation of emissions for purposes of emission characterization and biological testing. EPA solicits comments and suggestions on the proposed mileage accumulation requirements for baseline, non-baseline, and atypical F/FAs. If alternative approaches are provided, EPA requests commenters to include supporting data and a detailed discussion so as to allow an appropriate analysis of the options. C. Base Fuel Specifications The NPRM proposed the use of base fuels to represent theoretical ``industry average'' or normative formulations for each defined fuel family. EPA was to develop chemical and physical specifications to define a specific base fuel (including a minimum required additive package) for each fuel family. The base fuels were proposed to serve as the group representatives in compliance with testing requirements for baseline F/FA groups. The base fuels were also proposed to serve as the fuel substrates into which additives which were undergoing evaluation would be mixed prior to emission generation and testing. Tests conducted on the emissions of the base fuel would then serve as controls against which tests on the emissions of the additive/base fuel mixture would be compared. Although base fuel definitions for the conventional fuel families (gasoline and diesel) were discussed in a memorandum to the docket (``Base Fuel Determination Procedures for the Proposed Fuels and Fuel Additives Rulemaking,'' see Public Docket No. A&hyph;90&hyph;07), EPA did not specify at that time the required additive package for conventional fuels or the base fuel specifications for alternative fuels. The proposed specifications for the unleaded gasoline and diesel base fuels are shown in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively. Comments are requested on these specifications, with particular emphasis on the additive functions proposed to be included in each base fuel. The base additive packages are intended to include only those additive functions that are essential for fuel production or engine operation and/or those required by law. Selection of the specific product within each specified additive functional category would be up to the formulator of the base fuel and/or the test operator. However, additive products which include elements other than carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen would not be allowed as part of the base fuel/additive formulation. The base additives would be required to be used at their minimum effective concentrations in the base fuel.
