We have signed about two dozen various agreements and treaties. What still lies ahead? There are bottlenecks, complicated areas, etc., but there are prospects, there are things where further efforts -- very serious ones -- need to be undertaken. What spheres and areas do you see in this direction? [Nazarbayev] Since our big treaty, as it is being called, the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Aid signed between Kazakhstan and Russia in 1992, where everything that we have accomplished today was written, it may be considered that this is the concrete development of the big agreement that was ratified by both parliaments. Therefore, these 24 documents -- 23 documents -- which we signed, they give concrete expression to it. I am particularly pleased, for example, that Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin and I agreed to set up a joint economic commission that will be headed, from both our and the Russian side, by deputy prime ministers who will in turn take the chair every half-year, first in Moscow and then in Alma-Ata [Almaty]. They will be obliged, every quarter and every half-year, to report to the governments and presidents on how these accords are being fulfilled. An exhaustive number of documents were signed; for example, [the document] on defense cooperation does not require further development; on Baykonur, we came to a final decision on this question; on deepening economic cooperation, we still have to solve questions of customs space and on duty quotas between our states, setting up joint industrial-finance groups; on joint enterprises, the shares of Kazakh enterprises may be acquired by Russian enterprises, and vice-versa. Well, on these things the government has been given a period of one month in which specific agreements must be signed. But life being what it is, an agreement must be put into operation, the mechanism must be applied; certain problems may arise that we will tackle. Other matters were left to one side and that is why I invited Russian President Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin to Alma-Ata. He accepted my invitation and I think that it [the meeting] will take place in the summer, and we will develop these relations still further. [Correspondent] Nursultan Abishevich, a very important dimension, not only in bilateral relations, but also for every state, is the human dimension. The priority of the individual, the priority of the rights of the individual, and freedoms -- this is indisputable. Today, we are striving to push forward to this, although it is complicated both for Russia and for Kazakhstan, indeed for any country. It has its problems. How did you see interaction in this direction -- not only in terms of bilateral efforts but also within the CIS framework, and perhaps to move more widely, after all our country [Russia] and Kazakhstan are in many ways linked with the CSCE, and in many ways we belong both to Europe and to Asia, and this sense of two continents, how can this, let us say, take shape in terms of forms, of tools of interaction in human terms? [Nazarbayev] I understand what you mean. There used to be one state -- the Soviet Union. It split up into what are now 15 states, whose people used to live in one homeland, one country, and have found themselves the citizens of 15 states. But it would not be correct to say that the people do not have problems, because people are concerned, people are worried. Previously, there was no problem about where one's son lived, where one's father lived, where one was coming and going. Now all these problems have arisen. We really are faced with problems of the Russian people living in all of the Republics. And questions have arisen of the 1 million Kazakhs living in Russia. So, if you are speaking of our human relations, I believe that this is one of our main questions. And in the memorandum on citizenship that we signed -- and I would like to answer the first part of your question and then move on to the other part -- we said that there should be special interrelations between Kazakhstan and Russia, as I have always said. We did not make these up, they developed through history, and to pass on these relations which we have had to our children and grandchildren is a task for the politicians -- for us. Therefore, we said that if someone in Kazakhstan moves to Russia, he should be able to obtain citizenship there without question, without any delays. If he comes back to Kazakhstan, or a Russian decides to move to Kazakhstan permanently, he must be able to obtain citizenship straightaway. In other words, an individual must have freedom of choice as to where he wishes to live. At the same time, there should be no obstacles in the way of how he sells his house, takes away the property he has acquired, and so on, during the period of the move. I think that this worries people, and the most important thing is to alleviate this concern. Secondly, you correctly said that we are situated at the meeting point of Europe and Asia, especially in Kazakhstan, in the very center of Asia. Therefore, our sense of multipolarity in our economic relations is clear because Kazakhs have, as we know, have always belonged to the Islamic culture, although I do not think we have such a strong sense of religion, so to speak. Now, as in Russia, where there are about 20 million Turkic Muslims, and 50 million Turkic Muslims live in Central Asia -- the Asian part -- therefore, it is also necessary for them to be identified with and to seek out their historic culture and roots in these states. Therefore, situated between China and Russia, in the south of the Muslim world, we are trying to be multipolar. I think -- this is my opinion -- and Russia's, too, that to have equally effective relations, both with Europe and Asia, this is, it seems to me, a correct policy that we are pursuing. [Correspondent] Thank you very much.
