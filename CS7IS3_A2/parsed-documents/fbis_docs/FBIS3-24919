On this painful occasion, we must once more respectfully bow down in memory of the renowned builder of modern Cote d'Ivoire and renew our profound compassion for the great Houphouet-Boigny family. I call on all sons and daughters of Cote d'Ivoire, all our friends, to remain dignified and calm at this painful moment of separation. Our ability to perpetuate his action will depend upon our courage and determination to follow the path toward peace and development paved by the great deceased . Fellow Ivorians, the world is watching us. It is together, in peace, brotherhood, solidarity, and love that we will be able to ensure the continuity of his gigantic work. Let us all pray for the repose of his soul!
