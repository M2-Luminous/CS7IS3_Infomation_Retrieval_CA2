Zairian intellectuals in Brussels believe that President Mobutu is achieving exactly what he set out to achieve. His country is in a complete economic and social mess, and the hope of democratic reform is further off than ever. The "New Zaire" (NZ) which was introduced on 21 October 1993 by the pro-Mobutu government of Faustin Birundwa is visibly collapsing. The original exchange rate of three NZ for one dollar had climbed to 37 NZ to the dollar by last weekend. On the black market in Kinshasa, people were paying as much as 110 NZ last Friday. In addition, the introduction of the NZ has met with political opposition. This is strongest in East Kasai -- where prime minister Etienne Tshisekedi comes from -- and in the Kivu province. On 29 November clashes with the military in Kananga left at least seven dead. As a deterrent, President Mobutu had already dispatched his DSP [Special Presidential Division] to the Mbuji-Mayi diamond center. But the dealers are still refusing to accept the NZ. Any firm action by the DSP seems out of the question for the moment as the population is apparently well armed. Today, however, the presidential guard will enforce a total curfew and carry out large- scale house searches. In Bukavu the border with Rwanda has been closed for several days now. The shortages of goods had prompted many people to seek out supplies across the border. The Zairian government will not tolerate this and the military are firing mercilessly at anyone who infringes the ban. In the New Year, the thoughts of many Zairians are returning to the notorious 4 January 1959. In the then Leopoldstad, the troops of General Janssens put down the sudden call for "Dipenda" with brutal violence. The result was a couple of hundred dead and at least as many wounded. But in just one day independence was within reach. Thirty-five years later the Zairians are once again calling for dignity and freedom. The failure of monetary reform and of two months of political negotiations have robbed them of their last grain of hope for improvement in a situation which becomes increasingly hopeless by the day. No end is yet in sight to the oppression and the exploitation.
