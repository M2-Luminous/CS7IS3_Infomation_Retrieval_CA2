Ranariddh told Hosokawa during a 20-minute meeting that Cambodia is considering a number of major development projects and would welcome a resumption of the loans from Japan, officials said. The two premiers arrived in Tokyo earlier the same day with a large government delegation to attend a two-day meeting of the International Committee on Reconstruction of Cambodia (ICORC), which begins Thursday. Diplomatic sources said Japan will not announce a resumption of loan assistance at the conference, but will pledge some 9 billion yen in grant aid for the coming fiscal year, which begins in April. Japan extended Cambodia some 8 billion yen in grant assistance in fiscal 1993 ending March 31. The last time Japan, Cambodia's top benefactor, made an official loan to Cambodia was in fiscal 1968, when it extended an offer of 1.5 billion yen. But Cambodia's civil strife and sweeping changes of government since then precluded the extension of further loans, while the country's international credit-worthiness depreciated. Sources said the two countries will have to negotiate Cambodia's arrears before a resumption of loans can be effected. Officials said Hosokawa vowed that Japan will continue to offer Cambodia "as much cooperation as possible" to facilitate the country's reconstruction. They said Ranariddh, the son of ailing King Norodom Sihanouk, outlined Cambodia's aid expectations of Japan. In the area of social infrastructure, he said, Cambodia requires assistance for the building of roads and bridges. Ranariddh expressed appreciation for Japanese funding for reconstruction of a key 709-meter-long bridge spanning the Tonle Sap River which runs through Phnom Penh. The so-called "Japan Bridge," which was completed last month, was first built in 1963 with reparation funds from Japan for damage inflicted on Cambodia during World War II. Ranariddh said assistance is also needed to finance various energy projects, particularly for electricity generation. He noted that Cambodia has reserves of natural gas that could be successfully exploited for that purpose. A Japanese consortium has already started test-drilling an oil and gas field off southern Cambodia, the first drilling operation since the civil war halted foreign operations in Cambodia in 1974. In addition to social infrastructure aid, Ranariddh said Cambodia wants Japan's help to improve its agricultural production. According to officials, he said Cambodia has great agricultural potential, noting that land is plentiful in proportion to the country's small population of some 9 million people. The Cambodian leader said his government is making efforts to facilitate an influx of foreign investment, such as drafting investment and banking laws. Ranariddh expressed expectations for increased numbers of Japanese tourists visiting Cambodia to see the ancient temple complex at Angkor Wat. Officials said he invited Hosokawa to pay an official visit to Cambodia in the future. Delegations from 32 countries, the European Union and 12 international organizations will participate in the ICORC meeting.
