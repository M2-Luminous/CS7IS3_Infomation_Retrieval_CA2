U.S. Ambassador in Israel Edward Djerejian has asked Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin for answers on this issue. The prime minister vehemently denied the existence of any contacts with Baghdad. A senior political source in Jerusalem said last week: "There is no point in maintaining contacts with Iraq as long as Saddam Husayn is in power. Saddam is a madman, and you do not marry one." According to the British weekly FOREIGN REPORT, Israel and Iraq have been holding indirect contacts through European and Palestinian mediators in a bid to expand the peace process. According to the paper, in the framework of the contacts, efforts are being made to arrange a meeting between Foreign Minister Peres and a senior Iraqi figure. The foreign minister's bureau yesterday denied the London weekly story, saying: "this is nonsense." [passage omitted]
