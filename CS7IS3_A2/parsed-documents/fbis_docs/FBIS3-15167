The only places where it will not be seen are some regions in the Pacific and western parts of the United States and Canada. From now on, every Friday, there will be 50 minutes of Ukrainian Television on the international air. This is the result of an agreement concluded between the Ukrainian Television and Radio Broadcasting Company and Israeli television structures. This event is commented upon by president of the Ukrainian Television and Radio Broadcasting Company Mykola Okhmakevych. [Okhmakevych] During the times of the USSR, we did not give much thought to using space for applied purposes. In those times, Ukraine did not use artificial satellites for broadcasting our programs to other countries, and there are practically no other ways. As a result, the only television program that has a satellite channel is "Ostankino." When I was invited to negotiate with Israel's Television (credit must be given to Ukraine's Embassy in Israel for the preliminary work it did), I did not expect that in the very near future, we would have regular satellite television broadcasting to all continents. We are working with the organization "Intergama." "Intergama" leases quite powerful satellites. It turned out later that "Intergama" does not have enough programs to work with. That is why an idea emerged: "Why not beam Ukrainian Television programs on the international air?" [Balytska] Who will prepare the international program and what it will look like? [Okhmakevych] For this, we are creating a special editorial board (for the time being, about 10 persons). The first two programs were made as a digest: information block, which may present interest, and a number of interviews, which will elucidate Ukraine's policy as we see it and not as the foreign press comments upon it. Speeches by the state's leading persons are planned. Various information materials will be presented, including some concert features. At first glance, everything looks somewhat eclectic, but when we proceed to new proportions (I am sure that we will expand them), we will build our program differently. [Balytska] Consequently, the programs will be exclusively in Ukrainian? [Okhmakevych] Yes, they are meant for those who want to watch Ukrainian-language programs. [Balytska] Perhaps, it might be worthwhile to provide translation so that those who have no command of the Ukrainian language would also be able to obtain information on Ukraine? [Okhakevych] I think that this might be possible at a new stage, but not now. Approximately 20 million Ukrainians live abroad, including nearby foreign countries. This program is mainly for them. [Balytska] "Non-foreign" Ukrainians will never see it? [Okhmakevych] I think that, in the course of time, it will also be possible to see it here -- we already have the enterprise "Saturn" with corresponding technological means. [Balytska] Tell me, please, where are you getting the money for all of this? [Okhmakevych] A joint Ukrainian-Israeli venture was created. It must ensure the payment and even a possibility of getting some profit (mainly through carrying advertisements). Besides, "Intergama" works on connecting this channel to the cable television of all consumer countries (there already exist such agreements), and if there is stable reception, there may be profits. I hope that in the future, our program for abroad will be available on a daily basis -- three or four hours a day and not just once a week. The main thing is to just begin, and we have done this.
