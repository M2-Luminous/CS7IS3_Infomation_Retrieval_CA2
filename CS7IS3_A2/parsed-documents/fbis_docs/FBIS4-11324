One of these circumstances, aspects of the Cuban question in the United States, deserves to be considered briefly as an illustration. Although it is difficult for some people in the world to understand, the Cuban issue in the United States basically is not a matter of foreign but domestic policy because of interests involving winning the Florida elections. The fact that there are in this American state some 260,000 people of Cuban ancestry with voting rights has created the fiction that this number, which constitutes a minority in relation to the rest of the people with voting rights, is "essential" for victory in this state, the fourth most important in U.S. elections. This makes it clear that influence, big or small, in this context is determined by the correlation of forces among people of Cuban ancestry residing in the United States, particularly in Florida. What organization still exerts the greatest influence in this scenario? The Cuban-American National Foundation [FNCA], created in the early 1980's under then President Ronald Reagan's warm sponsorship, is an ultraconservative organization with ample financial resources and a well-oiled mechanism of influence in the Congress. The FNCA holds a very intransigent position regarding Cuba, rules out all possibilities of dealing with Fidel Castro's government, defends to the utmost the so-called Torricelli Law, and accepts only the surrender of the Cuban revolutionaries. Although the foundation's greatest influence was observed during the Republican governments of Ronald Reagan and George Bush, the FNCA's ties with Washington have not been severed, and there is official interest in not taking any steps that could cause significant clashes with the organization. On several occasions, the U.S. press, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL on 3 August 1992 for instance, have reported that the FNCA and its head, Jorge Mas Canosa, have turned the Cuban issue into a profitable political affair, not without certain irregularities. Another peculiarity of Mas Canosa's organization is the use of subversive methods against everyone in Miami who dares voice an opinion even slightly different from the FNCA's far-rightist ideas regarding Havana. Some people still remember what happened to THE MIAMI HERALD, which Mas Canosa accused of serving Castro's government only because the paper expressed an opinion that contradicted the Torricelli Law to some extent. Later, paper officials received death threats, and some of the paper's distribution centers were seriously damaged by terrorist actions. This explains the harsh attacks that the far-rightist sector of the Cuban community living in the United States has unleashed against the "The Nation and the Emigrants" conference, which opened today. The meeting's central goal, to advance on the road to normalizing relations between Cuba and Cubans living abroad, is unacceptable to the intolerant who alienate themselves from the true feelings prevailing in a community that is gradually abandoning them. Maybe this is why the initial shouting of those who act like this is an accurate indication of how right this conference is. And perhaps this shouting is also a noisy introduction to the emergence of new approaches which, though not ideologically coincidental with those of Cuba, could form a commonsense bridge in the civilized dealings between the nation and its emigrants.
