This is stated in a communique issued by the Office of the President of the Republic. According to the communique, the head of state regretted that high-level leaders like them continue to make multi-faceted statements unlikely to help the establishment of the broad-based transitional institutions and described the statements as a show of force. According to the same communique, the president said that it is (?inconceivable) that the country is ruled through communiques while there is another perfectly adequate way to rule the country: in the spirit of the fundamental law which recommends consultations within the Council of Ministers. The communique, which reached us today, is signed by the principal private secretary of the president of the Republic, Enoch Ruhigira.
