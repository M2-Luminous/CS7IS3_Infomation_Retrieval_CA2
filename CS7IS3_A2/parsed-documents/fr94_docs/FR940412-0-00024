FR940412-0-00024 FR940412-0-00005 (b) This section does not apply to: (1) Manifolds; (2) Station piping such as at compressor stations, meter stations, or regulator stations; (3) Piping associated with storage facilities, other than a continuous run of transmission line between a compressor station and storage facilities; (4) Cross-overs; (5) Sizes of pipe for which an instrumented internal inspection device is not commercially available; (6) Transmission lines, operated in conjunction with a distribution system which are installed in Class 4 locations; (7) Offshore pipelines, other than transmission lines 10 inches or greater in nominal diameter, that transport gas to onshore facilities; and (8) Other piping that, under §190.9 of this chapter, the Administrator finds in a particular case would be impracticable to design and construct to accommodate the passage of instrumented internal inspection devices. (c) An operator encountering emergencies, construction time constraints or other unforeseen construction problems need not construct a new or replacement segment of a transmission line to meet paragraph (a) of this section, if the operator determines and documents why an impracticability prohibits compliance with paragraph (a) of this section. Within 30 days after discovering the emergency or construction problem the operator must petition, under §190.9 of this chapter, for approval that design and construction to accommodate passage of instrumented internal inspection devices would be impracticable. If the petition is denied, within 1 year after the date of the notice of the denial, the operator must modify that segment to allow passage of instrumented internal inspection devices. PART 193_[AMENDED] 7. The authority citation for part 193 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 App. U.S.C. 1671 et seq.; and 49 CFR 1.53. §193.2015 [Removed] 8.

Section 195.120 is revised to read as follows: §195.120 Passage of internal inspection devices. (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, each new pipeline and each line section of a pipeline where the line pipe, valve, fitting or other line component is replaced; must be designed and constructed to accommodate the passage of instrumented internal inspection devices. (b) This section does not apply to: (1) Manifolds; (2) Station piping such as at pump stations, meter stations, or pressure reducing stations; (3) Piping associated with tank farms and other storage facilities; (4) Cross-overs; (5) Sizes of pipe for which an instrumented internal inspection device is not commercially available; (6) Offshore pipelines, other than main lines 10 inches or greater in nominal diameter, that transport liquids to onshore facilities; and (7) Other piping that the Administrator under §190.9 of this chapter, finds in a particular case would be impracticable to design and construct to accommodate the passage of instrumented internal inspection devices. (c) An operator encountering emergencies, construction time constraints and other unforeseen construction problems need not construct a new or replacement segment of a pipeline to meet paragraph (a) of this section, if the operator determines and documents why an impracticability prohibits compliance with paragraph (a) of this section. Within 30 days after discovering the emergency or construction problem the operator must petition, under §190.9 of this chapter, for approval that design and construction to accommodate passage of instrumented internal inspection devices would be impracticable. If the petition is denied, within 1 year after the date of the notice of the denial, the operator must modify that segment to allow passage of instrumented internal inspection devices.
