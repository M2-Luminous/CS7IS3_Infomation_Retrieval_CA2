Thank you for your warm welcome. I also want to say the Zapatist National Liberation Army has fulfilled its commitment. I want to state my opinion on this important moment in Guadalupe Tepeyac. We are confirming that policies based on principles are the best road for resolving conflicts and problems. This result would not have been achieved through violence. Reason and the search for peace and reconciliation are stronger. This is only one step, but it is a firm step on the road for peace and reconciliation. I think we all here today have learned much; both sides have. The main significance is we all want an honorable peace for the men, women, and children of Chiapas and Mexico. Viva Mexico!
