Where JESSI has been employed so far the results have been top-rank. This is the opinion recently expressed by JESSI's chief executive, Hans Meyer, at a meeting of the Technical-Literary Society (TELI) in Munich. He said that some partial projects have led to technology transfer between partner companies during the last few months. Meyer explained the knowledge and the advances that had been achieved with JESSI so far: in the new generations of MOS transistors, tunnel effects can arise at the submicrometer level which reduce the chip's performance. These can now be combatted with two proven production steps, namely the nitride-gate-oxide process and the Large Angle Tilted Implanted Drain (LATID) process. A further innovation involves the transfer of circuitry structures onto the chip by optical lithography. In wafer-stepper tools the demands for precision grow with increased wafer size. As JESSI researches have shown, even the available steppers can operate with an accuracy of 0.5 micrometers. In this case wave lengths of 365 nanometers are being used. With even shorter wave lengths, an accuracy of 0.1 micrometers is said to be attainable. Progress in development is also being reported for storage chips of the EPROM type (Erasable Programmable Memory). As has already been reported, JESSI distributed the first blueprints for a 16-megabit EPROM to partner companies. They were produced using 0.6 micrometer technology. JESSI was created by the European Research Coordinating Agency (EUREKA) to work jointly on basic technologies for electronic chips and chip production. At the moment 185 institutes and companies are involved, participating in 71 individual projects. 9337
