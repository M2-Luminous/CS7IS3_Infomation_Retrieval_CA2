FR940705-0-00021 FR940705-0-00002 Response: A review of past REA Form 515 Construction Contracts indicated that REA borrowers were specifying attenuation requirements at the accepted industry wavelengths of 850 and 1300 nanometers for multimode fibers, and 1310 and 1550 for single mode fibers. A review of present construction contracts also reveals that REA borrowers are still specifying attenuation requirements at the accepted industry wavelengths of 850 and 1300 nanometers for multimode fibers, and 1310 and 1550 for single mode fibers. Since REA borrowers are specifying attenuation requirements at the industry accepted wavelengths and not at nonstandard wavelengths, the requirement to conduct attenuation measurements at the wavelength specified in paragraphs (p)(1)(iv) and (p)(2)(iii) of 7 CFR 1755.900 will not be deleted from the specification as recommended by the commenter. One respondent commented that the dispersion and dispersion slope requirements of 2.7 ps/nm km and 0.085 ps(nm2 km), respectively for dispersion-shifted single mode fibers specified in paragraph (p)(1)(vii) of the specification will eliminate the use of their currently manufactured dispersion shifted single mode fiber by REA borrowers. Response: Since it is not REA's intent to eliminate the use of dispersion-shifted single mode fibers which are currently manufactured and used on non-REA telecommunication systems with satisfactory results, REA will change the dispersion and dispersion slope requirements for dispersion-shifted single mode fibers from 2.7 ps/nm km and 0.085 ps(nm2 km), respectively to 3.5 ps/nm km and 0.095 ps(nm2 km), respectively to allow use of the manufacturer's dispersion shifted single mode fiber by REA borrowers. Three respondents recommended changing the 1250 nanometer cut-off wavelength for single mode fibers specified in paragraph (p)(1)(viii) of 7 CFR 1755.900 to the industry accepted wavelength of 1260 nanometers. Response: If 7 CFR 1755.900 maintained the 1250 nanometer cut-off wavelength for single mode fibers, REA would force manufacturers to maintain two separate fiber optic cable inventories based solely on the different cut-off wavelength requirements. This in turn would result in higher fiber optic cable prices to REA borrowers. By changing the cut-off wavelength requirement for single mode fibers from 1250 nanometers to 1260 nanometers, REA would eliminate the need for manufacturers to maintain separate fiber optic cable inventories. This change would reduce fiber optic cable costs to REA borrowers. Therefore, REA will change the single mode fiber cut-off wavelength requirement in paragraph (p)(1)(viii) of 7 CFR 1755.900 from 1250 nanometers to 1260 nanometers. One respondent commented on the mechanical requirements for multimode fiber optic cables specified in 7 CFR 1755.900. The first comment recommended deleting the mechanical requirements for multimode fiber optic cables specified in paragraphs (q)(1) through (q)(5) of the specification because they feel that the qualification of single mode fiber optic cable designs to the mechanical requirements are adequate to qualify multimode fiber optic cable designs. The second comment recommended that if REA retained the mechanical requirements for multimode fiber optic cables that the allowable change in attenuation be changed from a maximum of 0.030 dB to a maximum of 0.040 dB since this is the present de facto industry requirement for multimode optical fibers. Response: In regards to the first comment, 7 CFR 1755.900 requires both multimode and single mode fiber optic cables to be tested for the mechanical properties specified in paragraphs (q)(1) through (q)(5) of the specification to assure that both cable types will withstand the rigors of field installation and provide satisfactory service over their useful lives. REA is of the opinion that both multimode and single mode fiber optic cable designs must be tested for the mechanical requirements specified in paragraphs (q)(1) through (q)(5) of the specification to assure REA borrowers that these designs will withstand the rigors of field installation and provide satisfactory performance over their useful service lives. Therefore, REA will not eliminate the mechanical requirements for multimode fiber optic cables specified in paragraphs (q)(1) through (q)(5) of 7 CFR 1755.900. Regarding the second comment, since it is REA's intent to use de facto industry requirements; where applicable, REA will change the maximum allowable change in attenuation for multimode fiber optic cables from 0.30 dB to 0.40 dB in paragraphs (q)(1) through (q)(5) of 7 CFR 1755.900. Two respondents recommended that mechanical testing specified in paragraphs (q)(1) through (q)(5) of 7 CFR 1755.900 for dispersion-unshifted single mode fiber optic cables be performed at only the 1550 nanometer wavelength in place of the required testing at both 1310 and 1550 nanometer wavelengths. The reasons for their comments are based on the data indicating that testing of optical fibers at the 1550 nanometer wavelength is considered the worst case condition because the fibers are more sensitive to bends at this wavelength.
