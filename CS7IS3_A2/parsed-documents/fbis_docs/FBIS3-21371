Quite the contrary. Let us overlook the dismaying and tragicomic episode at the opening session, the only reason for which was the outgoing president's deliberate refusal to accept the democratic rule that called for submitting his opening speech--designed to be a speech of defiance and pique--to the Managing Committee for its review. Let us also overlook, despite its seriousness, the violence done to a journalist-photographer and the terrorism in the form of insults and threats that a tiny minority of congress delegates belonging to the extreme left tried in vain to impose on the congress, which remained a congress of free expression and energy. Instead, let us remember the remarkable calmness of the officers of the congress (Taieb Baccouche and the seven other officers), the efficient organization thanks to the logistic support provided by the Arab Institute of Human Rights, the productive discussions in committee and in the plenary sessions, the pluralistic debate, and, last, that democratic space that is unique in our country and that we absolutely must preserve. Yes, it is with heads held high that the old members are leaving the league today. With their heads held high not to make verbal attacks on personalities they themselves invited or to slander the men and women who have taken over the leadership of the league. But I am convinced that the latter will be able to scathingly refute those who, in an insult to the future, are announcing "the disappearance of this last democratic space" because, in their eyes, democratic rules can only be a one-way street. Following the crisis, there is again hope that the league will return to the idea that gave it its prestige and specific character as a major and responsible opposition force that protests without going to excess and is concerned to develop its capacity for dialogue and negotiation and its ability to make proposals. At the head of the league today, we have passed the reins to a new and younger team whose president is not likely to drift into the narcissistic and despotic ways that we have been subjected to for four years. The essential thing is to preserve the league's independence and, in the internal debates by the Managing Committee, to return to that tradition of mutual respect, tolerance, dialogue, and social interaction, which unfortunately wound up disappearing under the combined effect of bitter political conflicts, the contagion of unbearable paranoia, and a policy of "sloganization" that sterilized most of the essential debate. Besides the exemplary democratic way in which the final balloting took place, one reason for hoping that we have now left the crisis definitely behind us is the content of the resolutions adopted with respect to internal regulations and the law on associations. The fight for human rights and the rights of citizens and peoples is an ethical and political fight for freedoms, for equality, against discrimination, for physical integrity and against torture, for the universality of standards and procedures for protection of the human person, and for the indivisible nature of those rights, which are not only civil and political but also economic, social, and cultural. The extreme left, which has fought and continues to fight for freedom of association and pluralist democracy, has not yet fully realized that to finish this fight, it is necessary to leave behind sectarian reflexes and archaic ideas concerning the rights of peoples as opposed to human rights and to abandon a populist-nationalist particularism that sets itself against universality in a simplistic and suspicious manner. Above all, both in the league and in the university, that left is paying the price for an erroneous strategy aimed at the systematic and partisan besieging of the democratic space for associations. Fighting for the rights of the human person means deeply rooting our convictions in a constant reference to the standards of the state of law and to international statements and legal instruments for the promotion and protection of human rights. Attentive to the appeals and the distress of the outcasts, those without a voice, the oppressed, and the victims of repression, we must voice their appeals to the public authorities while also performing a function of indispensable training and education for promoting a true human rights mentality. Last, the fight for human rights presupposes an availability to others, the qualities of a listener, and a conception of democratic citizenship that cannot possibly be a monopoly controlled by the leading lights of a certain kind of thundering "human rights-ism" with perverse effects. Because quite obviously, such a monopoly constitutes a poor substitute for partisan political action or, what is even more tragic, clinical therapies that it is serious and useless to evade any longer. Those are the errors that the league's new leadership will have to go to work on. We wish it good luck so that the independent and democratic Tunisian league will have a long life.
