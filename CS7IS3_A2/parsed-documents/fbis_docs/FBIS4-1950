Attending the forum to jointly discuss the issues of developing export-oriented agriculture, developing agriculture that can earn more foreign exchanges, and coordinating agricultural production with foreign trade and exports were vice mayors in charge of agricultural affairs from 14 cities throughout the province, responsible persons from the provincial level departments for foreign economic relations and foreign trade, and managers from various import and export companies at the provincial level. According to the calculation conducted by the foreign trade department, since the early 1990's the average annual increase of the province in the exports of farm and sideline products has been 10 percent. The province realized $800 million in foreign exchange from exporting farm and sideline products last year, which accounted for about 20 percent of the total volume of foreign exchanges earned by local export units in the year. However, the exports of farm and sideline products still suffer the problems of inflexible information of markets, insufficient goods resources, small patches of exports, product quality that cannot meet international demands, and of separation between production and sale. All of these need to be handled along with deepening the reform in the rural economy. Vice Governor Xiao Zuofu delivered a speech at the forum, in which he pointed out: Accelerating the production structure in rural areas to enable agriculture to enter international markets as soon as possible represents the major task for the province to deepen the development of the rural economy. The gap of per capita income between mountainous areas in east and north Liaoning and coastal areas is over 500 yuan. However, these mountainous areas are just the bases of developing export-oriented agriculture. Therefore, building the bases of farm and sideline products that can earn foreign exchanges through exports and establishing the production system for these farm and sideline products represent an emphasis for the province to readjust its rural production structure in next step. He pointed out: In building the bases of farm and sideline products that can earn foreign exchanges, various localities should do a good job to develop the enterprises whose products can earn the largest profits and upgrade the added volume of farm and sideline products. As for the production projects that can earn foreign exchanges, we should give preferential consideration in funds and material supply to them. The provincial people's government will establish its leading group in charge of the export-oriented rural economy, which will provide information, materials, services, for export-oriented enterprises and households in rural areas.
