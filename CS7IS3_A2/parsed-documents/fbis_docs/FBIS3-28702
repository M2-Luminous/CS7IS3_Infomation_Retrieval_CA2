He added bellicose absurd remarks that when circumstances do not permit dialogue, it was also the government's consistent stance to take strict measures against the North. These very dangerous provocative absurd remarks are leading the situation on the Korean peninsula to a phase of war [chonjaeng kungmyon] and are outraging our people. As everyone knows, the whole world recognizes that the nuclear issue in our country is an issue to be resolved between us and the United States. The reason the nuclear issue has been raised on the Korean peninsula is because the United States is increasing the risk of nuclear war [haekchonjaeng wihom] by introducing more than 1,000 nuclear weapons of various types to South Korea; is deploying them in forward positions in the areas adjacent to the Military Demarcation Line; and is conducting nuclear war exercises, including the Team Spirit military exercise, against the Northern half of the Republic every day. Therefore, the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula should be resolved between us and the United States -- the party that introduced nuclear weapons to South Korea and that is increasing the risk of nuclear war. The South Korean puppets are not qualified to interfere in the resolution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. They only have to act according to the decisions made through negotiations between us and the United States. If the South Korean puppets have anything to say concerning the nuclear issue, they should frankly apologize to all nations for bringing U.S. nuclear weapons to the land of South Korea to spread nuclear disaster among their fellow countrymen and for increasing the risk of nuclear war with the United States, and should ask to be given due punishment. It is intolerable that Han Sung-chu did not mention one word about this in his attempt to interfere in the resolution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. It is ridiculous that the South Korean puppets, which can hardly be called human beings as they are first-class colonial hunting dogs and flunkyist nation-sellers, are trying to interfere in the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula. What cannot be overlooked is that South Korean puppets are raving about some kind of resolute measures while the United States is threatening ultimatums by setting a deadline for us to accept the full-scope inspection [chonmyon sachal] of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. The South Korean puppets have so far made innumerable criminal outbursts disparaging us under the pretext of the nuclear issue. However, considering the fact that they spat out more belligerent outbursts, such as a stern measure, we can be well aware that the rascals' new war provocation moves have entered a very grave stage. The South Korean puppets have committed every strategic move to frustrate the DPRK-U.S. talks during the past period. Today, the process of peaceful solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is facing a crisis situation because of the betrayal of the United States [onul migugui paesin haengwirohaeso chosonbando haengmunjeui pyonghwajok haegyol kwajongi wigi sanghwange noigedoeja]. With this situation as a motive, the South Korean puppets are frantically running wild to prevent the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks from being realized and to bring about a nuclear war in our country, which will annihilate the entire nation in collusion with foreign forces. Under the pretext of the so-called meeting, Han Sung-chu will visit the United States from 16 to 22 February, meet with the U.S. President and secretary of state, establish the final U.S. and ROK position, and discuss a follow-up measure regarding the IAEA decision based on the North's attitude. This is one of the criminal moves to crush the fellow countrymen in collusion with foreign forces. Even Han Sung-chu babbled about dialogue, this is nothing but a brazen-faced maneuver to cover up their antinational, antipeaceful, and antireunification activity, which is driving our country's situation into the brink of a war. It is unreasonable for the South Korean puppets, who are trying to enforce the large-scale nuclear war exercise against our Republic in collusion with the United States and deploy Patriot missiles to South Korea, to talk about holding dialogue with us. Babbling about dialogue while wielding guns [chongdae] is, in fact, an insult to dialogue and negation of dialogue. Han Sung-chu confessed that a stern measure is a consistent position. Thus, the unchangeable real intention of the puppets, who are not interested in North-South dialogue at all and are trying to separate and crush our Republic in collusion with foreign forces, becomes clearer. Facts show that the South Korean puppets are rushing toward the road to North-South confrontation and war, not toward peace and peaceful reunification, and that they do not hesitate to endanger the entire nation with a nuclear holocaust. The entire nation set this year as the year for the great national unity and is accelerating the great advance for national reunification. The South Korean puppets, however, are taking the road to war and are the traitorous group that cannot live together under the same sky. The South Korean puppets should look straight at our people's will and determination and act with discretion. The rascals' reckless new war provocation will only result in their own destruction.
