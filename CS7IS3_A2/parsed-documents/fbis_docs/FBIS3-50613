The article adds that the sudden weakening of the Cuban economy from external factors has been reflected in a drop in individual consumption and the loss of the purchasing power of salaries which, in many cases, are partially alloted to buying on the black market, where they are also losing value due to an increase in prices. Upon the collapse of our import capability, production dropped in a descending spiral while the peoples' salaries and state expenses remain more or less stable, thus weakening financial balance and the motivational aspect of salaries. The time has come to begin putting order into domestic finances and directing the people's efforts toward a harmony between state expenses and income, while implementing actions to reduce the excess currency in circulation. As always in our society, the workers are the ones who can contribute most to solving these urgent problems because no measure or series of measures could hope to succeed unless it has the workers' support. We are convinced that the measures should be taken slowly, not only because of their technical complexity and the need to understand the problems more deeply, but also because they should be the future basis of a true national consensus without losing track of the Cuban nation's foundation of social justice. The TRABAJADORES editorial stresses that while we are grateful for the serene, democratic speed of the decision-taking process, we are calling all workers and union movements to action because much can already be done to promote financial balance and to fight the causes and consequences of imbalance. First of all, we have to preserve the value of work. The editorial adds that as Commander in Chief Fidel Castro has repeated, Cuban workers are demonstrating the value of honor and revolutionary and patriotic awareness as they challenge, day to day, all kinds of difficulties in fulfilling their labor tasks. It is unquestionable that the immense majority of Cuban workers have placed their commitment and honor above the material factors that affect work motivation under the present circumstances. Let us maintain and improve discipline and the commitment to do more with the available resources in every work center. This will be an immense contribution to the solution of the financial problem, which in the end will be solved through more production and work. Let us fight everywhere the absurd habit of spending certain allocations unjustifiably just to ensure a similar allocation in the next budget cycle. Let us reject, with renewed energy, inefficient work, particularly where there is a sure capacity to produce. In a proletariat society, the state develops and manages the budget with the same principles that a united family manages its own budget. The editorial adds that there is no sacrifice that is not good for everyone when it ensures the wellbeing of all. It adds: just as a family cannot nor ought to spend more than it earns, our state is also compelled to follow that strict economic logic. Presumably, the path to financial order and discipline will not be short nor easy, but everything being done will help us during hard times, and will better prepare us to accept any positive events that will result as the unavoidable reward of so much effort.
