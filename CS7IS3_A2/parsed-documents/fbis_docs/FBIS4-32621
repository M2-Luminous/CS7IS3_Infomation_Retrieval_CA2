It decided that the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] moved to the center of the political scene, that it is not implementing its election promises, and that it is no longer the left wing. Thus, on our political scene, there arose a dispute that has already often appeared in the history of the left wing: What is the "proper" left wing, and what is only pretending to be the left wing? A Favorable "No" UP took part in lengthy negotiations with the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] and the SLD regarding the formation of the government; however, it finally said "no." [passage omitted] The Opposition At the Sunday session of the National Council, 38 persons voted in favor of UP's passing to the official opposition, eight were against, and one abstained. The decision is of some significance chiefly in terms of propaganda. UP never was a member of the governing coalition; in voting, it has acted for a few months now rather like an opposition party. Thus, nothing will change in the Sejm. The coalition maintains its advantage. UP will not necessarily increase the strength of the parliamentary opposition. It criticizes the opposition from the position of a leftist party--that is, from a position entirely different from the positions of the Confederation for an Independent Poland, the Non-Party Bloc in Support of Reforms, or the majority of the Union of Freedom. It is worth recalling that UP abstained from voting on the report on the implementation of the budget by the Suchocka government. There Is Something Else Behind It UP's decision to officially join the opposition is not addressed to political groupings. Its addressees are supposed to be voters--voters of UP, as well as voters of the SLD. The UP Council argues that the SLD has moved toward the center of the political scene, that it has ceased to be part of the left wing, and that right now UP is turning out to be the sole defender of leftist values. UP will be the leftist opposition to the government, which, according to it, is centrist. At a 27 June press conference, Ryszard Bugaj said that the party's decision to join the opposition will not cause any serious political consequences in this parliament. The argumentation is quite risky. No matter how far to the right the SLD has moved--if it has moved in that direction at all--it seems that an attempt to persuade voters that the SLD is no longer part of the left wing cannot be successful. However, UP is in a comfortable situation right now as the last defender of the left. It will certainly act on behalf of the people, to whom the SLD promised social values in the election campaign, and the promises have not been kept. Thus, UP will speak on behalf of not only those who voted for it but also those who elected the SLD. It will hope that, among SLD voters, there are people who are really disappointed with the current policy of their party and will begin supporting UP instead. UP was established as the postsolidarity left wing. As such, it enjoyed the sympathy of centrist and rightist postsolidarity politicians as well. They hoped that its establishment would break apart the Social Democracy of the Polish Republic, attract some of the more valuable groups from this party, and, as a result, parties of the Polish People's Republic's origin would be relegated to the margin. The last elections must have put an end to these hopes: It became clear that SLD exists and will continue to exist. When the PSL and the SLD formed the government, it also became clear that sooner or later UP would try to find a place for itself on the right side of the political scene. The only thing that had to be done was to choose the right moment. From the UP point of view, it seems that it was high time. The party has been going through some problems lately. It has come to light that one of its politicians, Janusz Szymanski, is a member of the Supervisory Board of the Posnania Bank, a bank linked to the Elektromis company. Another UP leader, Wojciech Lamentowicz, was among those who signed a report on the condition of the cadres in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which caused such a great commotion. In addition, UP's influence within "Solidarity" has decreased quite dramatically. Finally, in the last self-government elections, the party obtained poorer results than had been expected. On 26 June, Bugaj's party started its long campaign to win over SLD voters. It is not at all certain what results this will yield.
