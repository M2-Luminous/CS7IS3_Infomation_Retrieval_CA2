A second-hand furniture dealer told of several families, especially in Stilfontein and Orkney, who were selling off all their furniture in such a hurry they were accepting any price. Meanwhile, several other right-wingers in Klerksdorp who intend staying have been barricading their homes, sometimes welding thick steel plates on bedroom windows to discourage intruders. Some of the houses looked like fortresses and contained enough emergency supplies to last a long time.
