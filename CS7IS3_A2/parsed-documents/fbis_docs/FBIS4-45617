Police said that tropical fish shop proprietor Yoshitaka Udagawa, 31, purchased an arowana from another tropical fish shop owner in Tokyo in June 1992. The carnivorous fish, for which some tropical fish enthusiasts in Japan will pay hundreds of thousands of yen each, is protected under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, or the so-called Washington Convention, Police said Udagawa failed to fulfill a legal requirement to register the arowana purchase with the Environment Agency within 30 days. He subsequently compounded his troubles with the law by selling the unregistered arowana in July 1993 to a man in Kushiro, Hokkaido, without informing the agency of the transaction. Masato Sasaki, 38, the Arowana's new owner, similarly failed to comply with legal requirements when he purchased the arowana from Udagawa and resold it to a tropical fish shop in Obihiro. Representatives of Traffic Japan, which monitors the illegal wildlife trade, said two separate cases of illegal trade of arowana in Japan were exposed in November and a third case in February.
