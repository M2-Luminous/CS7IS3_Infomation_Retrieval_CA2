In his Order of the Day at the end of the year, which was published today, Ruehe refers to the forthcoming internal restructuring, the closure of 66 command posts, and the transfer of numerous units to new locations. In view of the difficult budgetary situation, it will also be necessary in 1994 to set clear priorities and to confine activities to the "core abilities" of the armed forces which derive from "security policy requirements," the minister said. At the same time, he appealed to those responsible to make particular efforts for conscripts, despite tight resources: "Even though the money is tight, the training of our young soldiers must take a prominent position in our common efforts for a healthy Bundeswehr." In his Order of the Day, Ruehe referred in particular to the foreign missions of German servicemen. In the UN operations in Kampuchea, Somalia, Iraq, and the Adriatic as well as the aid flights to Bosnia, the Bundeswehr is fulfilling "daily the duty of Germany: People in need can count on our support." The armed forces are achieving "great things, at home and abroad" and they can be "justly proud" of this.
