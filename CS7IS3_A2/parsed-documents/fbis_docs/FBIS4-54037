Clinton described the relationship between the United States and Japan as "an important part of our long-term strategy for peace and stability and democracy in Asia." "I think the break there with the negotiations was a big plus," Clinton told reporters at a photo session with Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis. The trade accord, hammered out during a post-midnight session Tuesday after four days of intense negotiations, commits the two countries to resume "framework" talks on widening access of foreign goods to the Japanese market. The trade talks, held under the so-called "framework" accord the two countries concluded in July last year, have been stalled since they collapsed in February. Clinton said he was "very encouraged" after talking with Japan's Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata on the telephone Tuesday morning. U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said Clinton and Hata agreed, during the 14-minute phone conversation, the new agreement to restart the framework talks "shows that they can resolve issues and strengthen the relationship between the two countries."
