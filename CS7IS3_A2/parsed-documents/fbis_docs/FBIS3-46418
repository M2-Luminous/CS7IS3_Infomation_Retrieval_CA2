The F15-I jet fighter, manufactured by the U.S. Lockheed Aircraft Company, is a model of the F15-E which the company builds especially for Israel. Many consider the F15-E the most advanced jet in the world today. Ben Ami said purchasing the F15-I fighters will improve the "qualitative superiority" of the Israeli Air Force. It was reported that before Rabin made his decision, Israel compared the costs, capabilities, and other aspects of candidate planes in accordance with Israel's defense needs. Among the candidates were McDonnell's naval aircraft -- the F/A18 Hornet -- and Lockheed's F-16 double-seat fighter, with the latter being more favored. When U.S. President Clinton met with Rabin in Washington last October, he said the U.S. Government would consider exporting F15-E's to Israel; he also agreed to transfer the technology, which was unprecedented. In November, Clinton wrote to Rabin indicating he supported the project.
