FBIS4-53806 "dreas098_d_94016" FBIS-EAS-94-098 Daily Report 21 May 1994 South Korea * PRC Message Center for Koreans Planned * PRC Message Center for Koreans Planned 11111111 11111111 CSO [Editorial Report] The Seoul weekly SISA JOURNAL, in its 28 April edition on page 6 reported that the KILLIM SINMUN, a Korean-language newspaper published in Jilin, PRC, will become a message center for separated Korean families worldwide including both Koreas. The center could be operating as early as late May. This three-times-a-week, eight page newspaper's main audience is the Jilin-area Korean-Chinese. However, it is read throughout China and reaches North and South Korea, Russia, Japan, the United States, and Canada. This will be the third phase of the "Search for Separated Family Members" movement. The first was sponsored by the Korea Broadcasting System in the early 1980's, mainly for families in South Korea. The second was carried out by a private citizen dedicated to finding family members in South Korea and China. This effort, started in 1984, resolved nearly 2,700 cases. Although the KILLIM SINMUN-sponsored third phase will search worldwide, its main target is helping the thousands of separated North and South Koreans to find each other and exchange letters with families. This movement was initiated by the chief of the RENMIN RIBAO's Seoul Bureau, Pyon Yong-u, who is also KILLIM SINMUN's special correspondent in Seoul. Pyon had hoped an opening before May, but that wasn't possible because of the frozen relationship between the two Koreas. According to the SISA article, North Korea's reaction over Seoul's open criticism of North Korea's human rights stance and the Siberian loggers issue could delay things, but Pyon is optimistic. He is counting on Pyongyang's inability to stop KILLIM SINMUN from reaching North Koreans because of North Korea's relationship with China. Pyon plans to work closely with Cho Yong-sik, chairman of the Separated Families Reunion Promotion Committee in Seoul. Notices for missing family members will be published as classified advertisements and costs will be paid by the sponsors. However, the names of sponsoring companies or individuals and the adresses of the families seeking missing members will not be printed as a precaution against possible harm to North Korean families by the Pyongyang government. Pyon told SISA that he hoped this effort would speed reunification.
