He was speaking on Wednesday at a press conference for Russian and foreign journalists at the close of his working visit to the Russian capital. Yasir 'Arafat said he appreciated the fact that was the first leader of an Arab nation to be invited for a visit to the Russian Federation after radical changes in this country. Speaking about the results of his visit, 'Arafat said they were important and constructive. During his meetings with the Russian president, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and other officials 'Arafat discussed the most important problems of the Middle East region. In this context he stressed that the Middle East is for Russia not only a point on the map but actually a neighbouring region which really exists. 'Arafat said high-ranking Palestinian officials would soon arrive in Moscow to discuss the development of bilateral economic ties. As concerns Palestinian-Israeli negotiations on the procedure of implementing the Gaza-Jericho agreement, the Palestinian leader noted that they are continuing, although not always as smoothly as desired and not always in the sought direction. According to 'Arafat, Israel is constantly manoeuvering and playing for time. The Israeli troops were due to withdraw from the areas of the planned Palestinian autonomy but did not. "All attempts of our friends to stimulate the peace process have failed," 'Arafat stressed. "Despite negotiations and accords, the situation remains as it was". According to him, this trend is seen as favorable only by the extremists on both sides who want to disrupt the settlement process. "If no headway is made along the path leading to peace, the region will be engulfed by anarchy and Balkanisation," the PLO leader said. He formulated the PLO demands to the Israeli leadership -- to speed up the exact and guaranteed fulfilment of the reached agreements. Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin likes repeating that there are no sacred datelines, but there must exist commitments which must be realized without delay, 'Arafat said.
