Tchamlesso] [Text] With an impressive bureaucracy that includes 22,000 members, an ultra-sensitive budget totaling nearly $30 billion annually, and operating methods usually described as sinister and ruthless, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has a future role that evokes distrust and uncertainty today. "The CIA's worst of times" is the concise description used recently by Wolf Blitzer, a CNN correspondent attached to the White House and an expert on defense issues. This is how Wolf summarized the low spirits prevailing at the United States' foremost intelligence service during an interview last night with James Woolsey, director of the so-called "company," who was notably vague and elusive when answering questions on the CIA's real mission. Can President Bill Clinton trust the classified reports prepared daily by the intelligence community especially "now when the CIA seems to have lost its soul and is trying to find explanations to justify its existence?" Blitzer asked Woolsey. No clear reply came from the top Langley official, who is still somewhat confused by the disclosures associated with the Aldrich Ames case. Ames, a "mole" or double agent, provided extremely sensitive information to Moscow for 10 consecutive years prior to and following the Soviet Union's fall. Blitzer says the arrest of Ames and his wife, Maria del Rosario Casas, has sparked a scandal and also opened a page that reveals not only the fissures and moral decay within the CIA but also, from the operational viewpoint, the level of decline in internal security control mechanisms, which Woolsey must reevaluate. This couple's activities are something of a curiosity, because they are now being attributed to "motives of profit" as the result of receiving $2,500,000 for selling classified information first to the Soviet Union and then to Russia. Ames and his wife met and were married in 1985 in Mexico City, where both were diplomats. Some time later, Aldrich Ames was appointed chief of counterintelligence in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. He presided over the agency's much coveted and feared division located in the lower section of the CIA's Virginia executive building. The entrance hall of this building leads to a mural lined with 50 stars, each representing agents killed in action in enemy territory, according to Woolsey's explanations. Most likely the files can attest to a greater number of agents killed. According to the charges filed against Ames by a special FBI commission, he is suspected of having provided Moscow with the names and identities of 10 CIA agents infiltrated into the then Soviet KGB; moreover it is believed they were all executed for high treason. Certain experts believe Ames is now being used as a "scapegoat," because he provides the U.S. intelligence community with a reason to implement a witch-hunt with the self-evident goal of somehow justifying the predicaments through which it has gone, its lack of clear direction, as well as interagency rivalries. Now more than ever, the CIA is confronting fierce competition from other U.S. intelligence services, which include the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), the FBI, the National Security Council, which is attached to the Presidency, and the State Department's External Operations Unit. Woolsey seeks to establish more cooperation between these agencies, an objective which, according to some analysts, is difficult to accomplish. The CIA was created, supposedly, to gather information abroad, though it tends to invade the privacy of certain individuals' homes. What will it do now in the absence of concrete adversaries? In the past, the agency ordered the assassination of foreign world leaders and well-known figures, in addition to conspiring to topple "hostile" governments. With the end of an open East-West confrontation, the "company" lacks a concrete perspective of its real mission. It is walking blindly behind confusing and unpredictable objectives and goals, such as regional tensions developing in different geographical areas. Democrat Oklahoma Senator David Boren, chairman of the Senate Select Intelligence Committee, said recently it is time to define this agency's role. The agency's greatest problem is it mistakenly targets numerous objectives, which include drug trafficking, nuclear proliferation, or transshipments of missile technology, activities which it purports to control, as proclaimed by President Clinton himself, in an attempt to redefine the role of U.S. espionage. Another objective on which it focuses includes stressing intelligence gathering on the latest technological, industrial, and economical trends, even from some of the country's own Western allies. Before the collapse of the European socialist system, Washington assigned 65 percent of the CIA's budget to clandestine operations in the USSR and its Eastern allies. It presently earmarks 40 percent of the same budget to the same purpose.
