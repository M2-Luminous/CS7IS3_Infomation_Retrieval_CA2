Laurent Boussie asked Alain Juppe, minister of foreign affairs, what he was hoping for specifically from this Brussels summit. [Begin recording] [Juppe] I am hoping for three things. First, the alliance's support for the peace plan prepared by the European Union. It is the only one existing, and now we have to make commitments. Then the reaffirmation by the alliance that it is ready to go to the area, to guarantee the application of the peace plan, if it is signed. Third and finally, the willingness of the countries of the alliance to help the United Nations to get the Security Council resolutions respected, be it the reinforcement of ground troops, or the establishment of air protection when needed. [Boussie] Isn't this hope a bit feeble given the dramatic nature of the situation? [Juppe] I am well aware that any diplomatic gesture is insufficient today, in comparison with the terrible reality. I think that it can be useful, and it will enable European foreign ministries, in particular the French Foreign Ministry, to get back into contact with the parties very quickly, to tell them: you must stop now, or else there will be a disaster, because the question of maintaining the troops there in their current form will inevitably arise if the killings do not stop.
