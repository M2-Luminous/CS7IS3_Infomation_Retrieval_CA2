In Marrakesh 124 negotiating partners gave their assent to the final act. This is a milestone in trade policy. With a new framework for world trade, important conditions for promoting investments and for creating jobs have been set down. The Marrakesh agreement is of outstanding importance for Germany. The export-oriented German economy -- one out of three jobs in Germany depends on exports -- will benefit from the progress made in liberalization. GATT no longer is just an empty term. The Marrakesh agreements are important for all people, also in our country. All those who believed that they could hide behind the walls of protectionism or could avoid structural changes have been wrong. The strong approval for GATT and the newly founded World Trade Organization (WTO) clearly shows: The countries in this world want free trade, and they want to face up to the structural change, because they know this is the only way to ensure growth, employment, and prosperity in the long run. The festive signing was preceded by a negotiation marathon that lasted seven years, a marathon with many difficulties and obstacles. In the course of these seven years profound political and economic changes took place. In addition, there were disparities and controversies among the partners to the negotiations. Often it was difficult to overcome these things. Because of our elementary interest in the liberalization of world trade, during the entire period of negotiations the Federal Government worked emphatically, also in Brussels, for steps of liberalization that are as far-reaching as possible. In this connection, it was necessary to balance the differing interests within the European Community, if possible without losing too much of the substance with regard to the planned liberalization. In particular in the final stage of the negotiations in December 1993, the Federal Government made an essential contribution to facilitating the conclusion of the Uruguay Round. We were successful in bridging opposing views, in particular toward our French partners. In view of the difficult course of the negotiations, I am extremely satisfied that we have managed to achieve an agreement of this quality. First, we have achieved far-reaching progress in liberalization in many fields. Thus, customs duties are reduced by more than one-third on average for access of industrial goods to the market. The average customs rate for industrial goods is now no longer 6.3 percent but only 3.9 percent. Second, the agreement on trade in services, which exists in this field for the first time, is an outstanding success. It brings internationally valid obligations for granting most-favored-nation status, market access, and national treatment. Germany, the world's fourth largest exporter of services, will benefit from this agreement in a special way. Services constitute about one-quarter of all German exports. Even more important is their contribution to employment. Of the 7 million people employed in German export business, about one-third are working in the service sector. The new multilateral framework will enable the service sector to make further progress because of its positive effects on growth and employment. Third -- and this was urgently necessary -- we have achieved better protection of intellectual property. The agreement expands legal protection and, for the first time, links it with regulations to enforce these rights. Fourth, for textile and clothing trade we have achieved that this sector is reintegrated gradually in the GATT agreements, in the GATT rules in the course of a few years. This is in the interest of both the industrial countries and the developing countries. Fifth, for the agricultural sector we have achieved that agricultural production and agricultural trade will be integrated more strongly in the GATT and brought closer to the GATT. This also establishes the preconditions for greater market orientation of this sector. Last, but not least: The newly founded WTO will contribute to strengthening the multilateral trade system. GATT will be replaced, and this new WTO will replace it. It will contribute to the permanent progress and implementation in this organization of the process of trade alleviations, customs reductions, improvements in services, which has been concluded with the Uruguay Round for the time being. Even more important is: With this WTO we will for the first time create a functioning instrument of arbitration. Then world trade will work less along the lines of "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth." If one has to accept real or supposed trade problems and measures by another country, one simply does not react with retaliation. Rather, things are to be settled if possible in this international institution for arbitration. This is a very great progress; this is a breakthrough in world trade. Here I have to note that I suggested to bring the WTO to Bonn. This is an idea which we have to discuss, which we have to prepare. The question of the seat is still open. Other states, such as Sweden, Canada, and, of course, Switzerland, where the GATT Secretariat has its seat now, are also trying to get the WTO. However, I think that Bonn, a city in the heart of Europe with an excellent infrastructure, would be a serious applicant, a good applicant. My ministry is preparing the application. I do not hide the fact that the Uruguay Round has not solved all problems. Additional negotiations are necessary, primarily for the service sector and here in particular regarding financial services, but also in ocean traffic. The audiovisual sector has not been finally settled. We will have to discuss a multilateral agreement about civilian planes and also a multilateral settlement for steel. All this is confronting us, but it cannot diminish the value of GATT and Marrakesh. Let me say a few brief words on the ongoing so-called banana war. In Marrakesh we achieved the protection of our German legal position within the European Community. The lawsuit at the European Court of Justice has not been prejudiced, it continues. Shortly before the signing of the agreement in Marrakesh, one of our most important partners signed an agreement about government purchases, thus establishing complicated interlacements of our banana market regulation. We were able to defend ourselves against that. It was not easy, but we managed. In any case, this was a fact with which we enforced our views clearly and unambiguously on the basis of a correct position. Ladies and Gentlemen, Sir Leon Brittan, who headed the negotiations for the European Union, spoke of a new trade policy vision in connection with the GATT agreement. Now it is necessary to fill this trade policy vision with life. Only then will it develop its specific use. Even though it is difficult to give an exact figure for the expected economic profit, this has been tried several times -- with impressive results. The OECD puts the increase in prosperity for the international economy at about $270 billion in 2002 after the implementation of the liberalization agreement. Furthermore, the GATT Secretariat expects world trade to be about $755 billion higher in 10 years as a result of the Uruguay Round than if the status quo were continued. I repeat, Ladies and Gentlemen: The results of the Uruguay Round will benefit all participants in the developing countries and in the developed world. I say this with a particular view to our partners in the developing countries: Safeguarding the interests of the developing countries remains one of the central negotiation results. In particular in the new WTO we will continue to pursue the further deepening of the integration of the developing countries in the multilateral trade system. In addition, in Marrakesh we made a statement of commitment to the developing countries: We will examine the effects of the Uruguay Round with a view to supporting positive measures to achieve their development goals. Ladies and Gentlemen, a great number of countries have applied for membership in GATT or in the new WTO. This is incontrovertible proof of the attractiveness of the multilateral trade system. At the same time it is proof of the WTO's ability to function. The Federal Government advocates making open-minded and speedy progress with these negotiations for membership. In particular the countries of the former East Bloc must be given prospects for membership. Their membership will essentially contribute to the success of the process of structural reforms. There are also many new complicated and controversial topics that will shortly be on the agenda of trade policy bodies. These include the tensions between trade and environment. Trade and environmental policy are closely linked. Thus, many products can hardly be produced or transported all over the world without this having an effect on the environment. Conversely, national environmental policy can influence international trade; just think of different standards which affect the costs of production in specific places. This is considered by some to be a threat. They even speak of environmental dumping. And now the establishment of a committee in the WTO -- as this was decided in Marrakesh -- will take the issue of globally effective environmental protection a decisive step forward. We have agreed on this and we see this body as a suitable institution for discussing these important interrelations. Just as full of tension and politically highly sensitive is the other group of topics, namely labor and social standards. Ladies and Gentlemen, no one can accept exploiting children's labor, labor by prisoners, and forced labor. We must work with determination for overcoming these unbearable conditions in the world. For this purpose we need a consensus, we need cooperation, and, if necessary, also political pressure. However, Ladies and Gentlemen, we do not want to establish any new barriers which would further exacerbate the cycle of poverty, unemployment, and children's labor. We want a multilateral discussion to which all participants make their contributions. It is very important that this discussion takes place in the appropriate bodies -- in the bodies of the United Nations and the International Labor Organization, for instance. This discussion will certainly also be held in the WTO. However, it must not dominate or even paralyze the work of the WTO. And one thing must be clear: Neither environmental protection nor labor and social standards must be turned into vehicles for trade restrictions. Some people are just waiting to revive protectionism in the world with this vehicle. We would all suffer from that and in particular those would suffer who want to improve the world's environmental and social standards. A third important topic affects the relationship between trade and competition policy. Cross-border investments as well as global activities by multinational companies often avoid the control of usual regulations for competition, even though they often distort competition or restrict trade. We can observe that political pressure is growing to react to these distortions with trade policy measures. Such a development could counteract and devalue the new GATT agreements and concessions. Therefore, the whether and how of an international competitive order should be discussed soon. The temptation to give oneself onesided advantages and to protect oneself against competition through protectionism will exist also in the future. Our signature under the Uruguay agreement and the adoption of the statement of Marrakesh commit us to not giving in to this temptation. Ladies and Gentlemen, in the future as in the past I consider it my priority task as German economics minister to oppose protectionism wherever it appears. In our economic policy the strengthening of the German competitive position on the world's market, in particular on the booming markets in Asia, for instance, but also in Latin America, is of particular importance. GATT will that make easier for us. GATT is a contribution to overcoming the recession and also to solving the structural problems. GATT will contribute to giving Germany new opportunities for employment.
