FR940429-0-00007 FR940429-0-00004 14 CFR Part 73 [Airspace Docket No. 93&hyph;ANM&hyph;44] Revocation of Restricted Area R&hyph;6707; Queets, WA AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This action removes Restricted Area R&hyph;6707, Queets, WA. A Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) review of annual utilization data for R&hyph;6707 revealed that the area is no longer required for its designated purpose. The Department of the Navy subsequently submitted a proposal to remove the restricted area. EFFECTIVE DATE: 0901 u.t.c., June 23, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ken McElroy, Military Operations Program Office (ATM&hyph;420), Office of Air Traffic System Management, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20591; telephone: (202) 267&hyph;7686. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Rule This amendment to part 73 of the Federal Aviation Regulations revokes Restricted Area R&hyph;6707, Queets, WA. An FAA review of the annual utilization reports revealed that this area received limited use in the past year. After reviewing its operational requirements, the Department of the Navy submitted a proposal to disestablish the area. This action returns restricted airspace to public use; therefore, I find that notice and public procedure under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are unnecessary because this action is a minor technical amendment in which the public would not be particularly interested. Section 73.67 of part 73 of the Federal Aviation Regulations was republished in FAA Order 7400.8A dated March 3, 1993. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Environmental Review In accordance with FAA Order 1050.1D, ``Policies and Procedures for Considering Environmental Impacts,'' this action is not subject to environmental assessments and procedures.
