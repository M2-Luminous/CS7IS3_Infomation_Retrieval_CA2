He was tied up with representatives from the German government's development wing, and then another man, Mr Gopichand Hinduja, who also appeared to have lots of money, an aide explained. The new deputy foreign minister's willingness to make time for wealthy and influential people like Mr Hinduja -- said to be the 10th-richest man in the world -- became clear as he explained the new government's pragmatic and interest-driven foreign policy. Simply put, it entailed being very nice to the rich and powerful, nice to the potentially rich and powerful and kind to old friends who were neither. Although Mr Pahad would blanche at such a crude assessment, he agreed that gone were the days of making friends for friends' sake to further partisan objectives. It is a whole new game for a man who spent a good part of his ANC career trying to isolate South Africa, and a department which devoted itself to sanctions-busting and forming ties with everyone that would have it. Like all the other ministries under the new government, South Africa's foreign policy priorities are dictated by the need to ensure the Reconstruction and Development Programme's [RDP] success. "Our priority is making sure that the country has a sustainable, growing economy, otherwise the Reconstruction and Development Programme will remain an empty theoretical concept," Mr Pahad said. The job of the Foreign Affairs department was to promote and sell this programme abroad to secure foreign resources as swiftly as possible. Mr Pahad firmly ruled out the sale of grand embassies and art works as mooted by Minister Without Portfolio Jay Naidoo. The resources he speaks of are investment, favourable trading terms, development aid and soft loans. Given South Africa's sanctions-battered past, the focus will be to increase favourable economic relations with its traditional trading partners -- the United States and the European Union. But, Mr Pahad said, South Africa would also be looking beyond traditional partners to expand economic relations with, among others, Canada, Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, India, the People's Republic of China and Latin America. Another area where links were unexplored was the Middle East, not only for trade, investment and tourism but for oil, he said. There were also important new friends to consolidate politically in the context of being the new government. These would include China, which was sympathetic to the ANC as a liberation movement, and Russia, whose relationship with the ANC changed with the collapse of communism at the turn of the decade. Both these countries are permanent members of the UN Security Council. As there were scores of other developing countries on the lookout for favourable relations with the most important economic and political blocs -- the EU, NAFTA and the Association of South East Asian Nations -- SA [South Africa] had to capitalise on the enormous goodwill that existed since the successful elections, and keep it going, said Mr Pahad. South Africa had two aces to play in this regard. The first was its moral status in the world. The second, its position in an increasingly marginalised continent. Despite all gloomy predictions, South Africa became the example of the "best miracle of the century". "We have captured the moral high ground in non-racialism, democracy and conflict resolution to become the world leader in this arena." But, more importantly, it had become imperative for the rest of the world that this success story continued. For if South Africa were to fail -- and its success depended on consolidating democracy with economic growth -- there would be serious consequences for other countries' internal policies on democracy and racism. "They see our success as a godsend to a more healthy approach to politics. They want us to succeed." Another ace was South Africa's position in the continent of Africa. "If we don't sink, they see the hope that the region won't sink, and if the region doesn't sink they see some hope of a breakthrough in the development of other parts of Africa." This brings him to South Africa's second foreign policy priority -- its relationship with the southern African region, which, he says, is fundamental to South Africa's broader interests. President Nelson Mandela's reception at the OAU summit this week as the messiah of the continent highlighted the important role that South Africa could play in the continent. However, South Africa will have to be careful to straddle the demands and expectations of the rest of Africa with pragmatic policies. Mr Pahad once again has a realistic attitude towards relations with Africa. "Unless we can achieve mutually beneficial development in our region, we will not be able to tackle effectively our international or regional challenges," he said. This translates into developing regional co-operation by joining the SADC [South African Development Community] and rationalising the many regional institutions like the SA Customs Union and the Preferential Trade Agreement. He stops at integration. This was a long-term vision and would be dictated by the process of co-operation. It would also be in South Africa's interests to ensure stability in both the region and the continent. A lot of time would be spent strengthening OAU mechanisms for conflict resolution. Mr Pahad sees regional cooperation extending not only to areas of economic development but to basic issues like gun-smuggling, drug-peddling, refugees and illegal immigrants. He distinguished between illegal immigrants and refugees, the latter which South Africa would deal with according to internationally accepted conventions. "But we cannot turn a blind eye to illegal immigrants. We are going to have to deal with this in a way that protects the interests of our country. We must have an effective immigration policy and apply it justly and humanely." It was in this context that regional development became a priority for SA. "If you don't have mutually advantageous regional development, illegal immigrants will come to South Africa. And, given that our borders are so big, we will not be able to prevent it". On the question of the country's role in the OAU, Mr Pahad said that with its expertise in many fields South Africa could help the organisation become a more effective body on the continent and in the United Nations. Implicit in this is South Africa's desire to be the first African country to take a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. The government's policy of making new friends and extending South Africa's profile into uncharted territories would not mean establishing diplomatic missions everywhere in the world, he said. This would be dictated by the budget and the national interest and would entail downscaling some embassies, having one diplomatic representatives serving several countries, upgrading priority areas and establishing links with countries with perceived potential. One example under debate was the policy towards the People's Republic of China and Taiwan. He pointed out that, should South Africa establish diplomatic ties with the PRC, it would have to forego long-established diplomatic ties with Taiwan. The PRC was important for South Africa not only because of the enormous trade potential, but also because it was a permanent member of the UN Security Council. Taiwan was however, one of South Africa's largest trading partners. "In the final analysis, our decision will be determined by our own interests and international precedents." Mr Pahad stressed that foreign policy would not be dictated only by South Africa's interests. However, establishing friendships and coming to the rescue of friends did not necessitate establishing embassies in these countries. "There are other forms of interaction and co-operation."
