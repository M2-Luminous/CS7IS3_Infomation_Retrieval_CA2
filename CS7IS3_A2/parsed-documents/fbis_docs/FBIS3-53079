Sources close to Rafsanjani yesterday revealed that the president was "deeply resentful" of the repeated discovery of corruption cases in all government ministries and establishments. A total of 106 cases of corruption were uncovered in the past six months including sums exceeding $1.5 billion in 13 government departments, nine state banks, two government-owned insurance companies, and seven universities and research centers. The corruption cases even reached the establishments created by the mullas supposedly for charity. Two such establishments have been accused of involvement in the black market, smuggling, and extortion of funds from independent businessmen. The discovery of these cases has resulted in the arrest of 80 people including 22 senior banking officials. In the case of one bank, almost all its senior officials have been jailed. In a speech at Tehran University yesterday, Rafsanjani admitted that his government is facing "serious difficulties" because of the drop in oil revenues. He said his government intends to cut expenditures considerably and launch a campaign against extravagance and corruption. According to a source close to Rafsanjani, the Iranian president will not be able to carry out the required "purge" operation because of the restrictions on his powers under the Constitution. Khamene'i, whose powers are unlimited under the Constitution, is the only person who can authorize Rafsanjani to launch such a campaign which could "touch some important figures including prominent mullas."
