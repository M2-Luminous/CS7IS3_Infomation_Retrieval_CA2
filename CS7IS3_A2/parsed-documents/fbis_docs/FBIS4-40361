Luzhkov said he was certain that if implemented, it would push down crime rates in Moscow and elsewhere in Russia. Mayor Luzhkov was speaking at a banquet with US businessmen in the Slavyanskaya hotel. He said that "touring criminals" were responsible for 40 percent of crimes in Moscow and that the controversial registration of foreigners in the capital and improved supply of police with advanced hardware had had a certain effect already, although there was still much room for improvement. Luzhkov said that additional measures were necessary and he promised they would be taken in the near future. Asked about the dispute between the Mayor's office and the State Property Committee over privatization in Moscow, Luzhkov said that he saw President Yeltsin's instruction to Anatoly Chubais "not to touch" Moscow as a victory of common sense, and not of the mayor. Luzhkov said that from now on property in Moscow would not be privatized indiscriminately, and not at next to nothing, but for real prices and on a contest basis to ensure that Moscow's real estate end up in the hands of real owners, and not black-market brokers. Mayor Luzhkov invited US businessmen to be more bold in investing into joint projects, saying that in one year Moscow was capable of accepting up to two billion dollars of investments into all businesses. On guarantees for investors Luzhkov said that the government of Moscow had set up a reserve fund to compensate for losses that may be sustained by joint ventures in case of force majeure.
