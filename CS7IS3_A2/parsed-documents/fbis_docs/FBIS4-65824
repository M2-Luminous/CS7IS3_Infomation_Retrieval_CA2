Last night, UN alternate spokesman 'Ahmad Fawzi said the report would be submitted by the end of the week and clarified that the international organization has no information that Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas has accepted the confidence-building measures [CBM's]. But the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation correspondent in New York reported that according to UN Security Council circles, after intervention by Turkish diplomats, the Turkish side has been given a new extension until the end of May. According to the same information, Inal Batu, the Turkish permanent representative to the United Nations, sought a meeting with Marrack Goulding, Alternate UN Secretary General, at which time he conveyed a Turkish Government request that the report not be submitted before 31 May. His justification was that the Turkish Cypriot community is still holding meetings with Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's alternate special representative in Cyprus. The Turkish representative also claimed that Denktas informed Ankara of his decision to accept the 21 March UN document on the CBM's but said he could not announce it to Feissel before the extraordinary meetings of the pseudogovernment and the pseudoparliament today and tomorrow respectively. According to our correspondent, UN Security Council circles said the Turkish side was given the requested extension after it was stressed that no new extension would be given. U.S. officials said an extension would not be given even for the so-called referendum that Denktas may attempt to hold.
