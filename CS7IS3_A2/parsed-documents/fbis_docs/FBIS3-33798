And workers demonstrate against rising prices as well as unemployment, corruption spreads, and hardliners denounce the abandonment of revolutionary ideals. When the Islamic revolution triumphed on February 1, 1979 in the name of the have-nots, it made austerity a virtue and nationalized entire sectors of the economy. A decade and a half later, Iran has reversed course and headed toward a market economy, a process which has plunged the government into an unprecedented crisis and hit the poor severely. The liberalization drive was launched by President 'Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani, just one year after the revolution's charismatic leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeyni, died in 1989. Hoping to revive an economy disrupted first by the revolution and then by the 1980-1988 war with Iraq, Hashemi-Rafsanjani steadily removed subsidies, started monetary reform, and backed privatization of industry and services. He allowed foreign products back into Iran and urged wealthy Iranians who had fled abroad during the revolution to return home. Liberalization filled stores with goods, plunged the country into a spending spree after a decade of scarcity, and brought new life into the Tehran Bazaar, the economy's traditional driving force. It also led to new fortunes for those who invested in real estate. Tehran's relationship with Washington is a symbol of its current pragmatism. While the leadership and the press continue to label Washington as the "Great Satan" and the revolution's foremost enemy, the United States in the past few years has become one of Iran's main trading partners. But this "second revolution" is going through increasingly hard times as the government fails to control it properly and some politicians and religious figures slow it down for fear of its social consequences. The return to a market economy and a sharp depreciation of the rial have produced runaway inflation and impoverished much of the population who can no longer afford many items especially as subsidies have been withdrawn. Corruption, which had disappeared in the first few years after the revolution, has returned at an alarming pace. Uncontrolled imports combined with falling oil revenues have placed Iran on the brink of bankruptcy. According to western sources, Iran for the first time in its history is unable to reimburse its debts, and has accumulated 13 billion dollars in arrears in 18 months. The figure amounts to one year of oil revenue. The austerity policy Iran has adopted to overcome the financial crisis has led to a steep fall in imports over the past year but at the same time sparked a crisis for industry which depends heavily on imported equipment. Many factories are currently working at half or quarter capacity. For the first time since the revolution, tens of thousands of workers have been laid off, which has aggravated social tension. The current crisis, the most serious since the revolution, has sparked sometimes brisk debate between free-market supporters and an increasing number who back a return to revolutionary basics and a centralized economy. As the debate continues, many Iranian and foreign economic observers do not rule out that the government -- divided and unable to assume the political price of its reforms -- might turn inward again.
