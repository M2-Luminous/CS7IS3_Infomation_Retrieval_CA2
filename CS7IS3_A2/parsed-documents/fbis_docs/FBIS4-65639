This lack of political will, he noted, contributed to the current deadlock in the confidence-building measures. Receiving the credentials of new German Ambassador to Cyprus Friedrich Garbers, President Kliridhis said he appreciated Germany's position in promoting a Cyprus solution and maintaining UNFICYP [UN Forces in Cyprus]. President Kliridhis stressed: The people of Cyprus look forward to the day when the Nicosia wall will be demolished, just like the Berlin Wall. Presenting his credentials, the new German ambassador expressed the conviction that mutual trust is necessary between the two sides and added that it should be built soon through measures such as those proposed by the UN secretary general. He also said that the German Government welcomes the European Union's [EU] recognition of Cyprus' European identity, thus confirming the expectation of full accession to the EU. Garbers is 62, and a career diplomat. He has served in Milan, Helsinki, Nairobi, and Rome.
