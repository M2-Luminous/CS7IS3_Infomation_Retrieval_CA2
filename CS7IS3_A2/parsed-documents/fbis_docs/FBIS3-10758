Regarding these problems, Ramirez pointed out that the Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE] decided to transfer polling stations from four Chalatenango Department municipalities to the departmental capital. He noted that this violates the Electoral Code. Mario Jovel filed this report: [Jovel] Dr. Ramirez was displeased with the TSE plan to transfer polling stations from several Chalatenango municipalities to the departmental capital. The Onusal chief said that transfer is unjustified and violates the Electoral Code. [Begin Ramirez recording] It is indispensable that we consult with the municipal electoral boards and the supervision [vigilancia] board. The latter, in an announcement on 8 March -- according to information available to me -- did not recommend this transfer. [end recording] [Jovel] Ramirez added that despite efforts by the TSE, Onusal, and political parties to overcome problems with requests to enter names on the voter rolls without the prior submission of identity documents, there are still 75,000 people unable to obtain their cards. The diplomat said that 45 [word indistinct] points were established where requests may be rejected. Most of these, he added, are located in former conflict zones. But this is not enough to claim that there is any sort of fraud: [Begin Ramirez recording] The 75,000 [word indistinct] not supported by identity documents are distributed proportionally throughout the country. They are distributed on the basis of electoral volume [volumenes electorales]. In other words, it is difficult to determine just who is affected by this situation. [end recording] [Jovel] The Onusal chief noted that not all the news is bad. For example, the 2.3 million citizens supplied with voter identity cards -- a figure predicted by his organization -- was increased by 100,000. Ramirez added that this represents 90 percent of the potential vote, the highest ever for the country in its electoral history. [Announcer] In this regard, Dr. Jaime Romero Ventura, TSE magistrate for Arena [Nationalist Republican Alliance], said that Article 117 of the Electoral Code has definitely not been violated, because the decision to transfer ballot boxes to Chalatenango was made in consultation with the departmental boards. Erwin Gongora filed this report. [Gongora] Dr. Romero stated emphatically that the decision to transfer ballot boxes from certain Chalatenango Department municipalities for the elections arose from an agreement with the departmental boards and was not an arbitrary decision. This change in polling stations, the Arena magistrate added, is being made for specific reasons. [Begin Romero recording] First, 90 percent of the residents of those four municipalities live in the departmental capital. Second, two of these municipalities don't have electricity or telephone service. This would hinder the forwarding of results. [end recording] [Gongora] Romero pointed out this is not an isolated case, as similar instances have been reported, including those in Colon in La Libertad and San Francisco Menendez in Ahuachapan, where the same request was made for similar reasons. He also explained why approximately 79,000 people will not be able to obtain their voter identity cards in time to vote on 20 March. [Begin Romero recording] Specifically, the 79,000 people were not validated because their birth certificates are not registered in the corresponding municipalities. Thus, we do not have those files. I want you to know that these 79,000 citizens who unfortunately will be unable to vote are dispersed throughout the country. Actually they live in municipalities destroyed by the FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] during the war. [end recording] [Gongora] Romero also announced that the TSE has redoubled security upon the discovery by state intelligence organs of a plot by unidentified people to seize the TSE computer center. He added that the goal of this action is the destabilization of the electoral process.
