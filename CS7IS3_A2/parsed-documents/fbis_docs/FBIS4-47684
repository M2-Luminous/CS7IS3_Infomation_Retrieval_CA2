The question that's being asked is: Where are we now? I'd like to deal with that and answer questions afterwards from anybody who wants further clarity. An election consists basically of three phases: the voting phase, the counting phase, and the calculation phase. We are now in the counting phase where the millions of ballots that were cast are being reconciled and counted. I'm aware of the fact that there is impatience. I have a great deal of sympathy with that, but I must say that from the first press interview that I held months ago I have been at pains to meet precisely this impatience. We have said in the IEC, from day one, it is going to take time to do the counting and it is taking time, and we're not worried about that. It must take time. Let us get a few things clear. Number one, this is a people's election like this country has never seen. It involves the remotest villages in the far reaches of Venda, to the green hills of Zululand, now KwaZulu, to the mountains and crags of the Transkei, and for the very self-same reasons that it is difficult to get the ballots out there, it is difficult to get them back. It's not unexpected and it's not alarming. It is simply an inevitable consequence of the election that we are involved in. That is why we at the IEC have consistently said, be patient. Now the very transportation and communication and logistical problems that resulted in our starting late with the voting, have had a knock-on effect on the counting which is obvious. You can't start counting till all of the voting has been done. The very self-same communications problems in getting the ballots out there, up into the hills, are encountered in getting them back again, and you can't start counting until you've got all of them back. That takes time. Moreover, it's not only a people's election in terms of the electorate. It was made clear from the outset that this was to be an election for all South Africans, run by all South Africans. That means that there are tens of thousands of people involved in the process who have never been involved in such a process before. There are tens of thousands out there who have difficulty in dealing with the painstaking accounting processes involved in making a return in respect of an election. That has caused us problems. I tell you that frankly. ballot boxes have been returned not in a meticulous fashion. Also in many places, because of the very nature of the election where we had no voters' roll, the turnout at some voting stations was very much higher than anybody had anticipated, and that resulted in the voting process being overloaded. One of the problems was that the ballot boxes became overfull. Some presiding officers, using commendable initiative, took emergency measures at the time, emptied that ballot box into a container and replaced the ballot box in the voting station to enable the people to exercise their democratic right to vote. Now to a meticulous election administrator, opening a ballot box in the voting station is a surprising step to take. The presiding officers in those voting stations had a choice. They either had to turn the voters away, or they had to make a plan, and they made a plan, and that plan is not such a bad plan in retrospect. The alternative would have been much worse. The people were patient, but if there had been further blockages in the voting process, the consequences could have been grave. But this means that when you get to the counting stage, you've got a problem at the outset where you have to do a reconciliation of ballot papers issued to the presiding officer, ballot papers returned with votes cast, rejected ballot papers where people have asked for a new one because they had made a mistake on the first one, and unused returned ballot papers. Now where you have not got the ballots in a sealed box, that return is of relatively little value, and the reconciliation becomes very, very difficult. I went to Nasrec [National Exhibition Center] this afternoon, which is a very big counting station, and I took the opportunity to go to each of the counting points in that complex and explained to the party representatives there gathered, and to all of the officials of the IEC, that what is important is to get the count done. The reconciliation, which is so complex in these circumstances, should take a back seat. What is important is that the people who have voted now want to hear the results. It means, and I put it bluntly, it means departing from the prescribed procedure, the prescribed procedure which is a carefully worked out set of returns that must balance with one another. But the IEC resolves this afternoon, that the counting process cannot be held up by these reconciliation procedures. And I want to explain why we did so, and why we think that it is the best in the circumstances. Our Electoral Act is a very strange document and provides for a truly unique election. In the first instance of course it's unique to us because we've never had a proportional representational election in the country at all. Those of us who have been privileged to vote have known a constituency based election. This is a different type of election. In the second place, and more significantly, this is an election in which nobody was obliged to vote at a particular voting station. You could vote at the point of your choice. So there could be no prediction as to how many people could be anticipated at any one voting station. In the third instance, nobody really knew what the extent of the electorate was. The statistics were the subject of a great deal of debate, and on virtually only one thing the statisticians could agree, and that nobody could be certain within reasonable tolerances. The experience of the last few days would indicate that most of those estimates were substantially too low. I put that guardedly, advisedly, because that impression may not eventually prove to have been valid. But the most important unique feature of this election is that there was no voters' roll. Therefore, the ordinary kind of return rendered by a presiding officer was of very, very limited value. If I could use the image of plotting a point on map, you really need three lines to cross before you've got a reasonably accurate fixing of that point. Two lines get you nowhere and one line is totally useless. Now what we have here is a return by the presiding officer of the ballots issued to him, and a return eventually of the ballots he brings back to the counting station, broken down into those votes cast, those not used, and those spoilt. And it gladdens a bureaucrat's heart to see that reconciliation, but upon analysis it tells you nothing of any consequence. Unless you have an accurate indication of the people who had voted, you do not have the third line in order to plot your point. If I can make it as plain as I can, all that reconciliation tells you is what the presiding officer received, and what he is giving back, but it doesn't tell you how many ballots he is giving back with votes cast by voters. He is giving you a return of the seats and returns, and nothing else. Unless and until you can check that against a voters' roll, or possibly a turnstile which would give you numbers of people that entered, you do not have real verification. Each and every ballot cast must have on the back of it the identifying stamp of that voting station. Without that stamp that ballot is automatically rejected. That is a safeguard against someone who does not have access to the stamp stuffing the ballot box. But of course there is nothing in the procedure that prevents a corrupt presiding officer from putting the stamps on the back of ballots that he fills in to his or her choice. But that is the process we've got, and that is the process that the act creates, and that's the one we've got to live with. You are reliant upon the integrity and the fear of detection of the presiding officer, the vigilance of the party agents and of the others in the voting station. Reconciliation in those circumstances is of minimal value. It is of course so that it is a safeguard against him removing ballot papers, but then he could replace them with others at will if he wished to be dishonest. That is why we said, inasmuch as so many inexperienced people had rendered defective returns and inasmuch as the reconciliation rarely served, ultimately, no real purpose. If you can reconcile, by all means do so, and if you can't reconcile, note each one of the defects, note the objections of the parties, if any, if they can't resolve it, and carry on with the counting, because what is announced is not the result but the tally and that tally, we at the IEC will have to evaluate in the light of the nature and extent of the imperfections and the reconciliation process, the nature and the extent of the objections, and the degree to which the parties may have agreed in respect of some of it. That is calculated to shorten the procedure with minimal risk to the veracity of the result. If I can put it this way: As far as we are concerned, the election is about national reconciliation, not ballot reconciliation. Let's forget about the formalities. Let's get on with finding out what the people said they want. Thank you. [Cronje] Thank you, Judge Kriegler. Could I hand over to Professor Walter Kamba, one of the IEC's international commissioners, to give you his opinion on this election? Prof. Kamba. [Kamba] Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. May I start by saying this has been a remarkable election -- remarkable in a number of ways. Firstly, in relation to its magnitude, its size. Secondly, in relation to the circumstances in which the election is being held. It has been a mammoth task never seen before -- organized by a nation. The size of the bureaucracy that has had to be established in so short a time is absolutely incredible, and the commission has been mandated with the responsibility of running such an enormous event within a very short time, putting up such a large size of civil servants, if one may call them that, a lot of them with no experience whatsoever in running an election. The logistical arrangements that have had to be made have been equally of enormous size and the sheer logistics of getting polling stations, counting stations, delivery of various material, has been of enormous size, and the commission is very much aware that there has been a lot of imperfections. But if you take into account those factors that I have indicated, and also the manner in which a number of issues have been chopped and changed as we proceeded to the final stage, have added enormous difficulties to the whole process. Reports from you of how the actual voting process proceeded were characterized by the great commitment, the enthusiasm, the determination of the voters to go to the polls, and their attitude which they have reflected -- how they regarded this as a major event in their lives, particularly those who were first-time voters, but even those who had votes before -- they had never voted in any election of this kind. This is a national event to which the nation is committed, and the mandate of the IEC was really to deliver this election in the most difficult of circumstances, so when one comes to evaluate the election one must evaluate it in that context, and those who have complaints must really channel the complaints along the procedures that have been indicated, so that those complaints can be looked into and be added to the factors that have to be taken into account in coming to a final decision. The fundamental element in the election is to ensure that the country, its voters, have expressed their view in an atmosphere in which there is virtually no violence, virtually no intimidation, and we have seen, we have witnessed, the environment in which voters have streamed to the polls. It has been clear that whatever violence that existed prior to the actual polling process was almost absent when it came to the voters expressing their view. Procedures have been set up to deal with the question of counting, to deal with how you handle ballot boxes, how they should be submitted. I think we have set up adequate procedures to ensure that each vote that is counted can be said to be a valid vote, and that, I think, to me and to the commission, is what is of fundamental importance. If at the end of the day we can say the votes that were cast -- the votes that all parties who attend the counting centers -- can themselves agree the valid votes were in fact so, and that this determines the ultimate result of the elections. [sentence as heard] And I, as one of the international members who had participated in the process, I think we have done what we can to reinforce the impartiality, the independence, of the electoral commission, and to the extent humanly possible, to ensure that at the end of the day we can say the votes cast were valid votes, and represent the choice of the people of South Africa. Thank you. [Cronje] Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. We will ask you to identify yourself please. At this stage, to give everyone a fair chance, limited to one question, no supplementaries please. Can we start? Karen? [Correspondent Karen Bruinaard] My question is directed to Mr. Justice Kriegler. Sir, you took a very bold step, if I am correct, in deciding to overthrow a very important safety precaution, when you decided not to take reconciliation into account in certain circumstances. My question is: Will this speed up the process? On the other hand, we saw tonight that more or less one percent of the total vote has been counted so far. When do you expect a tally, or even a final outcome? Could it be before Friday? Thank you. [Kriegler] I take it that both questions were facetious. If I didn't make it plain, I will do so afterwards. I don't want to take up time unnecessarily. I will explain precisely why it is not a valuable safeguard at all. It is no safeguard at all if you haven't got a voters' roll or a count, an independent count of voters, but we can debate it afterwards. With regard to the second, most certainly before Friday. [Cronje] Pierre? [Correspondent Pierre Classen] Can I also address the judge please? Could you tell us, in making this modification to the procedures, did you get the approval or condoning of the parties concerned, and do you think that after the result they will still in a good spirit accept your decision in this matter? [Kriegler] Did you say the last.... [Classen, interrupting] The political parties, and after the result, do you think they will still accept your decision in this matter in good spirit? [Kriegler] I have no doubt that they will. They, the politicians, know precisely what the minimal value is of the process as it is, and I discussed with a committee out at Nasrec [National Exhibition Center] this afternoon, I discussed it with some of the major parties. Quite frankly, it's a decision that the IEC has to take and has to live with, and I am happy that I can justify it to any political party. [Cronje] Over here please. [Correspondent Michael Collins] Kind of the same question. Before the election there were a number of safeguards that were apparently deemed necessary -- the printing of special ballots with counterfoils outside the country, the fact that ballot boxes would remain sealed, the fact that reconciliation was to take place. With all of these revised because of the circumstances of the election, are you confident that there is no chance for fraud on a significant scale, and do you believe that the parties, especially the parties that are not the main two parties, who have already been making allegations of irregularities, will accept this as a legitimate revision of the Electoral Act? [Kriegler] I am indeed satisfied, and the commission is satisfied, that provided a ballot bears the official mark of the particular voting station, the prospect of there being significant fraud is very small indeed. [Cronje] Anton Fisher? [Correspondent Anton Fisher] Judge, I wanted to ask you -- the sort of shifting reconciliation to the back seat and the modifications that have been mentioned -- how do you think this is going to impact on the credibility of the election and the announcement of a free and fair election? [Kriegler] That's precisely why I'm here -- to answer each and every question about it, because we are satisfied that it does not affect the credibility, and we wish to take the people with us in that belief. It is not a decision we took lightly. We think we took it correctly. We are happy to debate that decision and to establish to the satisfaction of anybody that it is a responsible decision. [Cronje] Annette? [Correspondent Annette Joubert] My question centers around the question: What happened to the [Orange] Free State's results? Apparently they have finished already at 1030 this morning. We have heard nothing. What happened in the Northern Cape? There are only approximately 500,000 voters. Where are the results? And then, what is happening to the special ballots.... [Kriegler, interrupting] Would you mind not having a go at me with a shotgun? I'll come back to you, by all means. I simply can't remember so many questions at once. [Joubert] Do you not know what's happened to the results in the Free State, because we've had reports since this morning that the results have been available since 1030, and...? [Kriegler, interrupting] No, no results from any voting station has been available. I don't want to be clever. Tallies have come in, and we do not wish to put out tallies, even tallies from the head office, until we have checked them ourselves. Those figures can go out for public information. We're happy with that. But we're verifying them as tallies first. [Joubert] Just the last part of the question. What is happening to the overseas ballot papers at this stage? [Kriegler] I really can't tell you. They should all have arrived by now, but I'm not sure. [Cronje] Linda? [Correspondent Linda van Tilburgh] We've been on air for quite some time with the results, but it's rather going slow. To pick up on Karen's question, do you think it will go faster now? Will we have results rolling in by tomorrow, sort of creating more excitement than it is now? [Kriegler] I'm glad you asked the question. I owe you an apology. I was sharp with you the other day, and I shouldn't have been. I'm sorry. The process is certainly coming on stream. Quite apart from the ruling we made, the counting process is in any event calculated to speed up very rapidly as all of the counting stations get their preliminary work in order. You can expect a good deal more rapid returns coming on. [Van Tilburgh] Can I just ask: from tonight, or from tomorrow? Because it will affect us staying on air tonight or not. [Kriegler] Most of the counting stations are working through the night. [Cronje] Over here, please? [Unidentified correspondent] Judge, first, why if the reconciliation process is so inconsequential, why was it put in the electoral law in the first place? And second, I mean, it's the latest of a series of creative interpretations of the electoral law. Don't you feel that maybe while you solve logistical problems and you speed up the process, you are in fact creating a political problem because -- never mind whether you are sure that it can't be tampered with -- people who won't like the election results might jump on this loophole to declare dissatisfaction with the election? [Kriegler] With regard to your first question, why is the procedure in the electoral act if it has such minimal value -- it's a question I've asked myself, and I've come up with an answer: that the absence of a third coordinate and the significance thereof was not appreciated. Not one of the senior political representatives with whom we have debated the issue disagree with us on that. With regard to the second point, of course it is possible that particularly a loser will take this opportunity. It is possible. That is a risk we've got to run. I believe that the steps, in the circumstances, are so self-evidently correct that, A, there will be little temptation to resort to it as a peg on which to hang a declinature to proceed with the democratic process, and B, would be manifestly an unjustified resort to that particular step. I may say I sincerely trust that to some extent the integrity and impartiality of the commission will satisfy the broad body of the public out there that this was not done to benefit anybody or to prejudice anybody. Moreover, upon reflection, what we are postulating in order to be significant in a proportional representation system, is an undetected fraud of a massive scale committed by or in collusion with IEC officials. I think the prospects of that are pretty remote. [Cronje] The gentleman right at the back. [Correspondent Skwezi Skosana] Justice Kriegler, if I may ask: Are you satisfied about the manner in which the results are being flashed on the SABC screen and on the radio? The fact that the results -- they come in percentages -- is that not going to create a problem, especially to a fairly large majority of people out there who may not be able to interpret percentages without giving reference. For example, Western Cape results -- they came in as a percentage without giving reference whether they are from 10 counting stations, one counting station, or five. [Kriegler] I share your view. I agree with you, and I have already asked that the data be presented in a different form. I will take it up again tonight when I get back to the office. [Cronje] Radio (Populare). [Correspondent Paolo Barnard] Judge Kriegler, one of your duties will be to declare these elections free and fair, and one may wonder how free you are to declare these elections free and fair. Surely, there must be a lot of pressure from the two main political parties here in this country and international community. I'm not implying for one second that your judgment will be conditioned by these pressures. I'm only asking you if you ever felt these pressures on you, especially from the international community. [Kriegler] I am human and of course I'm subject to pressures. I don't take the decision alone, thank heavens, but I can assure you that the pressure of the situation is infinitely more than any political party could bring to bear. The realization is stark that if the election cannot be certified we are in a worse position than we were before the negotiation process started, and I would not be honest if I did not say that that realization falls very, very heavily on me. But I've got to live with myself after this election, and I will not certify if I am not satisfied that it was a substantially free and fair election as the statute obliges me to do, and I would like to add that I am not an auditor who has been called in with a green pen, green ink pen, to check on technical correctness. If that were my duty, I would have reported to the state president on Wednesday morning, that because of the logistical problems we had struck we would have to take measures which would be technically less than we would have required, and we shouldn't carry on. We decided that it was in the national interest to do the emergency printing and distribution that we did because we believed that that was the preferable cause to take, once we were staring at the possibility, on the one hand, of a possibly free and fair election, and on the other hand, possibly conflagration. We took the decision in the knowledge that there were risks. The risks on the other side were much greater and much more likely. [Cronje] The gentleman over here please. [Correspondent Themba Khumalo] Judge Kriegler, we have been told a few hours ago at an earlier briefing, that eight stations in Durban are not operating because of reconciliation problems. We have been told also that there are problems at Nasrec. Obviously people in Natal and in the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] regions are anxious to know which party wins and which party will lose. Are you not perhaps fearing that the delay of the announcement of results in certain regions might cause some problems in terms of people becoming angry? [Kriegler] I wouldn't say that I fear it, but I am aware of the risk. That is precisely one of the reasons we have said: Speed up the process. We can't reconcile in many cases. Don't try the impossible. Get on with the count. Note the objections. We will deal with them. The people are entitled to know what the tallies are. I agree with you in that respect. [Cronje] The gentleman over there, then Tim. [Correspondent Tan Moyane] Good evening, Judge. I just want to take you back slightly ... [Kriegler, interrupting] Can't you ask something of my colleague Walter, for a moment? [laughter] [Moyane] In terms of the tallies that are coming in. Some of us are sitting here at Gallagher Estate and watching you on Channel IEC, information, and at the same time watching television. We have just seen a discrepancy. There is more coming out on TV than what we are seeing here, and from what you have said just now, are we going to see a speeded up process in which we get the results from all over? I mean for 90 minutes, from seven to half past eight, all we saw was Western Cape national ballot results, and when I came here, Mr. Pieter Cronje was giving us results about other regions, and we haven't seen them on the screen here. [Kriegler] I am confident that the through-put of tallies from counting stations will materially pick up, yes, and I share your frustration, I may add. [Cronje] Tim? [Tim du Plessis] Mr. Kriegler, we have had a number of international organizations up here this afternoon, making all sorts of pronouncements on the elections -- some saying it's free and fair, some saying it's only free, but they were making pronouncements on the freeness and the fairness of the election. We've also had political organizations here saying those pronouncements were premature. What are your views on this? [Kriegler] I did not see them. This I will say without fear of contradiction: The balloting phase of the election was free and it was fair. The counting phase is at the moment in progress. There is no reason to think that it won't be likewise. As far as the arithmetical calculation is concerned, the same applies. [Cronje] The gentleman over there with the check shirt. [Correspondent] Judge, any indication yet of the total number of people who have been to the polls? [Kriegler] Pardon. [Correspondent] Any indication yet of the total number of people that have been to the polls? [Kriegler] No. No. Obviously one can't do that until you've got the final tallies in. That's one of the snags of not having a voter's roll.
