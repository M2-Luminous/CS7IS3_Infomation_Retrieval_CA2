Ozawa, secretary general of the coalition's core party Shinseito, told a news conference it would be ridiculous to hold an election under the current multiseat constituency system, noting that a government advisory body has been set up to delimit single-seat constituencies. Leaders of the country's two largest political parties, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the Social Democratic Party (SDP), both of which are in the opposition, have argued for the dissolution of the lower house for a general election to be contested under the existing multiseat system. The LDP, which has been urging the minority government of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata to hand over power, is poised to table a no-confidence motion after the enactment of the already overdue fiscal 1994 budget, expected in a month or two. The SDP, which quit the coalition immediately after its members voted for Hata in the Diet's prime ministerial election on April 25, has stepped up criticism against what it calls the coalition's high-handed management. SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama on Monday vowed to put the party on alert for a "battle" that could come at any time, hinting he is looking for an early general election. Asked how Hata's minority government will try to survive, Ozawa said the coalition will continue efforts to acquire a majority by coming out with its policies in the Diet. He also said that disagreement over policies caused the SDP's withdrawal from the coalition, and that the formation of a 130-member parliamentary group "kaishin" (innovation) excluding the SDP had merely provided the party with the excuse to leave the alliance.
