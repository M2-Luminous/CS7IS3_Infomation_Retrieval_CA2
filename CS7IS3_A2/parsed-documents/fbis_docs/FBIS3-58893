At a Brussels press conference, Mr. Nenakov added that -- to the contrary -- he was a Yeltsin supporter and that information suggesting that he had funded the nationalist leader's campaign had been circulated in order to harm his company. The Russian daily, SEVODNJA, reported in December last year that GMM had provided 800 million dollars (more than 28 million Belgian francs) to support Zhirinovskiy's campaign, adding that the company was operating without a license in Russia where it is involved in speculation. Mr. Nenakov denied these claims, stating that the newspaper who accused him was in fact in the hands of one of his competitors and that they were seeking to harm his professional activities. He indicated that he had instigated proceedings for defamation against SEVODNJA and that the journalist who wrote the article had already admitted that he had no document able to prove his claims. As regards GMM's activities in Moscow -- where the Global Money Management trust has a subsidiary -- another company representative, financial adviser Mr. Liozner, stated that his company has met with no difficulties with the Russian central bank, even if it attracts private Russian capital for investments abroad. He pointed out that relations between GMM and the central bank had "normalized," apart from few purely "technical" difficulties mainly due to differences between Russian and Western banking legislation.
