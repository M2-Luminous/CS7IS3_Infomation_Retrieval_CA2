Because politics is a science that has its own rules and basic elements. Of course, money is one of the elements, but not the only one. Al-Hariri arrived in London and was very warmly received by some Lebanese and Palestinians. he held press conferences and delivered lectures in his capacity as a rich man first and a prime minister second. He was successful in most of them. But success failed him in one of them, specifically at the press conference held at the foreign correspondents association. In this conference al-Hariri focused on his country's refusal to settle Palestinians in Lebanon. He stressed this point at great length, as though the Palestinians are just refugees, not Arabs also. Maybe they are not human. Al-Hariri tends to forget that he is from Sidon (unless he still insists that he is from al-Dar'iyah [as transliterated]), which is a few kilometers from Palestinian 'Akko. It might be useful to recall that the people of Sidon, Tyre, and southern Lebanon have always been an extension of the people of Galilee and the Palestinian coast, and vice versa, to the extent that it is difficult to distinguish between them in terms of features, customs, and traditions. But al-Hariri, who holds Saudi nationality, although he is Lebanese, and is enjoying all its privileges, is using a non-pan-Arab -- we would not say racist -- language when dealing with Palestinians. Because he thinks that their might has been destroyed and that he can through foreign aid flex his muscles on them whenever he wants. We assure al-Hariri that the Palestinians are guests of the Lebanese, just as they are guests of the Syrians, Jordanians, and all the other Arabs. They appreciate the patience and generosity of their hosts. And they have not asked to be settled, because nothing can replace their homeland, otherwise they would not have become strugglers and fighters. The point which attracted our attention most in his press conference was when he said he would consider an application to be submitted by Palestinian President 'Arafat to visit Lebanon, hence indicating that the Palestinian president needs a visa from the nearest Lebanese consul to make the visit in question, while other Palestinian leaders do not get the same treatment when they enter Lebanon. Regrettably, these unsuccessful statements, which lack the simplest political and diplomatic rules, came in reply to an optimistic question suggesting that the problem of President 'Arafat's visit to Lebanon was resolved the moment he was received in Riyadh by the Saudi monarch, King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz. But al-Hariri -- because of lack of experience or information -- "maybe" did not understand the significance. He failed to seize the opportunity to improve his government's position toward an Arab leader who only did what al-Hariri wants to do but cannot, that is sign a peace agreement with Israel. It saddens us -- and we know the situation in Lebanon and the independence of al-Hariri's government -- to hear these unsuccessful statements, which do not reflect a realistic and correct political reading of the rapid developments in the Arab region, the most recent of which is the Palestinian president's visit to Damascus and Riyadh and the historic meeting held in Geneva less than two weeks ago between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton. Prime Minister al-Hariri needs a pause for examination and a thorough revision of his positions, especially on the Palestinian issue and people -- a pause that matches the depth of the relationship between the Lebanese and Palestinian peoples, which was built on joint sacrifices for the sake of bolstering the issues of Arabism, first and foremost the Lebanese and Palestinian issues.
