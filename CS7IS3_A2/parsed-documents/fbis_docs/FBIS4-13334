The investigations also revealed that 'Adil 'Awad Siyam, the terrorist who was killed in a fight with policemen on al-Bahr al-A'zam street in al-Munib on 4 April, had been assigned by fugitive terrorist Dr. Ayman al-Zawahiri, leader of the al-Jihad Organization, to lead the organization's military wing and to act as coordinator between the terrorist leaders abroad and in Egypt. Dr. al-Zawahiri supplied him with the money to buy weapons and ammunition in order to carry out terrorist operations. Organization members were to have assassinated UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus-Ghali during his visit to Egypt, but failed due to a change in his route. They had also planned to assassinate Information Minister Safwat al-Sharif. The interrogation of al-Jihad's military wing members also indicated that terrorist Siyam had planned the aborted attempt on the life of Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi. For that operation, he rented a house for terrorists Diya'-al-Din Mahmud Hafiz, Nazih Subhi Rashid, Ahmad Faruq, and Muhammad Rashad 'Abd-al-Hamid in the Kafr al-Manfa area in al-Haram. He then persuaded terrorist Diya'-al-Din Hafiz to carry out the suicide mission, while he personally watched the interior minister's motorcade. Members of the organization, including terrorist Muhammad 'Abd- al-'Alim Khalifah, brother-in-law of terrorist 'Adil 'Awad, admitted to killing witness Sayyid Ahmad Abu-Yahya and three others at his car showroom in Shibin al-Qanatir on 4 February. He was murdered for reporting to the police on their terrorist colleague Sayyid Salah. Salah was sentenced to death in connection with the assassination attempt of Prime Minister Dr.'Atif Sidqi. They also admitted to placing an explosive device at al-Jazirah Youth Center in 1993 so it would detonate during a training course of State Security Intelligence officers, and to killing their dissident colleague 'Adil Anwar in Saray al-Qubbah area. The investigations revealed that terrorist Siyam had been using seven stolen cars to move around in and to pass instructions to organization members. A report by the criminal laboratory identified the weapons found in possession of the terrorists as those used in the Shibin al-Qanatir terrorist operation, in which Sayyid Abu-Yahya and three others were killed and a police officer, who chanced to be in the showroom, was injured. The investigations showed that terrorist 'Adil Siyam had received funds from abroad, for a receipt from a foreign currency transfer in Italy was found. The organization members used to disguise themselves in police, armed forces, and municipality workers' uniforms to place the explosive devices in strategic areas. The investigations revealed that terrorist 'Adil Siyam and his brother-in-law Muhammad Khalifah had trained the terrorists how to prepare explosives. The organization members led prosecutors to nine dens in al-Basatin, al-Munib, al-Qalubiyah, where weapons and ammunition had been stored, as well as an underground tunnel which led to Bilbays in al- Sharqiyah Governorate.
