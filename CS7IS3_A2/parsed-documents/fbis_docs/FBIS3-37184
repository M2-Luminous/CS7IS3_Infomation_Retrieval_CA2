As the press center of the Cabinet of Ministers informs, the talks will focus on a general agreement on the withdrawal of troops, the conditions for the future operation and dismantling of the Skrunda radar station, the problems of social security of Russian military personnel, and questions connected with the activity of representatives of both states in the vicinity of the border between Latvia and Russia. Based on the political will of Latvia and Russia and on the work accomplished during the previous talks, all the agreements included in the agreement package on the withdrawal of the Russian troops could be coordinated during this round of talks. This was predicted today at the airport by Sergey Zotov, head of the Russian delegation, upon his arrival in Riga. Zotov added that there were grounds for hope also for a ratification of these documents at the Russian parliament. These agreements were being drawn up and concluded taking into account the interests of both Latvia and Russia. It is anticipated that at tomorrow's sitting of the Cabinet of Ministers, the Latvian delegation will be given the authority to agree with the last proposal recommended by Russia of maintaining the operation of the Skrunda radar station for four years, and after that, dismantling it in the course of 18 months. The talks will continue until 16 February.
