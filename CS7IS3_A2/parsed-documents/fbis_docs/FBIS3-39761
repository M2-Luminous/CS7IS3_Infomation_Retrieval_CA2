He will be received by President Glavkos Kliridhis tomorrow and he will hold consultations this evening with UN's Gustave Feissel. Mr. Abou said upon his arrival that he will also hold meetings with the ambassadors of the 12 EU member countries as stipulated by the regulation. He also noted that there is no time schedule according to which he has to submit his report to the EU, but when Cyprus' application for accession is discussed in 1995, he will have to give all the details. Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis described the observer's arrival as practical proof he is following developments in the Cyprus issue. The EU observer had also requested to have a meeting with Rauf Denktas but the latter left for Turkey at noon today. Both Ankara and Denktas refuse to meet with the EU observers because they object to his appointment.
