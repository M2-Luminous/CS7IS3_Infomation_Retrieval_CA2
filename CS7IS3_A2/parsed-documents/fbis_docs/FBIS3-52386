This newspaper, which has always been run by Zionist institutions and Jewish American shareholders, especially for the past half century [as published], cited a Pentagon official as saying: "During the past 10 years Iran has purchased billions of dollars of arms; and if we disregard the U.S. presence in the Persian Gulf, Iran is today the most powerful military strength in the Persian Gulf." Such views and comments precisely reflect efforts by a large segment of the Zionist officials in the U.S. ruling system to create tension in the Persian Gulf and to prepare the necessary grounds for a new adventurism in the Middle East. The article in the Zionist newspaper THE WASHINGTON TIMES appears after a year of unsettling militarism in the Horn of Africa. After drawing in most of their Asian and European allies and treating the United Nations like a puppet in their hands, the Americans are disgracefully trying to save themselves from the Somali quagmire. THE WASHINGTON TIMES article comes at a time when Secretary of Defense Les Aspin has resigned in view of the defeat of America's unrestrained diplomacy in Somalia and when, under the crushing pressures of American public opinion, the President had no alternative but to immediately accept his resignation. This is one side of the coin. But the other side should be sought in the torturing loneliness that America is facing in its confrontation with the Islamic revolution. The Zionist circles' propaganda in America is a reflection of the failure that America has constantly met when seeking Europe's cooperation in confronting the Islamic revolution. At least before the U.S. presidential elections, some political analysts believed that such American pressures on its allies to encourage them to side with America against the Islamic Republic of Iran was only the policy of the Republicans and that the Democrats were not as insistent as the Republicans on this. But now it has become clear that basically such methods constitute American policy in general and not the policy of either Bush or Clinton in particular. In other words, from the point of view of the White House, hostility to the Islamic Republic of Iran is not a tactic but a strategy. America's strategy is to portray Islamic Iran as a regional and world threat; and they use the tactic of saying that the Islamic Republic of Iran is a threat to the region, to its neighbors, and to world peace and security, and that it should be confronted. The Americans believe that through this policy they can apply all-around economic, political, and especially military pressure and thus hinder Iran's economic growth. The 15-year experience of hostile American stances vis-a-vis the Islamic revolution and, especially, the eight-year experience of the oppressive and imposed war against the Islamic Republic of Iran were testimony to two realities. The first one is that in a world filled with profit-seeking economic rivalries and competitions, the breaking down of economic, political, or military walls and neutralizing hegemonistic plots is not a complicated matter; the other fact is that there is a basic necessity for a country in a region which has been the scene of American-made crises for a decade to strengthen its defensive structure and strive to achieve military and economic self-sufficiency. Under such conditions, the Islamic Republic of Iran cannot be indifferent to issues that are directly linked to the country's fate and the independence, freedom, territorial integrity, and security of its people. Therefore, during both the war and the so-called era of sanctions and today, our efforts have always been aimed at seriously preserving our military and operational skills and power and our economic growth. The Islamic Republic of Iran wants to achieve a degree of economic and military strength where no one could be tempted to start a fresh show of strength and mischief in the region. And precisely because of this, the belief is that the stronger the Islamic Republic of Iran's combat ability and economy are, the more regional peace and stability will benefit, and that this is the only way that it can maintain its effective role in preserving regional security. This is a reality of which the Western world on the one hand and the regional Arab rulers on the other are aware, despite their propaganda. The Zionist circles in America are concerned precisely because they know that with the increasing defensive capability of the Islamic Republic of Iran, the White House's plans to create chaos in the region will be foiled. If the regional countries are realistic and look at past history and regard their situation with insight, then they will accept this reality more confidently and will realize that the greater the military strength of Iran, as the guardian of the longest borders in the Persian Gulf, the more efficient security in the region will be. The Americans are trying to put economic, military, and political pressure on the Islamic Republic of Iran specifically at the Middle East regional level and are pursuing two major objectives in this process. One is to portray Iran as a threat and thus to pave the way for their continued illegal presence in the region and the continued dependence of regional Arab countries on them; the other is to promote more arms sales. Thus, on the one hand the return flow of the astronomical sums from purchases of Persian Gulf oil back into the pockets of American banks will be ensured, and on the other hand, the arming of regional regimes will create favorable conditions for Israel to make excessive demands. It should be noted that some time after the oil war, the United States sold billions of dollars of arms--quantities unprecedented in U.S. history--to the regional Arab countries on the pretext of creating a balance in the Persian Gulf and through its extensive propaganda about the Iranian threat. Nevertheless, the experience of the past 15 years have proven that neither economic sanctions nor political, economic, and military threats by America against the Islamic Republic of Iran have ever yielded the favorable results that the Americans expected. The Islamic Republic of Iran has found its way in an arena that is filled with world plots, so such ploys will never be able to force a review of our stances and activities on this great nation that has tread the path of revolution and the path of integrity and emerged intact from the most dangerous and deadly plots.
