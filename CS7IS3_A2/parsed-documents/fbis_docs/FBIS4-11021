"Tonight, I reviewed the budget laws with several ministers of the economic cabinet, so I did not concern myself with those rumors since the people no longer believe them," the presidend indicated. De Leon Carpio told LA REPUBLICA: "I do not care about those rumors," noting that the military institution has assumed with responsibility the job it must perform within the democratic process. "We have constitutional order here in Guatemala," he affirmed.

He indicated that this morning he will continue studying the package of economic measures, which he could announce tonight to the people of Guatemala. To conclude, de Leon Carpio said that on Thursday he will leave "with half the cabinet to resume the working visits to the interior of the country to see up close the problems of the people. This shows nothing is happening, that these are just ill-intended rumors that nobody believes."
