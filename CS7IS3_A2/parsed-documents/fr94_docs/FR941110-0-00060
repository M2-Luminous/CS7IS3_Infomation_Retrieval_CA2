FR941110-0-00060 FR941110-0-00016 A new Subpart D of part 488, consisting of §§488.201&hyph; 488.211, became effective on August 31, 1992, shortly after the proposed rule was published on August 28. This requires that we designate Subpart E, which was to consist of §§488.150&hyph;488.185, with subsequent numbers. To assist the reader, we are publishing the new table of contents for Subpart E, with designations of the proposed rule shown in parenthesis. In the following discussions, we refer to the sections as renumbered, with the proposal's identification included only if distinction is necessary. Sec. 488.300␣Statutory basis. (§488.150) 488.301␣Definitions. (§488.151) 488.303␣State plan requirement. (§488.153) 488.305␣Standard surveys. (§488.155) 488.307␣Unannounced surveys. (§488.157) 488.308␣Survey frequency.

(§488.184) 488.335␣Action on complaints of resident neglect and abuse, and misappropriation of resident property. (§488.185) Section 488.301␣Definitions Comment: Many commenters were concerned that the proposed definition of ``abuse'' is too broad and ambiguous. Unless the definition is amended, they believe it will generate inconsistency in the survey process and overburden the system with complaints of abuse. Other suggestions and recommendations are as follows: •Willfulness and/or deliberate intent should be incorporated into the definition; •Change ``and/or otherwise disregard of an individual which could cause or result in mild to severe harm'' and replace with ``has caused or creates a high probability of causing serious harm'';
