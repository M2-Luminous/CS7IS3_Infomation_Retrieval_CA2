These preliminary conclusions were reached at the end of the joint Russian-Japanese-South Korean expedition's first stage, which was undertaken with the participation of IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) specailists from March 18 to April 15. The Russian Navy press centre told ITAR-TASS that the tests were conducted on board the Russian hydrometeorological scientific reasearch ship "Okean" (ocean). The expedition helped obtain information about the real radioactivity and ecological situation in the areas of radioactive waste dumping by the navy of the former Soviet Union and Russia. Detailed analyses of sea water samples, sea bottom sediments, animal plankton and organisms living on the sea bottom, will be carried out in laboratories of Russia, Japan, South Korea and IAEA and published as a complete report within one year at the end of the expedition.
