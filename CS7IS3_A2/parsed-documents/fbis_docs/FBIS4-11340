Authorities are investigating to determine whether the weapons are linked to the Chiapas conflict. The soldiers arrived in five vehicles at "The French Courier" gun shop and seized the weapons just before midnight. The store is located on the corner of 60th and 65th streets, just two blocks from the local Government Palace. Although military authorities are keeping a tight lid on the matter, it was learned from unofficial sources that there are several tons and that the load may weigh as much as 40 tons. Answering questions about the reports, General Antonio Lopez Portillo said the seizure "probably did occur." Major Alberto Larios did not deny that there could be 40 tons of war materiel, and he confirmed there is an ongoing investigation into possible connections between local armories and the Chiapas conflict. "Who said there were 40 tons?" he asked, after denying the general was in, when in fact he was in his office. "That does not concern me. I know nothing of the matter," he said. Two individuals from Chiapas were arrested two weeks ago while trying to move 3,000 .22 caliber bullets reportedly obtained at the Merida armory. Larios said authorities are investigating possible ties between these men, the armories, and the Zapatist National Liberation Army. The men were trying to load the ammunition at the Merida bus terminal to transport it to their home state. The two men from Chiapas were intoxicated and acting suspiciously, and because of this, Federal Judicial Police were called in.
