He made the statement during a news conference, the first since his investiture on 29 January as president of the Republic. The Guinean head of state further added that this government will not necessarily include members of political parties. Questioned on the possible participation of the Guinean opposition in the next government, President Conte said: "I will not beg anyone. It is up to the opposition to come to me if they believe they have to contribute to the development of their country." "If we form a government including people from all political trends we run the risk of being taken hostage," he added. At the end of the first pluralist election in Guinea on 19 December, President Conte was elected for a five-year term with 51.70 percent of the votes. His election was contested by the opposition candidates who boycotted the 29 January swearing in ceremony. Concluding, General Conte called on African countries to "speed up" the economic integration process.
