J. Khergamvala: "Raphel's Remarks Will Help India"; boldface words as published] [Text] Manama (Bahrain), Nov. 20. With the dust settling on the controversial remarks on Kashmir passed by a senior U.S. State Department official these will turn out to be beneficial in the long run. At least, these will help India avoid the mistakes in the Arab-Israeli process. The remarks have also enabled Indians to see holes in India's attitude towards Kashmir and the U.S. Last month's "background" briefing of Ms. Robin Raphel, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for South Asia sparked a highly informed and honest public debate in the Indian media. A vital debate like this was by and large missing when the West Asia peace process was launched by the Bush administration. The U.S. hinged on its own prestige, not informed public debate among the direct participants. That came later. The violent and halting fallout of the secret Oslo deal between Israel and the PLO shows that Mr. Yasser Arafat's brave but rash move necessitated a desperate effort to economically prop up the peace deal after a wider consultative process was by-passed. On the Israeli side, the Labour-led coalition now finds itself stranded between barbed wires on the deal with Syria. The debate in India, and in due course in Pakistan and among Kashmiri elements, will make movement on an eventual deal ponderous but once made will ensure that it sticks. For long, Governments in India did their own private running of policy, without adequate input from the large number of specialist studies on the subject. It is extraordinary that a Government that calls for transparency at the UN on decision making is not obliged to do so for its own people. The holes have been exposed not only by the debate following Ms. Raphel's remarks but also by the British Foreign Secretary, Mr. Douglas Hurd's broadly similar remarks. Parallel message: The essential parallel message from West Asia, applied to Kashmir, is to forget the biblical times and 45-year-old resolutions and make recent agreements work, or else improve upon them. In other words, give up maximalist dreams. It may not be of much satisfaction to New Delhi and Islamabad that many Arab and Islamic governments feel the same way. Kashmir's 2nd century B.C. Buddhism, its 14th century transfer to muslim rule, its accession in 1947, the UN resolutions of the late 1940s -- none of these is relevant. Like the Arab-Israeli entanglement everyone is sitting on 10 layers of history that does not resolve but guide. The one common thread running through every editorial or commentary in the Indian and foreign media, and in conferences abroad is that Kashmir is the main obstacle to peace between India and Pakistan. This is a big gain for Pakistan's repeated plea that the dispute is a "core" problem. India has made little if any ground in lumping together all problems between India and Pakistan. The omniscient claims and attitude of various governments in New Delhi, to the exclusion of academic inputs, have led to taking stagnant and irrelevant positions in the international fora. Some telling debating points have been missed. A relevant question: For instance Mr. Amar Saksena, the Legal Counsellor to an international bank in West Asia, has in an essay to a regional paper raised a valid point. If only Kashmiris could decide Kashmir's fate, he argues, "why and pursuant to which legal right did Pakistan cede Kashmiri territory to China." In all the years of monitoring Indian and Pakistani positions in Arab and Islamic conferences one has never heard India making this searching argument. It must be conceded that India's policy in Washington has paid dividends. It was no mean feat to wean a close ally and bringing it to the brink of declaring Pakistan a terrorist state. But the flaw in India is that it appears to have elevated the U.S. to the status of chief arbiter on terrorism in the sub-continent. That has now backfired. India corroborated mindlessly on U.S. intentions against Libya. India had expected that if at the UN Security Council it looked at Libya and Iraq through the U.S. prism, the pay-off would be Pakistan being labelled a terrorist state. Backbone non-existent: The Indian official spokesman's unprincipled statement after Mr. Bill Clinton's Cruise missile attack on Iraq -- where he reminded that India too faced cross-border terrorism -- must rank as the most begging request New Delhi made to the U.S. Consequently, when Ms. Raphel downgraded Kashmiri terrorism and labelled it as "political consciousness," the bottom fell out of India's looking up to the U.S. as the judge of terrorism on the subcontinent. Pakistan had abstained on the Security Council Resolution 883 tightening the Libyan sanctions and is none the worse for it. It's amusing that all these years, the Indian political establishment complained of neglect from the U.S., but when a new administration, dubbed by Mr. George Bush as being run by "two bozos," switches on, the U.S. is branded as an unwanted do-gooder. The political establishment do not ask it who, in the first place, invited the U.S. into the terrorism issue. India forgets Mr. Sharad Pawar's remark of India winning the war without firing a shot, when Pakistan was put on the so called watch list. U.S. is out of it: Ms. Raphel's prodding remarks have also ensured that the U.S. is out of the Kashmir peace process. Her remarks have injured public sentiment and now that the public and the media will debate the subject neither is likely to allow the Government to use the U.S. in the dispute. Indo-U.S. differences lie primarily in issues concerning space, non-proliferation, missiles, trade related agreements, among others. At the business and public level there was a tremendous forward leap. It is in the public diplomacy domain that the relationship has suffered. That is perhaps the major reason why the U.S. is backing off. To wit, on November 9 at his briefing the State Department's spokesman talked about the bilateral relationship as "one that is considered among the most important in the region.... if not in the world itself" and is of the "utmost importance" to this administration. The added clarification, that the disputed area includes those parts of Jammu and Kashmir ceded to or in possession of China, suggest a recognition of one of India's main arguments, well put across by the foreign office -- that the country's concerns have to be understood in its Asian (China) construct. Whether, by including China the U.S. intends to include it in the overall South Asian security regime remains to be seen. Since four years India has tried everything to give Kashmir a non profile internationally. It may now turn out that whatever motivated the Hazratbal operation, has done the gravest damage to an old Indian Kashmir policy. An entirely new element has to be reckoned with by both India and Pakistan. In many ways a whole new ball game is beginning in a new ball park. And with new rules.
