Nakamura, 44, has been detained since mid-March after prosecutors arrested him on suspicion of taking a bribe from leading contractor Kajima Corp. On April 5, a judge at the Tokyo District Court rejected Nakamura's bail application, saying he might destroy evidence. In a fresh petition to the same court, defense lawyers argued that Nakamura, as a member of the House of Representatives, needs to perform his duty and take part in the vote for a new prime minister. The vote is very important in that it will decide the future of Japanese politics, they said. No date has yet been set for the two houses of the Diet to hold the vote on a successor to Morihiro Hosokawa, who announced his resignation last Friday. Under Japan's code of criminal procedure, a suspect under arrest is automatically detained for two months upon indictment but can apply for release on bail. The detention order has to be renewed every two months. Nakamura is charged with taking the 10 million yen bribe January 13, 1992, from Shinji Kiyoyama, then vice president of Kajima Corp. Nakamura was at that time acting head of the then governing Liberal Democratic Party's panel on antimonopoly policies. Prosecutors opposed Nakamura's previous petition for bail, saying he may destroy evidence because he has stayed completely silent when questioned about the case. Nakamura quit the LDP just before his arrest and is currently an independent member of the lower house. He served as construction minister from December 1992 to August 1993 under then Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa.
