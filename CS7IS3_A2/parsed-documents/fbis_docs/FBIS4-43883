In an interview in Boston yesterday with THE IRISH TIMES, Mr Reynolds said it was futile to talk in isolation about removing the constitutional claim to the North and that there had to be a balanced constitutional agreement. Spelling out for the first time what this means, Mr Reynolds said: "Institutional links between North and South will have executive powers. That's the type of overall framework we're looking to." He said there was still a "fair bit of work to be done" in the talks between officials from Dublin and London, but he was hopeful he and British Prime Minister, Mr John Major, could achieve their aim of agreement by mid-July. Mr Reynolds was in Boston to receive the Christian A. Herter Memorial Award from the World Affairs Council of Boston for his role in the peace process. President Clinton sent a message of congratulations to Mr Reynolds who, he said, had earned the respect and admiration of world leaders for his contribution to peace. In his acceptance speech, Mr Reynolds laid stress on the need for a balanced constitutional accommodation. New arrangements, he said, "must provide a clear and explicit institutional framework for the development of the necessary North-South co-operation and co- ordination in areas of mutual benefit." Expanding on this in his interview, Mr Reynolds said there had to be an even-handed approach in the negotiations with Britain and therefore the Government of Ireland Act 1920 and Articles 2 and 3 should be on the table "for negotiation both ways." "That's the Act that set up partition in the first place, but it also had the intentions of the British Government at the time to move on towards eventual unity of Ireland, and that (in the meantime) intermediate steps would be taken," he said. Asked if he was seeking a quid pro quo involving some type of cross-border authority with executive powers in return for the dropping of Articles 2 and 3, Mr Reynolds said: "Those are the type of areas we are exploring between the two governments at the moment. What I'm saying is institutional links between North and South will have executive powers. That's the type of overall framework we're looking to, but that emanates clearly from the contents of the Downing Street Declaration." Mr Reynolds acknowledged that unionists might view this as a form of the Council of Ireland which they had strongly rejected in the past. In the declaration, "we make it clear that there has to be a wider settlement involving other relationships, internal relationships in Northern Ireland, North-South co-operation and an institutional framework to reflect the diversity of the two parts and between the islands of Ireland and Great Britain." On the role of the United States, Mr Reynolds said the message from the United States to the nationalists was: "We're here to support you but we're not here to support any continuation of violence. Give up the violence and you can rely on us for our support to see that the cause is not ignored and that whatever commitments are given will be implemented." Mr Reynolds continued: "That's a very important guarantor situation for the United States and the people in the United States to have taken up." He said he now expected a response from Sinn Fein to the Downing Street Declaration by "the early days of July, if not before."
