Here is evidence: Troops of the 7th Brigade headquartered in Villavicencio seized an FAL assault rifle, the regulation weapon of the Venezuelan military, from the FARC [Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia]. The guerrillas repainted the rifle to hide its origin, but under the paint an inscription can still be read: Venezuelan Armed Forces. There are 80 other rifles like this one in Villavicencio, not counting the ones seized in other areas of the country. Venezuelan Military Staff members will arrive in Bucaramanga on 18 January to request the return of a large number of Venezuelan weapons seized from several guerrilla fronts. The official Venezuelan explanation continues to be that the weapons were stolen from border garrisons. The Colombian and Venezuelan defense ministers will meet on 19 January here at the 5th Brigade headquarters in Bucaramanga to study the issue of Venezuelan weapons in the hands of Colombian guerrillas. In dealing blows to the Colombian guerrillas over the last few months, authorities have found Venezuelan assault rifles, mortars, ammunition, and submachine guns, all of which bear the coat of arms and insignia of the Venezuelan Armed Forces.
