The Finance Ministry's proposal that budgetary allocations for the requirements of the military department be reduced is an attempt to stir up the country and make the Government quarrel with the Army. According to RIA, this was stated today by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. He said it had been a matter of a private initiative on the part of the Finance Ministry. However, the prime minister noted, the Finance Ministry does not itself decide anything. The prime minister gave the assurance that the financing of the Defense Ministry this year will remain at last year's level. As reported previously, the letter containing the Finance Ministry's proposals about reducing the benefits of servicemen, officers, generals, and military pensioners, which was sent to the Defense Ministry, evoked sharp dissatisfaction.
