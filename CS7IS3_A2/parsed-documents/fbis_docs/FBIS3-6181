The IAEA inspection team was scheduled to stay one day in Beijing; however, it will proceed directly to IAEA headquarters in Vienna. Mr. Kyd, IAEA information director, revealed that the inspection team was to stay one day in Beijing, but the team will arrive in Vienna on 16 March after changing its original plan in response to an emergency directive from the IAEA Secretariat. The IAEA will decide if it will convene a special Board of Governors meeting this weekend after hearing the inspection team's report on detailed results of the inspection activities. The major board members stated that the inspection for examination of conversion of nuclear materials was insufficient, including difficulties the team experienced in extracting test material of nuclear materials due to North Korea's lack of cooperation. As a result, it seems that convocation of a special Board of Governors meeting next week is inevitable.
