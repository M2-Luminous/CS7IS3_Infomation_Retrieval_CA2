FR940617-2-00206 FR940617-2-00116 g. The project will be operated competently, as determined by HUD in a management review. h. Project management is in accordance with any management improvement and operating plan approved by HUD for the project. i. The Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing plan meets applicable requirements. j. The purchaser certifies that it will comply with all applicable equal opportunity statutes, including the provisions of the Fair Housing Act, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Executive Orders 11063, 11246 and 11375, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, the Americans with Disabilities Act, Section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968, and all regulations issued pursuant to these authorities. k. The purchaser has funded the reserve for replacements account in accordance with HUD requirements, and yet the reserve account (and any other project funds available to fund the reserve account) is insufficient to finance both the capital improvements for which assistance is being requested and other capital improvements that are reasonably expected to be required within the next 24 months. D. Selection Criteria and Ranking Factors Each application for a Capital Improvement Loan will be reviewed by the HUD Field Office having jurisdiction over the project in question. Field Offices will recommend applications for funding to HUD Headquarters. Under section 201(n)(1), as amended by section 103(b) of the 1994 Act, Capital Improvement Loans for ELIHPA projects that are eligible for incentives may be made available on a noncompetitive basis. Submission and approval of the notices of intent and plans of action are subject to the eligibility of the owner filing them. E. Other Loan Terms and Conditions Repair items eligible for funding as a Capital Improvement Loan include any major repair or replacement of building components or other on-site improvements included in allowable costs when the project was built, (e.g., sewer laterals, roof structures, ceilings, wall or floor structures, foundations, plumbing, heating, cooling, electrical systems and major equipment), as well as any major repair or replacement of any short-lived building equipment or component before the expiration of its useful life. Improvements eligible for funding may also include limited supplements or enhancements to mechanical equipment, to the extent they are needed for the health and safety of the residents (e.g., air conditioning, heating equipment, and building sprinkler systems), where they do not exist; improvements necessary to comply with HUD's standards in 24 CFR part 8 for accessibility to individuals with handicaps; and cost effective energy efficiency improvements. Improvements eligible for funding as a Capital Improvement Loan do not include maintenance of any building components or equipment. Capital Improvement assistance may be provided in the form of an amortizing loan. The interest rate on the loan may not be less than three (3) percent (unless HUD determines that a lower rate is necessary to maintain rental rates, in accordance with Chapter 12 of HUD Handbook 4350.6, Processing Plans of Action Under the Low-Income Housing Preservation and Resident Homeownership Act of 1990 and Form HUD&hyph;90010, Owner's Calculation of Tenant Rent Phase-In Due to POA approval, but in no case less than one percent) nor more than six (6) percent. The rate is determined taking into consideration the project's ability to absorb the rent increase and the percentage of the tenants receiving rental assistance. Interest on the Capital Improvement Loan starts to accrue and the loan amortization period begins immediately upon disbursement of loan proceeds. A Capital Improvement Loan to a nonprofit organization may be in the form of a deferred note with a term coincident with the expiration of the project's insured mortgage note, accruing interest at a rate of one (1) percent. The deferred note will become due and payable upon a sale or refinancing of the project or at the expiration of the insured mortgage note. II. Application and Funding Award Process A. Obtaining and Preparing Applications Applicants may obtain application packages from the local HUD Field Office. An application must reflect the improvements required as a condition of approval of the plan of action. In addition, all other deficiencies, which are to be corrected with funds from sources other than Flexible Subsidy, must be identified on the work write-up and cost estimate and Management Improvement and Operation (MIO) plan Part II (Forms HUD&hyph;9835, HUD&hyph;9835&hyph;A, and HUD&hyph;9835&hyph;B) as if Flexible Subsidy were being requested. B. Submitting Applications Complete applications for a Flexible Subsidy Capital Improvement Loan pursuant to plans of action receiving preliminary approval under ELIHPA must be received in the HUD field office not more than 30 days following the issuance of preliminary approval. Timeliness of submission will allow the Department to review the application within the 30-day mandatory review period and in time to issue final approval of the plan of action in the period required by Part 248.219.
