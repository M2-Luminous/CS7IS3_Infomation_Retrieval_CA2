Presidential spokesman Chu Ton-sik said Kim instructed Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu to consult with Russian officials on the issue during his visit to Moscow this week. Over 100 North Koreans have reportedly escaped from logging camps, run by Pyongyang in exchange for labor fees paid in wood, and are seeking resettlement in South Korea. Spokesman Chu said President Kim previously shelved the issue of North Korean loggers for the time being in an effort to help foster an atmosphere for North Korea's return to the inter-Korean dialogue and their acceptance of nuclear inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency. "As North Korea keeps rejecting them, the president gave the instructions to review the issue based on the principle of humanitarianism," Chu said. On the presidential instructions, the government will examine several ways to extend a helping hand to the North Korean loggers stranded in Russia. The measures will include granting them asylum in South Korea, allowing only those loggers classified as "non-criminals" to resettle in the South, and having Moscow legally allow them to stay in Russia, a government source said. "Earlier we refrained from raising the issue of the loggers so as not to offend North Korea. We now believe our restraint has no meaning at this stage when North Korea persists in their intransigence," he said. Chu said it was from the same approach that the South earlier shelved the deployment of Patriot missiles but now promote their introduction because North Korea continues to reject additional nuclear inspection and boycott the South-North dialogue. "We will decide on whether to resume the Team Spirit military exercise from the same angle," he added.
