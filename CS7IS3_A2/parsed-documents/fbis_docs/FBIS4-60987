ITAR-TASS today learned at the headquarters of the Russian borderguard troops in Tajikistan that a group of armed men from the Tajik opposition made a attempt on Monday evening to fight their way into Tajikistan on one of the sectors guarded by the Horog borderguard detachment. The intruders enjoyed fire coverage from Afghan territory. The Russian borderguards were compelled to retaliate, thereby preventing the gang from crossing the border river. The Russian troops suffered no casualties. The enemy losses were not reported. Men of the irreconcilable opposition are now being massed on separate sections of the border between Tajikistan and the Afghan province of Tahor. Military sources do not rule out new armed provocations on this stretch of the border.
