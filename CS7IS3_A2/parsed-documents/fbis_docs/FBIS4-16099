What Is Behind Promises of Fantastic Interest Rates"] [Text] We are literally hypnotized by the advertising of various banks and firms. They attract our money by promising staggering interest rates of 40, 50, and 60 percent in hard currency -- no Western banker can promise that! We spoke about this to Viktor Melnikov, head of the Central Bank of Russia's [CBR] Main Administration for Currency Regulation. [Melnikov] I think that you can obtain megahigh profit ratios in Russia by using money in deals that go beyond the confines of banking legislation. In particular, this may involve trading operations via dummy firms. This is an extremely risky business: You can either become fabulously rich or lose everything. Reputable banks that top the ratings do not do this, nor do they promise investors crazy profits. [Kucherenko] However, everyone is now complaining that it is not profitable to export from the country: Prices in Russia are close to world levels. What is the reason for these interest rates then? [Melnikov] You cannot even imagine how many organizations have now won the right not to pay taxes and to export goods dutyfree. Control over the use of these concessions is, moreover, extremely lax. It is generally public or charitable structures that are the fortunate ones. And we do not know whether this trade benefits the disabled, for instance, or whether it is an overused cover for commercial enterprises which can quite easily make high profits if they do not pay duty and tax. [Melnikov ends] ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA File: The presidential administration's Control Administration noted 20 January that the government does not have information about how export quotas and concessions granted to organizations and enterprises are used. A curious example was cited. The Moscow Branch of the Children's Foundation gave its concessions to the "Silk Route" firm to conclude a purchase deal -- in return for 1 percent commission. [Kucherenko] There is the opinion that it was not the banks but structures involved in financial operations without banking licenses that started the race to see "who could provide the higher interest rate." GMM and Tibet, for instance. In the opinion of CBR Deputy Chairman D. Tulin, these structures operate on the principle of the "pyramid game": They pay stupendous interest rates on hard-currency deposits by attracting more and more money from the gullible. [Melnikov] There is regrettably a naive belief in miracles in our society, the belief that you can bury five gold coins in a field and get 100 times that amount in the morning. As long as there is a social breeding ground for all manner of "miracle workers," there will always be a handful of smart operators ready to offer the means to fabulous wealth. But all these "miracle workers" mainly operate with the far from rich ordinary population. The banks on the other hand prefer their clients to be a little more sound. Everything will evidently change when the inflated structures burst and a load of people lose their money irretrievably. [Kucherenko] But people should not be educated at such a terrible price! There is the Law "On Currency Regulation," which prohibits involvement in currency operations without licenses. [Melnikov] The point is that our laws are still extremely lax and imperfect. Britain's banking legislation for instance fills over 70 volumes and regulates literally every move that bankers make. Everything has been done to protect the client against fraud. If you try that here you immediately get a reputation for opposing the free market economy and supporting administrative-edict methods. You say that licenses are needed. The Law on Currency Regulation mainly acts as a framework, countless instructions are needed for it. We have managed to write a whole series of them, each one taking five to six months. [Kucherenko] But can charges not be filed against a particular company for its advertising? Is it not a fact that the procedure for conducting currency operations is being breached? [Melnikov] We have no legal documents pertaining to advertising, and whole pages of newspapers are crammed full of illegal announcements. For instance: "I am opening offshore companies on the Cayman Islands without a CBR license." That is a typical breach of procedure, commonplace smuggling of capital offshore in order to evade taxation. But we only have to resort to the courts and they will demand that an operational investigation be conducted: Do prove to us, with documents and other material evidence, that this firm has opened offshore offices for this or that client. We do not have the resources for that. Take GMM, which moves depositors' money without a license, i.e. is engaged in illegal actions. In this situation I think that law-enforcement bodies, primarily the prosecutor's office, should put a halt to the activity of a transgressor regardless of the latter's jurisdiction. GMM is a Dutch firm, but it is operating on our market and violating our laws. [Kucherenko] What about Tibet, is it a foreign resident? [Melnikov] We cannot do the work of the tax police! God willing, by the end of the year we will somehow have to write instructions regarding the Law on Currency Regulation. A tremendous amount of work is needed to give Russia a statutory banking base. Today a situation reigns in financial affairs that makes foreigners despair. Unlike our country, in the United States you cannot put more than $10,000 in an account without providing documentary confirmation that this money has been earned legally. Actual financial control in the Russian Federation is divided between the Finance Ministry's Auditing Administration, ourselves, the tax police, the Federal Service for Currency-Export Controls, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs. It is hard to coordinate the work. Many structures are still only just being formed and, organizationally, are extremely weak. Yet banking, tax, and currency legislation are simultaneously being violated at every turn. It would be sensible to look at the experience of the Italians, who, afflicted as they are by the mafia and corruption, have combined all control and financial organs in the Guardia di Finanza. Were we to set up something of the sort based on the tax police, for instance, many establishments would inevitably fall within this structure's purview. But we are doing something even now. We recently checked the work of currency exchange points in Moscow. Abuses were discovered at one bank ("Stayl" -- author's note). And the CBR suspended its license for hard currency transactions.
