FR940224-0-00048 FR940224-0-00006 The following table shows the method of calculating the Effective Calculating Rate (R) for each ``Computing Element'' (``CE''): Step 1: The effective calculating rate R. ␣ 1For computing elements (CEs) Implementing: Note: Every ``CE'' must be evaluated independently 1Effective calculating rate, R XP only (R xp ) 1 3 * (t xp add ). ␣ If no add is implemented use: 1 (t xp mult ). ␣ If neither add nor multiply is implemented use the fastest available arithmetic operation as follows: ␣ 1 3 * (t xp ). ␣ See Notes X and Y. FP only (R fp ) Max 1 t fp add , ␣ 1 t fp mult . ␣ See Notes X and Y. Both FP and XP (R) Calculate both R xp , R fp . For simple logic processors not implementing any of the specified arithmetic operations 1 3 * t log . ␣ Where t log is the execute time of the XOR, or for logic hardware not implementing the XOR, the fastest simple logic operation. ␣ See Notes X and Z. For special logic processors not using any of the specified arithmetic or logic operations R = R t * WL/64, Where R is the number of results per second, WL is the number of bits upon which the logic operation occurs, and 64 is a factor to normalize to a 64 bit operation. Note W: For a pipelined ``CE'' capable of executing up to one arithmetic or logic operation every clock cycle after the pipeline is full, a pipelined rate can be established. The effective calculating rate (R) for such a ``CE'' is the faster of the pipelined rate or non-pipelined execution rate.
