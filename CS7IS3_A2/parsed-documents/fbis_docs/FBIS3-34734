May God protect you dear ones, you brave Islamic community. Thank you very much for your kindness and good words. To calm the crowd, let us all chant a slogan in honor of the Prophet. In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful. It is truly a shame that our dear Imam [Khomeyni] and martyrs cannot be with us today to see this splendid scene of the extensive presence of the Islamic ummah in Freedom Square. Of course, their blessed spirits are with us and they can witness this glorious gathering, these enthusiastic sentiments and this historical epic. I can see in the surrounding areas, in all the streets leading up to this square -- as far as the eye can see, there are crowds hastening and rushing toward the square, chanting slogans, although they know they will not arrive in time for the ceremony. They keep coming, however, just to say, we are here just as always. I would like to thank them most humbly and I would like to praise their intelligence, awareness, loyalty and sincerity. Undoubtedly, today, on 22 Bahman, beginning the 16th year of this glorious revolution's life, hundreds of millions of eyes are gazing at this spot from throughout the world and, tonight, hundreds of millions of people will sit around their television sets to see images of this splendid gathering and to renew, once again, their hopes in the future of Islam's revolution and to revitalize themselves for greater action and jihad. And our enemies are watching the streets of Tehran with anxiety and with the false hope that, with the passage of time, our people will become alienated from the revolution or indifferent to it. God willing, they will take this hope to their graves. The people can sense the presence of the revolution in their lives with all their existence and this tangible sense that they have of the effects of the revolution will not allow them to forget it, even though the new generation does not have any memory of the past and cannot compare the post-revolution society with the pre-revolution one. However, it has heard from others and from history and it knows. And, even if it does not know about the past, it can compare its own society with other societies. They can compare this society where the names of heaven, the Koran and the lofty commandments of Islam fill the air with their perfume with those other societies where blasphemy, atheism, apathy, and secular systems invite the people to be immoral and unjust, to discriminate, to submit to sensual pleasures and ungodly ways. The new generation, too, is suitably equipped to make this comparison, assessment and judgement. Sixteen years ago our nation which had gathered in this very Azadi Square and streets leading to the cemetery and waited to see its imam had not seen the present days. This is the main difference between the young generation then and the young generation now. At that time they looked to the future and today they see the manifestations of the divine promises. Many of the manifestations of dualism, oppression, corruption, and tyranny which ruled over our society have gone. The manifestations that had turned everywhere, the television, radio, school, university, seaside, street, movie theater, theater, newspapers and magazines to centers of vice, lust and corruption of the youth. All things were contaminated with the corrupt western culture. But wherever they look today they see the Koran, Islam, call to justice, propagation of virtues and prohibition of vice, prayers and justice. The furthest we go from the capital and move into the heart of villages and the border regions, the affects of the revolution are better felt. There they know that all services once used only in the capital and several large cities are now provided to all parts of the country. Schools, electricity, drinking water, roads for transport, telephone and post are being provided to distant villages and places in the deserts in the same fashion that that they are provided for the cities. They see that the country's means are being used in the more distant places for development and construction. In the past few days people have heard that 1,600 development projects in deprived areas and thousands of more development projects across the country have started operations. The radio and television and the press have reported on some of these but the people who live in those areas feel their effect. The further we go from the capital, the people are happier, fresher, more hopeful, more participant, and more loyal to the revolution. With such background and realities the news of imperialism is wasting its time uselessly. The more they propagate the less they achieve. The more they seek to blackmail through propaganda the less the result. In fact on the contrary, the false propaganda reminds the people of the world -- who might gradually forget the revolution if left to themselves -- to study our revolution and thus we add to the supporters of the revolution every day across the world, despite all the dreadful propaganda. They have left no accusation and lie. For years they accused us of terrorism but the world does not believe it. The people across the world can see the hands involved in terrorism. People know the victims of international terrorism. In Iran people have seen and buried enough victims of terrorism and today continue to visit the grave of their martyrs for prayers. How could they believe the American accusations that Iranians are terrorists and support terrorists in the world. They accuse Iran of violating human rights. But their own hands are in the the people's blood up to their elbows and their whole being is involved with usurping human rights. Bosnia, Palestine, Somalia, and other places are witness to this claim of ours. If today they raise any issue regarding social justice and global peace, the people of the world will not believe them when they witness the Bosnia-Herzegovina case. But the people of the world see that truly the Islamic Republic declares that we are ready to despatch 10,000 soldiers -- who will take their lives in their hands -- to Bosnia at our won expense so as to establish peace and consolidate security but they do not let us in because they know we will be supporting righteousness and peace over there, which is something that they do not seek. The claim of human rights violation against Iran falls on deaf ears among nations; although the media and mercenary news agencies propagate such claims. That fails to have any effect on our nation. All their propaganda arrows have hit granite. They have begun an extensive propaganda onslaught so that they might make our nation despair about the future and become discouraged. But even there the palpable effects of the revolution do not allow them to succeed. They embark on economic sanctions, put pressure on our income resources. They wish to damage us -- at the expense of their own friends -- by making oil prices plummet. But tomorrow they will see that even those actions will bring about a reverse result; something that is quite palpable today. The world will notice that such words are no longer of any effect. In these 15 years -- and specifically in its First Development Plan -- the Iranian nation succeeded in carrying out infrastructural work in such a way that the oil price fall can no longer inflict any general damage to this country and or to the revolution since plans have been made to replace oil revenue by various means. At one time we needed to sell oil and import goods for all our consumer requirements so that our people could live. But those days have now passed. Today our factories take the main part of their raw materials -- from steel, copper, lead, and zinc to aluminum -- from what we produce ourselves. And our other factories take the main part of their requirements from our own petrochemicals. And our laborers today work with indigenous, Iranian and national materials. Our specialist forces have taken the place of foreign advisors and experts to such an extent that in no arena does our nation feel the need for any foreign expert force. And if there is a special case there are adequate numbers of those who would take a wage, work, and take orders. The Iranian factories do not need to make use of arrogant forces. More than 90 percent of the country's consumer goods are being made in our own factories and workshops. Our nation, our farmers, our cattleowners, our poulterers, and our fishermen have been able to meet the society's required food supply by their own efforts and with the aid of their system and government. And export a great deal as well. They thought that, with all the machinery in our possession, we would be dependent on spare parts. With the extensive measures that were taken in relation to making and designing spare parts inside the country, according to a very firm policy, during the past five years, today, we do not need to import any spare parts for a great deal of our industrial equipment. Our universities are rapidly supplying our required work force. The dependence of our communications on foreign resources has been reduced to a very small amount. They can indulge in as much propaganda as they like to dishearten our people, but our people can see how things are for themselves. They saw how their regime pursued two very difficult programs at the same time: one, economic adjustment, and, two, economic development; giving priority to infrastructural and cultural tasks. They saw how it travelled this path with success. They can also see how our own neighbors are having so many difficulties in carrying out their policies of economic adjustment and of changing their structures. Can this have any reason other than that our people are present on the stage, are vigilant, are aware, support their regime, endure the problems that result from this revolution treading along its difficult path by itself, obey the eminent leader of their revolution [Khamene'i], are loyal to the path of their eminent late imam, value the blood shed by their martyrs and draw inspiration from the dear families of martyrs, those missing in action, the war disabled and the former POWs and from the proud POWs and war disabled themselevs, who are the torches guiding this country. And the hizbollah forces throughout the country, in villages, towns, factories, schools, universities, offices -- everyone can see among themselves everywhere these intelligent, dear and determined supporters of the revolution. They can see the armed forces [crowd interrupts chanting slogans] -- thank you for your good words and sentiments. They see the Armed Forces, the Revolution Guards' Corps, the proud Mobilization forces, the Law Enforcement Forces and the other sectors at the service and in great support of the revolution. This great body is participating in all villages and cities across the country. Everywhere you will see something similar to the Azadi square where intelligent and enlightened people have come to express their loyalty, strength, and steadfastness. Reports I have received since this morning indicate that across the country people are using their time, effort, and voice at the service of the revolution and Islam today. Your participation will make the faltering tongues of the world arrogance stutter even more for sometime and will shut them up. And even if they scream and yell it will only hit a mountain that will return it to them. I sincerely thank your honors and the dear students who carried out such a sweet song so well in this great square and all those who organized and managed the good programs for the Ten Days of Dawn celebrations. May God keep you. God willing we will meet again in the other venues of the revolution. May God's blessings and peace be upon you.
