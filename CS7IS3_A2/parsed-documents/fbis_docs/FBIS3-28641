Ambassador Georgiy Kunadze and four other Russian Embassy officials sailed to the scene of the sinking of two Russian gun boats near Sowolmi-do Island aboard a maritime police patrol ship at 2 pm to observe the service. The two Russian ships, 6,500-ton Variak and 1,200-ton Koryeth, were sunk in a battle with six Japanese warships on Feb. 9, 1904, one day after the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese war. The Russian vessels were in the Inchon harbor at that time to protect the Russian legation in Seoul. Sixty-four wounded sailors of the two ships were evacuated to nearby English, French and Italian vessels. But, the remainders went down with their vessels as they sank their ships rather than to surrender to the Japanese. Earlier in the day, Ambassador Kunadze and his party called at the Inchon City Hall and discussed with Mayor Choe Ki-son ways to promote exchanges and cooperation between Inchon and Russian cities.
