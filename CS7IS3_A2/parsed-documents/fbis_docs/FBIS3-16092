The Palestine Liberation Organization is headquartered in the Tunisian capital. The Russian foreign minister will hold talks with the Palestinian leadership, in particular he will meet Yasir 'Arafat and will pass to him a personal message from Russian President Boris Yeltsin. The main goal of the visit is to assist in bringing together the stances of the PLO and Israel and to achieve a compromise with regard to resuming the Palestinian-Israeli dialogue as soon as possible. This dialogue was frozen two weeks ago after a Jewish settler opened fire on Arabs during worship at a mosque in al-Khalil on the occupied West Bank. The MENA news agency reports that Andrey Kozyrev intends to set out Russia's viewpoint to the PLO on the current stage of the Middle East peace process, which is above all the need to implement the PLO-Israeli agreement on self-government for Palestinians in the Gaza strip and the Jericho area. The Russian foreign affairs head and the PLO Executive Committee chairman are expected to begin their talks within the next few hours. Also, during his stay in Tunis, Andrey Kozyrev is expected to be received by Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. The Russian minister arrived in Tunis from Israel, where today he held a series of intensive consultations with his opposite number Shim'on Peres and met Jewish Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin.
