He told journalists in Moscow today that the decision regarding the ultimatum was adopted at a high-level session of the European Union (EU) and session of the NATO Permanent Council in Brussels. The ultimatum's essence is a threat of carrying out air strikes on Serb positions, if the Serbs do not pull out their heavy weapons from the security zone around Sarajevo by a specified date, he said. The problem is not to put an end to the inhuman siege of the Bosnian capital, the German parliamentarian added, nobody is opposed to it. The question concerns consequences of such a step, which are difficult to predict now. In order to put the ultimatum into action, inevitably further decisions will have to be adopted, which will not only involve a military, but also a political risk. At stake is the prestige of the U.N. and the capability of the world organization to carry out further actions in order to settle the Sarajevo conflict. Besides this, Sarajevo is not an isolated incident. There are other cities in Bosnia which have been besieged not only by the Serbs, but also by the Moslems and Croats. That is why while resolving the Bosnian problem, all politicians should also take into consideration its complexity and diversity, Voigt noted. Replying to a question asked by this correspondent, the Bundestag member expressed an understanding of the Russian Foreign Ministry's position. I share the apprehensions of Russian diplomats regarding the use of military means in order to resolve the problem, Voigt said. Like them, I also think that the use of force will lead to a further escalation of violence. Difference of opinions exist in the assessment of the situation, which has emerged after the declaration of the ultimatum, he emphasised. Now the U.N. and the North Atlantic Union should seek its implementation, so as to maintain the convincingness [as received] of its policy and capability in the future, he said.
