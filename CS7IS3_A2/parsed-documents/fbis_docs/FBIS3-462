What will remain are institutions and structures at a political and socio-economic level. The key danger to the transition will be from the apartheid bureaucracy. The demise of apartheid may open up contradictions between organised labour and the unemployed who could be exploited by employers. An ANC [African National Congress] government will be under tremendous pressure from small and medium size enterprises whose approach to wages undermines labour standards and worker rights. Loss of Leadership The nominations for the national and regional legislatures have taken away certain key leadership including officials. Loss of leadership is also positive (in that people with a working class background will be in decision-making places in our country). Our success will depend in part on our ability to consolidate the emerging leadership. Contradictions Within the Alliance Different Emphasis As the major partner in the new GNU [Government of National Unity], key personnel from within the ANC will find themselves in senior executive, legislative and administrative positions in national, provincial and local government. This reality will introduce new strategic challenges, social class/strata tendencies and tensions: A New Social Stratum The new reality will not just present a new strategic challenge. In effect, the promotion of several thousand key ANC-linked personnel into senior governmental positions will constitute the formation of a new social stratum. Between the new ANC senior governmental stratum, especially those in management roles in the civil service, and the mass of workers in the public sector certain tensions and contradictions will occur. This new social stratum may well exhibit new class tendencies which have an anti-popular character. But we must be careful not to present or conceptualise these strains as a simple ANC vs COSATU [Congress of South African Trade Unions] contradiction. The vast majority of public sector workers, and the majority of the popular masses are ANC activists, members or supporters. On the other hand, senior ANC personnel in government will also find themselves frustrated, undermined and blocked by the large bureaucracy they will inherit from apartheid. To some extent rank and file public sector workers (and workers more broadly in all sectors) will be natural allies of the new governmental strata. Quite apart from their subjective strengths and weaknesses, the new stratum will face contradictory strategic and class pulls and inclinations. Which of the different tendencies sketched out above will emerge as the dominant tendencies will be a function of strategic clarity on our part, struggle and the relative balance of organised forces within the broader ANC-led alliance. There are other contradictions that will face us. The ANC will be subjected to a lot of demands by all sorts of interest groups. Our membership will expect change in the conditions of work and living standards. Employers will expect the ANC to confront us on issues such as a productivity, minimum wage and to accept a wage restraint. The ANC as the government of the day will have to concern itself with catering for the needs of society as a whole, including our class enemies. The prospect of a new public sector union engaged in negotiations with an ANC government is both challenging and full of uncertainties. Contradictions and differences may not only be confined to COSATU and the ANC, but may also come from within. Already different strategies exist between unions. We need to find ways and means of containing these while emphasising areas of agreement. Our key role is not only to prevent contradictions and differences, but to find a way to manage them in the interest of the working class. Employers Strategies The opening up of the world to employers, the formation of a single employer organisation/federation will ensure greater coordination amongst them. They will attempt to copy the strategies of their counterparts in other parts of the world where attempts are being made to weaken and to split the labour movement. We must avoid being forced to articulate their position around the opening up of the economy. We need to increase our productive capacity to that of world standards. Such increase should be aimed at benefiting society as a whole. 2. Redefining Our Role The changing situation demands of us to redefine our role. New methods of dealing with problems, demands and expectations will have to be found. While workers in the past may have joined us because of our links with the Congress movement, in the future they will join us primarily because they expect us to safeguard their interests. Some will even put pressure on us to concentrate only on bread and butter issues and leave the rest to political parties and organisations. Our members are part of the community. Therefore we can never confine ourselves to bread and butter issues. They want houses, water, electricity, an end to violence, etc. Increasing the social wage of workers is our responsibility, we need to be engaged in struggle through the RDP [Reconstruction and Development Plan] and other avenues to win these issues. Trade Union Independence The strength of COSATU will depend in part on our ability to maintain trade union independence. We need to differentiate between independence and non-alignment. We are in alliance with the ANC and SACP [South African Communist Party] based on a particular programme. This alliance must be maintained and strengthened so as to ensure ever deeper and broader democracy. Independence means that we are not a conveyor belt of our alliance partners. It will be a sad day for trade unionism if COSATU was to become a sweetheart federation. Our members will do to us what we have done with the old TUCSA [Trade Union Council of South Africa] unions. Prioritising Our Involvement In the past year we have been involved in too many fora. In some of these we were represented in name only with either no person attending regularly or no report back and mandating structures in place. We need to prioritise issues around which we wish to negotiate in fora and participate to the best of our ability. Failure to prioritise will mean involvement in everything, but no capacity to deliver or time to develop policies. The weakness and vagueness of sections on Trade and Industry as well as labour market policies in the RDP is an indictment on COSATU. Defining a 3-5 year Strategic Vision In defining our role in this ever changing situation, we must base it on a long term sustainable strategic vision. Such a strategy, while allowing for dynamic changes, must guide us between now, the post-Election conference in May and the Fifth National Congress in September. From September onwards, we must be planning to confront challenges that lie ahead. Not only do we need a 3 year programme, but our strategies must take into account that the Government of National Unity and Reconstruction will last for about 5 years. Our strategy will have be underpinned by among others the following broad objectives: - winning an election - RDP that provides for real transformation - ending violence and crime - attaining financial self-sufficiency - mass driven programmes and campaigns - sustaining membership and growth - provide real service to affiliates - solidarity. We must also analyse and plan to deal with the strategies of employers at a regional level. No COSATU vision will succeed unless it is also based on the Southern African region. Issues such as regional economies, trade union solidarity and labour migration needs proper discussion. 3. Key Challenges As outlined at the beginning, many challenges will face us in the coming period. Key amongst these are: 3.1 Building organisation The paper presented at the Special Congress contained a nine point plan to strengthen organisation: Capacity building COSATU needs to build capacity (personnel and structures) that makes it possible for us to respond to defined priority areas timeously. Servicing Membership In almost all our regions, workers are complaining about lack of service and involvement in decision making. The majority of our affiliates still use the same structures and methods of the early eighties to drive the organisation forward. Most cases either go unchallenged or are badly handled, resulting in disgruntlement and resignation. In most factories that hard fought for victory for holding general meetings during working hours is no longer utilised. Building Structures and Layers of Leadership The cornerstone of our organisation is supposed to be locals. In most areas they either do not exist or are not being attended by shopstewards and officials. While it is true that violence plays a role in the declining attendance, our neglect of those structures is a contributing factor. The other factor is the status of locals in COSATU. We need to revisit our debate on the role of locals and regions in the run up to the 5th National Congress. If we are going to be a real force against employers, we will have to once more rely on our members to defend us against them. Realignment of Structures The two previous papers on demarcation has proven that there is a bigger debate looming in industrial demarcation. We have two routes: One is to implement piecemeal as we go along, the other is to wait until we have concluded the whole debate. The danger is that we are faced with an immediate task of putting together a service sector union and that waiting too long would just kill the initiative. The reality is that we need to redefine industry and build strong unions. Interaction With Institutions We need to put structures for the implementation of the RDP in place. Their role before the elections will be to identify areas of concern to COSATU, institutions and organisations with whom we need to interact, build capacity for implementation. Beyond the elections they will have to relate to a number of fora, affiliates, employers and government structures. The ANC conference resolution places the coordination of the RDP at the President's office and Premiers. We must realign our structures to the same scenario. Setting Up Proper Fora After the elections, we must identify a few forums for participation, develop policies and feed this publicly or through our interaction with mass bases formations. We should concentrate on the following areas: Trade and Industry and Industrial Strategy in particular, Workplace Democracy, Public Sector and Parastatals, Labour Market issues, Education and Training and Macro-Economic policies. We must consider pushing for a merger of the NEF [National Economic Forum] and NMC [National Manpower Commission] structures to deal with labour market and macro-economic issues. We should also debate the possibility of setting up a committee that interacts with government on socio-economic issues. All interest groups of significance would be represented. Policy Formulation Apart from principled positions, we have got no detailed policies on a number of crucial issues. Very often we reach consensus only to return to the same issue at the next meeting. We should put together a team/s to look at the following areas: - minimum wages - grading/skills/wages - investment strategy - new comprehensive LRA [Labor Relations Act] - labour based (construction) standards and wage rates on labour intensive construction and public works programme. - Affirmative action - Productivity. The Struggle for Socialism The special Congress held in September reaffirmed our commitment to socialism. We need to ensure that conditions for such advancement are possible. The RDP, while itself not a socialist programme, lays the basis for such advancement. COSATU together with SACP and other organs of civil society need to plan beyond the end of the GNU around which the RDP is based. The conference on socialism must emerge with certain answers and a programme that can easily be implemented. we also need to find ways and means of strengthening the Left both inside and outside of parliament.
