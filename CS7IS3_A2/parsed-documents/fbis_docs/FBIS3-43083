In familiarizing readers with its content, we will allow ourselves some comments in passing. After the breakup of the Union, as the situation in Russia became more acute, the West was faced with the threat of a catastrophe associated with the brain drain, and with it also new technologies in the field of the means of mass annihilation. Even more than in the past there was a strengthened fear of the proliferation of nuclear weapons, especially their appearance in countries with an unpredictable policy. This circumstance aroused Western analysts to concern themselves with work on the matter of aid to Russian scientists. The pursued objective was not only to retain control over nuclear weapons, but also to take advantage for themselves of the rich scientific potential of Russian scientists, attracting them to joint development work by extending financial support along the lines of both international funds and national corporations, funds and societies having adequate financial and scientific resources. A concise prehistory of this is as follows. James Baker, the former American Secretary of State, in September 1992 conveyed to B. N. Yeltsin, president of the Russian Federation, the information that the United States was ready to make its contribution to the saving of Russian science. He promised to seek $25 million for these purposes which it was proposed be distributed among scientists engaged in the military field. This initiative received official support in Russia. Subsequently the European Community joined this initiative, promising to allocate an additional $19 million. In turn, Japan obligated itself to add $17 million for this very same purpose. George Bush, president of the United States, assumed that in cooperative work it would be possible to maintain the scientific capabilities of Russia. He laid great hopes on the International Science and Technology Center, which was to award its first grant not later than May 1992. Sixteen months have elapsed, but this international center has not allocated a single penny for these purposes. The Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation in every way possible has held onto the possibility of such cooperation. Both the supporters and opponents of this idea in its ranks have become very active. The first have striven not to lose their positions in the field of the fundamental sciences where our scientists have been traditionally strong. The second have found such an alliance to be humiliating, on the one hand, and on the other hand they have expressed the fear that such a policy will favor the leakage of secret information. However, each of the well-developed countries has sought to extract the maximum advantage for itself and has been in no hurry to allocate money to the Russians. Negotiations at the top frequently end with assurances of readiness for cooperation, but the times for allocating sums are constantly violated. The selectivity of interests also has exerted an influence. For example, the Americans have been primarily attracted by space research. They have promised Russia that $100 million will be released for use on the Mir space station and the right to conclude contracts for the launch of commercial satellites. However, our country has received only $34 million of the $250 million promised through all channels. Long months have passed on different kinds of agreements and understandings. As a result, the process of implementing the project has assumed a drawn-out character, has begun to develop on a noncentralized basis (it always was centralized in the former USSR when the agreeing side was either the CPSU Central Committee or the USSR Academy of Sciences and different ministries), e.g. through individual private funds. One of the first who succeeded in overcoming the bureaucracy was the billionaire G. Soros, who set aside $100 million for Russian science. But it was found that just money was not enough. It was first necessary to establish a banking and accounting system, a control system, a system for expert evaluation of projects and purposeful selection of organizations and specific individuals whose activity would command the respect of American specialists and appeal to their interests. Months also were spent on this and meanwhile a considerable percentage of the promising scientists had already emigrated from Russia. Just at the Nuclear Research Institute imeni Kurchatov 20 of the 54 scientists of the Plasma Theory Section have departed for the West, and as far as can be determined, they have no intention of returning. Scientists are unsettled with respect to their status as researchers and their material rewards. Some foreign funds would like to avoid high taxes in their own countries and therefore are not adverse to investing sums for beneficial purposes, such as the subsidization of Russian science. However, it is not so easy to accomplish this. In the Russian Federation private individuals do not have the right to receive hard currency from abroad. No one is fully confident that the allocated sums will reach the intended recipients because they pass through several bureaucratic levels (customs, bank, institution where the specialist works). It is not always possible to set up the base necessary for research in place. Sending the money on is complicated by high taxes. The Americans have become convinced that the Russian side is misusing the aid sent. For example, Russian individuals in many cases travel to the United States who have nothing to do with those programs for which the sums were allocated. This circumstance prompted our American colleagues to put this work under their control. In December 1992 the Russian Federation was visited by a group of scientists from the United States for on-the-spot familiarization with the most promising scientific centers. Without special difficulty they determined 22 research groups meriting special attention, 21 of which were immediately included in a plan for the funding of scientific work. A grant in the sum of $5,000 annually was set aside for the scientists of each group and one scientific association received $30,000 from the Human Genome fund. The money will be sent directly to those doing the work. Plans call for increasing the number of grants, the amount of which varies from $10 to $100 thousand, under two-year scientific programs. Difficulties arise with respect to expert evaluation of the applications submitted for receiving such grants. Plans call for involving the leading scientists of the United States, Western Europe and Japan in this work. Cooperation with Western colleagues in the science field is not limited solely to funding. It is not less important to exchange scientific information [publications, holding of scientific conferences and such. In this connection the authors of publications mention the slowness in the finalization of exit visas, which results in the disruption of foreign missions of Russian scientists.] The table accompanying this article, published in the mentioned journal, is of interest.

The others are either in the organizational phase or have already depleted their resources. Those organizations which do not publicize their intentions but make a contribution to supporting the development of Russian science arouse a definite sympathy. A long procedure is involved in receiving grants. And this is entirely to be expected. In the West they are not accustomed to throwing money to the winds. For us it was typical to receive subsidies from the state and not always was attention given to the results of our own research. In many cases the subsidies were used by science and education officials to make trips to different countries, where at government expense they satisfied their personal curiosity and also pursued more mercantile objectives. Unfortunately, this also is no rarity today. The birthmarks of socialism do not go away rapidly. And so it goes that foreign colleagues invite you to international congresses, you try to formalize travel documents, but the real possibility for departure is in the hands of completely other people -- either ministerial workers or officials at institutions of higher education who have accomplished little in science and who are completely unknown in the West. It happens that a scientist is invited to work at the WHO and a person goes who is closer to the administrative circles of the Ministry of Health or a scientific research institute. It appears that in our system for evaluating the intellectual capabilities of a specialist, his social and juridical defensibility, we will not very soon put our house in order in this respect. That is why there is the fear that the system of grants is being used by ``go-getters.'' The system of grants may possibly seem to some to be humiliating. But under the conditions of negligence of science, education and public health in our country it would be incorrect to ignore it. Otherwise we risk falling completely behind in our own development, losing traditions and priorities in science. Science as a part of culture is international. A scientist has a motherland, but science does not. Its results belong to all mankind.
