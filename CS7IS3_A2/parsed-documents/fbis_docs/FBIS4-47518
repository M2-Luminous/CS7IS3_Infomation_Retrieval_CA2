The Transcarpathian, Crimean, Ciscarpathian, Poltava, Lugansk, Kherson, and Zaporozhye oblasts have been deemed possible sites for the use of geothermal energy. According to scientists' estimates, the potential geothermal energy resources of these areas can support the operation of (1) geothermal power plants with a total capacity of as much as 230 million kW assuming well depths up to 7 km and (2) a geothermal heating system with a total capacity of as much as 1,370 million kW assuming wells up to 4 km deep. It should be noted that these are cautious estimates that have been made after studying about 15 percent of all potential sites. The Transcarpathian Oblast has been determined to be especially promising for the development of geothermal power generation. In the said oblast, rock at depths up to 6 km has7 temperatures ranging from 230 to 275�C. Four extensive territories (total area, 330-380 km[.sup]2[/]) with an elevated geothermal gradient have been identified in the Transcarpathian Oblast. Ukraine still lags behind foreign countries from the standpoint of developments related to intensive extraction of the heat of heated rocks located deep below the earth's surface. Several underground circulation systems have been considered along with possible designs for a geothermal power plant that includes a geothermal circulation system. Special attention is being paid to the combined use of low-potential heat and heat obtained by burning fuel, which is estimated to result in an efficiency of 40-70 percent depending on the end temperature of the coolant discharged from the system and the initial temperature of the thermal water. The best systems currently achieve temperatures of 35-45�C. The use of heat pumps in geothermal heating systems will make it possible to reduce this temperature to 5-10�C, and an initial coolant temperature of 70-80�C will make it possible to double the intensity of the heat extraction process. A computer program has been developed to perform 10 sequential calculations to determine the technical and economic feasibility of proposed geothermal power plants. According to the program, given the elevated geothermal gradient encountered in Ukraine (i.e., 22-25 m/�), the optimum coolant temperature would be 190-220�C, which translates into a circulation zone depth of 5.0-5.5 km. Given current prices for electricity produced at nuclear power plants and state regional electric power plants, a geothermal power plant constructed in regions with an elevated geothermal gradient (i.e., <20 m/�) would be competitive in today's market. After the year 2000, even geothermal power plants constructed in regions with average geothermal gradients (i.e., > 25 m/�) would be competitive with nuclear and state regional electric power plants. The operating modes and process equipment of experimental geothermal power plants in Ukraine remain to be worked out. Construction of commercial geothermal power plants may begin thereafter (beginning in 1993-1994) in areas with high geothermal gradients. Figures 5; references 6 (Russian).
