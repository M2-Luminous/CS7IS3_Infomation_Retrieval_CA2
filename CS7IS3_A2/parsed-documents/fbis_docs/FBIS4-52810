The organization itself is still following the North Korean line, but its constituents are wavering. The possibility of their collective secession from Chongnyon is still slim because their families are held in North Korea as hostages, because they would have no means of livelihood if they leave Chongnyon, and because of the sense of loyalty that they should not betray the organization that gave them help. Although they are physically involved in Chongnyon, their sense of disappointment with North Korea, which they believed to be a paradise on earth, has increased over the years and their expectations for reunification are growing distant. As a result, an attitude of attaching more importance to "oneself" than the "organization" is being created. The nationality of pro-Chongnyon people is simply "Korean" [Choson], neither North nor South Korean. On the other hand, members of the Federation of Korean Residents in Japan [Mindan-- pro-ROK organization] clearly have the nationality of the ROK. Because there are no diplomatic relations established with North Korea, the Japanese Government does not recognize the nationality of "Korean" as the title of the nation. The Japanese Government regards it merely as an "emblem." If pro-Chongnyon people want to visit North Korea, they have to obtain a "voyage certificate" from the Japanese Government without fail. If they do not obtain this certificate, they will not be allowed to return to Japan. This is not all the inconveniences that affect their daily life. With its past record of "destructive and violent acts" committed in the course of its formation, Chongnyon is an organization subject to application of the Japanese "destruction prevention law." If Chongnyon commits acts destroying Japanese order, the Japanese Government may issue an order for forcible dissolution of Chongnyon at any time according to the law. This is why Chongnyon headquarters frequently hand out an order to its subordinate organizations to abide by the law. On the contrary, Mindan is not subject to application of this law. There are many factors threatening Chongnyon organizations, including various restrictions, a sense of upcoming economic unrest if economic sanctions are imposed on North Korea, and human rights issues for Japanese living in North Korea that have been raised among the people in Japan. Moreover, even its constituents tend to show a move to seek "oneself" instead of "organization" and "welfare" instead of "ideology." As a result, Chongnyon's Central Standing Committee is in a difficult position of having to simultaneously deal with outside threats and internal discontent. In testimony at the Japanese Diet on 30 March, Ogata Shigetake, director-general of the Japanese Agency for Public Security and Investigation, said that there are about 680,000 South and North Korean people residing in Japan. Of them, 369,000 are pro-Mindan and 247,000 are pro-Chongnyon. He also revealed that among pro-Chongnyon people 56,000 are actively involved in Chongnyon. These 56,000 people are "main force" [Chonjong yowon] who sustain Chongnyon organizations. They are only one-fourth of all Chongnyon constituents. This "main force" is further classified into "organizational staff," "full-time workers" and "activists." The organizational staff and full-time workers are paid every month by the Chongnyon Central Standing Committee and activists are those who positively participate in Chongnyon activities. They play the role of shock brigades by actively opposing anti-Chongnyon forces within Japan by violent means in disguise of lawfulness. Organizational staff and full-time workers are afraid that diplomatic relations will be established between Japan and North Korea. They fear that if Japanese-North Korean diplomatic relations are established, Chongnyon's properties and organizations will be absorbed and they will lose their jobs to those who North Korea assigns to Japan. 500,000 Yen Per Person for a Meeting With Kim Il-song North Korea's Kim Il-song sent a congratulatory message to Han Tok-su, chairman of Chongnyon, on 1 January 1993, and emphasized the strengthening of Chongnyon organizations and the establishment of an ideological guidance system. In this message, Kim Il-song urged Chongnyon to promote its patriotic work--the work of supporting North Korea--to a higher stage and to prepare Chongnyon to be a "reliable defender of the socialist fatherland." Experts in issues concerning Chongnyon unanimously noted that the popularity of North Korea within Chongnyon began to gradually decrease starting in the early 1980's and began to fall rapidly in the late eighties. The amount of money remitted to North Korea by individuals fell to 10 million yen from 100 million yen, and has even fallen to 1 million yen subsequently. Since the amount of money remitted to North Korea has decreased, North Korea resorted to various means to deprive Chongnyon of money. Mr. Chang Myong-su (60), senior secretary of the "Council for Measures for Compatriots Repatriated to North Korea," who is waging a movement for human rights of the compatriots repatriated to North Korea, said: Two hundred students of Chongnyon-affiliated Choson University were collectively repatriated to North Korea in 1972. North Korea tried to send 50 students of the 200 to Japan in 1991 for the purpose of begging money from their former classmates who inherited wealth from their parents and who were now engaged in large business by pleading their difficult life in North Korea. North Korea gave up this plan because of a possibility of diplomatic friction and fear that the students would escape and not return to North Korea. North Korea also attempted to sell grave sites to Chongnyon in 1984. A Chongnyon-affiliated leading businessman said: Any man, after getting old, thinks of his native home. This is more true for Chongnyon's first generation, which is older than 60. North Korea, keenly sensing such feelings by Chongnyon's first generation, proposed the sale of grave sites in an attempt to earn foreign currency. In other words, North Korea wanted to sell excellent sites in native towns for grave sites for the sake of money. This work was urged under Kim Chong-il's leadership. The concrete amount of payment for each pyong [land measurement] of land was bargained for. Kim Il-song, learning of this, opposed the sale, and stated that "although earning foreign currency is important, the act of selling land in a socialist country cannot be tolerated." An even more serious incident occurred during the Pyongyang youth festival in 1989. The Pyongyang festival was an international event arranged by North Korea in an attempt to cope with the 1988 Seoul Olympics. Yim Su-kyong, a student of Korea University of Foreign Studies in Seoul, voluntarily went to the North in order to attend this event. In the wake of this youth festival, North Korea advanced the following propaganda in an effort to induce donations to Chongnyon: "If you pay 5 million yen [$49,000] per person, you will be allowed to meet the great leader by visiting Pyongyang by a special plane." Nevertheless, the response to this propaganda was negligible. Therefore, North Korea lowered the amount of payment, and in the final stage, the amount was decreased to 500,000 yen per person. The condition of meeting Kim Il-song by visiting Pyongyang in a special plane remained unchanged. As this was revealed, Chongnyon's main force publicly complained, stating that they devotedly worked for the socialist fatherland throughout their life but they were unable to meet the great leader. Now, however, if one pays money, a meeting with the great leader will be granted. How on earth can this happen? One of the impending difficult problems to which Chongnyon shows a most sensitive reaction is the anti-Chongnyon movement being waged in Japan. Anti-Chongnyon activities in Japan are categorized by two movements: One movement is pushed for and led by Ogawa, a professor of Tokyo University, and is waged by Japanese human rights organizations calling for the promotion of human rights in North Korea. The other movement is led by Chang Myong-su and is waged by former Chongnyon's core members calling for human rights protection of Korean compatriots repatriated to North Korea. Chongnyon Organization Central Standing Committee (One chairman, One first vice chairman, Nine vice chairmen) Secretariat Organizational Department Propaganda Department Political Department Education Department International Department Economy Department Social Affairs Department Cultural Department Planning Department Finance Department General Affairs Department Home-Visiting Department Local headquarters: 48 Chapter offices: 300 Branch offices: 1,550 Subordinate organizations: 18, including Chongnyon Chamber of Commerce Schools: 148 Enterprises: 23, including CHOSON SINBO Daily Professor Ogawa is a person well-known to us who revealed and made an issue of human rights in our country during the fifth and sixth Republics. However, he has now changed his attitude and presented human rights violations in North Korea to the Japanese Government. An anti-Chongnyon rally was held last April in Osaka and Tokyo. The rallies were disturbed by an organized opposition of the main forces [chonjong yowon] of Chongnyon. The Chongnyon main forces checked and frustrated the Osaka rally by force of arms. As this became a controversial issue in Japanese society, the Japanese police searched 13 Chongnyon offices in Osaka. Such a hard-line attitude of the Japanese police was said to be unprecedented. The Chongnyon could not counter the Japanese police's hard-line measures. Herein lies Chongnyon's dilemma. The dilemma is that if Chongnyon ignores anti-Chongnyon activities, a situation endangering its organizations will result and if it uses force against anti-Chongnyon activities it will result in the Japanese police further cracking down on Chongnyon organizations and may lead them to eventually apply the "destruction prevention law." It is known that Chongnyon has enough strength to the extent that it can buy off leading figures in Japanese political circles. However, it seems to be difficult for Chongnyon to check and frustrate human rights groups' activities. Under such a crisis, there have been signs that the unity of the organization is shaky. A typical example is its members' complaints against Ho Chong-man, its responsible vice chairman. Ho assumed the post last July. He is virtually the No. 2 man of Chongnyon and is regarded to succeed Chairman Han Tok-su. There still is controversy inside Chongnyon over the appointment of Ho to that post. Chongnyon was originally supposed to be made up of one first vice chairman and nine vice chairmen under the chairman. If the chairman is in an accident, the first vice chairman is supposed to be the acting chairman. Disregarding this stipulation, the Central Standing Committee of Chongnyon appointed Ho to that post on the grounds it was ordered by Kim Chong-il. At that time, Yi Chin-kyu was the first vice chairman. On the grounds that it is wrong to appoint a formerly expelled person to the post of vice chairman, there was prevalent criticism against the appointment of Ho--who had been expelled in 1968 after being branded a factionalist in an internal feud involving Chongnyon's command system--to the post of responsible vice chairman. Any decision of the Central Standing Committee should be referred to an enlarged central committee for deliberation and then to a plenary meeting for approval. This appointment, however, did not follow such a procedure. This move has been criticized as being an expedient. Since the appointment of Ho, the Chongnyon Central Committee has held a succession of support rallies or study meetings for bureau chief-level and above officials, thus preventing this from becoming an issue. Despite this, Chongnyon members have been keeping a keen eye on the activities of Ho as he is smart in `money.' Ho had been trained in the International Affairs Department and the Financial Affairs Department of Chongnyon. He has never worked in the Organization Bureau or Social and Cultural Bureau. Those inside and outside Chongnyon say that he is a careerist who has handled only money. Therefore, it is believed he will forcibly sell Chongnyon's property in Japan and send it to North Korea if it is necessary to advance his career. The issue of disposing of Chongnyon property is a sensitive one between North Korea and Chongnyon. Fight Over Property Between North Korea and Chongyon Chongnyon members have shown responses of "it is unexpected" or "it is a mystery" regarding Kim Il-song's appointment of Ho Chong-man. They suspect it is a calculated step to divert Chongnyon property to North Korea as Ho is a colleague of former Chongnyon Vice Chairman Kim Pyong-sik, who was appointed vice president of North Korea in an abrupt manner. Chongnyon property is estimated to amount to as much as between 20 trillion yen (about 200 billion dollars) and 30 trillion yen from a combination of bank deposits of Chongnyon people and stationary assets, such as buildings affiliated with Chongnyon. This is several tens of times as much as North Korea's GNP of $21.7 billion as of the end of 1992. As of the end of July 1993, deposits at finance institutions, such as the Choson Bank, Credit Union, and Kumgang Insurance Company, amounted to 2,390 billion yen (about 25 billion dollars). Buildings such as Chongnyon Central Hall, Choson Publishing Hall, and CHOSON SINBO are located in the center of downtown Tokyo, where land prices are the highest in the world. A total of 148 schools affiliated with Chongnyon are also stationary assets with immense value. Originally such stationary assets belonged to each individual. As their owners die, ownership has experienced a change in type. The type differs by regions. In the case of Osaka, there are four Chongnyon headquarters in the eastern, western, southern, and central regions. The land and buildings in the eastern, southern, and central regions are all under individuals' names. The land in the western region is under an individual's name, but the building is under the name of Kongyong Corporation. The corporation is known to be affiliated with Chongnyon. Property in some regions are under the names of a responsible person of a Chongnyon chapter, a responsible person in the commercial and industrial sector, or a third person. North Korea claims they own this property. Some people in Chongnyon, including responsible vice chairman Ho Chong-man, sympathize with this claim. The majority assert, however, that the property should be used for the welfare of all of Chongnyon. Their logic is that it should be used for such welfare because individuals have donated the central headquarters, the publishing hall, and schools to the Chongnyon organization. Cadres of North Korea and Chongnyon have had frequent contacts to discuss this issue since the 1988 Seoul Olympics, but it is reported they have failed to reach a conclusion. Those inside Chongnyon were greatly shocked in September 1990 when Kanemaru, vice president of Japan's Liberal Democratic Party; and a vice chairman of the Japan Socialist Party, issued--when they visited North Korea--with North Korea's Workers Party a "Three Parties' Joint Declaration" related to establishing diplomatic relations between Japan and North Korea. They were shocked because they felt uneasy that if North Korea and Japan should establish relations, the nationality of those affiliated with Chongnyon would be changed to North Korean and they would have to abide by North Korea's Constitution. Thus, they had misgivings that their rights to their property in Japan might not be recognized. With Kanemaru's visit to North Korea as momentum, Chongyon organized a project team to make a detailed examination of such an issue. Such a move was discovered by the ROK Embassy in Japan. Around that time, our government supported Chongnyon from the standpoint of compatriots by publishing a booklet entitled "An effect of the normalization of relations between North Korea and Japan on the compatriots affiliated with Chongnyon" in cooperation with Mindan. It is reported that the Chongnyon's own project team has failed to do anything due to obstruction from North Korea. It is said that the movement to protect Chongnyon property is still under way. Under such complicated circumstances, the assumption of the post of responsible vice chairmanship of Ho Chong-man, a finance expert and a colleague of Kim Chong-il, has further agitated Chongnyon members. It is said that some Chongnyon cadres are secretly hiding their property to avoid it being confiscated by North Korea and that some are demanding the return of donated land through law suits. It is said that a perception "Chongnyon's property is of the nation" is widely spreading in Osaka where many Chongnyon-affiliated people are living. In fact, people affiliated with Chongnyon are said to have almost neglected preparing for their old age. They have been inculcated by Chongnyon that "if reunification should materialize, you could return home." Thus, they have eagerly waited only for the day of reunification. With the dream of returning home some day, they are said to pin almost all of their hopes on that organization, which would make such a dream come true at an early date. So, they donated their own money to build schools and spared no money to be sent to North Korea with a view to contributing to the development of their fatherland. This notwithstanding, as they are aging and their children are growing up, their expectations for reunification are becoming a more and more remote dream. In November 1993, the Chongnyon Central Committee discussed the issue of "protection of compatriots' rights" as an important agenda item. It was the only agenda discussed. According to the ROK Embassy in Japan, it was the first time the Chongnyon Central Committee ever convened with the single agenda item of "protection of rights." The ROK Embassy understood that this was a sign of change on the part of Chongnyon, which has thus far shouted political slogans, but is now paying attention to its members' welfare. Many Chongnyon-affiliated schools are now faced with the crisis of closure due to the drastic reduction of the number of students. This is because parents are reluctant to send their children to such schools on grounds that "it is difficult to adapt to Japanese society, where competition is fierce, if you graduate from Chongnyon-affiliated schools where ideological education is emphasized." All the Chongnyon-affiliated schools in the Osaka area took down placards of Kim Il-song hung in school buildings last year. This is a sign showing that a wind of change--today's life is more important than ideology--is blowing within Chongnyon.
