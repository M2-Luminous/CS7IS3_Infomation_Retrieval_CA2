Karadzic was quoted by the Bosnian Serb news agency as saying he had decided to "find a legal way" that would allow the release of the 11 French nationals employed by the Premiere Urgence (First Aid) group who have been held since April 8 in the outlying Sarajevo suburb of Lukavica. (In London, European Union negotiator Lord Owen confirmed the aid workers would be freed "very soon." He told AFP he had received this assurance overnight from a trusted intermediary who was speaking on Karadzic's behalf. Owen said the Frenchmen would be freed "without condition and without trial.")
