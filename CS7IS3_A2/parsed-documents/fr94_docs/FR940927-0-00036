FR940927-0-00036 FR940927-0-00005 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;191&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;8748; AD 93&hyph;23&hyph;12] Airworthiness Directives; Learjet Model 60 Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule; correction. SUMMARY: This document corrects information in an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Learjet Model 60 airplanes, that currently requires deactivation of the auxiliary cabin and cockpit heating systems and installation of placards. This action corrects the applicability of the rule. This action is necessary to ensure that only airplanes subject to the addressed unsafe condition are subject to the requirements of the rule. DATES: Effective December 15, 1993. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations was previously approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of December 15, 1993 (58 FR 63060, November 30, 1993). ADDRESSES: The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Learjet, Inc., P.O. Box 7707, Wichita, Kansas 67277&hyph;7707. This information may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, Rules Docket, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington; or at the FAA, Wichita Aircraft Certification Office, 1801 Airport Road, Room 100, Mid-Continent Airport, Wichita, Kansas; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: C. Dale Bleakney, Aerospace Engineer, Systems and Equipment Branch, ACE&hyph;130W, FAA, Small Airplane Directorate, Wichita Aircraft Certification Office, 1801 Airport Road, Room 100, Mid-Continent Airport, Wichita, Kansas 67209; telephone (316) 946&hyph;4135; fax (316) 946&hyph;4407. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On November 22, 1993, the FAA issued AD 93&hyph;23&hyph;12, amendment 39&hyph;8748 (58 FR 63060, November 30, 1993), to require deactivation of the auxiliary cabin and cockpit heating systems on all Learjet Model 60 airplanes, and the installation of a placard stating, ``Cabin and Cockpit Heat Inop.'' That action was prompted by a report of a fire in the aft fuselage of one airplane, which had resulted from miswiring that was installed in an auxiliary cabin heater during manufacture. The actions required by that AD are intended to prevent overheating of the auxiliary cabin and cockpit heaters, which potentially could result in a fire. Recently, the FAA has become aware of the fact that the applicability of the AD is unnecessarily broad. In developing the AD, the FAA intended that its applicability be coextensive with the effectivity listing of Learjet Alert Service Bulletin SB A60&hyph;21&hyph;1, dated November 1, 1993. (That service bulletin was referenced in the rule as the appropriate source of service information.) That service bulletin indicates that only airplanes having serial numbers 60&hyph;002 through 60&hyph;021, inclusive, are subject to the addressed unsafe condition; all other airplanes of this model were modified during production in such a way so as to preclude the unsafe condition. However, the applicability of the AD, as published, inadvertently indicated that all airplanes of this model were applicable to the requirements of the AD, rather than just those having serial numbers 60&hyph;002 through 60&hyph;021. That inadvertent action incorrectly made the requirements of the AD redundant for airplanes other than those with the specified serial numbers. The FAA has determined that it is appropriate to take action to correct the applicability of AD 93&hyph;23&hyph;12 to specify only airplanes that are subject to the addressed unsafe condition. Therefore, action must be taken to correctly limit the AD's applicability to only Learjet Model 60 airplanes having serial numbers 60&hyph;002 through 60&hyph;021, inclusive. Action is taken herein to correct the error and to correctly add the AD as an amendment to section 39.13 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 39.13). The effective date of the rule remains December 15, 1993. The final rule is being reprinted in its entirety for the convenience of affected operators. Since this action only corrects an inadvertent error in the applicability of the rule, so as to eliminate airplanes not subject to the identified unsafe condition, it has no adverse economic impact and imposes no additional burden on any person. Therefore, notice and public procedures hereon are unnecessary. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Incorporation by reference, Safety. Adoption of the Correction Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration amends part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. ยง39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by correctly adding the following airworthiness directive (AD): 93&hyph;23&hyph;12 Learjet, Inc.: Amendment 39&hyph;8748. Docket 93&hyph;NM&hyph;191&hyph;AD. Applicability: Model 60 airplanes having serial numbers 60&hyph;002 through 60&hyph;021, inclusive, certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent overheating of the auxiliary cabin and cockpit heaters, which could potentially result in a fire, accomplish the following: (a) Within 10 flight hours after the effective date of this AD, deactivate the auxiliary cabin and cockpit heating systems; and install a placard stating, ``Cabin and Cockpit Heat Inop'' adjacent to the AUX HT Switch (S44) on the co-pilot's switch panel; in accordance with Learjet Alert Service Bulletin SB A60&hyph;21&hyph;1, dated November 1, 1993. (b) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Wichita Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), FAA, Small Airplane Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Wichita ACO. Note : Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Wichita ACO. (c) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with section 21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. (d) The deactivation and placard installation shall be done in accordance with Learjet Alert Service Bulletin SB A60&hyph;21&hyph;1, dated November 1, 1993. This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51, as of December 15, 1993 (58 FR 63060, November 30, 1993).
