Even so, does it enhance our security? This question was put to a representative group of Polish citizens age 15 and over by the Public Opinion Survey Center. The answer is that most of us believe that Partnership for Peace is good for our security, as the table illustrates. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Does Partnership for Peace enhance Poland's security? | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |No |24 percent | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Yes |66 percent | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Hard to say |10 percent | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- A decisive majority of Poles believe that Poland should strive most energetically for NATO membership. Advocates of this option constitute 79 percent of respondents, while opponents of our association with the NATO pact represent only 7 percent of those questioned. The belief that NATO membership is a correct course for Poland increases along with respondents' attained level of education. Its most fervent champions are optimistic, affluent, and inclined to approve the changes that took place under Solidarity rule. Those who are discontented and pessimistic rarely advocate our membership in NATO. The survey also provided an opportunity to investigate our views on our country's sovereign status. A little over 50 percent of those questioned believe that Poland is now fully sovereign and independent of other states. One in three respondents sees our situation as exactly opposite. This distribution of views has not changed for the past year. Residents of large cities are convinced of our sovereignty. Those who live in the rural sector and in smaller cities maintain a much higher degree of skepticism in this question. Discrepancies between views held by urban and rural dwellers are becoming progressively greater and embrace a number of other questions beside the subject under discussion. It has not yet been ascertained whether this phenomenon is caused by differences in urban and rural mentalities or by divergent interests.
