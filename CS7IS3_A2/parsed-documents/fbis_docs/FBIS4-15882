Although official reasons are not announced, sources in Alma Ata [Almaty] said the decision of Nazarbayev was caused by his dissappointment with the CIS. During his recent visit to Moscow Nazarbayev voiced an idea of creating an Euro-Asian Union instead of the CIS. Later, during a visit to Japan, he said the Commonwealth of Independent States has played its role and again advocated the idea of the new union. Nazarbayev believes that the CIS has ensured a more or less stable transformation of former Soviet republics into independent states. Now the states which are ready for close ties should think about the Euro-Asian Union, according to the president of Kazakhstan.
