This was stated today in an exclusive interview given to the ITAR-TASS correspondents by Pyotr Krawchanka, Belarus foreign minister, who is on an official visit to the FRG. The signing took place in Bonn today of two important documents -- an agreement on cooperation in the sphere of culture and also a memorandum on cooperation in alleviating the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster. "At the present time," the head of Belarus' foreign policy department continued, "we have begun work on preparing further accords, which will be signed during forthcoming visits at a higher level." "The Belarus side is satisfied with the level of development of relations with the Federal Republic of Germany. At least they look more solid than those with any other Western European country: We have credits and joint enterprises. Germany is our number one partner among Western countries; it occupies first place in our exports and imports. Today we can state that Germany takes its obligations to Belarus very seriously. The fact that half the government guarantees for goods deliveries and credits for our country is equal to the whole credit allocated to Ukraine -- totaling 300 million German marks -- shows that the Germans' intentions are serious. The minister was asked a question about the Belarusian leadership's attitude to the Partnership for Peace program approved recently by NATO. "On the whole, we are positive about this idea. It will be discussed in the Belarus Security Council and in the Belarusian parliament, after which Belarus' official position will be drawn up," he said. Stressing that considerable attention was paid to disarmament problems during his discussion with German Foreign Minister K. Kinkel, the minister pointed out that "under its international obligations, Belarus is due to destroy at least 2,000 tanks, 1,650 APC's, and 150 aircraft. The number of tanks to be destroyed is the highest in Europe. These tanks do not belong to us, yet it is we who must destroy them. This is why we need technological and financial assistance now. In particular, it is well-known that this process requires a large quantity of energy." Answering a question from the ITAR-TASS correspondent about the Belarusian leadership's attitude to Gazprom's decision to reduce gas deliveries beginning today [3 March], the Belarusian foreign minister said, "I think this issue is not political, but economic. After all, we have signed a preliminary agreement with Gazprom to set up a unified Russian-Belarusian joint-stock company, and we expect that Russia will sell us gas not at contract prices, but at the prices charged on the domestic Russian market." The Belarusian foreign minister's visit to Germany lasts until 5 March.
