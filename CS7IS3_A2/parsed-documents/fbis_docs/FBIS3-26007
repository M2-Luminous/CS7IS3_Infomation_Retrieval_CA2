The dictionary, one of the key projects for the eighth five-year-plan period (1991-1995) has taken more than 300 experts eight years to complete. The dictionary is regarded as another monumental work in the studies of the Chinese language. It contains 86,00 entries, double the number collected in the mammoth 17th century "Kangi Dictionary" and 30,000 more than in the current most authoritative Chinese dictionary (Han Yu Da Zi Dian).
