And the government should the measures to guarantee pupils nine-year compulsory education. Education lags behind economic development due to the more than four decades of centrally planned economic development which preceded the market reforms of the early 90s. And experts say that the geographical distribution of universities and colleges is irrational--they are sited according to old administrative district boundaries. Most of the country's universities and colleges are located in big cities like Beijing, Shanghai and Xian while backward areas, where talent must be nurtured as a matter of urgency, still have to rely on government allocation of university places. In many colleges, the curricula lack flexibility and are limited in scope. As a result college students graduate with little knowledge of areas outside the subjects they have majored in and may find it difficult to fit into the work environment. Universities usually emphasize theoretical knowledge at the expense of practical know-how. For decades, the country's education system has been government- dominated. The State used to pay tuition fees and had the final say in the students' job assignments. Though the situation has improved quite a bit in the last few years, public enthusiasm in the form of donations--money, facilities, private schools--has been either neglected or discouraged, experts say. Enterprises failed to play their role in helping students combine theoretical studies with work experience. But as local governments get more industrial power and new geographical economic blocks take shape, it is inevitable that the distribution of the country's colleges and universities will become more rational, experts say. And the "invisible hand" of the market will also stretch out and influence university curricula, the experts point out. But the State, while loosening its grip on university management, should not completely give up its educational control. The government should see to it that due attention is paid to underpinning courses like teacher training. These courses, the experts point out, are vital to the country's national long-term interests. Out in the business market, success will depend on workforce training programmes, according to enterprises managers in the People Daily's forum. After all, high-level technical and managerial personnel help enterprises improve product quality which in turn brings the firms more profits. And professional management skills in key civil service sectors like the treasury, tax office and judiciary are vital to the creation of a sound business environment for manufacturers, the managers agreed. Both experts from universities and managers of enterprises are concerned about the situation of the country's basic education. Academics and businessmen concerned about the future of education in China have all called upon the government to be responsible for financing the country's basic education. Primary and secondary education provides youngsters with basic knowledge which is vital, if they are to go on and learn specialized skills. Basic education does not aim at getting immediate economic returns. But it develops the youthful potential. And since the young are the labourers of the future, their enhanced capacity for professional knowledge can only profit the country. So it is not surprising that many countries have set up compulsory, free basic education system, which guarantee poor children a schooling. China has already launched a nine-year compulsory education system. However, many localities have failed to effectively implement the compulsory system. And random collection of fees from students in primary and secondary schools has deprived many poor children of their rights to a basic education. Statistics show that more than 10 percent of the country's pupils and middle school students quite school last year. And prohibitively high school charges were one of the biggest reason behind this. Some localities also try to shirk their financial responsibilities for basic education under the cover of giving schools more say in their own management. Government financing and management aid should be made available to support the compulsory education system, according to experts. The government should campaign to encourage individuals and groups to give financial and social support to basic education, experts say.
