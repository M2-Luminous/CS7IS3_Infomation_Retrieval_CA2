You have said that President al-Asad has not done even one percent of what he should be doing toward the peace process, but the Syrians say that he has done much more than that. He has stated that he is prepared to fully recognize Israel in exchange for full withdrawal from the Golan. He also has gone a long way by explaining to President Clinton what he means by a comprehensive peace with Israel. Why don't you for your part travel the same distance that President al-Asad has travelled by specifying what you mean by withdrawal from the Golan? [Rabin] First of all, I am not aware that the two U.S. officials you have named will come to the region. As far as I know, since it has been decided to resume the talks in Washington at the end of April, U.S. Secretary of State Christopher and the U.S. peace team will visit all the countries participating in the peace process to get the process going. This is all I can say in this regard. I am going to Moscow for four days next month and when I come back, Christopher will be in the region. He will visit Israel the week after next. In the meantime, we are continuing the negotiations with the Palestinians, primarily in Cairo. We are also negotiating with them on economic issues in Paris. President Mubarak and the Egyptian Government are hosting the negotiations in Cairo. I believe that President Mubarak has made a great and positive contribution toward continuing this process and eliminating the obstacles facing it. As regards the other parties, undoubtedly the position of Syria is of major importance to the peace process. I have previously stated, and I still believe, that Israel is a democratic state. Its people must be convinced, now that we have entered the peace process, that we must achieve peace with all parties in the region. Naturally, no one could do what President al-Sadat did in terms of making a breakthrough in the Arab-Israeli conflict. There is no doubt that President Mubarak is developing and backing the peace resulting from this breakthrough. As for Syria, I refer to what the newspaper TISHRIN, the official paper in Syria, published two days ago. It severely criticized Oman for hosting an Israeli delegation to talk about water issues. If such an attitude shows a readiness for peace on the part of Syria, then I don't know what opposition to peace would be like. Also, do not forget that in the joint news conference between Clinton and al-Asad following their talks, in which you said the Syrian president explained his definition of full peace, none of the Israeli papers were invited to the conference. Israeli journalists were not allowed to ask any questions. In addition, Syria is hosting antipeace organizations. It allows the Ahmad Jibril-led organization and others to attack the PLO for signing the Declaration of Principles with Israel and the Cairo Agreement and at the same time urges the Palestinians to undermine the peace process. More serious than this is that Syria provides all facilities to all types of attacks on Israel, whether from Lebanon or other places. All this does not prove that Syria has made a strategic decision to make peace with Israel. I also do not believe in the possibility of achieving peace with Syria without secret meetings. We all remember that a secret meeting took place between Major General Hasan al-Tuhami [an aide of late Egyptian President al-Sadat] and Moshe Dayan in Morocco in 1977. We also remember that we were engaged with the PLO in secret talks in Oslo over six months, after which a Declaration of Principles was reached with the PLO. Our government was the first Israeli Government to accept Resolution 242 as a basis for peace with Syria, which includes agreement to withdraw from the Golan as I have announced many times before, and this prompted the Israelis to attack me. However, the geographical dimension of the withdrawal cannot be determined until after Israel knows the full meaning of the Syrians' term full peace. President al-Asad may have explained what that meant to President Clinton as you have indicated, but I have no knowledge that Syria's delegate to the Washington peace talks has explained this to his Israeli counterpart at the talks. So I cannot understand the meaning of a full peace as envisaged by the Syrians. Besides, the problems goes beyond the mere linking of peace and withdrawal and we have to know the meaning of peace, the extent of withdrawal, and the security phases that this withdrawal will pass through. Let me remind you that the Camp David Accord was reached after one-year-long talks, from the time President al-Sadat visited Jerusalem in November 1977 to September 1978, and another six months were needed to reach a peace treaty in March 1979. Six months later we withdrew to the Ra's Muhammad-al-'Arish Line and then began the normalization between the two countries by exchanging embassies and we completed the withdrawal beyond the border as was agreed upon in April 1982. In the one-year period between President al-Sadat's visit to Jerusalem and the signing of the Camp David Accord, the Israeli prime minister was invited to Ismailia and the Mena House Conference was held. We also held talks at the highest level before the Camp David Accord, 13 days after Egyptian, Israeli, and U.S. leaders met behind the walls of Camp David, which was isolated from the rest of the world. So far, nothing of this kind or similar to it has happened between us and Syria. [Wahbi] I have spoken with some Syrians about your demand for secret talks with Syria, but they told me that the Palestinians' experience in the secret talks with you does not really encourage them to repeat the same experiment with you. [Rabin] Why? [Wahbi] Because of the many difficulties the Palestinians are encountering right now, particularly since some Palestinian leaders believe that the PLO was cheated in the Oslo agreement. The talks leading to that agreement were held in secret and no third party, like the Americans, was represented in them. [Rabin] The difficulties existing now are due to the fact that the Declaration of Principles between Israel and the PLO tackled much more complex matters than those that might complicate matters between Israel and any other Arab state. An agreement with any Arab state would mean defining peace, dividing borders, withdrawal stages, and the interrelation between a phased withdrawal and the normalization process. When it comes to Palestinians, we are trying to attain a certain goal in the peace process in its entirety. That goal is how to establish peaceful coexistence between two geographically overlapping entities. This creates much cause for strife on a daily basis. Many other details will need to be tackled if you want to guarantee success for peaceful coexistence between these two overlapping entities. Moreover, there are people among both Palestinians and Israelis who oppose peace and want to ruin it. Among the Palestinians, extremist groups like "Hamas" and al-Jihad Organization practice terrorism, although they know very well that the Israeli people accept a political solution. But most of these Israelis ask: If this solution does not bring peace to us in our daily life, what kind of peace do you seek through the current peace process? The operations that "Hamas" and al-Jihad are carrying out create a vicious circle of violence between the two sides. This makes an agreement with the Palestinians much more difficult than with any Arab state. [Wahbi] Egypt used to say to our Arab brothers that Israel can be very difficult and might insist on the smallest details in negotiations, but it implements any agreement it signs to the letter. I have to tell you that many of us have difficulty in repeating what we used to say to Arabs about the Israelis. [Rabin] Why? Why? [Wahbi] Since you say that agreed dates for implementing the Declaration of Principles are not sacred, what prevents you from announcing later on that any of the Declaration's words is not sacred? [Rabin] I will only give you an example to show you that there is no justification whatsoever for saying that. We did not delay for a single day any previously agreed date for negotiations with the Palestinians. They delayed negotiations with us for a month. The opponents of peace in Israel asked me why I did not suspend negotiations with the Palestinians after the killing of Israelis in the "Afula and Hadera" incidents. I told them that if we did that in reaction to those who killed the Israelis with the goal of ruining the peace process we would be giving the perpetrators the best reward for their actions. We did not delay negotiations for a single day. The Palestinians have to realize that they cannot say that dates are sacred. They said that they were delaying talks for a month because of a certain horrid incident to achieve what was agreed upon and to show commitment to the dates specified in the Declaration of Principles. However, I say that if both sides are prepared to reach middle solutions, which they have already done several times, we will implement the agreement on putting the Declaration of Principles into effect within two or three weeks at the most after signing it. [Wahbi] It is also being said that if Rabin is causing all these difficulties while negotiating about the implementation of an agreement that is not related to the questions of sovereignty, the settlements, and Jerusalem, which have been postponed until negotiations on the final status of the occupied territories start, then what kind of difficulties could he cause when the time comes to discuss these topics at the final stage of the negotiations? [Rabin] Why are these suspicions raised? The Palestinians and Israelis have agreed that their agreement would not be the same as Israel's agreement with the other Arab states. First of all, the Palestinians do not represent a country, but an organization. Second, it was clear to them and to us that when the facts change and when the Palestinians are able to run every aspect of their life, cities, villages and the enormous responsibilities that this entails, the more difficult issues can then be handled. This is because they would then be in a better position to handle such issues. Also, the atmosphere then would be more suitable because bridges of confidence between the two peoples will have been built, or at least the mutual hatred and suspicions will have eased. [Wahbi] It is known that the self-rule idea goes back to the Likud and to [Zionist leader] Jabotinsky. The Labor Party has always talked about regional solutions that involve exchanging land for peace. Why, then, this exaggerated insistence by the Labor Party on the terms of the self-rule? [Rabin] First of all, the Palestinians do not like to use the term self-rule because it appeared in the Camp David Accord. They prefer to use the abbreviation PISGA, which stands for Palestinian Interim Self-Government Authority. For our part, we have decided not to get into an argument with them over names. Thus, the term self-rule was mentioned in the letter of invitation to the Madrid Conference on this basis. For me, I believe that there are two stages: a transitional stage for building bridges of confidence and changing some realities, then comes the stage in which the final solution will be handled and in which we will be ready for regional solutions. We have pointed out that we do not want to assume responsibility for most of the Palestinians in the territories, but this does not mean that we will be prepared to withdraw to the pre-1967 lines. [Wahbi] It is said that by creating obstacles to the implementation of the Declaration of Principles, Rabin is damaging the credibility of the moderate Arab forces, particularly Yasir 'Arafat's position. It is also said that if Rabin continues to create such obstacles, this will cause chaos in the occupied territories and might cause problems for Israel itself. What is your comment? [Rabin] I am not creating any problems, nor am I delaying the implementation of any agreement. If you read the Declaration of Principles you will be certain that agreement has to be reached through negotiations on each phase stipulated in the Declaration. We have not postponed the negotiations and are ready to pursue the efforts to reach an agreement that will realize the goals of the transitional phase, overwhelm the opposition from some forces on both sides, achieve security for the Israelis, and grant the Palestinian council the authority to run the Palestinians' affairs. [Wahbi] I believe you have promised to face the problem of the settlements in the future. The question now is how can you deal with this difficult problem with all the trouble it entails if you are currently refusing to evacuate about 20-30 settlers from (Notetrim) settlement and also refuse to evacuate a handful of settlers from Hebron even after the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre? [Rabin] Because the agreement is very clear. It stipulates that all settlements will remain during the transitional phase and the PLO has signed that agreement. We will turn to the settlements when we negotiate a final solution. I expect the Palestinians to honor their commitments as they expect me to honor mine. [Wahbi] About two weeks ago Israeli television showed a documentary in which the camera proved that the settlers, at least in some case, issue orders to the Israel army instead of the army issuing orders to them. How true is this? [Rabin] I have not seen this program, although I heard about it. In any case, that situation does not exist and for our part we will prevent that from happening. We have issued additional orders to make sure that such an impression is not made in future, because the army is responsible for the security of both the Palestinians and Israelis and that is its role. [Wahbi] It is also being said that you are using the talks with the Palestinians to pressure the Syrians and vice versa. Why don't you negotiate with everybody at the same time and with the same zeal? [Rabin] We have not suspended the Washington talks, the Syrians decided to suspend them, then the other parties followed suit. We are not engaged in any "game" at the expense of other parties. We deal with every Arab party on the basis of the chances of success that each issue presents. We thought we were close to reaching an agreement with Jordan, but unfortunately our efforts have not brought results. For our part, we have no regional problems with Jordan basically. We have absolutely no regional problems with Lebanon, but there are security problems because the Lebanese Government does not enjoy sovereignty over all its territories. We are not after a single inch of Lebanese territory. There are international borders between us and Lebanon. All we want is for the government there to be able to disengage [as published] the private military groups, such as the Druze and Phalangist militias and others. So far, the Lebanese Government has not done anything to prove its ability to control south Lebanon. [Wahbi] Let me ask one final question, which concerns Israel's internal affairs. How far is Foreign Minister Peres authorized by you to negotiate with the Palestinians? In other words, does Minister Peres have a real and full authorization to reach an agreement with the PLO or do you keep the final decision on the Palestinians in your hands? If so, why do you refuse to meet with President 'Arafat, with whom you have not met for a long time? [Rabin] Every time Peres met with 'Arafat he had full authorization, and reports about a limited authorization are nothing but nonsense. Also, I believe that no one should recommend a meeting between me and Chairman 'Arafat before everything is made to prepare for such a meeting. This is because if we meet and fail to reach an agreement, it will cause disappointment and frustration that in fact will defeat our purpose of reaching an agreement that can be implemented.
