Mirza Sadikovic reports from Bihac that "the Chetniks are mindlessly attacking, obviously planning it to be do or die in their blitzkrieg in which they plan to occupy the right bank of the Una. Therefore, they are bringing in fresh manpower and military hardware." Sadikovic says that "during last evening as well as in the early morning hours, the artillery was destroying Bihac, Cazin, and their suburbs. Several civilians have been injured and the material damage is huge. There is no peace along the separation lines with the remainders of the paramilitary of the so-called Kladusa autonomy. After operating at [word indistinct], the commune of Cazin, provocations continued at other parts of the separation lines." Hajrudin Sermic describes the situation in Maglaj as "extremely dramatic. The attacks by Chetniks and Ustashas on Maglaj are increasing by the minute and the encirclement is tightening more and more. Everything that the aggressor possesses is being used today; helicopters are flying over in an unperturbed manner carrying out combat activity with guided missiles on our fighters' positions. Tanks are coming ever closer to the town and trucks and transport vehicle are constantly bringing in manpower reinforcements. All this is taking place at a (?critical) line of the (?Ploca)-Plana section on the northern section with the generous aid of Ustashas dressed up in Chetnik uniforms. Many of them have been recognized and the [word indistinct] traffic of Chetniks and Ustashas speaks of their coordinated action. There are some dead fighters on our side and tanks are rolling over their bodies. On behalf of 35,000 civilians of this town, we demand that UNPROFOR forces enter Maglaj urgently and immediately and prevent an unprecedented catastrophe."
