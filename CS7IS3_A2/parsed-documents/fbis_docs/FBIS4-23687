Our colleague, Jean-Paul Habineza, reports. [Begin Habineza recording] Gitarama is entirely in the hands of the RPF. Fighting had been fierce of late in Gitarama. After realizing that the RPF had captured Kabgayi, 2 to 3 km from the town, government forces reinforced their positions with additional troops mostly from Ruhengeri. They even lightly pushed back the RPF. The RPF soldiers then surrounded Gitarama town and closed all entry roads. The fighting increased. Some government soldiers lost their lives while others fled. The chief commander of the Rwandan Patriotic Army, Major General Paul Kagame, said it was this morning that the RPF clearly captured Gitarama town. Our friend Louise Kayibanda, who sent us the news, informed us that she visited Murambi the headquarters of the so-called government and said that the area looked like a farm, so it is clear that the so-called government left the place long ago. On the significance of capturing Gitarama, Maj. Gen. Paul Kagame said the meaning was both political and military. Politically, it is clear that the government, which is continuously on the run, is useless. Militarily, Paul Kagame said, this victory, along with others shows that the RPF troops are doing well at the front. Paul Kagame said the continuing fighting was aimed at stopping the killings.
