De Leon Carpio held a news conference after meeting with Costa Rican President-elect Jose Maria Figueres. De Leon talked about the Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE] decision to hold elections to choose a new Congress on 14 August. This new Congress will function until January 1996. He pointed out that he will ask the magazine that published the report on the alleged secret pact to explain its article. [Begin recording] [De Leon, in progress] ...is false. As for the first question, through the Public Relations Secretariat of the Presidency, we denied the report and asked the magazine that published it to offer an explanation in its next issue. We have sent the media our explanation that this report lacks integrity. In addition, the report mentioned the Army, as well as Christian Democrat Alfonso Cabrera. I flatly deny this. I have not met with him. If I had, I would admit it. I have no reasons to hide it. I repeat, it is untrue that I met with him; it is untrue there was such a pact. [Reporter] The TSE today decided to hold congressional elections on 14 August. What is your opinion on this decision? [De Leon] Imagine the great pleasure that is overcoming me, because it pleases me to say this in front of the Costa Rican president-elect and his distinguished delegation, which represent Central American democracy. Costa Ricans have upheld democracy for so many years. There were times when Costa Rica was the only democratic country in the region. We Guatemalans admire, commend, and -- I admit it -- even envy them. If there is something we lack, it is their democratic system and the respect for human rights that has ennobled Costa Ricans and their country. I say this because today is a very special day. The TSE called elections as a result of a popular consultation. Regardless of the number of citizens who participated in the electoral process and regardless of abstentionism, the people chose to follow this path, the most difficult path. It is worth recognizing that Guatemala is following the most difficult, yet democratic and constitutional, path. A few months ago, when institutional and constitutional order broke down, the Guatemalan people requested that the three governmental branches be purged. The executive branch acquiesced when I arrived at the Presidency. It is still acquiescing, but it asked and demanded the purging of the other two branches. Unlike what was done and is being done in other countries in which illegal channels are being used, we are resorting to democratic ways until we fully comply with the people's determination. People won a great battle: They will have a new legislative organization -- namely, a new Congress democratically elected by the Guatemalan people. They will also have a new court of justice. The TSE's decision to hold congressional elections strengthens all of these achievements, which, along with the new constitutional reforms that have gone into effect as the result of the desirable mechanism of popular elections, undoubtedly make me unable to hide my great pleasure, because, as Costa Rica found out many years ago, we are also finding that democratic path, the path of respecting the Guatemalan people. I believe the Guatemalan people are beginning to know, defend, and love the democratic system for the first time. They showed this love by defending it in May of last year. I have not been asked to say this, but I am going to say it anyway. It is a great honor and pleasure for me to meet with the president-elect of our sister nation of Costa Rica, Jose Maria Figueres, because he is a great symbol for us. I repeat, meeting with President-elect Figueres and his honorable delegation is a great pleasure for all Guatemalans, because they represent a truly democratic system. As I said before, if there was something we Guatemalans had, it was the lack of democracy. We have never, or almost never, lived in democracy. On the contrary, our history is plagued with all types of dictatorships -- civilian, military, personal, collective, open, blatant, and sometimes underhanded. Dictatorships, coups d'etats, and electoral fraud plague our history. I say this before Costa Rica, which has implemented a different system -- a system of accepting the results of the Costa Ricans' political resolve. By meeting with Figueres today, we are greatly pleased, because we feel we are following the same path. We are emulating them, and we are advancing toward that democratic path they started traveling so many years ago. Additionally, the good relations between both presidents -- one a president-elect and the other an incumbent -- are satisfying to the Guatemalan Government and the Guatemalan people. This underscores the excellent relations not only between Costa Rica and Guatemala, but those relations at the Central American level as well. President-elect Figueres just said Central American economic integration will be further strengthened. This is our intention. He also referred to our plans concerning NAFTA and a series of issues and objectives that are of common interest to Costa Rica and Guatemala, as well as to all Central American countries. Therefore, I reiterate before the domestic and foreign press that you, Mr. Costa Rican President-Elect, are welcome in this country, which is struggling to find the democratic path you found so many years ago. [Reporter] Mr. President, after you stated last night in your message that some countries have opposed [words indistinct] to provide the equipment needed to [words indistinct]. What countries were you referring to specifically? [De Leon] Well, I would say -- as I said last night in my message to the nation -- it is ironic that today, when there is a president who respects human rights and who is striving to respect human rights and to attain peace, thereby achieving respect for individual rights, there appear problems, obstacles, and stumbling blocks from some countries that are demanding that our civilian military forces be demilitarized. In light of our work plan, as we attempt to devise ways to fight poverty and achieve respect for economic, social, and cultural rights, it is ironic that such obstacles be presented. Nevertheless, when we ask for equipment or support [words indistinct] I am not going to answer your question in full, because I prefer that the representatives [one-second reception break] who have heard this report by the people of Guatemala, through their president, reconsider it and note the irony of this. At this moment, we need to strengthen civilian security forces. To this end, however, we undoubtedly need the aid these countries offer to other countries. [end recording]
