First, we would like to have you discuss the content of the SIA's basic duties and its posture in grappling with them. [Suetsugu] The SIA was established in 1962. Its initial purpose was with the national insurance and national pension systems in place, to separate planning and implementation as the nucleus of social insurance -- i.e., the management of health insurance, seamen's insurance, welfare pension insurance, and national pension under government supervision -- and to clarify its responsibility for implementation. Therefore, its goal regarding its administrative duties is to accurately execute management of the four systems. When the SIA was inaugurated, the motto of the then director general and my predecessors was the three S's (`shinsetsu' [kindness], `jinsoku' [rapidity], and 'seikaku' [accuracy]), and I believe that the SIA has endeavored to implement the motto in its operations. [KANKAI] I believe that the social circumstances and the environment today have changed considerably compared to 1962 when the SIA made its debut. What are your primary goals for the 21st century? [Suetsugu] At the outset, the national pension system in terms of public pensions had just been established and the welfare pension was just beginning its payments. I believe that the SIA's role at the time was miniscule compared to the nation as a whole. To give several current indicators and in terms of the welfare pension and the national pension, the insured persons total about 6.3 million which covers about 90 percent of the public pension system. In terms of the payment of insurance premiums, the total premiums for the government-supervised health insurance, the welfare pension, and the national pension amount to about 21 trillion yen, which is about one-third of the national taxes. The number of pensioners totals about 23 million, and it is rising at a rate of one million annually. The amount of pensions paid out was about 16 trillion yen at the end of FY91. It is growing rapidly, and I believe that it will continue to grow. Therefore, regarding the goal for the immediate future in terms of our future duties, in view of the coming of a super-aging society, the value concepts will become diversified and the people's needs will also become diversified. The environment for social insurance is changing in various ways, and I believe that it will continue to change rapidly in the future. Consequently, we believe that it will become difficult to accurately conduct the business managment relegated to us by the people if we adhere to the timeworn methods of the past, and we feel that we must search for a basic direction for the business in the future. We therefore drafted a future concept for the social insurance business in July last year. It contains visionary ideas as well as realistic tasks. With a blend of such ideas, we have been looking for a future direction. We hope to push forward our management in line with the future concept of social insurance operations. [KANKAI] The coming fiscal year is the year of pension reform and the coalition parties' proposal has been prepared. However, I believe there are portions which are better than what the Ministry of Health and Welfare and the SIA had in mind at the beginning. What is your evaluation in that regard? [Suetsugu] Speaking from our standpoint, first of all, we must establish a stable pension system. It must be a pension system that can be trusted by the people. At the same time, it must be seen by the people as a convenient system with complete services. First, in the sense of stable management, we believe that the recent revised bill is significant. We of the SIA as the implementing agency are conducting studies to cooperate with the Pension Bureau at an early stage to enable the revised contents to be realized smoothly and simultaneously. We believe that we must further accelerate our efforts to implement them. [KANKAI] The Ministry of Health and Welfare's timetable calls for a three-year postponement from the initial 1998 to 2001. Will that have a considerable impact? Or can we understand it to be a move within a somewhat stable system? [Suetsugu] This is a systemic theory, and in terms of operations implementation based on our position of actually putting a system into action, we believe that there is no special problem. How To Cope With the Problem of Delinquent Payment of Insurance Premiums [KANKAI] Speaking of pensions, numerous families are in arrears in the payment of premiums for the national pension. Another problem is the imbalance between systems, and it is said that they should be unified. What is your thinking regarding these two points? [Suetsugu] The national pension system requires voluntary filing and payment of premiums by the insured. In that sense, management may not be simple. In the case of each pension system, such an arrangement probably is not practical unless the administering agency is well equipped and the people's awareness is at a high level. The fact that such management has been possible under such conditions is, I believe, the result of the high awareness among the people and the efforts by the administering agencies including the cities, towns, and villages. However, as long as it is a public pension, we cannot be complacent about the present situation, but must aim for 100-percent efficiency. From such a standpoint, we instituted a meeting to promote the national pension system in 1992 to review failures to file for national pensions and delinquent payment of insurance premiums. In October [1993], we received a report in which various items of advice and proposals for action were included. First, to seek further understanding among the people, particularly among the younger generation. Second, to utilize the various data and material available in the cities, towns, and villages. For example, the system of national health insurance is simultaneously in operation in the cities, towns, and villages, so their resources should be utilized. There is also a variety of other resources, so the pertinent material should be used. Third, to further promote the transfer of accounts. Such proposeals are being received. However, we believe that perhaps the most conclusive is the basic pension number. In order to fundamentally eradicate failures of filing or notification, we believe that the important point is to accurately and efficiently implement exchange of information among the various systems. Therefore, we would like to speedily introduce a basic pension-numbering system in the form of a common lifetime numbering key, and we are going ahead with preparations. We feel that this is not only a problem of the national pension, but will also help to improve services for the overall public pension system, such as the speedup of judgments concerning the right to receive pension payments, the response to pension consultation, an early confirmation of the qualification of the insured at a specific age, and prior notification of the time and amount of payment before judgment is made under the pension system. Realization of the Future Concept of Social Insurance [KANKAI] What is your position on a unified pension system? [Suetsugu] I believe that deliberations will be carried out in various places and forums on unification. Our task is to be prepared to respond, no matter what conclusion is reached. [KANKAI] I see that five management directions are included in the future concept on social insurance. [Suetsugu] First, social insurance that grows with the people. Second, insuring the rights of the people to receive insurance. Third, a flexible response to changes. Fourth, kind, speedy, and accurate accommodation. Fifth, the promotion of insurance and welfare facilities. [KANKAI] Do frequent payment delinquencies and failures of notification mean that there are some lack of services and PR [public relations] to the people? [Suetsugu] Payment delinquencies occur most frequently in the urben areas. It is partly due to the constant shifts in population. Another factor is the large number of youths. Trends of population shifts are particular noticeable in the large cities. To solve this, we have established a national pension countermeasure office within the SIA and are providing individualized guidance, beginning with the large cities. Both we and the executives would like to appeal to the municipal directors on this point. We are visiting the cities individually and are meeting the mayors directly to seek their understanding. As I mentioned before, we are also hoping to cope accurately with the shifts in civilian population through the use of basic pension identification numbers and to appeal to them regarding entry and payment of insurance premiums. Another problem pertains to students. In other words, there is a lack of understanding about pensions among the youths. They think that the pension system is a problem concerning the distant future, and they lack understanding and awareness concerning pensions. Therefore, we have proclaimed a pension week every year for the past two years and are conducting public relations with particular emphasis on urban and rural youths. In every prefecture, we are in a stage of targeting the youth and making efforts in public relations by focusing on various ideas. We are also working on supplementary textbooks on public pensions to be taken up in school education. [KANKAI] What projects are you planning for the super-aging society? [Suetsugu] The pension system itself is one of the projects. At the same time, we are implementing the so-called welfare facilities project through pensions or medical-care insurance. One example is the home-care support program which has been newly implemented since 1992 as part of medical-care insurance. This is a project that supplements the rental fees for machines and instruments used by persons recuperating or receiving care at home, who are beneficiaries of government-supervised health insurance, apart from the previous medical checkup programs or workplace healthcare. It has been implemented since October 1993. Our posture has been to team up with the networks of cities, towns, and villages that actually know best who should be the beneficiaries, in order to let them know that there are such ways to help them and to expand its use. We are gratified that it has been quite widely appreciated by the users. The Future of Public Pensions Without Anxiety [KANKAI] The best thing for the people is to have a stable public pension system that will enable them to spend their life of retirement without worry. According to what we have heard from you thus far, is it safe to assume that the pension system will never go bankrupt? [Suetsugu] That it correct. [KANKAI] What about medical-care insurance? [Suetsugu] Medical care has been switched to midterm fiscal operations which is a term of about five years. We are gratified that so far we have been able to operate it on a stable basis. However, due partly to the business stalemate last year, although medical-care payments have been generally as expected, revenues have been lower. However, this is considered as a midterm fiscal operation, and because there are reserve funds, we believe we can operate it without problems from the standpoint of the overall system. Also, I talked earlier about support for home care within the insurance welfare facilities system. In addition, the problem of mental health was taken up in the past, particularly by the large companies, and has been studied by the respective companies. A similar problem existed among the small and medium companies concerning the beneficiaries of government-supervised health insurance, and there were points that were indicated and desires expressed. Therefore, with the hope of grappling with the target goals of mental health, we have begun to conduct studies. We hope to find ways to cope and to implement them as soon as possible. [KANKAI] If the care system under study by the Ministry of Health and Welfare is feasible, will the implementing agency be the SIA, or will it be a completely different arrangement? [Suetsugu] We have not yet heard that the proposal has been finalized, so we do not know how it will turn out. Assuming that it will be us (the SIA), we hope to cope with it fully. [KANKAI] If it is feasible, would it be the only option? [Suetsugu] The crux is what arrangement to use. On the basis of the first-time insured persons, and within the framework of the national pension and the welfare pension, 90 percent of the people are covered, while the rest is covered by mutual-aid insurance. The medical-care field is divided into three categories of the health insurance associations, government-supervised health insurance, and national insurance, aside from mutual-aid insurance. Of the three categories, we are in charge of government-supervised health insurance and, depending on which arrangement is adopted, the ratio of coverage will change. If we are the administering agency, we have the confidence to implement it. However, I believe that the kind of arrangement that is adopted will be decided in the future.
