After meeting the leaders of the four coalition partners, Dehaene said in a statement that they "wish the government to continue its work." Two other leading socialist officials of Belgium's French-speaking regional government resigned Friday, a few hours after Coeme. Guy Spitaels, former Francophone Socialist Party president and president of the French-speaking regional government, and Guy Mathot, another member of that government, announced their decision to the press just two hours after the Royal Palace announced Coeme's resignation. The three leaders had been accused of taking bribes and channelling funds to the Socialist Party in connection with the 1988 purchase of 46 Italian Agusta helicopters for the Belgian Army. Coeme, 48, was defence minister at the time of the 225 million dollar purchase. A judicial investigation was launched after the assassination of former Socialist Party President Andre Cools on July 18, 1991. In an article entitled "Is a fuse necessary?" the influential newspaper LA LIBRE BELGIQUE wrote Friday that the affair had caused dismay in the centre-left coalition of socialists and christian-socialists which backs Dehaene's federal government.
