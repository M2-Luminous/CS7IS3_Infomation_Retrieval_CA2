Dr. Nabil al-'Arabi, Egypt's permanent delegate to the UN, said in a speech to the Security Council last night that the UN has two alternatives. Either to adopt the collective security measures stipulated under the UN Charter to end the existing aggression against Bosnia-Herzegovina and force the aggressors to withdraw or lift the military embargo imposed on Bosnia. Dr. al-'Arabi noted that the Egyptian delegation had repeatedly cautioned the Security Council against the consequences of failure to adopt decisive measures to ensure a firm and decisive remedy of the deteriorating situation in Bosnia. He called on the Security Council members to adopt the immediate and necessary measures to put an end to this tragedy, which cannot be tolerated. Chief among these measures are for the NATO to undertake the immediate military actions needed to lift the siege of Gorazde, force the Serbs to withdraw from the town, back the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government in its legitimate right to self-defense, and lift the military embargo imposed on it, he added.
