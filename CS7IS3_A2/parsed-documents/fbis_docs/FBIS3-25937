One year ago, He Kehui, member of the provincial party committee's Standing Committee, was elected chief procurator by provincial People's Congress deputies. After assuming office, she undertook the heavy task of severely punishing economic crimes and criminal offenses. Procuratorates throughout the province are facing this situation: On the one hand, there are difficulties in economic development, reform achievements have not been easy, and 10 million people are still in poverty. On the other hand, a small number of people are abusing their power for personal gain, trading power away for personal benefit, and lining their pockets at others' expense. What a sharp contrast! So her responsibility is even heavier. Last year, together with other comrades of the procuratorates, she handled 952 major cases each involving more than 10,000 yuan, dealt with 18 major criminal cases involving cadres at the county sectional level and above. The arrests of Yan Jianhong, former board chairman of the provincial international trust and investment corporation; Guo Zhengmin, former chief of the provincial public security department; and Ma Yongqing, former general manager of the Guizhou Airline Company afforded general satisfaction. Procuratorates throughout the province has made breakthrough progress in dealing with economic crime, recovering an economic loss of 58.95 million yuan for the state and collectives. In the meantime, procuratorates throughout the province have meted out punishments to major criminal offenders, thus protecting reform, opening up, and the masses. On the work in 1994, He Kehui said: This year is a year of conscientiously implementing instructions of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and of developing the socialist market economy, during which reform will enter a crucial period. It is also a year in which the fight against corruption will develop in depth. Procuratorates throughout the province should profoundly conduct the struggle against corruption. Above all, they should concentrate on examining and handling major and important cases, uphold the principle of severe crackdown, safeguard the country's political stability and social tranquility, strengthen their supervision over law enforcement, and continue to change the situation where law is not observed or law enforcement is not strict. The people trust the people's procurators. In the auditorium of the provincial people's government yesterday afternoon, Xie Jinhan, who has worked for decades on the judicial front, came up to the rostrum of the provincial People's Congress meeting to report on the work of the Guizhou Provincial Higher People's Court. Last year courts throughout the province conscientiously implemented the party Central Committee's instructions on preserving social stability, further strengthened their function in exercising dictatorship over enemies, and resolutely dealt with all kinds of criminals according to the law, thus puncturing the their arrogance and providing a powerful guarantee for the province's stability. In addition, courts throughout the province followed the party Central Committee's arrangements in carrying out combat against corruption. Focusing on major and important cases, they increased the momentum of strikes at economic crimes. Last year, they handled 1,755 economic cases. Through trial, they recovered an economic loss of 1.18 million yuan for the state and collectives. In the course of curbing economic crimes, courts throughout the province focused their blows on government functionaries, particularly leading cadres, who abused their power for corruption, bribery, and embezzlement of public money. Last year, they handled 515 corruption, bribery, and public money embezzlement cases and punished 636 criminals. Following the deepening of the fight against corruption, more economic criminal cases were unearthed and dealt with one after another. More economic criminal cases will be submitted to courts. For this reason, Xie Jinhan pointed out in his report: Courts throughout the province should make the necessary preparations both mentally and in terms of having adequate court personnel. Major corruption and bribery cases must be thoroughly examined and severely punished, no matter who is involved. On the work in 1994, Xie Jinhan said: The general requirement for this year is to produce good results in crackdowns on major and important cases and to make big headway in adjusting economic relations. For the interests of the country and the people, for the dignity of law, courts throughout the province must, under the supervision of party committees, leaders, and people's congresses at all levels, make important contributions to the fight against corruption.
