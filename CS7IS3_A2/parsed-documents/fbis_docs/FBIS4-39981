He pointed to notable changes in the economic situation in Russia in the first months of this year, characterized by a further slump in production concomitant with the slow-down in the rate of growth of inflation, higher unemployment and demand constraints. No growth of accumulation was recorded in the use of the gross domestic product, and while the crediting and monetary policy grew tougher, tension increased in the financial state of enterprises. The amount of outstanding debts to suppliers kept growing in relation to the monetary resources on the accounts of industrial and construction enterprises and the non-payment crises showed no signs of abatement. Soskovets stressed that the share of loss-making and idling enterprises in the industry as a whole kept growing, and the industrial production slump from January to May went 25 period [as received] deeper from the same period last year. The reduction in production was the deepest in the processing industry and consumer goods production. Soskovets said the slump in production was no longer due to the severance of former economic ties but to demand constraints and structural factors, as well as to the shortage of money at the disposal of customers. "Stocks of manufactured goods are swelling, mass-scale production has to be stopped or curtailed at a large number of enterprises, which results in the reduction not only of effective but also of physical demand and in the accelerated spread of paralysis along technological chains," the vice-premier said. Soskovets stressed however that far from all enterprises were in a crisis. Many of them has adapted to the new conditions of economic management, accumulated rouble and hard currency reserves, and are delaying remittances of resources to the accounts of their suppliers not because they lack money but because they seek additional profits. The reduction in the volume of production continued in many regions of Russia, Soskovets said. Out of the 21 republics within the Russian Federation only Karelia, Komi, Kalmykia and Yakutia registered the reduction in output by less than 20 percent. The situation remains extremely complicated in the regions where processing industries and industries producing means of production prevail. These are the Central, Volga and Ural regions, and some parts of the northern, northwestern and eastern Siberian economic regions. The pursuance of the policy of the macroeconomic stabilization has brought to light a number of problems which have been accumulating in the economy for a long time. One of the most serious among them is that reforms have not affected the technological structure of production: most enterprises have been unable to cut the cost of production, particularly in conditions of a tougher competition with foreign producers on the domestic market. As concerns the social sphere, Oleg Soskovets said "certain positive shifts" have taken place there since the beginning of the year. Measures were taken to increase wages and monetary incomes and improve the provision of pensions. Along with this, the differentiation in society has continued to increase, and the situation on the labour market grew increasingly worrisome. Although formally the level of unemployment in the country remains quite low at 1.7 percent of the economically active population, "the dynamics of this process is growing".
