FBIS4-18629 "drweu068__a94004" FBIS-WEU-94-068-A Daily Report 8 April 1994 ANNEX Inter-European Affairs EC Says U.S. Trade Report `Better' Than 1993 EC Says U.S. Trade Report `Better' Than 1993 BR0704141794 Brussels Textline Database in English 6 Apr 94--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY BR0704141794 Brussels Textline Database English BFN [Unattributed article: "Commission Reacts to New U.S. Report on Obstacles to Trade"; as released by Brussels EUROPE] [Text] Brussels, 5 Apr 94 (AGENCE EUROPE) -- The European Commission spokesman reacted with the following spoken comment following the publication by the United States representative for trade relations of the new American report on obstacles to trade: "1. The American report arrives before the Marrakesh conference but the USTR [U.S. Trade Representative] is obliged by the Trade Act of 1988 to submit this report each year no later than 31 March. As usual, this report, which is the 9th, takes stock of all the significant trade barriers, whether or not in compliance with international rules. ``2. Compared with last year, the 1994 report is considerably better: Firstly, because there are few new practices, secondly, because the United States recognizes that a large number of problems are solved in the Uruguay Round, thirdly, because it has a United States/European Union dialogue that enables limiting and solving problems at their initial stage, like for example, through the negotiation of agreements for the mutual recognition of technical standards as well as regulatory cooperation. ``3. The Commission remains concerned about the particular nature of Super 301 which makes this report the point of departure of procedure 301 whose next step will be identifying `priority practices' on 30 September 1994 which will determine the future action of the USTR. ``4. Likewise, the Commission is concerned about the potential of application of unilateral measures which the USTR might take on the basis of Title Seven of the Trade Act (deadline 30 April 1994) and on the basis of Special 301 (deadline 30 May 1994) for public procurement and intellectual property respectively. ``5. In conclusion, all these American reports become an ordinary event of the agenda of American trade policy. For their part, the Commission's services limit themselves to a single annual report, which should be out in the forthcoming weeks.'' The following remarks can be made regarding this statement by the spokesman: - point 1 obviously aims to make less alarming the fact that the United States has published a report of this kind two weeks before the signature of the Uruguay Round. It is not a blunder or intimidation on the part of the Americans but a coincidence of dates imposed by the calendar of the 1988 Trade Act. As for the Commission, it will publish its report on the obstacles to trade practised by the United States (and by other countries) after the Marrakesh meeting; - in point 2, underlining that the American report denounces few "new practices," the Commission obviously refers to the practices for which the European Union is criticized (whereas Japan, for example, is the subject of more numerous criticism); - point 3 must be understood in the light of the Super 301 procedures. The indication of obstacles to trade in the report will serve as a basis for the implementation of other phases of the procedure: designation before 30 September of countries which maintain obstacles considered unacceptable; opening of negotiations with these countries with a view to eliminating these obstacles; in case of failed negotiations, possibilities for the United States to introduce restrictive measures. EUROPE adds that the new 281-page American report devotes 42 pages to Japan, 25 to the European Union, and the rest primarily to China, South Korea, Russia, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Hungary, Mexico, Taiwan. The obstacles for which the European Union are criticized are on the whole the same already indicated in last year's report (particularly in the sector of public procurement), with nevertheless particular emphasis on the audiovisual sector. In the absence of provisions on this subject in the framework of the Uruguay Round, the United States is of the view that this sector falls under the application of the general rules of the GATT forbidding restrictions and discriminations, and they directly attack "broadcasting quotas" for television and destination of taxes on video cassettes.
