Do you think that the changes announced yesterday and valid as of 1 March will divide the public and possibly the army as well? [Fur] I do not think so, because these changes are precisely the results of the Defense Law based on a broad parliamentary consensus. Every political force represented in parliament accepted the need and timing for these changes. Only the Hungarian Socialist Party would have carried out the changes after the elections. However, the law required the elimination of the divided structure, and our history and traditions also oblige us to create the leading army bodies required by NATO in its recent concept of Partnership for Peace. One of the major factors of joining NATO will be the assertion of civilian control over the Army and the guiding role of the political echelon in every country. On behalf of the Defense Ministry, I can assure you that we will continue to inform the political parties and groups immediately about our every concept and step and, according to the possibilities, we will also use their opinions. [Fekete] What will the top leadership of the Defense Ministry consist of? [Fur] According to our plans, and contrary to the current state administration practice, there will be three state secretaries in the Defense Ministry: a political state secretary, an administrative state secretary, and a state secretary who is an Army commander or chief of staff. [Fekete] Many people fear that this structure could collapse if the defense minister is an Army officer. [Fur] According to the general practice in Europe, the defense minister is a civilian, and I do not think that it is worth parting with this practice in the future. Our current step guarantees the institutional cooperation of the Defense Ministry and the Hungarian Army in harmony with the Defense Law, and it also improves their efficiency. [Fekete] Some 10 days ago, you announced the retirement of some Army officers in leading positions. You also confirmed this during the government spokesman's news conference held on 14 January. Does this mainly affect the Hungarian Army generals, or the staff of the Defense Ministry? [Fur] The law and regulations stipulating the requirement for professional Army personnel to retire at the age of 55 are still valid. This means that these people must retire when they reach this age, not simultaneously but gradually as they reach the age of 55. Among the generals in question, two generals will become 55 in the first half of 1994, and the others will become 55 in the second half of 1994. I can also say after the government session that the changes affect various levels, both higher and lower levels. Mr. Kalman Lorincz, whom I would like to thank for his activity so far, also declared at the meeting that he had finished the task he received in 1989 and he would become 55 on 11 February 1994.
