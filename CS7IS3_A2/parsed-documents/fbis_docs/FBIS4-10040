This was a statement by Foreign Vice Minister Jorge Alberto Bolanos during a news conference on 6 April with Cuban and foreign journalists to discuss preparations for the forthcoming conference, The Nation and the Emigre Community, to be held 22-24 April. Bolanos added that the meeting will be for friends only and will include a broad cross-section of the emigre community, including representatives of the right. Bolanos pointed out that the only ones excluded are those who maintain a hostile attitude toward their fatherland and who advocate a dirty war and the U.S. blockade. Bolanos also stressed that the participants will be people capable of making positive contributions to the Cuban emigre community and to their ties with Cuba. He added that the April meeting is not an isolated event, but a continuation of the dialogue begun in 1978, which seeks to find answers to issues left unresolved then, as well as to new issues. Bolanos announced that over 200 invitations have been sent and that positive responses have been received. Over 170 emigres are expected to attend the conference. The conference's four main subjects will be addressed by Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina; Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National Assembly of the People's Government; Abel Prieto; and Carlos Lage.
