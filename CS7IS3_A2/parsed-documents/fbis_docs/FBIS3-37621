According to the Georgian correspondent for TURAN, conditions vis-a-vis Georgia's Azeri population worsened following a January 30, 1994 incident when armed Armenian terrorists killed three Azeris in the Tezekend village in the Bolnisskiy region of Georgia which borders Armenia. According to the same source, last week bandits attacked and robbed the home of Mamed Guliyev, a resident in the Gyzyl-Hajyly village. Around the same time, unknown individuals fired at two buses riding along the Baku-Marneulinskiy route from a bridge over the Khrami River in the Marneulinskiy region of Georgia. The society, "Ozan", supporting the interests of the Azeri community in Georgia, demanded that local authorities punish the criminals. Judging by the political and social conditions in Georgia, this appeal, like the previous ones, will not likely be answered.
