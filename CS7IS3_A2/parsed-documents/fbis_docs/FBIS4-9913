[Cardoso] I will not think about that until late April. Our program is the economic plan that we will support to the end. [Aissa] When will the people start to feel its effects? [Cardoso] The economy will be stabilized by the second half of the year. I have no doubt about that. Things have already markedly changed. [Aissa] Will you interfere with the implementation of the economic plan? [Cardoso] I will not interfere, but I will support it publicly. This I will do. [Aissa] Will you maintain contacts with the economic team? [Cardoso] I will maintain frequent contact with the new minister, at his request. [Aissa] Some people contend that this is rather unethical, since you are a presidential candidate. [Cardoso] That is an insincere remark. Everyone knows it is my plan, that I made it. I will continue to comment on it. Yet, I no longer assume responsibility for any actions taken in this respect. I will, however, assume responsibility for supporting it. [Aissa] Will you seek alliances with the PFL [Liberal Front Party] and the PPR [Progressive Renewal Party]? [Cardoso] The PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] is taking care of that. Why would one seek alliances? To win. In our electoral system, which envisages a run-off election, everyone seeks alliances. It will not be the party leaderships that will decide this, but individual voters who move from one candidate to another. One party only needs to hold negotiations with another that is different from it. If both parties are equal, there is no need for negotiations. For instance, the PT [Workers Party] is seeking an alliance with the PC do B [Communist Party of Brazil], a truly obsolete party that still advocates a dictatorship. Why is the PT doing this? Because it needs votes. [Aissa] Would you accept alliances with the PPR, or with the PFL? [Cardoso] I would accept alliances with them, with the PDT [Democratic Labor Party], the PP [Popular Party], or the PT. I would accept an alliance with the PT. It could happen that neither I nor Lula [PT leader Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva] qualify for the run-off election. [Aissa] Would PSDB voters agree to your sharing a platform with [Bahia Governor] Antonio Carlos Magalhaes? [Cardoso] I have already shared a platform with Antonio Carlos Magalhaes, and with Tancredo Neves, Lula, and many others. To focus on that is to overlook the real issues. What are the real issues? One's government program, who the trustworthy people are, and with whom one is going to rule. I would be very happy if the PT decides to enter into an alliance to support me. I have my background, my history. No one could say I am a rightist because I am not. [Aissa] Who will finance your campaign? [Cardoso] I still do not know. The subject is still being discussed. [Aissa] Would you accept a contribution from Odebrecht [construction company]? [Cardoso] Yes. As long as everything is done properly.
