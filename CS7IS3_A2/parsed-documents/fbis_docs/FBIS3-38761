This was stated by Foreign Trade Minister Pertti Salolainen in Stockholm after his meeting with the other Nordic ministers. Timo Seppaenen reports. [Seppaenen] The demands for regional subsidies presented to the EU by Finland, Sweden, and Norway are very similar. Swedish Minister of European Affairs Ulf Dinkelspiel said, however, that the EU negotiators have a somewhat more positive attitude toward subsidy requests from Norway and Finland than ones from Sweden. Sweden has not connected its demands regarding these subsidies to any other issue in the negotiations. In negotiations concerning Sweden, every matter is discussed on its own merits, Dinkelspiel affirms. Finland's negotiating strategy is different, at least concerning regional subsidies. Foreign Trade Minister Pertti Salolainen said in Stockholm that Finland might use the price of agricultural products as a carrot to tempt the EU to promise regional subsidies as generous as Finland has hoped for. According to Salolainen, Finland might promise the EU that it will move more quickly than expected to green prices, which are cheaper than the current prices. Salolainen even said that Finland might consider moving straight to such prices if a satisfactory solution is reached in the regional subsidy matter. What Salolainen said reveals a fairly essential aspect of Finland's negotiating tactics and his message shows what a how crucial regional subsidies are for Finland. Both Sweden and Norway place great importance on this matter. Sweden, for example, is hoping to get the so-called first class regional subsidy, which the EU gives to its poorest southern member countries, for Norrland [northern area of Sweden]. According to the Swedish minister of European affairs, Sweden could never accept an unambiguous no from the EU to the demands on regional subsidies for Norrland.
