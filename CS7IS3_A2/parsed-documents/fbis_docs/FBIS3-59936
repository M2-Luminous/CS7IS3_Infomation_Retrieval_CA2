When you think that you have managed to push the stone up the hill you suddenly realize that the stone is again lying at the foot of this hill." Why does the American Sisyphus want to do this ungrateful work? It is not difficult to guess. Ukrainian missiles are targeted at the United States and can smash it in seconds. Given the unstable political situation that can go out of control at any time, the U.S. strategists do not exclude the possibility that a fervent Cossack can press a missile button just to frighten those Americans overseas. Currently, Ukraine does not lay any claims to the United States: This state has not yet done anything good or bad to it. Next, if we even wanted to press this missile button we would be unable to do so because Russia controls 176 missiles and nuclear warheads stationed on the Ukrainian territory. No doubt, this situation disturbs Washington because the United States cannot guarantee that Russian chauvinists and nationalists dreaming of world domination will not come to power tomorrow. Americans cannot but notice the transformation of the Russian Government after the latest October events. Since then, the Russian Government has adopted a range of "strong" decrees including the Russian military doctrine and Russian Foreign Intelligence Doctrine "Prospects for NATO Development and Russia's Interests." Russian President Boris Yeltsin continues writing letters to Western leaders while Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev is enraged with Ukraine because it has ratified the START-I Treaty. I would like to emphasize that the issue of Russian democratic chauvinism is not yet on the agenda, because the political situation is unstable. I would like to recall that the internal strengthening of Russia has always led to its foreign expansion. One more thing: Enormous Russian potential had always enabled it to quickly recover from various natural calamities. This happened in the 17th century, when Russia was almost enslaved by Poland in the Smolensk War (1633-1634). However, in some 20 years, Russia began waging military operations against Ukraine. One hundred years later, after Russia was defeated in the shameful Crimean war in 1853-1856, it strengthened its positions in the Balkans after a successful war with Turkey in 1877-1878. Again, after a disastrous civil war in 1918-1921, Russia began making claims on the international community. Washington knows history all too well and ponders on the possibility of the revival of Russian international influence. If Ukraine does not overcome its critical financial situation by the time Russia regains its power, our state will lose its independence. If this happens, Ukrainian nuclear missiles will become Russian property; however, they will be directed at the United States. This explains why Washington Sisyphuses are aiming at the destruction of Ukrainian missiles as soon as possible. Moscow supports Washington Sisyphuses in conducting their negotiations with Ukraine because, first, Russia could appropriate Ukrainian strategic nuclear arms, and, second, Russian strategists are anxious that the Ukrainian party could retarget its missiles from the United States at Russia. It was not accidental that when Ukraine slowed down the process of disarmament in spring, the Russian mass media launched a wild campaign claiming that Ukraine could acquire control over nuclear missiles. Does this mean that Russia thinks that a nonnuclear state could be easily subordinated? I want to underline that if things go this way, the United States will be unable to guarantee our security. By the way, they are not going to do it at all. U.S. State Secretary Warren Christopher put it quite clearly when he visited Kiev in October. His joint press conference with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Zlenko went like this: [Christopher] At first, you should disarm, then you will get money. [Zlenko] At first, you give us money, next, we begin disarming. We require an enormous sum of money -- some $2.8-5 billion. Will the American Sisyphus grant us this money? I doubt it. That means that Ukraine will continue to preserve nuclear arms on its territory. It is senseless asking Russia to pay us compensation. As for Washington, I think that it will at last come to the conclusion that nuclear disarmament requires joint efforts. It is absurd to do this work alone.
