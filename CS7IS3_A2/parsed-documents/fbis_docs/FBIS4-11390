The peasants will reportedly stage marches and block roads throughout the interior of the country. During their six-hour meeting, about 20 peasant leaders from all the national peasant organizations decided to join a general strike called by the United Workers Trade Union, the Paraguayan Confederation of Workers, and the National Workers Federation for 2 May. Peasants from the interior of the country will join the general strike to express their rejection of the government's neoliberal policy, their repudiation of corruption and social injustices, and their support for peasant demands. The peasants will express their solidarity with a great rally sponsored by the National Peasant Organization (ONAC). The rally will be staged at the Heroes Square in the town of Coronel Oviedo. The peasants will march from Heroes Square to the international highway intersection at Coronel Oviedo where they will decide whether to block the crossroads there. Other roads in various parts of the country will also be blocked. The Coordinating Board of Landless People [Coordinacion de Sin Tierras] will block roads in the towns of Union, Maria Auxiliadora, and Sanguina Cue. The peasants organizations in San Pedro will block traffic in Tacuara. The Paraguayan Peasant Movement branch in Limoy will block the "superhighway" at 10 points. The Chaco Communities Coordinating Board [Coordinacion Intercomunitaria del Chaco] will block traffic on the Transchaco Highway. Local peasant organizations will stage another rally at the 234 Square in Curuguaty. After long discussions, the peasant commission that is participating in negotiations with the Social Development Council decided to walk out because problems are not being solved. Estanislao Martinez, a peasants coordinator, explained: "We walked out of the negotiations with the government because the government officials asked us not to implement any pressure measures and because the government refused to respond to our petition for compensation for the bad quality seeds distributed among peasants." Another point raised by the peasants to support their walk out from the negotiations involved the incorrect management of 3.8 billion guaranies that Paraguayan Cotton Chamber made available to the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock to resolve peasants problems. Finally, it was decided to ask the appropriate government officials to clearly determine how Esteban Balbuena, the National Peasant Federation (FNC) Environment and Ecology secretary, died. Balbuena was found dead on 19 April in Itapua Department. He was in a pickup truck with a bullet lodged in his body.
