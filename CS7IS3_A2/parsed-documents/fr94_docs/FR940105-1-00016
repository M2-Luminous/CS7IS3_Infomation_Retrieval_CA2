FR940105-1-00016 FR940105-1-00006 Availability of NPRMs Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 93&hyph;SW&hyph;20&hyph;AD, 4400 Blue Mound Road, bldg. 3B, room 158, Fort Worth, Texas 76106. Discussion This document proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc. Model 214B, 214B&hyph;1, and 214ST helicopters. Recent retesting and analysis has shown that the main rotor trunnion (trunnion), part number 214&hyph;010&hyph;230&hyph;101, is sensitive to high-power events. High power events are takeoffs and external load lifts. This condition, if not corrected, could result in fatigue failure of the trunnion, loss of the main rotor, and subsequent loss of the control of the helicopter. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type design, the proposed AD would require for the trunnion, within the next 25 hours' time-in-service after the effective date of this AD, (1) creation of a component history card; (2) accumulation of the historical high-power events; and (3) thereafter, recording of the high-power events as they occur. Additionally, the proposed AD would establish a trunnion retirement life of 60,000 high-power events. The FAA estimates that 15 helicopters of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 16 work hours per helicopter to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts would cost approximately $10,929 per helicopter. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $29,523, assuming inspection and modification of one-sixth of the fleet is required each year. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
