In his letter to the Political Bureau, Deng said: I recently learned that party and government departments, units, enterprises, and schools in some localities wanted to erect statues of me, cast badges of me, repair my former residence, and build memorial halls for me. This is an indication of the respect and solicitude which the party and the people have for me, and I am deeply moved by and gratified for this, but I also feel deeply uneasy. It is hoped that the central and local authorities will do a good job of persuading them not to erect statues of me, repair my former residence, or building memorial halls for me, and I extend sincere tribute and gratitude for this. In a talk with members of the Secretariat, Deng said: I hope you will not raise me to an excessively high level in publicity. May I suggest that the Secretariat issue a circular, calling on people not to erect statues of me or build memorial halls for me. Even after I go, this should still be upheld. Shaoqi [Liu Shaoqi], the Premier [Zhou Enlai], Chen Yun, Peng Zhen, and I raised the issue of opposing the personality cult at the Eighth CPC National Congress. At that time it was aimed at countering the personality cult starting to develop around Mao Zedong, but it was not upheld later and it led to the feverish cult for Mao Zedong and brought grave misfortunes to the party and the people. This state of affairs was basically curbed after the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee. Some time ago, some people in the party suggested hanging the portraits of present leaders. Comrade Zemin [Jiang Zemin] was opposed to this, and I supported him. It is right to hang the portraits of present leaders, but it is better not to. In 1980 the central Secretariat made a decision against hanging the portraits of leaders for the next 20-30 years in an effort to eliminate blind worship and superstitions concerning any one individual. Deng added: Of course, it will not do for a state or a political party not to have a program or a theory guiding its practice. The party's and state's theory of construction and development should be the crystallization of collective wisdom, which has stood the test of practice. These theories still have to be constantly substantiated, improved, and revised along with the progress of the times and the development of the state. One or several individuals may play a substantial, or even a crucial role at a certain stage or period. Nevertheless, one or several individuals belong to the party and the people, and therefore it is inadvisable to publicize any one individual to an excessively high level. True, some of my viewpoints differ from, and may even be antagonistic to Marxism. Some people in the outside world and in the party label me a "revisionist," and even a "traitor" to Marxism. Talking about revisionism, it is necessary to see in which direction it is "revised." If, after revision, the line, principles, and policies can push forward and accelerate state development and progress, enrich the people, and improve their living standard, then we should continue walking along this line. The most fundamental and important task of a political party governing on behalf of the people is to enhance the state's comprehensive national power and to improve the people's living standard. If we fail to do so, what right do we have to govern on behalf of the people? Deng added: From now until the end of this century, it is still necessary to give more publicity to the line of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, the resolution of the 14th party congress, and the leading collective of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core. In the last five years, there has been another substantial change in the country which finds concentrated expression in the firm and strong leadership of the present leading body. This is the result of implementing a correct line, a fact that all people without prejudice will admit. The source said that Deng Xiaoping indicated explicitly that he should not have conferred on him such titles as honorary state president, honorary chairman of the military commission, honorary chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and so on, because this would put him in an awkward position.
