In an interview with ROSE AL-YUSUF, he said: Our method since we came out of prison has been not to participate in any incident. Our connection with any extremist group has not been proven, from Shaykh al-Dhahabi [killed by the Repudiation and Renunciation group], the Military Technical School incidents, the assassination of al-Sadat, to the Asyut incidents. We in fact have issued several statements criticizing violence. [ROSE AL-YUSUF] The repentant al-Shawqiyun Group leader has accused you of supporting terrorism with money. [Mashhur] I have no knowledge of that. Let them investigate. If it is proven that Ahmad 'Ubayd (the man named by 'Adil 'Abd-al- Baqi in his confessions) or any one else has done so, let them bring them to account. But the Muslim Brotherhood has nothing to do with this. [ROSE AL-YUSUF] Don't you have any connection with Ahmad 'Ubayd? [Mashhur] I mean that we have nothing to do with the money, and Ahmad 'Ubayd has not informed us that he gave money. [ROSE AL-YUSUF] Does the Muslim Brotherhood intend to escalate the situation and declare civil disobedience in the professional unions? [Mashhur] Our method is moderation, and not violence, capitulation, and weakness. We are carrying out a message. This is the right of every citizen. It is my right to say that Islam is the solution, just as others say socialism is the solution. Actually, we exist legally, but it is they [the government] who do not want to recognize us. [ROSE AL-YUSUF] Can any professional union undertake any measure without your decision? [Mashhur] Yes. We only give general guidance and do not interfere in all matters. We are not against dialogue with the officials. It is they who are against dialogue with us. Our work is done in the open. There is no secret organization, as some people claim. [ROSE AL-YUSUF] If a dialogue takes place, what are the issues on its agenda? [Mashhur] Emissaries from Al-Ahram Research Center came to see us. We said we do not object to dialogue, provided the government allows political rights to the people, a party, the publication of a paper, and free elections. [ROSE AL-YUSUF] So what is required to end the confrontation is a party and a newspaper. [Mashhur] What I mean is freedom of expression--instead of licensing parties that have no assets and claiming that the establishment of a Muslim Brotherhood party will lead to sectarian strife. Our relations with the Copts since the time of al-Banna have been good. [ROSE AL-YUSUF] Is there an intention to put up candidates in the next elections? [Mashhur] Of course, unless they prevent us. [ROSE AL-YUSUF] Some people say that the Labor Party has sacrificed the Muslim Brotherhood in order to attend the National dialogue meetings. [Mashhur] I do not think this is correct. The alliance between us continues. [passage omitted]
