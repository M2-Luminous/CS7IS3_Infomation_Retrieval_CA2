FBIS4-23086 "cr00000030294001" 5 June 1994 FBIS FOREIGN MEDIA NOTE--FB PN 94-073--CHINA CHINA: MEDIA HIGHLIGHT EFFORT TO BUILD CHINA: MEDIA HIGHLIGHT EFFORT TO BUILD Chinese media in recent weeks have given increased attention to efforts to create a modern national information infrastructure. Several meetings have been held to discuss projects to develop an "information highway," government officials and industry leaders have expressed their views in the press, and a State plan is being formulated. Some individual projects have already been begun or completed. U.S. firms are providing foreign technology, expertise and investment capital. The "Three Golden Projects" China's information highway program is part of the "Three Golden Projects," a national information infrastructure initiative announced last year by the Ministry of Electronics Industry. Minister Hu Qili, in a national telephone conference on 2 July 1993, said that the domestic electronics industry would concentrate on three major projects, titled the Golden Bridge, the Golden Card, and the Golden Customs. The Golden Bridge is a national public information network connecting ministry- and provincial-level specialized databases, the Golden Card is a payment system for bank credit cards, and the Golden Customs is an economic information network for foreign trade (CHINA DAILY 3 Jul 93). The projects are aimed at permitting paperless commerce and electronic data interchange through government-established information industry projects (KEJI RIBAO 4 Mar 94). National Meetings, Media Attention Increased public attention to the Three Golden Projects began in early March. A signed article in the S&T paper KEJI RIBAO, on 4 March, noted that the government "is paying increasing attention" to the development of an indigenous information industry and that "Party and government leaders have issued numerous major statements on the topic, and officials have begun formulating appropriate strategies and plans," such as the Three Golden Projects. On 12 March, the same paper reported that it had sponsored a symposium the previous day for information highway experts. It said that government, industry, and academic participants had agreed that China should accelerate its planning and increase financial support for the projects. The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT), some 10 days later, sponsored a forum in Beijing on "building China's high-speed information networks." According to KEJI RIBAO, academicians from the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), professors, senior engineers, and high-level managers from the fields of computers, communications, and automation offered their proposals for the development of information highways. Officials from the ministry's Planning Department and Directorate General of Telecommunications spoke on the status and development plans for the national networks. The ministry's Science and Technology Committee chairman, Song Zhiyuan, announced that China's information highway program will consist of two major components-- communications platforms in the public sector and application information systems in the government and other official sectors (KEJI RIBAO 25 Mar 94). The following month, more details on China's information infrastructure plans were laid out by Minister of Posts and Telecommunications Wu Jichuan, in an article in RENMIN RIBAO on 13 April. Wu stressed that the creation of a nationwide economic information network was essential to the establishment of the market economy and reported that the Chinese Government had made "an important policy decision" to establish such a network. He reviewed the development of the State telecommunication facilities over the past 10 years and maintained that the information network could be established on this foundation. Noting that his ministry is responsible for building the infrastructure of the country's telecommunication networks and providing services to all economic sectors, Wu concluded that the ministry should map out a development plan and "speed up the building of public telephone networks, packet-switching public data networks, digital data networks, and mobile telecommunication networks, to provide a highly efficient, high-capacity information transmission channel and reliable telecommunication platform in support of" the Three Golden Projects and other information processing systems. The same day Wu's article was published, KEJI RIBAO reported that CAS's Bureau of Technological Science had established an interagency, interindustry expert group for "policy and research on developing domestic high-speed information networks." As group director, CAS assigned Beijing Posts and Telecommunications University optoelectronics authority and CAS academician Professor Ye Peida. Professor Chen Junliang was appointed vice-director (KEJI RIBAO 13 Apr 94). In early May, Wu Jichuan was quoted again, in two Chinese news agency reports, on his ministry's plans for an information highway. The first report, on 5 May, said that Wu had addressed a "recent" symposium, attended by senior Chinese officials and information experts. Wu indicated that China is watching the latest developments in information highway construction abroad and will carry out its own development in a planned and systematic manner. He said China will expand the application of computers in digital telephone exchanges, accelerate laying of fiber-optic cables, and build an internet by developing a network telecommunications platform based on the country's public telecommunications network. He pointed out that the construction of the information highway will require joint efforts by participating departments. The 5 May report reviewed the status of China's telecommunications development, reporting that: --China is building 22 national-level fiber-optic cable trunk lines, 20 digital microwave trunk lines, and large and medium-sized satellite communications ground stations. --The high-capacity digital transmission network connecting the nation's major provincial capitals will be completed early in 1995. --First-phase construction of a nationwide digital packet- switching network, known as Chinapac, was completed last September. At present, the network extends to 267 of China's major cities and has started to exchange information with 37 centers in 20 countries. --The first-phase project of the high-speed digital trunk line network connecting 21 provinces and municipalities will be put into operation this July. A cellular phone network covers the coastal provinces in the Southeast and some central provinces. --China's 700,000 mobile telephones will soon be linked by a nationwide network. --China's 7 million radio pagers have made the country one of the world's largest paging markets. As another step in the construction of the information superhighway, according to the report, China plans to accelerate high-tech research in information modernization, especially advanced remote sensing, surveying, computers, automation facilities, and modern telecommunications technologies (XINHUA 5 May 94). The second news agency report, a week later, quoted Minister Wu as saying that, by the end of the century, China will finish building a major telecommunications network composed of 16 fiber- optic cable trunk lines covering all the provincial capitals and connected with international networks. He also reported that the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) for telecommunications development has been initially drafted and that it gives priority to construction of long-distance fiber-optic cables (XINHUA 12 May 94). Other Comment from Government and Industry Officials Other government officials have also been calling attention to the importance of building a national information infrastructure within the overall Three Golden Projects: --Ji Fusheng, chief engineer in the State Science and Technology Commission's Department for Basic Research and High Technology, wrote that, up to the year 2020, information technology will remain a hot topic and be a key to international competition. He said China is capable of leapfrogging advanced nations in the race towards an information highway, but it must be practical and realistic, charting out its path according to market demand. The State has already taken some steps in the Three Golden Projects, such as providing support from the 863 Program (China's high-tech research and development program) for research on high-speed parallel computing and high-speed communications, but this is only a beginning (KEJI RIBAO, 1 Apr 4). --State Information Center Vice-Director Wu Jiapei wrote that China's present level in information technology, 30-40 years behind that of the United States, must be raised significantly for the nation to remain competitive. He advocated that the Three Golden Projects be market-driven, nongovernment investment be encouraged, and an entrepreneurial spirit incorporated in the projects. He noted that the government has invested over 20 billion yuan ($2.3 billion), which went for construction of a dozen-odd major information systems, and is investing an additional 50 billion yuan ($5.75 billion) for construction of information systems at as many as 10,000 firms (KEJI RIBAO, 16 Apr 94). (By comparison, the output value of China's entire information services industry in 1991 was only a few billion yuan ($250-500 million), compared to $203 billion for the entire world; in that year, the percentage of China's GNP occupied by information products and services was only one-tenth that of the average for all nations (KEJI DAOBAO Feb 94).) Industry leaders have also publicly discussed the need for the development of a modern information infrastructure. For example: --Beijing Guolian S&T Enterprises Ltd. General Manager Zhou Xiwei advocated the gradual modernization of existing information systems, noting that there should be a plan that would encourage stronger firms to take chances on exploratory projects (KEJI RIBAO 4 Mar 94). --The Three Golden Projects were endorsed in articles by Ni Guangnan, chief engineer at the Legend Group, one of China's foremost computer companies, (ZHONGGUO DIANZI BAO 21 Mar 94) and Beijing Huaxun Communications Development Corporation Governor Dai Huanzhong (KEJI RIBAO 21 Apr). Details on Specific Projects Since the Three Golden Projects were announced last year, the media have provided details on some specific projects, relevant to the development of a modern Chinese information infrastructure, that have been given priority by MPT. An electronics publication reported that among the critical issues in determining the development course of China's fiber-optic communications technology in the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-1995), one of the most important was the inclusion of Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) tasks. After sufficient investigation, the ministry decided to include the following projects: STM-1 (155 megabits/s (Mbps) and STM-4 (622 Mbps), as well as digital cross-connect (DXC) equipment and 565 Mbps (DS5) fiber-optic cable communications system technologies, all of which have been studied and which are to be made more utilitarian. The ministry's Institute Five and Wuhan Institute of Posts and Telecommunications have been the leading organizations in optical SDH research. Simultaneously, the State 863 Program's Optoelectronics Topical Area and a recently formed "Communications High Technology" Expert Topical Area have worked toward development of STM-16 (2.5 gigabits/s) optical communications systems (ZHONGGUO DIANZI BAO, 29 Nov 93). The following month, the same publication described the 22 fiber- optic cable trunk lines, later mentioned by Minister Wu, that form a national backbone with Beijing as the hub, pointing toward the East, West, South, North, and Central China. The construction plan is as follows: --Beijing-to-Northeast: Two fiber-optic cable trunk lines- -Beijing-Tianj in-Shenyang-Changchun-Harbin and Beijing-Chengde- Fuxin-Baicheng-Qiqihar--and four branch lines have formed a mesh network covering the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan economically developed region and the three Northeast provinces, as well as the eastern part of Inner Mongolia. --Beijing-to-Southeast/Seacoast: The Beijing-Tianjin-Nanjing and Nanjing Shanghai fiber-optic cable trunk lines are being linked to the Shanghai-Fuzhou-Guangzhou fiber-optic cable trunk line forming a Southern Seacoast Economic Development Area information network. --Beijing-to-Central China/South: Two Beij ing-Wuhan-Guangzhou fiber-optic cable trunk lines--one overhead, one buried--are being built and will be interconnected with the Southern Seacoast fiber- optic cable trunk line and the Northwest fiber-optic cable trunk line into a backbone. --Beijing-to-Northwest/Southwest: Three optical cable trunk lines--Beij ing-Hohhot-Yinchuan-Lanzhou, Beijing-Taiyuan-Xian, and Xian-Lanzhou--are forming a ring network extending westward to Urumqi and eventually farther west to Yining. The Chengdu- Chongqing-Guiyang-Changsha-Nanchang-Fuzhou/Hangzhou fiber-optic cable trunk line and the Chengdu-Kunming, Kunming-Nanning, Nanning- Guangzhou, and Guangzhou-Haikou fiber-optic cable trunk lines (which form a chain that has linked up the Southwest in a large ring) together have formed a mesh network covering the Southwest. --Fiber-optic cables spanning South-Central China and the East: Wuhan-Chongqing, Xuzhou-Zhengzhou, Zhengzhou-Xian, Xian-Chengdu and other fiber-optic cable trunk lines are being built. All of these trunk lines, totaling 32,000 kilometers in length, will be completed by the end of 1995, and will be interconnected with 20 interprovincial digital microwave trunk lines and 19 satellite earth stations to form a three-dimensional nationwide digital communications trunk line network (ZHONGGUO DIANZI BAO, 6 Dec 93). According to an article in RENMIN RIBAO, some of these trunk lines are part of the Asia-Europe fiber-optic cable project, proposed and launched by MPT. In 1992, the 11 nations along the proposed route signed an "Agreement to Construct an Asia-Europe Fiber-Optic Cable" and formed the Asia-Europe Fiber-Optic Cable Management Commission. The main cable runs f rom Shanghai through China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Iran, Turkey, Ukraine, Poland, and terminates in Frankfurt, Germany, while a branch leads to Tajikistan--a total length of 16,000 kilometers. Completion of the project and operational date are now set for the first quarter of 1996. Within China, the cable links Shanghai with Xian, Lanzhou, Urumqi, and the Kazakhstan border. So far, the line from Xian eastward has been completed, while that from Xian westward is scheduled for completion in 1995. The Asia-Europe fiber-optic cable member states are to meet in Germany this June to negotiate cable sales and usage by the various countries (RENMIN RIBAO 28 Feb 94). Recently, information was released on the completion of China's first major 565 Mbps (DS5) fiber-optic communications trunk line- -Shanghai-to-Nanjing. This project, undertaken jointly by MPT's Design Institute, the Wuhan Institute of Posts and Telecommunications Science, and the China Communications Construction Corp., is based on an extension of the Shanghai-Wuxi DS5 experimental cable, which has passed acceptance tests. The Shanghai-Nanjing cable, almost 400 kilometers in length, has a main channel capacity of 15,360 simultaneous voice circuits, with 720 voice circuits for interdistrict communications (KEJI RIBAO, 18 Apr 94). The nationwide public digital data services network announced by Minister Wu is a crucial element of the Three Golden Projects. For this network, China will import from Canada a model 3600 bandwidth management system and from the United States some DACS II-2000 DXC equipment. DXC node computers will be installed in 24 provinces and municipalities nationwide. The main channels of this network are scheduled to be completed and operational in July 1994, with full project completion by early 1995. Network users will be provided with channels for data/image/videoconference digital transmission services at a variety of bit rates up to and including 2 Mbps (DS1), and will have transprovincial transmission capabilities via public telecommunications networks, packet-switching networks, and local- and provincial-level digital data services networks now being built (ZHONGGUO DIANZI BAO, 21 Mar 94). Several sources have reported on the development of Chinapac, the new national backbone network, consisting of 5,540 ports, which covers capital cities of all mainland provinces and autonomous regions as well as the municipalities of Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Chongqing, and can be connected with the public telephone network to cover all of China's cities and counties. After five months of trial operation, the final form of Chinapac passed the joint MPT/Northern Telecom acceptance tests on 5 February 1994. The eventual 20,000 ports--including those in local public data networks now being built throughout China and due to start operation by early 1995--can be connected via fiber-optic, digital microwave, and satellite links to international gateways in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou for interconnection with 26 packet-switching public data networks in the United States, Japan, France, Germany, the ROK, Sweden, Italy, and eight other countries. This final form of Chinapac, consisting of 32 nodes and eight tandem centers with a throughput of 6400 packets/s, provides basic services such as switched virtual circuit ("virtual call") and permanent virtual circuit. Chinapac also provides specialized services such as electronic mailbox, electronic data interchange, videotex, Teletex, database searches, fax storage and relay, virtual dedicated networking, broadcasting, IBM/SNA (Systems Network Architecture) networking, token-ring LAN intelligent bridging, and asynchronous datagram interfacing. Since trial operation commenced on 1 September 1993, over 500 users and 16 nationwide groups have joined Chinapac, which has carried an average monthly load of 31 million fields (JISUANJI SHIJIE, 11 Aug 93; CHINA DAILY, 2 Sep 93; ZHONGGUO DIANZI BAO, 25 Feb 94). Beijing Guolian S&T Enterprises Ltd. is now developing China's first electronic data interchange network. The network's data processing center consists of 50 supermicrocomputers forming a parallel distributed information processing system supplying 260,000 user terminals nationwide with real-time searches. This network's first-phase project--a book/newspaper/magazine data transmission service network--is now taking shape. The network's data input center can store 7.5 million Chinese characters daily; it can quickly enter abstracts and subject records from Chinese periodicals into the network's database for servicing user searches (KEJI RIBAO, 4 Mar 94). Saishite Electronics Ltd., in Shenzhen, pioneered domestic batch production of fiber distributed data interface cards--often called the heart of computer "data highways," or high-speed (100 Mbps) LANs--beginning in September 1993. These cards were jointly developed by Chinese and U.S. scientists and have been authenticated by the Federal Communications Commission (KEJI RIBAO, 5 Jan 94). The Shanghai paper WEN HUI BAO reported on the completion of a project closely related to the Three Golden Projects--a satellite digital transmission network, called a "Space Highway Network" or "Information Bridge," based at the Shanghai Stock Exchange. The network was developed, designed, constructed, and put on-line by Shanghai Gaozhi S&T Development Company, a Shanghai Caohejing New Technologies Development Zone high-tech firm, along with its partner Shanghai Xinhua Computer and Electronic Information Company. It provides instantaneous (0.5 s) synchronous transmission of stock and economic information from the exchange to over 1000 small satellite earth stations nationwide, many of them hundreds or thousands of kilometers away. The network also has been used for newspaper fax transmission. It has been in operation for six months and relies on a satellite in geosynchronous orbit to relay information (WEN HUI BAO, 4 Apr 94). High-Tech Help from U.S. Firms Chinese media have taken note that the Three Golden Projects are receiving equipment, technical assistance and investment capital from U.S. high-tech firms, especially 3Com, Motorola, IBM, and AT&T. --XINHUA reported that Eric Benhamou, President of 3Com Corporation and Chairman of the American Electronics Association's National Information Infrastructure Task Force, announced, at a 28 April 1994 seminar in China on building information superhighways for the next century, that 3Com will shortly set up a representative office in Beijing to help develop a pool of networking expertise in China (XINHUA 28 Apr 94). --Motorola Corporation will expand its production of pagers in China by at least 50 percent this year in order to tap the potential of the local market. There is plenty of room for expansion in this market, since China has 400 million city dwellers but only 10 million pagers. There are about 3 million Motorola pagers in use in China at present; this represents a third of the Chinese pager market, with most of the rest going to Japan's NEC and some Chinese manufacturers from Guangdong Province (CHINA DAILY, 5 May 94). --Motorola signed a US$125 million contract with Beijing Kaiqi Communications Corp. to supply Asia's first 800-MHz all-digital trunking communications network. Kaiqi will import a MIRS (Motorola Integrated Radio System) frequency-division multiplexing/time- division multiple access (FDM/TDMA) cellular mobile communications network, integrating telephone, fax, voice mail, simple information services, and computer data transmission. The network will cover Beijing Municipality with a capacity of 100,000 users (ZHONGGUO DIANZI BAO, 28 Mar 94). --On 3 May in Beijing, IBM announced it will invest at least $100 million in the Three Golden Projects. It will be the first foreign company to be involved in the Golden Bridge Project. The deal comes under a Memorandum of Understanding signed on 28 April in the United States between IBM and the Ministry of Electronics Industry during Chinese Vice Premier Zou Jiahua's visit. In the first project, IBM and Jitong Communications Corp. will set up a Beijing-based joint venture to produce networking technologies. In the first phase, it will help design and install regional communications networks and link them into a national system. Under the agreement, IBM will establish a wholly-owned software development center in Shanghai to develop system and application programs for the domestic and foreign markets. It will also set up three open system networking centers in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. In return, China has pledged to use IBM's PowerPC platform as one of the major microprocessors in planning the country's future (CHINA DAILY, 4 May 94). --On 7 and 8 May, AT&T signed two contracts to supply state-of- the-art transmission and other equipment to the Beijing Telecommunications Administration. The deals, totaling more than $20 million, will give the city the largest and most sophisticated digital transmission network in China. Under the contracts, AT&T will provide fiber-optic transmission equipment operating at SDH's STM-16 rate (2.488 gigabits/s) and a set of advanced network management and surveillance systems to monitor and manage the communications network. With the equipment, Beijing can offer advanced telecommunications services and have the flexibility to move forward with new services, according to Beijing officials. Zhang Ligui, director general of the Beijing Telecommunications Administration, said the signing of the two agreements signifies that cooperation between AT&T and Beijing has entered a new stage. AT&T currently has nine joint ventures in China (CHINA DAILY, 9 May 94). (AUTHOR: THOMAS TORDA.
