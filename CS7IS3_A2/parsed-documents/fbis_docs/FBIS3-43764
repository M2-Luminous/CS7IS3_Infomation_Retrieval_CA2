Unofficial British sources said the day before yesterday that the United Kingdom's sea authorities on 8 January detained a ship carrying war materiel coming from Russia on its way to Angola. The United Kingdom's law stipulates that all controlled material, such as weapons, passing through its territorial waters obtain export permits.
