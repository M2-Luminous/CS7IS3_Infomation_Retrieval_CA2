Another 60 Bn will be transferred Friday and in April 300 Bn rubles will be made available to the industry every week from state funds. Shokhin emphasized that these payments were made possible by predictions of stable revenue next month. There are no such predictions for subsequent months and so such a timetable could not be outlined. "We don't wish to make promises on which we cannot deliver," Shokhin said. He added that he had been appointed Thursday to chair the inter-sectoral commission on socioeconomic problems of the coal mining communities (this position had once been occupied by Yegor Gaydar -- IF) and intended to give much attention to this work. Shokhin and senior officials of numerous Russian ministries will have a meeting with 500 miners representing various communities who picketed the White House on 30 and 31 March. Shokhin will also tell them about the steps the government is taking to stabilize the coal mining industry. "Local developments will depend on the miners' response to these proposals," Vitaliy Budko, chairman of the Russian Coal Mining Industry Trade Union, told Interfax following the meeting with Shokhin.
