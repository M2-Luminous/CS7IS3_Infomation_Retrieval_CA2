In an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE, Peters said that while Canada's budget process "is not directed specifically to Japanese or any other foreign investors," the fact that the country has tackled its federal deficit will keep investors confident in Canada. A former chief economist with one of his country's largest banks, Peters perhaps knows international financial markets better than many cabinet ministers. He said the Japanese bank, brokerage and insurance company executives he met in Tokyo have all been encouraged by Canada's commitment to fiscal stability. "We have been very pleased with the reception (to the budget) here," Peters said. And it is no coincidence that Canada's junior finance minister is in Japan only days after Finance Minister Paul Martin brought down the budget February 22. Japanese institutional investors hold more than 40 billion dollars in Canadian Government and private debt instruments, including federal and provincial bonds. A loss of confidence in Canada, where the government of Prime Minister Jean Chretien took office only last autumn, could mean a massive sale of Canadian debt on international and domestic markets and a major headache for the new government. Peters, who met with Japanese Government officials as well as financial executives, said he now has little fear of any heavy selling by Japanese investors. "The Japanese are long term investors in Canada and I fully expect them to remain so," he said. On other investment fronts, Peters said he also gained a "sense" that Japanese direct investment in Canadian business could increase. Trade trouble with the United States "is very much on people's minds (in Japan)," and Canada could see increased direct investment because of worries about the U.S., Peters suggested. "The other side of the question, however, is that saber rattling by the United States could make the Japanese very aware of importing from American companies. Canadians must make very sure that does not hurt their markets in Japan." He also suggested that Canadians are "very interested" in U.S. attempts to open Japanese markets, particularly in financial services where he believes Canadian financial institutions have expertise. "We are concerned about transparency in some rules that may shut us out of areas such as financial derivatives and other new financing methods where Canadians have a deservedly high reputation," he said. Peters will visit investment institutions in Hong Kong on Wednesday before returning to Canada on Thursday.
