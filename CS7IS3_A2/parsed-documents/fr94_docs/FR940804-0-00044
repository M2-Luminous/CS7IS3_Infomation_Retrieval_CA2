Memorandum Opinion and Order at ¶ 113. On reconsideration, however, we have concluded that adding use of a multiplier will allow us to more effectively enforce the broadband PCS/cellular cross-ownership and broadband PCS spectrum cap rules consistent with their intent. We also conclude that using a multiplier is consistent with our policy goal of promoting full competition in wireless markets, because it will not cause the exclusion of firms that pose no threat to competition. Without a multiplier, parties that have neither the ability to exert control nor a substantial financial stake in the cellular or broadband PCS license could be unduly restricted in acquiring interests in such license. Furthermore, absent a multiplier, anomalous and unintended results occur. For example, if Company A holds a 21 percent non-controlling interest in Company B, which in turn holds a 30 percent non-controlling interest in Company X, a cellular licensee, Company A's attributable interest in Company X would be deemed to be 30 percent, in excess of the 20 percent threshold applicable to broadband PCS/cellular cross-ownership. Company A would thus be limited to acquiring a 10 MHz broadband PCS license in Company X's cellular service area, even though it has neither the ability to exert control or significant influence over the operations of Company X's cellular system nor a financial stake in Company X so substantial as to give rise to an incentive to engage in anticompetitive conduct. In comparison, by using a multiplier, Company A's attributable interest in Company X would be 6.3 percent (0.21×0.3), under the 20 percent attribution threshold, and Company A would not be restricted to 10 MHz broadband PCS licenses in Company X's cellular service area. 5. Considerations of ``actual involvement'' with, true economic interest in, and ability to control a licensee are crucial in determining whether a particular indirect ownership interest should be attributed to the holder for purposes of our cross-ownership and multiple ownership rules. These considerations apply with equal force in the broadcast, broadband PCS and cellular contexts; thus, we conclude that a multiplier similar to that used in applying our attribution rules in the broadcast area should be adopted for purposes of determining attributable interests in cellular and broadband PCS licensees. We therefore will amend §24.204 of our Rules to include use of a multiplier to determine whether an entity holding indirect non-controlling interests in a cellular licensee or a broadband PCS applicant or licensee has an attributable interest for purposes of our broadband PCS/cellular cross-ownership rule and our broadband PCS spectrum cap rule. For purposes of applying the multiplier, where an entity's ownership interest in any particular link in the ownership chain is greater than 50 percent or is controlling, the interest will be treated as if it were 100 percent. 6. Accordingly, It Is Ordered That Part 24 of the Commission's Rules is amended as set forth below. 7. It Is Further Ordered That the rules changes made herein Will Become Effective 30 days after their publication in the Federal Register. This action is taken pursuant to Sections 4(i), 303(r) and 309(j) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 154(i), 303(r) and 309(j). List of Subjects in 47 CFR Part 24 Personal communications services, Radio. Federal Communications Commission. William F. Caton, Acting Secretary. Final Rules Part 24 of Chapter I of Title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations is amended as follows: PART 24_PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES 1. The authority citation of Part 24 continues to read as follows: Authority: Secs. 4, 301, 302, 303, 309 and 332, 48 Stat. 1066, 1082, as amended; 47 U.S.C. 154, 301, 302, 303, 309 and 332, unless otherwise noted. 2. Section 24.204 of the Commission's Rules is amended by adding paragraph (d)(2)(viii): §24.204 Cellular eligibility. * * * * * (d)␣*␣*␣* (2) *␣*␣* (viii) Ownership interests in a cellular licensee or a broadband PCS applicant or licensee that are held indirectly by any party through one or more intervening corporations will be determined by successive multiplication of the ownership percentages for each link in the vertical ownership chain and application of the relevant attribution benchmark to the resulting product, except that if the ownership percentage for an interest in any link in the chain exceeds 50 percent or represents actual control, it shall be treated as if it were a 100 percent interest. [For example, if A owns 10 percent of Company X, which owns 35 percent of, and controls, Company Y, which owns 25 percent of Licensee, then Company X's attributable interest in Licensee would be 25 percent, and A's attributable interest in Licensee would be 2.5 percent (0.1×0.25).] * * * * * [FR Doc. 94&hyph;18942 Field 8&hyph;3&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6712&hyph;01&hyph;M
