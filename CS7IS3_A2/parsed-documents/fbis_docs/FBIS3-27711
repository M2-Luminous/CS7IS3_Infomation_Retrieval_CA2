This was the assurance given by MNLF Chairman Nur Misuari to Senator Santanina Rasul during their dialogue earlier. The apprehension that the term of office of ARMM officials would be affected stemmed from Misuari's call for the establishment of a provisional government in Mindanao. ARMM officials, headed by the regional governor, have a three-year term of office.
