It was the first time the sound of battle could be heard so clearly in the port city of Aden, stronghold of Vice-President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, whose forces are fighting off a northern offensive. And it triggered fear among the population of 500,000, who had been reassured only the night before that the southerners were keeping the offensive at bay. Remaining foreigners crowded the port trying to board an Indian and a Pakistani ship which were due to set sail. Nearly 280 Indians were scheduled to leave during the day, a port official said. Northern troops, loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, are locked in a bitter struggle with al-Bid's forces at al-'Anad, a strategically important air base 50 kilometers (30 miles) to the north of Aden. There also fighting at Zinjibar, to the east, and Haraz, to the west. Artillery fire could be heard near the city on Wednesday to both the north and east. Al-Bid's Yemeni Socialist Party has stepped up conscription, taking thousands of youths to the front, willingly or not, aboard party vehicles that were criss-crossing the city. Salih has rejected international appeals for a ceasefire and insists that al-Bid and his aids surrender or flee into exile. The civil war was about to enter its third week with no end in sight. It has shattered the uneasy four-year old union between the conservative North and Marxist South.
