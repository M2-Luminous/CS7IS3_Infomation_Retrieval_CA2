Speaking in Sevastopol on Tuesday, he said Russia could be allowed to deploy its navy there for a period of 15 to 25 years after an appropriate leasing agreement was signed. The commander hopes that the problem of sharing the Black Sea Fleet (BSF) will have been sorted out by the end of next year as envisaged by the Yalta agreement. On Speaker of Parliament Alexander Moroz's call for joint BSF command to be maintained, Beskorovainy described the task as technically feasible. However, he stressed that the question was purely political amounting to the creation of a military alliance in fact. Russia and Ukraine ended the final round of talks in Kiev on 9 June by compiling a list of warships to be shared with each other. However, the question of deployment and sharing the existing infrastructures remains unresolved. Beskorovainy also said that a Ukrainian patrol ship would be sent to France to take part in a final parade at Rouan early next month dedicated to fifty years since the allied nations' operation in Normandy.
