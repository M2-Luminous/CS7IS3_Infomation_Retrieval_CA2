FBIS4-12276 "drnes067_j_94002" FBIS-NES-94-067 Daily Report 6 Apr 1994 ARABIAN PENINSULA Yemen YSP Statement on Military Buildup by North Denied YSP Statement on Military Buildup by North Denied NC0604210394 Cairo MENA in Arabic 1620 GMT 6 Apr 94 NC0604210394 Cairo MENA Arabic BFN [Text] Sanaa, 6 Apr (MENA)--An official Yemeni source has denied a statement by an official at the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], led by 'Ali Salim al-Bid, about a north Yemeni military buildup on the former border regions between the north and the south of Yemen. The source said the YSP official's statement is not true and aims to cover up the military buildup and movements by the forces of the YSP in al-Dali' and Shabwah in the south. The source warned against attempts by the YSP separatists, as he described them, to seriously escalate the military situation, dragging the country into a crushing civil war that could lead to separation and return the country to the situation it was in before 22 May 1990, the day unity was declared. The Yemeni source said the YSP separatists are seeking military escalation to circumvent the Pledge and Accord document and hinder the implementation of the decisions made by the Council of Ministers in its latest meeting in Aden. The decisions provide for withdrawing troops from the former border regions. The source denied reports that several countries offered proposals to solve the Yemeni crisis on the basis of federation or confederation. No Arab brother made such proposals. Indeed, they all stressed support for the Yemeni unity and its continuation, the source said. The official Yemeni source stressed that the General People's Congress, led by President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, is eager for dialogue among the political forces as the only option and the best solution to protect unity, reach understanding on common denominators to build the Yemeni state, and entrench the course of unity. The source denied reports that during the meeting in Salalah in Oman, President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih threatened to resort to war to solve the crisis. The source said these reports are false and are being promoted to cover up the YSP's unjustified military escalation and preparation for war.
