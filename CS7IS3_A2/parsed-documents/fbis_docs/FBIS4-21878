The most prominent feature of this phase is the diversion of part of the Palestinian bourgeoisie from the national program. In an exclusive interview with AL-QUDS, Dr. Habash added: We are preparing ourselves and are working on the basis of a program of comprehensive opposition to the Madrid-Oslo program and its numerous and Islamic parties without ignoring the international link, be they international institutions or progressive organizations, parties, and forces supportive of our rights and struggle. Dr. Habash affirmed that the future struggle will consist of two parts: First, continuing the struggle in all forms and with all available means. Second, opposing the accord and its implementation on the ground with the aim of foiling it. [passage omitted] Dr. Habash emphasized that his opposition to the self-rule authority will be based on political, popular, and social struggle and all possible democratic forms. On whether Arab states, especially Syria, were exerting pressure on the 10 factions, Habash said: The current situation of the official Arab system and the state of total collapse that it has reached, particularly following the second Gulf war, constitutes by itself the greatest pressure on us -- as rejectionist forces -- to be incorporated into the U.S. orbit. This situation, however, does not preclude the existence of Arab regimes that reject or oppose the U.S. concept of peace despite their limited role and effect. Habash affirmed: Despite differences in views and positions, Syria is not exerting any pressure on us. On the contrary, it is showing understanding for these positions, which stem from the nature and dangers of this accord. Dr. Habash said: For more than a year now the PLO leadership has stopped paying the PFLP its allocations from the Palestine National Fund. The cause for this is not the financial crisis. It preceded the crisis. By doing so, it is using the same weapon which Arab and Western countries are using against it. Dr. Habash added: Nationalist allies in Arab regimes provide us with periodic aid, which is very modest and does not meet the requirements of the struggle.
