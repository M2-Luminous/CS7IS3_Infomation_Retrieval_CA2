Korean `Dissidents' Protest U.S. Secretary's Visit OW1904171594 Beijing XINHUA in English 1451 GMT 19 Apr 94 OW1904171594 Beijing XINHUA English BFN [Text] Seoul, April 19 (XINHUA) -- Some 30 dissidents staged a demonstration in front of the American Embassy in Seoul today in protest against U.S Defense Secretary William Perry's visit to South Korea. Perry, who delayed his visit due to last week's downing of U.S. Army helicopters by friendly fire, will arrive here late tonight to hold talks with his South Korean counterpart Kwon Yong-hae on Pyongyang's nuclear issue. The demonstrators, believed to belong to "Chongukyonhap," an alliance of dissident activists for "democracy and national unification," delivered to the U.S. Embassy a letter addressing Perry. The letter accused Washington of "intentionally aggravating" tension on the Korean Peninsula to benefit the U.S. defense industry and to sustain its world hegemony as the sole military power even though the Cold War is over. It called on Perry to drop his earlier remarks warning of a war against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). It also urged the United States to withdraw immediately all Patriot missiles from South Korea and to suspend the Seoul-Washington joint military exercise "Team Spirit" permanently. South korea and the U.S. will find ways during Perry's visit here to break the stalemate of the nuclear issue, including the timing of the "Team Spirit" joint military drill. The first shipment of patriot missiles and their launchers arrived in South Korea Monday [18 April] aboard two U.S. military transport ships. The number of launchers amounted to 24, but the number of missiles was not known. South Korea and the U.S. claimed that the Patriots are purely defensive missiles designed to counter the DPRK's air strikes and Scud missiles. However, the DPRK strongly opposes the deployment of the Patriots in South Korea, saying that the missiles are designed for offensive purposes.
