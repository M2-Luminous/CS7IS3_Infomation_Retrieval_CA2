In an interview for CTK, Pittner said that "the Czech party must drop its claim to the Kasarna area in exchange for another territory and recognize that for Slovakia the area is important and attractive by its character, and that it is not only a matter of territorial compensation." Kasarna, now administratively part of north Moravia, has been an object of discords between the Czechs and Slovaks for several centuries. Pittner said that the area was to be discussed by the Czech and Slovak premiers, Vaclav Klaus and Jozef Moravcik, when they meet within the World Economic Forum which opened in Crans-Montana, Switzerland, today. Pittner and his Czech counterpart, Jan Ruml, are to meet on the Czech territory next week to discuss some pending questions related to the introduction of a standard border regime and some technical questions related to the addendum to the Czech-Slovak visa-free agreement which specifies certain articles of the agreement. The addendum was approved by the Slovak Government earlier this week. It is to be signed by the Czech and Slovak foreign ministers, Josef Zieleniec and Eduard Kukan, at their meeting in Prague on Monday [20 June].
