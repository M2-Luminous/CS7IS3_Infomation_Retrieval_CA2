The decision also affects former Chechen communist leader Doka Zavgayev. In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Monday, Mamodayev said that "instead of seeking reconciliation, Dudayev's regime takes steps causing the situation to worsen." He also brushed off accusations of alleged involvement, together with Russia, in preparations to remove Dzhokhar Dudayev from power. "We do not want confrontation or opposition between various parts of the Chechen population. We call for reconciliation and political dialogue," he said. Mamodayev stressed that the way out from the current crisis is through a constructive dialogue and the soonest possible economic reform.
