FR941128-0-00009 FR941128-0-00004 12 CFR Part 204 [Regulation D; Docket No. R&hyph;0857] Reserve Requirements of Depository Institutions AGENCY: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Board is amending Regulation D, Reserve Requirements of Depository Institutions, to increase the amount of transaction accounts subject to a reserve requirement ratio of three percent, as required by section 19(b)(2)(C) of the Federal Reserve Act, from $51.9 million to $54.0 million of net transaction accounts. This adjustment is known as the low reserve tranche adjustment. The Board has increased from $4.0 million to $4.2 million the amount of reservable liabilities of each depository institution that is subject to a reserve requirement of zero percent. This action is required by section 19(b)(11)(B) of the Federal Reserve Act, and the adjustment is known as the reservable liabilities exemption adjustment. The Board is also increasing the deposit cutoff levels that are used in conjunction with the reservable liabilities exemption to determine the frequency of deposit reporting from $55.0 million to $55.4 million for nonexempt depository institutions and from $44.8 million to $45.1 million for exempt institutions. (Nonexempt institutions are those with total reservable liabilities exceeding $4.2 million while exempt institutions are those with total reservable liabilities not exceeding $4.2 million.) Thus nonexempt institutions with total deposits of $55.4 million or more will be required to report weekly while nonexempt institutions with total deposits less than $55.4 million may report quarterly. Similarly, exempt institutions with total deposits of $45.1 million or more will be required to report quarterly while exempt institutions with total deposits less than $45.1 million may report annually. DATES: Effective date: December 20, 1994. Compliance dates: For depository institutions that report weekly, the low reserve tranche adjustment and the reservable liabilities exemption adjustment will apply to the reserve computation period that begins Tuesday, December 20, 1994, and on the corresponding reserve maintenance period that begins Thursday, December 22, 1994. For institutions that report quarterly, the low reserve tranche adjustment and the reservable liabilities exemption adjustment will apply to the reserve computation period that begins Tuesday, December 20, 1994, and on the corresponding reserve maintenance period that begins Thursday, January 19, 1995. For all depository institutions, the deposit cutoff level will be used to screen institutions in the second quarter of 1995 to determine the reporting frequency for the twelve month period that begins in September 1995.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 19(b)(2) of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 461(b)(2)) requires each depository institution to maintain reserves against its transaction accounts and nonpersonal time deposits, as prescribed by Board regulations. The initial reserve requirements imposed under section 19(b)(2) were set at three percent for net transaction accounts of $25 million or less and at 12 percent on net transaction accounts above $25 million for each depository institution. Effective April 2, 1992, the Board lowered the required reserve ratio applicable to transaction account balances exceeding the low reserve tranche from 12 percent to 10 percent. Section 19(b)(2) also provides that, before December 31 of each year, the Board shall issue a regulation adjusting for the next calendar year the total dollar amount of the transaction account tranche against which reserves must be maintained at a ratio of three percent. The adjustment in the tranche is to be 80 percent of the percentage change in net transaction accounts at all depository institutions over the one-year period that ends on the June 30 prior to the adjustment. Currently, the low reserve tranche on net transaction accounts is $51.9 million. The increase in the net transaction accounts of all depository institutions from June 30, 1993, to June 30, 1994, was 5.0 percent (from $788.5 billion to $828.3 billion). In accordance with section 19(b)(2), the Board is amending Regulation D (12 CFR Part 204) to increase the low reserve tranche for transaction accounts for 1995 by $2.1 million to $54.0 million.
