Over five percent of the respondents preferred the ZRS. The news has aroused foreign interest, as evidenced by today's talks between ZRS Chairman Jan Luptak and British Ambassador in Slovakia David Bright. Speaking on the radio, Luptak said Bright had been interested by the (blue collar) workers' negative attitude to market economy being introduced throughout Slovakia. [sentence as received] "It is impossible to privatize quickly and at the same time justly," Luptak said, pointing to the privatization of British Rail, whose privatization he said has been going on for twenty years despite Britain having a healthier economy (than Slovakia). "The ZRS has made contacts with the international workers' movement and is especially interested in the policy of the Norwegian Workers' Party which won the latest elections," Luptak said.
