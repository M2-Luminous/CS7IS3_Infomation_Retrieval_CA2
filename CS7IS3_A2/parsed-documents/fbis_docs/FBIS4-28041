He was speaking at the closing ceremony of the four-day Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries (TCDC) International Symposium for Capacity Enhancement in Primary Health Care and HIV/AIDS Management, attended by 24 countries. "We are confident we will not repeat those mistakes," Dr Chamrun said. Dr Chamrun was referring to a lack of know-how and proper methods for handling the spread of the deadly disease. He agreed that developing countries must share technical know-how and resources. "We are looking forward to convincing government and non-government organisations to take necessary action to strengthen management, technical cooperation internally and internationally and mobilise experts," he said. The meeting focused on four main issues, distribution of condoms, integration of HIV/AIDS care with primary health care, monitoring and evaluation and behavioural change. The participants also noted that funding from overseas for HIV/AIDS programmes is usually short-term and it was difficult for a country to sustain after the end of outside assistance. For evaluation and implementation purposes, additional funding is necessary.
