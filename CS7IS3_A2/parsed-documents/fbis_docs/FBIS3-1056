The ANC [African National Congress] and the SACP [South African Communist Party] voted in favor of the proposal but it was opposed by the NP [National Party] and the DP [Democratic Party]. Mr. Cyril Ramaphosa of the ANC said that the right to vote was a basic right, and that problems could be created by allowing only certain categories of prisoners to vote. Home Affairs Minister Danie Schutte said the government was strongly opposed to murderers and rapists being allowed to vote.
