FBIS4-5015 "dreas067__a94016" FBIS-EAS-94-067-A Daily Report 4 Apr 1994 ANNEX Japan Coalition Parties Consider Policy Study Group Coalition Parties Consider Policy Study Group OW0604190794 Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 4 Apr 94 Morning Edition p 2--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0604190794 Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] On 8 March, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa introduced his proposal for an interparty policy study group involving all coalition parties. The proposal provoked friction among the coalition parties, and, in the end, Hosokawa had to drop it. Nevertheless, Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa has again proposed an interparty "conference on basic policy issues" (tentative name). On 4 April, Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, who has just returned from Europe, will join a coalition leaders' meeting to restart discussions on the interparty consultative body. Shinseito and Komeito are still eager for an early merger of all coalition parties, and the controversy is likely to again threaten the coalition government's unity. It appears Hosokawa and Ozawa are impatiently seeking a coalition merger. Now that the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] is intensifying its stance in urging the Hosokawa cabinet resign, these coalition leaders want to rehabilitate the multiparty coalition's unity, which was weakened after the enactment of the political reform legislations. Hereafter, the coalition government will have to grapple with such pending issues as tax reform and the DPRK (North Korea) nuclear weapons development program, and these controversies may trigger serious internal discord in the government. A senior Shinseito official said that, "if the coalition's framework is left as it is, each party may go its own way until the coalition breaks up." Yet, the turmoil over Hosokawa's policy study group proposal clarified that Ozawa's real intention is to merge all coalition parties into one under his control. In this sense, proposals for the policy study group and the unified floor group were made to discourage the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] and Sakigake [Harbinger] from opposing a coalition merger. Commenting on this, the senior Shinseito official said, "in fact, that was a tricky action." However, every coalition party is aware that some sort of interparty tie-up is needed for the coalition government's survival after the next general election. The senior Shinseito official stressed "everybody knows the need for multiparty candidates or joint campaigns." At a coalition leaders meeting, even SDPJ Secretary General Wataru Kubo acknowledged the need for selection of multiparty candidates. Sakigake Secretary General Hiroyuki Sonoda insists joint election campaigns are possible without a coalition merger, saying: "Even under the new electoral system, it would be better to seek selection of multiparty candidates." However, Ichikawa stresses that a policy accord is an inevitable prerequisite for joint election campaigns, saying "interparty cooperation in election campaigns is impossible without narrowing policy gaps among parties." Ichikawa explained the "basic policy issue council" is intended for "narrowing policy gaps" among election partners on security and defense affairs. But Shinseito intends to demand the SDPJ and other leftist groups review their political stances to pave the way for tie-ups in election campaigns. On the other hand, the SDPJ intends to separate policy debates from multiparty cooperation in elections. For the time being, coalition parties are likely to confront each other over the issue.
