The agreement will not enter into force until the government and the URNG sign a final peace agreement at the end of this year. The preparatory work for this accord will begin in the next 60 days, it was announced. Once the resettlement concludes, the sides will begin to discuss the topic of the "identity and rights of Indian peoples," which is the next step in the negotiations. This new pact, accompanied by the one signed already on human rights, consolidates the possibility of bringing to an end the longest continuing conflict in Latin America, the United Nations indicated.
