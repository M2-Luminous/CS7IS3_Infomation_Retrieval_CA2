After the conclusion of a working visit to Latin American countries, Georgiy Mamedov visited Washington where he was holding negotiations on the situation around Sarajevo and Russian-U.S. relations. Straight after his return to Moscow he said in an interview to an ITAR-TASS correspondent that "they touched on the question of 'the Ames case' but it is an exaggeration to say that I was a special representative on this matter." Georgiy Mamedov said that there is rather a big fuss in the United States over this matter, but he believes that a lot is unclear in this case -- Ames himself has not admitted to being guilty. Georgiy Mamedov said that it is difficult to explain why the declaration of "the Ames case" has coincided in time with the critical situation over Sarajevo and with the declaration of the new initiative by Boris Yeltsin, the president of Russia. The deputy minister noted that "we simply should calmly and in a balanced way sort all that out."
