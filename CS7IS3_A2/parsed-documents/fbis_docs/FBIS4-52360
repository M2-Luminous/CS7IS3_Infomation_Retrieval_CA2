In East Timor, a Portuguese territory it invaded, Indonesia admitted eventually and reluctantly that its troops slaughtered about a hundred students in the infamous Dili massacre. That was the last official figure. Now stories are emerging of how other people wounded by troops had their heads smashed in by soldiers, one by one, as they lay in their own blood in hospital, or were systematically poisoned. Still later reports, based on observations by western journalists who risked their lives to learn what is really happening in East Timor, suggest a scale of systematic murder of the population. If the reports are accurate, it spells genocide. If the scale of what the Indonesians are doing to the East Timorese people is debatable, it obviously is on a scale enough to mean death, torture, imprisonment, and terror for a great number of people who would rather not live under corrupt and dictatorial Indonesian rule. And so to Western New Guinea. This is a former Dutch territory which, we shan't tire of reminding our readers, was handed shamefully to the Indonesians on a plate thanks to a sham United Nations vote pressured for by the Americans at a time when it was Washington's policy to do anything at all to curry favor with anti- Communist Asian regimes. The Melanesian people of Western New Guinea were never allowed a scrap of "self determination"; their fate was determined for them. Ever since, they have been the victims of Indonesian colonialism. Many western New Guineas have been jailed, tortured, and killed for seeking independence for their country; many continued to be jailed, tortured, and killed. Various organizations and people critical of Indonesia quote various figures. These are suspect. But not suspect enough to deny the truth of reports that show the Indonesian regime in occupied western New Guinea to be oppressive. In western New Guinea, the Indonesians are simply probably doing a better job hiding their crimes there than they are in East Timor. Recently, to their credit, the Americans have taken note of what is happening in East Timor and are now limiting the supplies of arms to the Indonesians. Not so the British, who after being so indignant about the Falkland Islands, Kuwait, and Bosnia have no qualms about selling jet warplanes to the Indonesians, as they are happily doing so now. The Indonesians regularly invade Papua New Guinea to kill indigenous rebels who cross the border from the occupied western half of the island. There is some evidence, which the Papua New Guinea government appears to want to ignore, that Indonesian troops recently killed a dozen or more Papua New Guinea villagers. Some of Indonesia's neighbors, and countries like Britain who want to sell it arms, make a great effort to whitewash the Indonesians. Indonesia is a huge market of 200 million. This is what attracts the British, Americans, French, the Australians, and other exporting countries. It is a militarily powerful, dictatorial, corrupt, aggressive, and expansionist country, which is what frightens Australia and Papua New Guinea. Indeed Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating, at the time hot on Kuwait too, described Indonesia as "no country is more important to Australia". He heads a government with a policy which wreaks of appeasement where the Indonesians are concerned. Alas, there is very little that can be done about Indonesia except to treat it with caution. It is too big and dangerous to do otherwise. One small bloom in the desert is that some Indonesians acknowledge their sins and that the seeds of democracy and decency in their country are beginning to sprout. Unfortunately, the growth rate of these delicate plants is unlikely to be fast enough to be of any help to the East Timorese or the west New Guineans. They are doomed to be devoured by Indonesia. Australia, and Papua New Guinea's mental agony is: could we one day be gobbled up too?
