His visit to France was his first trip outside Africa since his victory in the September 1992 presidential elections and the resumption of the war with UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola]. After the visit was postponed, and in spite of the opposition of French supporters of UNITA, the Angolan president was met officially in Paris by his counterpart, President Francois Mitterrand, and also by Prime Minister Edouard Balladur and the French ministers of cooperation and the interior. This was a form of diplomatic recognition for Eduardo dos Santos, but France failed to commit itself at any level. Paris has made the resumption of its cooperation conditional on a peace agreement, has referred the rescheduling of the 1 billion francs owed to it by Angola to the IMF, and has upheld its embargo on arms sales. Monique Mas began by asking President Dos Santos if he was not disappointed by his visit: [Santos] No, we are not disappointed. The most important thing for us is that France has a firm position on the current problems in Angola. We heard from the French authorities that there was a legitimate, elected government in Angola. It is with this government that France will maintain relations of friendship and cooperation within a relatively privileged framework. We view the question of the [arms] embargo within the broader framework of the United Nations, in light of the resolution adopted by the Security Council, whereby the Angolan Government is free -- at least until the cease-fire is reimposed in Angola -- to reequip itself militarily. France is a permanent member of the Security Council, and so I hope that France will apply this United Nations resolution. Regarding the resumption of economic cooperation in the post-war period, I think that there was considerable interest from the French Government in broadening current levels of cooperation, so that Angola can enjoy not only the support of France, but also that of the international community as a whole. The possibility was even raised of organizing an international conference on the rehabilitation of Angola. [Mas] On the subject of the international community, the United States and Great Britain have lifted the military embargo against Angola. How do you explain France's differing position on this issue, and do these two countries supply you with anything significant in terms of arms? [Santos] It is more a political than a military question. We have not asked for arms from either the British, U.S., or French Governments, but, as I have stressed, there is a rebellion in Angola, the French Government has diplomatic relations with the Angolan Government, which it recognizes as a legitimate and elected government, so we do not see any reason for an embargo. We are sure that the French position on this issue will change. [Mas] With France in a period of cohabitation, have you been reassured as to this government's attitude to Angola in contrast to that of the previous socialist government? What do you expect from France, in particular on the subject of the Lusaka talks? [Santos] As I told you, we heard a common position from the French authorities regarding the political, military, and even economic problems in Angola. We are very satisfied with this position. We have asked France to play a role in this region in order to establish a regional climate which can accelerate the negotiating process in Lusaka. [Mas] What role in particular? [Santos] We would like France to put pressure on all the countries in the region that continue to give military aid to UNITA, helping it wage war against the democratic institutions. [Mas] Would this be mainly Zaire? [Santos] South Africa -- let us say conservative, radical elements in South Africa -- and also Zaire of course. [Mas] The Lusaka talks have touched on political issues. How far are you prepared to go in your talks with UNITA? [Santos] Taking account of the basic principle that the party that won the elections should set up a government and should govern, we are prepared to offer portfolios to UNITA, within a framework of national reconciliation, just as we have offered portfolios to other political parties represented in our government. [Mas] What can you offer Mr. Savimbi? [Santos] What UNITA asks for is a special status. The terms of this status will be discussed in Lusaka.
