Recalling that the DPRK Government, through a statement of the Foreign Ministry April 28, proposed to the United States to hold negotiations to establish a new peace arrangement that would replace the old armistice mechanism, the letter says: As you confirmed personally during your visit to our country toward the end of last year, an unstable state of truce, neither peace nor war, has lasted for more than 40 years on the Korean peninsula. The situation on the Korean peninsula has become all the more strained and the possibility of a total armed conflict is increasing because the United States, entering this year, has massed huge reinforcements in and around South Korea and stepped up its military actions against the DPRK on the pretext of the "nuclear issue". The Korean Armistice Agreement and its observation mechanism should have controlled such actions, but they have failed to play any role due to the U.S. side's systematic acts of breach and destruction. In 1956 the United States expelled Neutral Nations Inspection teams stationed at the appropriate ports of entry under Paragraph C, Article 2 of the Korean Armistice Agreement from the area under its control and, on June 21, 1957, it unilaterally renounced Subparagraph 13d of the Korean Armistice Agreement which stipulates that the introduction into Korea of reinforcing combat equipment shall be ceased. Since then the United States has shipped sophisticated weapons including more than 1,000 pieces of nuclear weapons into South Korea without any restrictions and it has become all the more undisguised of late in its shipments of such combat equipment. Having systematically destroyed the military armistice mechanism, the U.S. side completely paralyzed it by unilaterally appointing as the senior member of the "UN Forces" side to the Military Armistice Commission (MAC) a South Korean serviceman without any legal justification or qualification in view of the Armistice Agreement on March 25, 1991. The present-day reality in which the basic provisions of the Armistice Agreement that should guarantee peace on the Korean peninsula have been scrapped and the armistice observation mechanism now remains only in name requires that a decisive measure be taken to establish a new security arrangement for saving the situation which has reached the danger line and preventing arms buildup and the outbreak of another war. In fact, the Korean Armistice Agreement signed on July 27, 1953, was a tentative measure taken to stop combat actions between the belligerent parties and taken in anticipation of its conversion to a peace agreement in the future. The adoption of the resolution (3390, b) calling for the dissolution of the "UN command" and the replacement of the Armistice Agreement by a peace agreement at the 30th session of the UN General Assembly in 1975, therefore, was a very just measure to ensure a lasting peace on the Korean peninsula and it opened a bright vista for the final solution of the Korean question. The DPRK Government has taken initiatives and proposed negotiations on many occasions to ensure a durable peace on the Korean peninsula and made tireless efforts to carry them into effect. Nonaggression was vowed by the North and the South through the "agreement on reconciliation, nonaggression, cooperation and exchange between the North and the South" adopted in 1992 as a result of our positive efforts. But we are still in a state of truce vis-a-vis the United States which keeps its Armed Forces stationed in South Korea. The "UN command", known as a signatory to the Armistice Agreement, serves for the strategic aim of the United States to isolate and stifle the DPRK and establish control over Asia and the Pacific region, an aim which has nothing to do with the UN mission to keep peace in South Korea. I think, therefore, that there is no condition for the U.S. Forces present in South Korea to act "UN Forces" any longer. [sentence as received] Taking into consideration the actual conditions where a grave situation threatening peace had been created on the Korean peninsula but there was no rational institutional mechanism capable of controling it, the DPRK Government proposed to the U.S. side to negotiate the establishment of a new durable peace arrangement that will replace the old armistice mechanism and, at the same time, took practical measures of recalling all the members of the Korean People's Army (KPA) side from the MAC, setting up the KPA mission at Panmunjom as a new mechanism for negotiations with the U.S. Forces side and of appointing the chief and members of the mission. This is, to all intents and purposes, an innovative and well- intentioned step to make a breakthrough in establishing a new security arrangement for peace on the Korean peninsula and a peaceloving step that took into account the publicly accepted international usage whereby some countries abandoned the relationship of hostilities after the Second World War and declared peace relationship instead. I consider that the United Nations must pay due attention to our proposal in the sense of liquidating its unpleasant past vis-a-vis the DPRK, its member state, and in the sense of fulfilling its resolution to replace the Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement. The "nuclear issue" over which some countries are now making a fuss is, in fact, not a question to be discussed by the United Nations, but one that must be solved through negotiations between the DPRK and the U.S. Taking "sanctions" against the DPRK, yielding to the unjust demand of some countries, it will, no doubt, bring devastating consequences menacing peace in Asia and the rest of the world, not to speak of the Korean peninsula. With a view to accelerating the process of the replacement of the Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement in accordance with the resolution of the 30th General Assembly, the United Nations must take a practical step to dismantle the "UN command", the framework of the old armistice structure. In the letter Kim Yong-nam expresses the hope that the UN secretary-general will pay a particular attention to the peace overture of the DPRK to establish a new peace arrangement through the medium of the DPRK-U.S. negotiations and actively cooperate in its materialisation.
