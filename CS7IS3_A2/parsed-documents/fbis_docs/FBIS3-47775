[Bui] In implementing Directive No. 15 dated 20 November 1992 issued by the CPV Central Committee Political Bureau and the Decision No. 114 dated 21 November 1992 by the prime minister on suppressing and eliminating corruption and smuggling, the government has tried to direct the ministries, sectors, and localities in carrying out various important measures and has achieved significant initial progress. The determination of the party and state in radically suppressing corruption and smuggling received widespread support from the cadres and people. There have been more corruption and smuggling cases detected and handled strictly than before. [Hong] But, Dear Minister, our cadres and people still have a lot to worry about in regard to these problems. [Bui] That is correct. Although the direction has been more resolute than before, our achievements were still very limited, and in some areas the number of corruption cases even grew. Areas of great concern are basic construction, real estate, and illegal automobile and motorcycle imports through the ports and southwestern borders. These activities occur mainly in major economic sectors like trade, construction, communication and transportation, marine products, agriculture, and the food industry. Many agencies and authorities have allowed individual traders to use their power to engage in smuggling activities. In the first 10 months of this year, we discovered 918 corruption cases involving 285 billion dong, 95 percent more in terms of the number of cases and 244 percent higher in terms of the money involved compared with the same period last year. Corruption was detected, not only in economic and business agencies, but also in law enforcement agencies or in agencies directly charged with preventing and fighting corruption and smuggling, such as customs, taxation, public security, inspection, courts, and so forth. [Hong] What are typical recent examples of corruption? [Bui] Analyzing the cases detected, we can list some general types of corruption activities as follows: Violating laws and regulations relating to budget expenditure and income. Abusing joint business ventures by colluding with foreign partners to cheat in import-export activities. Violating state regulations on real estate management and basic construction. The most serious situation was the popular trend of wrong-doing among leading cadres at some ministries, sectors, and localities, who only care about their sector's benefit and ignore the laws and regulations. They even go beyond their authority to set up economic and financial regulations themselves, thus assisting corruption and smuggling activities and worsening the already complicated situation. [Hong] Dear Minister, what are the noteworthy features of the struggle against smuggling? [Bui] There was a reduction of smuggling directly involving state authorities and economic agencies under social and political organizations. The implementation of verification and control measures, though still bearing many shortcomings, has begun to help the concerned agencies recognize those professional smugglers, punish them severely, and repress the haughty and challenging attitude of the smugglers towards the government. The smuggling situation, however, is still very serious, because it has become so complicated and diversified in various regions and localities, at different points of time, with some hot spots being the southwestern border, the northern border, and at sea. These are some emerging issues: violations of lumber export regulations are common smuggling of foreign cigarettes along the west and south-west borders is on the rise, even more openly than before automobile smuggling through the southwestern border is still serious for items whose importation is prohibited, or whose import permits are cancelled temporarily, the smugglers still find ways to elude control measures and investigation smuggling at sea has become more complicated Most major smuggling activities (via sea, air, and inland routes) involved using state-owned vehicles and ships, by either arrangement by the people in charge of the media with the smugglers, or the state economic agencies directly carrying out the smuggling themselves. The concern is that there has been collusion among smugglers, corrupt people, and degenerate cadres in the forces directly in charge of smuggling suppression. [Hong] Could the minister please outline the policies and measures to suppress corruption and smuggling? [Bui] The report of the government to the fourth session of the Ninth National Assembly has outlined the following policies and measures: 1. Reorganize, adjust, and complete the current system and policies relating to the suppression of corruption and smuggling. The government will soon issue documents to distinguish the state management authority with production and business management functions of ministries and sectors. For the near future, the government is going to issue preliminary documents on public service regulations, government employee awards, and on a number of urgent issues such as regulations on receiving gifts and bonuses, expenditure of public fund, and so forth. 2. Heighten responsibility of leaders of all agencies in fighting corruption and smuggling. 3. The law enforcement authorities will concentrate on regions and areas where conditions allow smugglers and corrupt people to make connections with degenerate cadres, in order to fight corruption and smuggling effectively. 4. The law enforcement agencies will take up resolute measures to consolidate and cleanse the organizations. They also have to promote clean and just cadres for this campaign. 5. The ministries, sectors, and localities should regularly scrutinize the implementation of government decisions on anti-corruption and anti-smuggling work. 6. Consolidate the ancillary anti-corruption and anti-smuggling bodies within ministries, sectors, and localities. Determine clearly the responsibility and power of these bodies to ensure their effective operation. [Hong] Thank you, Dear Minister.
