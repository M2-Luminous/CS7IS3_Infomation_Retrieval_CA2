According to some politicians, the journalists are professional and thorough, while other politicians accuse television journalists of bias, superficiality, and sensation seeking. For a few months now, there has been a spirited argument going on among politicians as to the assessment of the new public television management, but that is not the only theme of the argument. Another one is something much more tangible -- assessments of the degree of professionalism of television journalists. According to Jan Litynski of the Freedom Union, in recent times, the level of reporting and of television news programs has much improved and he says it is "quite high." In his view, the commentaries and reports are professional and describe well the essence of the political event in question. While Litynski's only complaint concerns constant changes in the arrangement of television studios, Jerzy Wiatr of the Democratic Left Alliance has some more serious accusations to levy. In his view, the general level of professionalism displayed by television journalists, is low. "There are instances of professional, intelligent, and unbiased journalists" -- Wiatr lists Andrzej Morozowski as one of them -- "but there are also many very bad ones." He adds that the level is much below the capabilities that exist in Poland and that is because many valuable people are removed. In Wiatr's opinion, the main "sin" of television journalists is not political prejudice but superficiality. In contrast to their Western colleagues, Polish journalists are often times poorly prepared to handle the topics they have been assigned. They often try to cover up this ignorance with engaging in polemics or even with a certain degree of aggressive behavior. According to Litynski, television journalists are not biased. Even if one can be critical regarding, for instance, the composition of a panel of guests invited to some political talk show, there is no bias in that whatsoever. Wiatr in turn thinks that often, errors in journalistic work do not indicate simply a lack of professionalism but also bias. Tomasz Nalecz of the Union of Labor has high praise concerning television journalists. True, he thinks they engage in too much sensation seeking (a report about a Sejm deputy who caused an accident after having drunk two beers is more important than a significant decision by the Sejm) but he adds immediately that the team of journalists servicing the Sejm is fully competent and professional. Nalecz is outraged at the decision to suspend Grzegorz Miecugow for failure to include a report on the president's return from Estonia in "Wiadomosci" [main television newscast]. Nalecz thinks Miecugow was right in his decision. "This proves that we still do not have a purely information- oriented type of journalism" -- Nalecz says. "But I do not condemn journalists because a short leash has always been applied to them."
