This important transformation in the financial distribution system will undoubtedly bring about new changes in our province's financial distribution structure and produce great impact on our province's economic development. For this reason, this reporter recently interviewed Comrade Zhao Leji, our provincial finance department director. This reporter has learned from Director Zhao's briefing that, in the long run, with the implementation of the tax sharing financial system, the financial capacity of the central authorities will be strengthened and able to regulate financial distribution among various localities, optimizing resource disposition to gradually narrow the gaps between various localities in terms of economic and social development. However, a fairly long period of time will be needed. According to the principle of structural reform characterized by separating the system from difficulties and giving priority to ensure the smooth promulgation of the new economic system, in establishing the tax sharing financial management system involving the central authorities and localities, no special consideration has been given to our province as a region of minority nationalities. It is obvious that we are encountering financial difficulties. Although the tax system reform has not increased the tax loads of enterprises in our province as a whole, our province has faced greater challenge in the competition in the unified market of the whole country because the level of economic efficiency of enterprises in our province is generally low. In this connection, Zhao Leji maintained that our province must adopt the following relevant countermeasures: We must be firm and unshakable in developing the economy. Value-added tax is our province's major source of financial income. According to the new tax system reform, the central authorities will get 75 percent of the tax. Value-added tax is a general tax category. As long as our economy has been developed, we can get 25 percent of the tax. If we add the 30 percent rebates from the amount of tax increase to this, we can get about 40 percent returns. The tax income rebates which the central authorities give to various localities will definitely be linked to the growth of the value-added tax and consumption tax of the whole country according to a certain coefficient. It is obvious that, as long as we are firm and unshakable in promoting economic development, the central authorities can get more and so can we. This is the only way out for our province to extricate itself from its financial predicament. We must regulate our ideas on development and cultivate local financial resources. With the implementation of the tax sharing system, the structure of our province's financial resources will also change. This new setup will definitely have an impact on the growth of our province's local financial resources and also play a role in guiding our province's economic development. Under the prerequisite of conforming with the state industrial policy, the focus of augmenting our province's financial resources should be shifted to the vigorous development of those trades and products which are directly connected with our local financial resources. We should pay attention to devoting our limited funds to projects and links which have obvious efficiency and can increase local financial incomes to expand Qinghai's local financial capacity. According to the new tax system, the resource tax on the majority of items is regarded as local income. Our province is rich in natural resources and we must fully exploit this strong point. We must promote the exploitation of our natural resources such as hydropower, salt lakes, petroleum, natural gas, metals, mineral products, and asbestos mines. Business tax and income tax from local enterprises are the main sources of local revenues. We must vigorously develop our tertiary industry, speed up the pace of reform and opening up, fully combine the importing of advanced technology with internal economic connections, and develop nongovernment-owned economic sectors, including collective, individual, private, and joint-stock enterprises. Our tertiary industry has very great potential and we have bright prospects for developing our financial resources. We must try in every possible way to increase economic efficiency in our state-owned enterprises. According to the tax sharing system, localities will have their own due shares. The purpose in doing so is to encourage localities to enhance economic efficiency in state-owned enterprises. However, in our province one-third of our state-owned enterprises obviously lose money in business, one-third losing money latently, and only one-third is truly making profit. Although the tax loads of our state-owned enterprises have not yet become heavier as a result of the implementation of the tax sharing system, various systems have been strictly standardized, including those governing enterprise tax, tax reduction and exemption, repayment of investment loans, income distribution, and so on. The majority of state-owned enterprises in our province cannot adapt themselves to such changes. In particular, they are facing a big challenge in the unified markets of the whole country and in the great environment of fair competition. To enhance enterprise efficiency under the new financial system, we must, at least, grasp the following focal points: First, we must develop a sense of efficiency. The economic work focus of local governments is to grasp enhancement of enterprise efficiency. Efficiency should mainly be regarded as a yardstick for examining enterprise achievements. Second, we must enhance the efficiency of scale (gui mo xiao yi 6016 2875 2400 4135) and establish a base for efficiency resources to develop a structure of group-type financial resources (xing cheng ji tuan xing de cai yuan ti xi 1748 2054 7162 097 0992 4104 2088 3293 7555 4762) to promote development of scale, management of scale, expansion of scale, and enhance enterprise competitiveness in market competition. Third, we must establish supervisory mechanisms for financial resources and examine the efficiency of financial resources at all levels. Fourth, we must establish a modern enterprise system to invigorate our state-owned enterprises and gradually relieve the state of its unlimited responsibilities for enterprises. We must transform government functions, speed up socialized management, and provide excellent services. With the implementation of the tax sharing system, on the basis of defining the control powers of the central government, it is necessary to further define the control powers of local governments. In other words, trades and projects which are closely connected with the development of the local social economy and undertakings should be independently developed by local governments. This can clearly show the direction for speeding up the changeover of local government functions. Local governments must firmly seize on this favorable opportunity to switch from directly running enterprises and commanding their production and business operations activities to strengthening social management and basic facilities projects and providing still better services for the operations of enterprises to create an environment which is more beneficial to macroscopic economic environment. Comrade Zhao Leji also pointed out that apart from relying on ourselves to increase incomes considerably, strictly exercise control over expenditure, and solve some difficulties, the key lay in striving for the help of the central authorities, so that when they are establishing a system which governs the transfer of payment system they will fully consider Qinghai's difficulties and give our province the necessary support.
