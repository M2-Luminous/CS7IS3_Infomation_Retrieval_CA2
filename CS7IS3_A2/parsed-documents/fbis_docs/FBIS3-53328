In an interview with the morning daily HAMSHAHRI published Wednesday, the minister said that Iran and other non-member countries would have to join GATT sooner or later. "However, we have to strengthen the infrastructure and structure of our economy in such a way to become able to enjoy the facilities which are to be provided by the agreement," Kalantari stressed. He believed that Iran can obtain a favorable export market for its several agricultural products such as vegetables and green house products. After joining the GATT, the minister added, Iran has to introduce certain changes in its present agricultural patterns in the coming years. He noted that in future Iran should produce strategic products such as wheat, rice and sugar as much as are needed for domestic use only. Should Iran be able to benefit from the facilities provided by GATT, it would get a good chance for exporting its agricultural products, he maintained. Moreover, Kalantari added, with implementation of the agreement, the world prices for Iranian agricultural products would increase. Iran should become self-sufficient in wheat production as soon as possible, because, he said, the world prices for this strategic product are on the rise.
