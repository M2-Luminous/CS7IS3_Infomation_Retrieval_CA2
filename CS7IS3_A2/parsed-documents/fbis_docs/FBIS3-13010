The feature includes a brief opening talk by the announcer, who says: "If we want to examine the al-Khalil [Hebron] mosque massacre, we can see that, contrary to the allegations by the regime occupying Jerusalem, the massacre of the worshipers at the al-Ibrahimi mosque was not a spontaneous act by a group of extremists but the starting point of a series of acts that are being perpetrated by the Zionist government in a bid to achieve a special objective. If we want to understand this better, we have to look at the recent U.S.-Israeli act in the region. What the West is propounding as the peace process only mentions the word peace and pursues very specific objectives." The announcer then goes on to say: "The first objective that international Zionism is pursuing is to extinguish the burning flames of the intifadah, which is considered to be one of the most dangerous political-social phenomena of the region for Israel, the United States, and even the corrupt regimes around them. International Zionism considers the intifadah to be yet another fruit of the Islamic revival process, which is threatening the interests and objectives of the regime occupying Jerusalem." Then the guest of the feature, Hoseyn Sheykholeslam, Iranian deputy foreign minister for Arab and African affairs, is asked to comment on the Hebron massacre. In answer to a question on what objective the Zionists are pursuing in the incident, Sheykholeslam says: "The Zionists' objective is very simple. They do not want there to be any Palestinian in Palestine. They do not want any non-Israeli or anyone who does not believe in world domination by Zionism to be in Israel. Israel has a big strategic plan for this purpose. This plan has political, international, economic, propaganda, social, and psychological aspects. It has been following this plan for more than 50 years in various stages. It has almost succeeded, especially with the implementation of the Camp David agreement as well as the compromise plans that have emerged, one by one, after Camp David." Sheykholeslam then refers to the Islamic revolution in Iran and says that one of the most important aspects of the revolution was the method that Imam Khomeyni used in directing the revolution: "a method that displayed the true power of the nation, something that we saw in our revolution and what we are witnessing in Palestine today." Sheykholeslam says: "This massacre was actually a follow-up to the psychological-social plan to spread fear in the hearts of the Palestinians so that they will become dissatisfied with their life in Palestine and will leave their territories and go." Sheykholeslam discusses how the same method is being used in the field of economics by "increasing inflation at home" so that the Palestinians will not be able to lead a good life and will have to leave the country. Later in the feature and after music and slogans, Sheykholeslam is asked to give details on the Hebron incident and to comment: "It is good to note that the majority of the martyrs were between 18 and 25 years of age. This shows how close this [Palestinian] revolution is to our revolution. Like the role that the youths played in our revolution, the youths there have now come onto the scene. The youths have stolen the scene from the nationalists, politicians, and communists and it is the Muslims who are on the scene now. Fortunately, this trend is growing more and more each day. The last base of the nationalists was al-Khalil which, I think, will be taken out of the Israelis' hands with this incident." The feature goes on to broadcast phone calls from listeners who express their readiness to fight next to the Palestinians. Sheykholeslam then says: "The nation is well aware that this war, the war that is going on in Palestine, is one between Islam and blasphemy. The future of the world will be determined by this war. Whether we want it or not, the future of the world will be determined by a confrontation between Islam led by the pure Muhammedan Islam, which His Eminence the Imam propounded in Iran, on the one side and arrogance, which is led by the United States and Israel, on the other." Later in the program the announcer asks Sheykholeslam to comment on the opinion by many analysts that "there is a link between the massacre of Muslims in Palestine and the massacre of Muslims elsewhere, namely in Bosnia-Herzegovina." Sheykholeslam says that as previously stated: "The future war will be one between Islam, especially the outlook of our nation and its leadership on the one side, and arrogance in general on the other. Each and every Muslim, wherever he may be, is considered a potential enemy to them. The more combatant a Muslim is, a bigger enemy he is for them. And if there is the possibility that he can form Islamic rule, even a rule by Muslims, this is considered a greater threat to them. The crime that you are witnessing in Bosnia-Herzegovina today is being done to prevent the Muslims there from forming a country and an Islamic rule. I do not know why it is, but apparently it is God's wish that the hotter this furnace of struggle becomes, the more combatant the elements that emerge from it are. According to the Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina, if it was not for this struggle they would not have been able to become acquainted with Islam in this way, and if this genocide had not continued, they would not have come so close to the Islamic Republic and the mode of our thoughts. The same applies to Palestine. Today's Palestinians are much closer to us than the Palestinian of the pro-Camp David era." The feature continues with more phone calls. The last question asked of Sheykholslam is what significance the people's presence at the Jerusalem Day march has. Sheykholeslam says: "Our nation should know that arrogance wants to convince the Palestinians that they do not have anyone to support them. This is the policy that is aimed at spreading disillusionment. But our nation should know that by coming to the scene and to the marches, it shows that it is next to the Palestinian nation. It will encourage the Palestinians. And this is exactly the opposite of the policy that arrogance wants to impose. Our Palestinian brothers believe that Muslims bearing black flags will come from the east and will liberate Palestine. Maybe this means the black chadors [veils] of the Iranian nation. You know that our nation, and especially the women, impressed the West with their black chadors and conveyed a special message. This belief by the Palestinian nation may mean this. At any rate, the Palestinian nation, which arrogance tried to disillusion as much as possible, is powerfully on the scene today and should be supported by our nation in every possible way, the most simple of which may be presence at the Jerusalem Day march."
