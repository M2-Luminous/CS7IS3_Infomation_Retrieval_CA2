FR940527-2-00100 FR940527-2-00084 Fish and Wildlife Service Notice of Availability of a Draft Recovery Plan for Blue Shiner for Review and Comment AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. ACTION: Notice of document availability and public comment period. SUMMARY: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announces the availability for public review of a draft recovery plan for the blue shiner ( Cyprinella caerulea ). It occurs in the headwater river systems of the Coosa River in Georgia and Tennessee, and in smaller tributaries of the Coosa River in Alabama. Populations are fragmented and isolated by impoundments and by distance. The species has been extirpated from the Cahaba River system, and Big Wills Creek, Alabama. The Service solicits review and comment from the public on this draft plan. DATES: Comments on the draft recovery plan must be received on or before July 29, 1994, to receive consideration by the Service. ADDRESSES: Persons wishing to review the draft recovery plan may obtain a copy by contacting the Jackson Field Office, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 6578 Dogwood View Parkway, suite A, Jackson, Mississippi 39213. Written comments and materials regarding the plan should be addressed to the Field Supervisor at the above address. Comments and materials received are available on request for public inspection, by appointment, during normal business hours at the above address. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert Bowker at the above address (601/965&hyph;4900). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Restoring endangered or threatened animals and plants to the point where they are again secure, self-sustaining members of their ecosystems is a primary goal of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's endangered species program. To help guide the recovery effort, the Service is working to prepare recovery plans for most of the listed species native to the United States. Recovery plans describe actions considered necessary for conservation of the species, establish criteria for the recovery levels for downlisting or delisting them, and estimate time and cost for implementing the recovery measures needed. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq. ) requires the development of recovery plans for listed species unless such a plan would not promote the conservation of a particular species. Section 4(f) of the Act, as amended in 1988, requires that a public notice and an opportunity for public review and comment be provided during recovery plan development. The Service will consider all information presented during a public comment period prior to approval of each new or revised recovery plan. The Service and other Federal agencies will also take these comments into account in the course of implementing approved recovery plans. The species considered in this draft recovery plan is the blue shiner ( Cyprinella caerulea ). This medium-sized minnow is currently known from only the Coosa River system. The blue shiner occurs over a sand and gravel substrate among cobble in cool, clear water. The blue shiner was listed as threatened on April 22, 1992. The major threat is water quality degradation, the likely cause of extirpation from the Cahaba River system. The objective of this proposed plan is to delist the blue shiner. The species may be considered recovered when populations in the stretches of the Coosa River system identified in the recovery plan are documented to be viable and are fully protected. Actions needed to reach this goal include: (1) Determining its optimum habitat, (2) determining its life history, (3) developing and implementing a plan to restore and protect its essential habitat, and (4) monitoring its populations. This Plan is being submitted for agency review. After consideration of comments received during the review period, it will be submitted for final approval. Public Comments Solicited The Service solicits written comments on the recovery plan described. All comments received by the date specified above will be considered prior to approval of the plan. Authority The authority for this action is section 4(f) of the Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. 1533(f). Dated: May 18, 1994. Robert Bowker, Field Supervisor.
