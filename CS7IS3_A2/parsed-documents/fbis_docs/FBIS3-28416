A government intelligence official revealed that "it has been confirmed that, by using the parts and facilities North Korea introduced from the former Soviet Union in 1991, North Korea succeeded in assembly-production of two MiG-29 jets at the Panghyon plant." MiG-29 jets are Russia's ultramodern fighters that are recognized as being superior to U.S. F-16's which the ROK Air Force is expected to import for its Korean Fighter Program. North Korea's assembly-production success draws public attention, because this means that the technology of North Korea's arms industry has surpassed expectations. Another high-level government intelligence official said that "the government is keeping close watching over North Korea's possible production and introduction of more MiG-29 jets." North Korea began introducing MiG-29 jets from the former Soviet Union in the mid-eighties and now possesses approximately 20 MiG-29 jets.
