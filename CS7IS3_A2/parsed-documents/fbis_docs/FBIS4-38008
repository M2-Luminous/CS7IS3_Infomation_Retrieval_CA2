'Azmi al-Shu'aybi (from the Fida party) criticized the policy of domination and monopolization pursued in the entire political, security, economic, and administrative structure being set up. He warned against transferring the deformities afflicting the PLO and its experiment in exile to Palestinian territory, because that would lead to its failure. Dr. al-Shu'aybi, sports and youths minister, said in a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that "we in the Palestinian Democratic Union `Fida' decided to participate in the authority in order to serve our people in this stage. From the outset we have called for abandoning old working methods and the policy of domination, not politicizing the institutions, and reducing reliance on individuals in favor of institutional action based on competence and the real need. Despite our knowledge of the chronic ailments in Palestinian action outside the homeland, we wagered and continue to wager on the role of popular control over the institutions to be moved to the homeland. Because the Palestinian people, who have waited all these years and succeeded in returning their leadership from abroad, will not allow incompetent structures to be imposed on them from abroad." [passage omitted] Al-Shu'aybi pointed to the danger of militarizing the institutions and to the militias' control of citizens' life and food. He said that "the most dangerous thing facing us is the lack of clear powers and the separation between security and and police services operating in Gaza and Jericho. Our people have begun to openly express their indignation at the spread of security services and the way in which the preventive security service operates. And numerous field commanders still have not comprehended the fact that the authority does not belong to Fatah and that Gaza and Jericho are not another Lebanon." He added, "we are a responsible and constructive opposition using the weapon of criticism, which expresses the people's feelings and their discontent at methods which are alien to their struggle traditions through which they confronted the occupation over the past years. While we criticize erroneous practices and participate in the Palestinian Authority, we raise our voice to avert mistakes and correct the march immediately. We expressed this in front of Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, whose impartiality we respect and appreciate." [passage omitted]
