This was surmised from remarks by Deputy Foreign Minister Fernando Gerbasi, who, during talks with EL GLOBO, has said this is the first time the United States has disclosed the name of the candidate for the OAS position. According to Gerbasi, the North Americans "are looking at an OAS that is economy-oriented with emphasis on the idea of a free market, and thus they think integration can be thoroughly achieved through it." He feels this stand is respectable, "but it undermines the importance and significance of the OAS, an organization that should have its own political criteria, because any group of governments cannot hope to become something technical or have a partial vision of society. Society must be viewed as a whole, because, basically, any action within a society is a political action." Asked about the importance of support of the United States, as a world power, to determine the victory of the new secretary general, Garbasi has said: "We are not in a bipolar world, but it is not a unipolar world either. Perhaps this is true in the military but not in the political or economic spheres."
