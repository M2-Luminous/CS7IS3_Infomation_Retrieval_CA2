He says he has again come to Ried this year in spite of being very busy with election campaigns for three provincial government elections. And he gets down to business immediately. [Begin Haider recording] Of course, the Austrian People's Party and Social Democratic Party of Austria are top in opinion polls. But the elections have always been won by us, and this will also be the case on 13 March. [end recording] Haider also knows how he wants to win the elections. The state, which has been ruined by the governing parties, must be reorganized without taking anything away from hard working people. This could be done by cutting bureaucracy, reforming the social insurance system, and abolishing privileges for functionaries. [Begin recording] I think it is the wrong policy to say we will secure our future social benefits by letting more foreigners enter the country; they are known to have more children than Austrians, and they will finance our social benefits. I have a different opinion. We need fewer foreigners and a sensible family policy so Austrians can afford children and it is not a question of money whether we have children or not. [end recording] Haider also demands self-confidence for Austria's European Union [EU] accession talks. He says the government has submitted a declaration of capitulation in Brussels. [Begin recording] Dr. Mock said we should enter the European Union quickly because the window to Brussels is open. To, so to speak, slip in through the window, then you are in, because it could close again. We have to tell him, we Austrians are self-confident enough to enter a house through the door. Whoever wants to get us in through the window will not get us in. Either they open the door properly, in which case we will enter if we want to, or we will stay out. [end recording] Another issue that is topical for Haider on Ash Wednesday is that of the letter-bomb attacks. He rejects any link between the FPOe and the attacks. And he suspects that those who are to blame are to be found in a different political camp. A confidant of the state police is behind bars as a suspect. And another was arrested in the apartment of a well-known socialist functionary in Vienna, Haider says.
