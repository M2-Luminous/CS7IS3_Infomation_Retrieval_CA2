Tsai] [Text] Taipei, Jan. 15 (CNA) -- The government will do its best to safeguard the safety and property of overseas Chinese in Lesotho in the absence of diplomatic relations between the two countries, officials at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Saturday [15 January]. Taiwan suspended diplomatic ties with Lesotho Wednesday after the Maseru government switched diplomatic recognition to Beijing. Currently, there are about 400 overseas Chinese residing in the southern African kingdom, the officials pointed out, adding that most of them are doing business in garments, groceries, and car repairs. As overseas Chinese have made substantial contributions to Lesotho's economy, their safety and property should not be in jeopardy, the officials said. Meanwhile, they noted, a 17-member agricultural mission previously stationed in Lesotho has withdrawn to neighboring South Africa. The mission had been in the Kingdom since the re-establishment of diplomatic ties between Taiwan and Lesotho in 1990. The farm experts will be assigned to new jobs, they added. Du Ling, director of the ministry's African Affairs Department, left for Lesotho Thursday to deal with the problems resulting from the diplomatic break.
