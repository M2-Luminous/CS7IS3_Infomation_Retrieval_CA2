Firstly, it continues the Russian-Spanish treaty of 1812. Secondly, it establishes legal and political conditions for the implementation of other agreements, including those on the environmental protection, economy, finances, industries and scientific cooperation, which will help to deepen the Russian-Spanish relations. Thirdly, the treaty plans meetings of Russian and Spanish foreign ministers no less than twice a year and a summit no less than once a year. In his turn, Russian President Boris Yeltsin said Russia has had abnormal relations with Spain. Two big nations with huge possibilities had a goods turnover smaller than that with other European states. In his opinion, a reason for this situation was the absence of a fundamental document - the treaty on friendship and cooperation. "The cooperation will now swiftly develop," said Yeltsin. Asked about prospects for signing the Russian agreement on civic accord, the president said he wants the document to be signed on April 28. This idea is basically supported by the leadership of the State Duma, the Federation Council, the government, the majority of parties and public movements. "That is why, I think the majority will sign the document on April 28. Then it will be open for signing to all those wishing," stressed Boris Yeltsin.
