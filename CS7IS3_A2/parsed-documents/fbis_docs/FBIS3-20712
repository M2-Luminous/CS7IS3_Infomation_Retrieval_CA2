Finance Minister Mitja Gaspari presented it at a news conference. Suzana Kos reports: [Begin Kos recording] At today's session, the government finally passed the 1994 budget. The treasury will amount to 402 billion tolars, while the deficit is supposed to be 8.9 billion tolars. The greatest portion of the funds in the treasury -- 373 billion tolars -- will, of course, come from taxes, while 20 billion will come from non-tax sources. The obligations from this year's budget will be 348 billion tolars, while 52 billion will be intended for various investments. Officially, the budget document will reach parliament tomorrow. Next week, the government is also supposed to send a document on the public deficit of the Republic of Slovenia and a report on the financial rehabilitation of commercial banks. Let me quote some other budget figures. The Finance Ministry has the greatest share in budgetary expenditure, amounting to 92 billion tolars. This figure comprises the obligations of the state toward the Pensions' and Disability Fund, the Agency for Construction of Highways, and toward foreign counties. The second greatest share of 86 billion tolars will go to the Labor Ministry, followed by the Defense Ministry, the Ministry of Justice, and other departments. The government was supposed to discuss the problems surrounding our debt to commercial banks again today. However, because Defense Minister Jansa put forward a sort of document at the session, that is to say, proposed new conclusions to resolve this issue, the government will discuss this topic again next week, when it will also study Minister Jansa's new proposals. It is interesting to note that the finance minister did not wish to answer when he was asked whether a repeated debate and confirmation of already agreed conclusions regarding debts toward the commercial banks is really necessary.
