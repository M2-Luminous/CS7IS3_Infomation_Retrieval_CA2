A BAe spokesman said yesterday: "We have been talking to them for years about ways to enlarge the markets for products we have in common" -- though he added that no announcement was expected in the short term. Given the decline in world defence markets and its own financial difficulties of recent years, BAe has been involved in a variety of collaboration attempts with rivals, though most of them have so far failed to succeed. Last year it attempted to bring off joint ventures for its missiles division with France's Matra-Hachette and its regional jet business with Taiwan Aerospace Corporation, both of which collapsed. It also called off merger talks with Britain's GEC [General Electric Company], and in an attempt to slim its portfolio, BAe sold its corporate jets division and construction arm, Ballast Needam, in 1993 and is now selling Rover to BMW for 800 million pounds. A joint venture could strengthen Royal Ordnance, which is still believed to be losing money despite rationalisation. BAe bought the company from the government seven years ago to expand its core defence division. Royal Ordnance makes small arms, ammunition and guns for tanks such as Vickers' Challenger 2. Jack Dromey, National Secretary of the Transport and General Workers Union told last night's BBC Money Programme: "Within Royal Ordnance, in presentations to the trade unions, the company has made it clear that it is talking to European companies -- Giat in particular--on a link-up and also on the production of a European tank."
