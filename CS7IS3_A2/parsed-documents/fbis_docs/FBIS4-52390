As an initial step, the federation sent on Tuesday a fact-finding team to the three Northeastern Chinese Provinces -- Heilongjiang, Liaoning and Jilin -- to determine the feasibility of creating pasture lands there. The team will also sound out the possibility of bringing in the 1.5 million tons of corn South Korea introduces from China annually for use as livestock feeds, directly from China instead of through third countries like Hong Kong as now. Overseas development of pasture lands is needed as there is no room to expand pasturage in the country and hay fodder prices are higher in Korea than those of grain feeds, a federation official said.
