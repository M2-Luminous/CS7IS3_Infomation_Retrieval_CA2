FBIS4-39015 "drsov108_c_94003" FBIS-SOV-94-108 Daily Report 3 Jun 1994 Federal Assembly Federation Council Urged To Agree on Abkhazia Peacekeeping Federation Council Urged To Agree on Abkhazia Peacekeeping LD0306144194 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1320 GMT 3 Jun 94 LD0306144194 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin "is likely to use some form of persuasion on the upper chamber of the Russian parliament in order to force a positive decision on the introduction of Russian peacekeepers into Abkhazia during the second consideration of this problem by the Federation Council," an employee of the presidential administration declared to Interfax Friday. He expressed his supposition saying that the refusal to support the presidential address regarding forces' introduction voiced the day before is "a kind of a gesture, an appeal to the presidential team to develop such documents thoroughly." The employee has no doubts that the majority of the Federation Council understands the need to conduct a peacekeeping operation in Transcaucasus. The second consideration of the issue on introduction of peacekeepers into Abkhazia in the Federation Council is scheduled for June 21. According to an Interfax source, "a slight" delay in the introduction of peacekeepers into Abkhazia "is an unpleasant but not a fatal fact." He does not predict any threat of resumption of a widescale conflict between Georgia and Abkhazia.
