It appears from public statements that Mr Mandela is finding it difficult to contain his impatience and contempt for Mr de Klerk's handling of national affairs. Tension between the leaders stems primarily from a disagreement as to who should dictate the course of action to be taken in the weekly crises that have been occurring during the pre-election period. It was evident two weeks ago during the crisis in Bophuthatswana, and it showed itself again at a press conference in Pretoria on Thursday over the impending crisis in kwaZulu. Mr Mandela made it quite plain two weeks ago that he was not satisfied with the agreement Mr de Klerk obtained from Bophuthatswana's former president, Lucas Mangope, that he would participate in the elections. It did not follow that this implied co-operation in allowing free and fair elections to take place, he said. He was not satisfied, and insisted that IEC [Independent Election Committee] chairman Judge Johann Kriegler be sent to Bophuthatswana to secure these assurances from Mr Mangope. As it turned out, Mr Mandela was right, and his concerns that Mr de Klerk dismissed so confidently were in this case justified. Not only did Mangope start making noises that he would renege on his agreement on participation in the elections, but he could not give satisfaction to Judge Kriegler that he would co-operate with the IEC. The handling of the crisis in kwaZulu has once again drawn the two men together -- to argue and to disagree. On Thursday Mr Mandela and Mr de Klerk could not agree on the course of action to be taken in the violence-ridden homeland. Mr Mandela wanted swift action; Mr de Klerk wanted to hold back a little longer. After the meeting, Mr Mandela referred at great length to the attack that Mr de Klerk made on ANC secretary-general Cyril Ramaphosa, who had called for the TEC [Transitional Executive Council] to replace the kwaZulu government with an administrator. "Unfortunately, Mr de Klerk has not acted like a state president who himself is interested in ensuring that there should be free and fair elections in that province," Mr Mandela said. "He has acted not like a state president but like a petty politician who is concerned with electioneering and is ignoring major national issues facing our country." He also accused Mr de Klerk of refusing to address the question that the kwaZulu government was using state funds to destabilise the elections. "We regard this statement as cheap politicking, and it is for that reason that I think the people of South Africa are determined to throw out the National Party in the elections," Mr Mandela said. "I am completely disgusted," he continued. "I have refrained from handling matters in a way that will complicate Mr de Klerk's own problems. I don't get a similar response and cooperation from him. I totally condemn the manner in which he is handling national issues." Mr de Klerk has not responded to this latest attack.
