FBIS3-1802 "drchi041_d_94004" FBIS-CHI-94-041 Document Type:Daily Report 2 Mar 1994 Northeast Asia Deng Reportedly Urges Officials To Support DPRK Reform OW0203074894 Tokyo KYODO in English 0717 GMT 2 Mar 94 OW0203074894 Tokyo KYODO Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Seoul, March 2 KYODO -- China's veteran leader Deng Xiaoping has instructed Chinese policy makers to fully support North Korea's economic reform policy and realize President Kim Il-song's visit to China, a diplomatic source said Wednesday [2 March]. The source said Deng issued the call after he received a briefing on North Korea from Ding Guangen, a Politburo member of the Chinese Communist Party. Ding has met Hwang Chang-yop, a North Korean parliamentary committee chairman, who made a trip to China leading a five-member delegation in January. During his stay in China from January 15 to 23, Hwang discussed with Chinese leaders Pyongyang's economic policy and Kim's planned visit to China, the source said. In a meeting with Ding, Hwang, who is chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of North Korea's Supreme People's Assembly and in charge of relations with China and the United States, conveyed North Korea's intention to adopt a Chinese-style open economic policy. North Korea announced in 1991 a plan to set up free economic zones in Nachin and Sonpong, in the northeastern part of the country, as part of a Tumen river development program. North Korea made a rare and candid admission early in December that the country is in serious economic difficulties and carried out a leadership reshuffle in an apparent move to revitalize its economy. "The targets of the total scope of industrial output and some major indices including electric power, steel and chemical fiber envisaged in the third seven-year plan failed to be attained due to international events and the acute situation created in (North) Korea," Pyongyang's official KOREAN CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY (KCNA) reported. Seoul's YONHAP NEWS AGENCY reported in mid-January in a dispatch from Beijing that Kim plans to visit China for in-depth talks with Chinese leaders over the situation on the Korean peninsula and possible favorable moves in connection with North Korea's alleged nuclear weapons program. YONHAP quoted Western sources as saying Kim's visit to China, expected soon, is being discussed through diplomatic channels and China has reacted positively to the move. Hwang surfaced as a core member of the North Korean power hierarchy during the December session of the Supreme People's Assembly, along with Kim Il-song's brother Kim Yong-chu.
