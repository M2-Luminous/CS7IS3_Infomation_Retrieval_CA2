While the ultimatum given by the NATO Council to the belligerent sides expires on 21 February, negotiations between Bosnian Serbs and Muslims in Geneva have not seen any positive results. According to the press center of the Ukrainian World Coordinating Council, there are two approaches in Ukraine towards the Sarajevo bombing. The first one is to support the international community, which seems inclined to resort to violent measures to stop the conflict; and second, to support Russia -- openly sympathetic with Serbia and intent on delaying any forced outcome. Here is how Ivan Drach, chairman of the Ukrainian World Coordinating Council, commented on this issue: I would say that the truth is somewhere in between these two stances. All those events affect the interests of Ukraine, ethnic Ukrainians living there, and Ukrainian soldiers serving in peacekeeping battalions stationed in that region. Given the above factors, let me say that our position should be well balanced. The shelling of Sarajevo is, so far, a sort of intimidating action, and not a combat operation yet. Both sides were offered one more chance for reconciliation. After all, the bombing threatens to become another spiral in the escalation of violence. This time, Serbian President Milosevic threatens all of Europe, saying that he cannot guarantee the security of UN peacekeeping forces after any air strikes. This should make all those who assumed the peacekeeping mission think twice before deciding on this serious move.
