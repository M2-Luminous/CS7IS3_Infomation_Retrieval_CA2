FR940118-2-00082 FR940118-2-00050 (C) The interests of the Plan for all purposes under the Lease are represented by an independent fiduciary, Norwest Bank South Dakota, N.A.; and (D) The rent paid by the Employer under the Lease is no less than the fair market rental value of the Property. EFFECTIVE DATE: This exemption, if granted, will be effective as of January 1, 1994. Summary of Facts and Representations 1. The Plan is a profit sharing plan with 35 participants and total assets of approximately $6,492,809 as of December 1, 1993. The Plan is maintained by the Employer, which is a South Dakota general partnership engaged in the practice of law in Rapid City, South Dakota. Investment discretion over the assets of the Plan is exercised by the Plan's three named fiduciaries: Thomas H. Foye, Charles L. Riter, and Patrick K. Duffy, each of whom is a partner in the Employer. The Plan's assets are held in trust by the Norwest Bank South Dakota, N.A. (the Trustee), which was formerly named Norwest Capital Management and Trust Company. The Trustee represents that aside from its function as Trustee, it is independent of the Employer, although the Employer has deposits in, and a current installment loan with, the Trustee's commercial department totalling substantially less than one percent of the total deposits and total loans of its commercial department. Additionally, the Trustee states that the Employer performs professional services for the Trustee, and that total fees paid by the Trustee to the Employer for such services constitute less than one percent of the Employer's gross income. 2. Among the assets of the Plan is the Property, a parcel of improved real property which constitutes the Employer's principal place of business. The Property is located in downtown Rapid City, South Dakota and is improved with a two-story brick office building (the Building) containing approximately 9,600 square feet of office space. The Employer has leased the Property from the Plan under a triple net lease (the Prior Lease) with a term of ten years commencing January 1, 1984 and ending December 31, 1993. The Employer's lease of the Property from the Plan under the Prior Lease was exempt from the prohibitions of section 406 of the Act and section 4975(c) of the Code by virtue of an individual administrative exemption, Prohibited Transaction Exemption 83&hyph;172 (PTE 83&hyph;172, 48 FR 48880, October 21, 1983). 5 The interests of the Plan for all purposes under the Prior Lease were represented by the Trustee, which served to monitor, on behalf of the Plan, the performance of the Employer under the Prior Lease, and to represent the Plan in the enforcement of its terms and conditions. The Trustee represents that the Employer occupied the Property in compliance with all terms and conditions of the Prior Lease for its duration. The Prior Lease expired on December 31, 1993. 5 A proposed amendment to the Prior Lease was the subject of an additional individual administrative exemption, PTE 86&hyph;113 (51 FR 32556, September 12, 1986), involving the proposed construction of an addition to the Building and its proposed purchase by the Plan. The Employer represents that the subject amendment to the Prior Lease was never consummated because the Employer chose not to construct the addition to the Building. 3. Because the Plan's lease of the Property to the Employer continues to constitute a favorable Plan investment, providing the Plan with a good rate of return under protective arrangements, and because it continues to constitute an advantageous arrangement for the Employer, the Trustee and the Employer desired that the Plan continue leasing the Property to the Employer after December 31, 1993, under substantially the same conditions as those of the Prior Lease. Accordingly, the Trustee and the Employer have agreed to a new lease (the New Lease), effective January 1, 1994, which provides for the Plan's continued lease of the Property to the Employer, and they are requesting an exemption for the New Lease under the terms and conditions described herein. 4. The New Lease is a triple net lease for a term of ten years commencing January 1, 1994 and ending December 31, 2003. The interests of the Plan under the New Lease for all purposes are represented by the Trustee. The annual rental under the New Lease is payable in equal monthly installments. Initial rental under the New Lease is $6,000 per month, which is the fair market rental value of the Property as of the commencement of the New Lease, as determined by Richard Kahler (Kahler), a professional real property appraiser in Rapid City, South Dakota. The amount of annual rental paid under the New Lease will be reevaluated every year by the Trustee, and will be increased in accordance with any increases in the Property's fair market rental value, as determined by the Trustee. In no event will the annual rental be decreased under the New Lease. On the fifth anniversary of the New Lease, the Trustee will provide for a new appraisal of the Property and its fair market rental value by an independent professional real estate appraiser of the Trustee's choice. The New Lease requires the Employer to pay all repair and maintenance costs of the Property except with respect to necessary major capital improvements to the Building, its roof, or its electrical, heating, cooling or plumbing systems in excess of $5,000 in any calendar year. Any such excess over $5,000 will be the responsibility of the Plan. The New Lease requires the Employer to pay all real estate taxes on the Property and to carry fire, extended coverage, and public liability insurance on the Property in amounts acceptable to the Trustee with the Plan as the named insured. Under the New Lease the Employer will indemnify and hold the Plan harmless from all penalties, claims demands, liabilities, expenses and losses of any nature arising from the Employer's use of the Property. 5. The Trustee, which represents the Plan for all purposes under the New Lease, will monitor on behalf of the Plan the Employer's performance under the New Lease and will represent the Plan in the enforcement of its terms and conditions. The Trustee represents that it has reviewed and evaluated the Plan's continued lease of the Property to the Employer under the New Lease and has determined that it is in the best interests of the participants and beneficiaries of the Plan. Specifically, the Trustee states that the Employer has proven to be a successful, reliable tenant of the Property and that the Property constitutes the best and most highly productive of all Plan asset investments. The Property was appraised for its fair market value as of December 1, 1993 by Kahler, who represents that as of that date the Property had a fair market value of $607,500. 6. In summary, the applicants represent that the subject transaction satisfies the criteria of section 408(a) of the Act for the following reasons: (1) The New Lease is a triple net lease requiring the Employer to pay costs of repair and maintenance and all taxes and insurance on the Property; (2) The interests of the Plan under the New Lease are represented by the Trustee, an independent fiduciary which will monitor and enforce the Employer's performance under the New Lease; (3) The New Lease ensures that the rental payments will remain no less than the fair market rental value of the Property for the duration of the New Lease; and (4) The Trustee has reviewed the Plan's continued lease of the Property to the Employer under the New Lease and has determined that it is a highly desirable investment for the Plan.
