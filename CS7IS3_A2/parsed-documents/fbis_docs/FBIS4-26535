It belongs to the Panjiang Administration of Mines. The mine is designed to produce 1.8 million tons of coal a year. It is expected to go into production within five years. The cost of creating the mine will reach 500 million yuan (57 million U.S. dollars). Fan Jinsheng, an official of the Department of Coal Production of Guizhou provincial government, said that Jinjia Mine, at the junction of the two provinces of Guizhou and Yunnan and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, will help provide power and industrial raw materials to a large number of backbone enterprises in south-west China. It will thus play an important role in the economic development of Guizhou Province and even of the whole south-west China area. He said that Guizhou is rich in coal resources. The verified reserves of coal deposits amount to 50 billion tons, making the province top among the nine provinces and autonomous regions south of the Chang Jiang river. The province now produces 45 million tons of coal a year and provides a dozen provinces and autonomous regions with coal and electricity.
