In a communique sent to AFP in Libreville today, the UDDS stressed that issues to be discussed at the talks should include the formulation of laws on the press, unions, associations, the establishment of a human rights charter, as well as the access of all parties to state media. The UDDS says it is "ready to negotiate directly and unconditionally" with President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo or his representatives "in order to end the country's sociopolitical crisis." Municipal elections are scheduled to be held by the end of the year. To this end, a delegation led by a senior civil servant in charge of elections at the Spanish Interior Ministry, Miguel Angel Abat, recently visited Malabo to assist the authorities with electoral code reforms and electoral census, reliable sources in Libreville have disclosed.
