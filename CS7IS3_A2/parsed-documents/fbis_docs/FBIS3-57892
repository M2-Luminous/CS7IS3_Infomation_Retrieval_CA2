I believe this reflects the very fruitful cooperation of past Greek Presidencies with the European Commission. Together we have solved many problems. I will not list them now but I will remind you of the joint funds, the term cohesion and its meaning, and the Mediterranean programs. These are not the only issues. We have worked closely with common goals and we have succeeded. We hope this Presidency will develop in the same way. Cooperating closely with you, we will proceed to lay another foundation stone in building the European Union [EU]. We are assuming the Presidency at a very difficult time for the world, Europe in particular. There is major recession and we cannot see its end on the horizon, at least not on the near horizon. A large part of the workforce is unemployed. There is recession and unemployment. We are called upon to deal with these problems at a period when economy has become a universal problem, when economic borders among states are collapsing fast and technology is racing forward. This is why the latest EU summit in Brussels, which approved Jacques Delors' white paper, is a great historical step. For the first time, employment--apart from the prominent monetary and symbolic goals--becomes a primary issue for a united Europe, focusing on reducing unemployment and increasing competitiveness. Delors' contribution is great, leading us to believe that the 1996 intergovernment conference will openly and clearly include employment and development in the Maastricht Treaty. Indisputably, the two goals--competitiveness and employment--are often contradictory. The measures that are often adopted to increase competitiveness can harm employment. I believe our own effort should focus on improving competitiveness without reducing or losing the achievements of the working class in Europe. When there is a contradiction, we must consider that the workforce alone cannot pay for competitiveness. I close my short welcoming statement by saying it is a special honor for us to host European Commission President Delors, whose contribution to a united Europe's course remains decisive. It is with great pleasure that I raise my glass to you and your associates and wish you every success. [Delors] Prime Minister, Dignitaries, Ladies and Gentlemen, first, allow me to thank you for your most friendly and warm welcome to me and my European Commission colleagues. I would like to make a friendly statement to the Greek people, who are full EU members, never mind what you may read here and there. The European structure surely represents a very ambitious plan. The European people show many differences and have special characteristics. Europe is rich in differences and characteristics. Prime Minister, we will cooperate with the Greek Presidency and the Greek Government--as we did in the past--to serve the goals you have set out. The European structure has reached its 37th year. It is a unique attempt to unite sovereign peoples who have chosen this road without any of the members being sovereign or in charge and is happening at a time that is free of the Cold War's limitations or fears. Prime Minister, as you have stressed, Europe is going through the worst recession since World War II. Along with the other goals of the Maastricht Treaty, Europe wants to give the European people the right and the dignity of work, the right to employment. The European Commission submitted and presented the white paper; no member is forced to follow it closely. But the principle of assistance will be implemented everywhere. Every member state will implement its own rules keeping in mind the principle of assistance. Every member state will be based on the strong points and try to overcome any weaknesses. So, Prime Minister, I would like to thank you and assure you that we will cooperate as effectively as possible. The world has changed. The world has moved faster than us. But, thanks to recent efforts, we are now in the pleasant position of watching the developing countries on the road to prosperity. We see the South approaching the North's level of prosperity and living conditions. But we must not let this go unexploited. We must continue our efforts, because everyone must deal with the fear and danger of decay. We must now deal with problems caused by refusal to talk and by intolerance. As you have very correctly stressed, Prime Minister, this economic effort should lead us to new efforts. We must show even more courage and anticipation. This spirit must prevail in all our efforts. Greece's geopolitical position is particularly useful in this. Because of you, Prime Minister, we can become more familiar with today's Europe. I raise my glass and thank you and Mrs. Papandreou and wish the Greek Presidency every success.
