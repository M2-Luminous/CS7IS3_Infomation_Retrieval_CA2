Here is our reporter Saibou Yara Nyandou with a live report. [Nyandou] Indeed, they all turned up this morning and exchanged accolades with their colleagues of the majority. They have returned to the parliamentary family. By they, I mean: Hama Amadou, Afara Djika, Moutari Moussa, Ila Kane, Amadou Boukari, and others among the 33 parliamentary opposition members. A little over two and a half months ago, during the roll call, our eyes turned to their empty seats. However, since 28 May, following the announcement of their return, we have had the certainty that they will stay, work, and participate in the present and future sessions for the triumph of democracy and the consolidation of the gains made so far.
