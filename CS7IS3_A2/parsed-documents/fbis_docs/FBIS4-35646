This was to settle the old accounts of the Gulf war in reply to the Yemeni's pan-Arab position and to teach the Yemeni leadership a hard lesson for its pan-Arab role in the Mother of Battles. When Yemen joined the Arab Cooperation Council, certain Gulf states were outraged because they considered it the backyard of the Gulf and the Roman theater in which they watch the rivers of blood flow to kill their boredom of money and oil. Since the Gulf War ended, the United Stats has been hatching conspiracies to destroy the pan-Arab flame in Yemen and place its shores and Bab el-Mandeb under U.S. control to complete the occupation of the entire Arabian Peninsula and its long shores. The UN Security Council's intervention in a domestic affair without the request of the responsible Yemeni party also comes to avenge the Jordanian stands, which certain Gulf states still abhor because of, first, Jordan's fostering of the Arab Cooperation Council; second, its rational position in the Gulf war; and, third, its honorable mediation to spare Yemeni blood. The new imperialist conspiracy did not stop at fragmenting Yemen's unity, isolating it, and pushing it into the quagmire of a long civil war. It went beyond that to the objective of aborting the Jordanian mediation and destroying its plan for pan-Arab renaissance -- the Arab Cooperation Council, as well as destroying the effective Yemeni role in that Council. The more important objective of the conspiracy was to curb the Jordanian role and prevent it from contributing to the pan-Arab renaissance because the Arab Cooperation Council plan -- which certain Gulf states viewed as a challenge and an axis hostile to their dreams and encroachment on their influence zones, primarily Yemen -- was about to shatter the hopes of the U.S. imperialism to impose control on the Gulf. To avenge that position, certain Gulf states, acted quickly to complicate matters and push the situation in Yemen to a dead end. They used in the process certain Yemeni stooges to implement their conspiracy, with promises that they will be put in control if they implement their policies. We denounce the UN Security Council's intervention in Yemen's internal affairs. We know in advance that any Arab subject that enters the Security Council will come out of it more complicated because the Security Council will not put things in the proper context and will, instead, complicate the problem, knowing that behind every Arab sedition there are American hands. The Yemeni issue remains of concern to the legitimate Yemeni leadership and any foreign intervention in rejected. The Yemeni people will reject any Yemeni party that throws itself into the lap of U.S. imperialism to impose on its people a position that runs counter to their national aspirations. The Yemeni people have always been invulnerable to attempt at containment or hegemony and have crushed all conspiracies aimed at colonizing them and subjugating them to foreign hegemony. We urge the Yemeni people and leadership to deny the conspirators every opportunity and to adhere to Yemen unity. We also urge them to utilize every chance for dialogue in order to foil the evil conspiracies and abort the big sedition.
