The programme will be submitted for debate and evaluation to the Government Economic Committee (KERM). According to CUP President Miroslaw Pietrewicz who unveiled the main assumptions of the programme at a press conference here Thursday, the proposed scenario is ambitious but can be implemented, given social support for it. The plan calls for creating 1.2 million new jobs. This will mean a drop in unemployment by some 600,000 from the present 3 million. The plan can be implemented only if Poland continues along the path of sustained economic growth which began some 18 months ago, Pietrewicz noted. Growth requires larger investments, savings and exports. The success of the programme also hinges on external conditions, chiefly the rate of economic growth in Western Europe which influences the volume of imports from Poland. "The starting point for the programme is not easy," CUP president observed and added that the Polish economic situation was still difficult.
