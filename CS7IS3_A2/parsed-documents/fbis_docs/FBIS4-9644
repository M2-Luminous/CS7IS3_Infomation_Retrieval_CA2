Earlier, Ioan Solcanu (from the PDSR) speculated that the dialogue was in danger of breaking up because of some statements of Adrian Severin (from the PD). The leader of the PDSR delegation [Solcanu] told Nord-Est Presse: "We must be restrained." Solcanu was restrained only with the representatives of the press who were impatiently waiting for the end of the discussions. There was also a desire to formulate the intentions of the PDSR in less vague terms. Adrian Severin stated clearly that the failure to state these intentions in concrete form would lead to the cancellation of the discussions set for 20 April. Here are the statements of the leaders of the delegations: Adrian Severin, deputy chairman of the Democratic Party: ``It seems to us that we should have a round of discussions so that we can find out how things will be going from now on. We have agreed on some steps to be taken in the immediate future, but, I would like to express, at the very beginning, my concern about a certain impasse in regard to the capacity of this discussion to produce anything concrete. ``We decided that, prior to the next meeting, we must receive a very concrete response to the proposal for an agreement on political conduct (presented by the PD). Today we proposed the creation of six joint working groups, which would eventually be open to other parties in the opposition. There would be a group that would draw up a list of legislative priorities; a group analyzing situations in which the lack of independence of the judiciary is noted; a group that will analyze situations in which abuses or irregularities are noted in local administration; another group that would treat the issues of the politicization of economic agencies--making leadership positions in such organizations dependent upon party membership and the establishment of party organizations in enterprises and institutions. There is also a group that aims at the isolation of extremist parties and intolerant, xenophobic, and anti-Semitic movements. ``This is the concrete package of proposals that we made and to which we expect a response. We have also received a draft plan for parliamentary collaboration to which we will respond. Basically, this plan does not upset us. On the contrary, it is very welcome. But we cannot agree that the laws on reform should pass with only the votes of the PD and the CDR [Romanian Democratic Convention], while the laws on restoration should pass with the assistance of the four parties that constitute the parliamentary majority, along with the PDSR. ``We also decided that, by the next meeting, each one of us would present a precise list of subjects related to a political pact and a pact on the management of the economy. The PD believes that these are preliminary moves in preparation for many discussions with the CDR, for the real restructuring of the current parliamentary majority. "We are asking the PDSR to clearly state its views in regard to this possibility, even though we understand that some of the representatives of this party are afraid of losing the bird in the hand for two in the bush. We are alarmed by a certain lack of decision, an inability `to cross the Rubicon,' `to cut the Gordian knot,' lack of decision on the part of the PDSR, which slows things down. It is obvious that if we do not obtain anything concrete we will have to break off the negotiations set for the end of April." Eugen Dijmarescu, Democratic Party senator: "The expectations were not too great for the fourth meeting but they were greater than what we achieved. I would say, in fact, that we achieved very little--actually, another postponement, when, in my opinion--a few months after the Democratic Party had put a draft national pact on the table and the PDSR had presented an alternative formula--the premises existed for moving on to the discussion of the main ideas which could lead to a document which we would offer as an opening to other political forces, with a view to the restructuring of the parliamentary majority. The PDSR came up with a proposal on the achievement of an agreement on parliamentary cooperation between the two parties, with more limited point-by-point objectives compared to the national pact. Unfortunately, the PDSR presented it late, the night before the meeting, making it impossible to have a thorough discussion and to put it in a form in which it could be signed quickly. Therefore, we proposed that both parties reexamine both documents more carefully, that they also reach an agreement on their behavior, with a moratorium on agression and, possibly, set up joint working groups on matters related to reform and all that the transition signifies." Ioan Solcanu, deputy chairman of the PDSR: ``It was a meeting at which we evaluated the status of consultations between the two parties and we agreed that we should go beyond the listing of theoretical possibilities and take concrete steps. Therefore, we presented a draft of a political pact which is certainly subject to improvement. This is why we presented it in this form. It would have taken some time to discuss the draft at the current session since we are not in agreement about the stage at which the respective draft was drawn up. We decided that this possibility of drawing up principles and subject matter for a draft of a political accord and a draft plan for economic management would be on the agenda for a future meeting between the two parties. Also, the PDSR presented a document on an agreement on parliamentary collaboration and the PD presented a draft agreement on political conduct. "We agreed that the point-by-point development of the two documents presented by the two parties would be on the agenda for the next meeting."
