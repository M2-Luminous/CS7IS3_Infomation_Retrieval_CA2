FR940413-0-00054 FR940413-0-00019 40 CFR Part 721 [OPPTS&hyph;50583G; FRL&hyph;4746&hyph;2] Phosphorylated Oxoheteromonocycle Polyoxyethylene Alkyl Ether; Phosphorylated Caprolactone, Alkyl Oxoheteromonocycle and Polyalkylene Polyol Alkyl Ether; Revocation of Significant New Use Rule AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: EPA is revoking a significant new use rule (SNUR) promulgated under section 5(a)(2) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) for phosphorylated oxoheteromonocycle polyoxyethylene alkyl ether and phosphorylated caprolactone, alkyl oxoheteromonocycle and polyalkene polyol alkyl ether, based on receipt of new data. The data indicate that the substances will not present an unreasonable risk to health. EFFECTIVE DATE: The effective date of this rule is May 13, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Susan B. Hazen, Director, Environmental Assistance Division (7408), Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics, Environmental Protection Agency, Rm. E&hyph;543A, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460, Telephone: (202) 554&hyph;1404, TDD: (202) 554&hyph;0551. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the Federal Register of August 9, 1990 (55 FR 32406), EPA issued two SNURs establishing significant new uses for phosphorylated oxoheteromonocycle polyoxyethylene alkyl ether (P&hyph;89&hyph;836) and phosphorylated caprolactone, alkyl oxoheteromonocycle and polyalkylene polyol alkyl ether (P&hyph;89&hyph;837). Because of additional data EPA has received for these substances, EPA is revoking the SNUR. I. Background The Agency proposed the revocation of the SNUR for these substances in the Federal Register of September 29, 1993 (58 FR 50895). The background and reasons for the revocation of the SNURs are set forth in the preamble to the proposed revocation. The Agency received no public comment concerning the proposed revocation. As a result EPA is revoking the SNUR. II. Background and Rationale for Revocation of the Rule During review of the PMNs submitted for the chemical substances that are the subject of this revocation, EPA concluded that regulation was warranted under section 5(e) of TSCA pending the development of information sufficient to make a reasoned evaluation of the health effects of the substances, and EPA identified the tests considered necessary to evaluate the risks of the substances. The basis for such findings is referenced in Unit I. of this preamble. Based on these findings, a section 5(e) consent order was negotiated with the PMN submitter and a SNUR was promulgated. EPA reviewed testing conducted by the PMN submitter for the substances and determined that the information available was sufficient to make a reasoned evaluation of the health effects of the substances. EPA concluded that, for the purposes of TSCA section 5, the substances will not present an unreasonable risk and subsequently revoked the section 5(e) consent order. The revocation of SNUR provisions for the substances designated herein is consistent with the revocation of the section 5(e) order. In light of the above, EPA is revoking SNUR provisions for these chemical substances. When this revocation becomes final, EPA will no longer require notice of any company's intent to manufacture, import, or process these substances. In addition, export notification under section 12(b) of TSCA will no longer be required. III. Rulemaking Record The record for the rules which EPA is revoking was established at OPPTS&hyph;50583 (P&hyph;89&hyph;836 and P&hyph;89&hyph;837). This record includes information considered by the Agency in developing these rules and includes the test data that formed the basis for this revocation. IV. Regulatory Assessment Requirements EPA is revoking the requirements of this rule. Any costs or burdens associated with this rule will also be eliminated when the rule is revoked. Therefore, EPA finds that no costs or burdens must be assessed under Executive Order 12866, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), or the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ).
