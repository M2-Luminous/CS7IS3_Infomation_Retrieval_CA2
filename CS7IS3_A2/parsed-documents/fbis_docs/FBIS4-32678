These are the final talks with all the sides that are involved in the Bosnia-Herzegovina war in order to find ways for progress and peace, and to prepare for the meeting of the G-7 and Russia in two weeks time in Naples, Minister Martino said. The talks with President Milosevic were cordial and very instructive. I am an optimist when it comes to the future. I think that we should overcome the disorder of the present and the historical roots of the conflict, and turn to the future and its promises. I think, Minister Martino said, that peace is essential for the prosperity of this region and these countries, as well as for the entire Europe. I was happy to hear what President Milosevic had to say and to draw conclusions from his views, Minister Martino said. This is how FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] Foreign Minister Jovanovic assessed the talks between Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and Italian Foreign Minister Martino: [Jovanovic] I will go along with what the minister said about the talks being cordial and substantive, and that they showed that both sides are very interested in reaching peace as soon as possible, and in the removal of all the artificial obstacles that thwart the efforts for reaching peace even before the latest efforts. [sentence as heard] We are particularly encouraged by the fact that the new Italian Government is going to intensify its activities in the process, and do everything it can to mark the departure from the policy of double standards so that a principled approach is formed toward the Yugoslav crisis. A principled approach is the only one that can lead to peace. The talks about all the aspects of the Yugoslav crisis show the common concern for peace, and the readiness of both sides to contribute to a positive solution for Bosnia [words indistinct]. We believe that -- together with Italy as the most important neighboring country -- we will find ways for developing a constructive cooperation and continuing political contacts.
