Permission to make the letter public was given by his successor. The Foreign Ministry said Israel firmly insisted that the Palestinian autonomy institutions be situated in Jericho and not in Jerusalem, but made it clear that there would not be any change in the status of the Palestinian inhabitants. Foreign Minister Peres acted with the knowledge of the prime minister, and that is very important for relations between the two and for responsibility, for at least the information fiasco. The letter says: I wish to confirm that the Palestinian institutions in East Jerusalem and the affairs and welfare of the Palestinians in East Jerusalem are very important, and will be upheld. Therefore, all the Palestinian institutions in East Jerusalem -- economic, social, educational, and cultural -- and the Christian and Muslim holy places fulfill a vital function for the Palestinian population. There is no need to say we will not intervene with their activities. Yours sincerely, Shim'on Peres. That is the letter. It is still not clear whether that is all there is. I must say that several days ago.... [Ahime'ir, interrupting] But we just saw the letter, and you read out the translation. What do you mean when you say it is not clear if that is all there is? Is that the letter or not? [Sukenik] That is the letter. The question is whether there is more, why Israel admitted to a letter only three weeks after 'Arafat divulged the fact that he has a letter on Jerusalem, no matter how innocent it is. Shim'on Peres and others -- including Rabin in the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee several days after the letter's existence became known -- said that there are no secret annexes to the accord with the Palestinians. In other words, they say this is not an annex to the accord, but a knowledgeable Foreign Ministry source told me that it is an accompanying letter -- to what? Not to my mortgage--apparently to the agreements with the Palestinians. [Ahime'ir] Gadi, do you suspect there might be other documents? [Sukenik] I do fear that because of the fact that it was held up for weeks and the fact that we were told it contains only a quote from Peres' Knesset speech. By the way, there is another letter translated into Hebrew -- I will not show it to the camera now -- which contains quotes from Peres' speech to the Knesset, but Faysal al-Husayni spoke about other understandings on Jerusalem made in February, and in the wake of this whole circus, it is not clear if that is all there is. There is no doubt that in the best circumstances, Rabin and Peres have lost a lot of points in their battle for credibility. We are going to have a national referendum, at least on the Golan Heights, and this creates a big problem.
