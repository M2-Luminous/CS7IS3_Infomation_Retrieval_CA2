SUMMARY: Public notice is hereby given in accordance with the provision of Section 1413 of the Safe Drinking Water Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 300f et seq ., and 40 CFR part 142, subpart B, the National Primary Drinking Water Regulations (NPDWR), that the State of Michigan is revising its approved Public Water System Supervision (PWSS) primacy program. The Michigan Department of Public Health (MDPH), has adopted drinking water regulations for 27 synthetic organic chemicals and 8 inorganic chemicals that correspond to the NPDWR for synthetic organic chemicals and inorganic chemicals promulgated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) on January 30, 1991, (56 FR 3526&hyph;3597) and, as amended on July 1, 1991, (56 FR 30266&hyph;30281). The U.S. EPA has completed its review of Michigan's PWSS primacy program revision. The U.S. EPA has determined that the Michigan rule revision meets the requirements of the Federal rule. Therefore, the U.S. EPA is proposing to approve the MDPH's rule revision. All interested parties are invited to submit written comments on these proposed determinations, and may request a public hearing on or before May 6, 1994. If a public hearing is requested and granted, the corresponding determination shall not become effective until such time following the hearing, at which the Regional Administrator issues an order affirming or rescinding this action. Requests for public hearing should be addressed to: Jennifer Kurtz Crooks (WD&hyph;17J), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 5, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois 60604. Any request for a public hearing shall include the following: (1) The name, address, and telephone number of the individual, organization, or other entity requesting a hearing.

(3) The signature of the individual making the request; or, if the request is made on behalf of an organization or other entity, the signature of a responsible official of the organization or other entity. Notice of any hearing shall be given not less than fifteen (15) days prior to the time scheduled for the hearing. Such notice will be made by the Regional Administrator in the Federal Register and in newspapers of general circulation in the State of Michigan. A notice will be sent to the person(s) requesting the hearing as well as to the State of Michigan. The hearing notice will include a statement of purpose, information regarding the time and location, and the address and telephone number where interested persons may obtain further information. The Regional Administrator will issue an order affirming or rescinding his determination upon review of the hearing record. Should the determination be affirmed, it will become effective as of the date of the order. Should no timely and appropriate request for a hearing be received, and should the Regional Administrator not elect to hold a hearing on his own motion, these determinations shall become effective on May 6, 1994.
