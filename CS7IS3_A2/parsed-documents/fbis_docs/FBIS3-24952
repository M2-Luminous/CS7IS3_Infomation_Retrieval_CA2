Babcock Construction contractors will assist Hyundai with on-site construction. At the signing Hannes Botha, managing director of Sasol synthetic fuels, said the installation of this reactor was a step toward producing synthetic oil more cost effectively than at present. "The new technology used in the SAS reactor is more energy efficient, requires lower capital investment and needs less maintenance than the proven synthol technology. Sasol is always looking for ways to improve its cost competitiveness and it is foreseen that this new addition will contribute toward this purpose," Mr Botha said. Mr N. K. Kim, regional director of Hyuandai in South Africa, said his company accepted the challenge for the manufacture of the SAS reactor, which uses the latest technology for the production of oil from gas. The reactor will weigh 840 [metric] tons and is too large to be transported as a unit from Korea to Sasol Two. Parts of the reactor, some of them weighing 300 [metric] tons, will be shipped to Richards Bay and transported by road from there to Secunda. Assembly will take place at the construction site. Sophisticated welding techniques will be used for the closing seams under difficult site conditions. A set of complex steam coils weighing 240 [metric] tons will be installed inside the reactor. The coils will be shipped from Korea in sections and will be assembled on site. When construction is complete a hydro test will be done requiring 1.7-million litres of water. The commissioning of the plant is planned in September 1995 and will increase the gas utilisation at the Secunda complex. The reactor will have a capacity greater than each of the existing circulating fluid bed reactors and requires much less capital to erect. Sastech was appointed as managing contractor after completion of a research and development project to establish an alternative reactor technology. In 1991 the team of Sastech scientists and process engineers was awarded the Bille Neale-May gold medal by the South African Institute of Chemical Engineers as well as the national award of the Associated Scientific and Technical Societies of South Africa for developing, designing and commissioning the prototype of the new reactor. The contract for the detail engineering and design was awarded to Raytheon engineers and constructors of Boston, USA.
