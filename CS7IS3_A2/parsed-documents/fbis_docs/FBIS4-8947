Despite great potential in food production, Yugoslavia would have to import some 100,000 tonnes of sugar, some 400 million liters of milk, 50,000 tonnes of potatoes and 20,000 tones of beans, said Ivko Djonovic, Serbian agriculture minister in an interview to Belgrade's daily BORBA Monday. In this way, Djonovic denied assessments by federal government experts that farmers would this year secure enough food to satisfy the needs of the Yugoslav population. Yugoslav farmers have prior to the introduction of the sanctions exported all currently deficient articles. Thus, Yugoslav sugar factories earned 300 million dollars annually from sugar exports, said Djonovic. Market surpluses, in his view, could be expected in basic cultures such as grain and maize. Experts assessed that some 2.5 million tonnes of grain would this year be reaped in Serbia. Yugoslavia's overall needs may be met with 1.5 million tonnes. Apart from its population of 10.4 million, more than 500,000 officially registered refugees from the former Yugoslav republics, were a cause for concern.
