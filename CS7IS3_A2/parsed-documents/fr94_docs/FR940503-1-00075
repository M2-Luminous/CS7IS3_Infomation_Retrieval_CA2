The Volume Limitation on Use of Individual Refinery Baselines An importer's use of a foreign refinery's individual baseline is proposed to be limited to volumes of reformulated gasoline equivalent to the foreign refinery's 1990 volume of gasoline imports to the U.S. This volume constraint is described above. The volume cap limiting use of an individual baseline for reformulated gasoline production (until January 1, 1998) to a foreign refiner's 1990 import volumes ensures that the use of an individual baseline is constrained by historical import volumes. Volumes imported above the 1990 constraint would be subject to the importer's statutory baseline. Foreign-produced reformulated gasoline subject to an individual baseline, within the 1990 volume cap limitation, would be measured for compliance against gasoline produced in 1990, and therefore would be at least as clean as the foreign refiner's 1990 gasoline. However, any reformulated gasoline produced by a foreign refiner above the 1990 volume would be evaluated relative to the statutory baseline and therefore would be at least as clean as reformulated gasoline produced using the statutory baseline. 2. The Time Limitation on the Use of Individual Foreign Refinery Baselines A further constraint on potential adverse air quality effects is the time limit on an importer's use of a foreign refiner's individual baseline. It would be limited to the period commencing when reformulated gasoline is first imported into the U.S. and continues through December 31, 1997. After 1997, individual baselines have no further relevance to the requirements for reformulated gasoline, and all importers and domestic refiners are required by the Final Rule to measure compliance with the reformulated gasoline standards against the statutory baseline. Therefore, the effect of this regulation would be limited to this three year period only. 3. The Number of Foreign Refiners Who Would Seek to Use Individual Foreign Refinery Baselines Would be Limited This proposal is predicated on the assumption that the costs inherent in producing reformulated gasoline and meeting the requirements of the reformulated gasoline program, including those costs necessary to establish an individual baseline, will deter most foreign refiners from selecting the individual baseline option, thereby further limiting any potential adverse air quality impact. These costs include extensive refinery modifications; costs associated with petitioning EPA for an individual baseline and providing adequate information to establish with certainty that the baseline determination is accurate; a baseline audit; and the record keeping and product tracking associated with complying with the proposed annual compliance audits. EPA believes that few refiners have made the requisite capital investments necessary to produce reformulated gasoline. Therefore, it currently appears that the number of foreign refiners who would take advantage of this proposed amendment would be limited. In addition, the limited time period during which individual foreign refinery baselines could be used may limit the number of foreign refiners that would take advantage of this option, because the costs associated with exercising this option described above, could only be recouped within the 1995 through 1997 time frame. 4. Conventional Gasoline Not Affected by This Proposed Amendment EPA's concern for gaming in the case of conventional gasoline is substantially greater than its concern with respect to reformulated gasoline. First, there is likely to be significantly more conventional gasoline imported into the U.S. than reformulated gasoline. Second, the Final Rule provides that individual baseline will be the basis for conventional gasoline compliance into the foreseeable future while an individual baseline for reformulated gasoline is applicable only until December 31, 1997. Accordingly, due to these volumetric and long term distinctions between reformulated gasolines and conventional gasolines, the potential for adverse air quality impact is significantly larger if individual foreign refinery baselines could be used with conventional gasoline, as compared with the potential if individual foreign refinery baselines could be used with reformulated gasoline. The Final Rule requires that domestic refiners apply their individual baselines to conventional gasoline production. EPA anticipates that nationwide use of individual baselines will result in gasoline quality that approximately equals the statutory baseline. However, EPA believes that an option to use individual baselines by foreign refiners in the production of conventional gasoline would result in significant skewing, in a negative direction, of the average quality of imported gasoline based on the gaming scenario described above.
