I suppose that the results of elections in Ukraine will decide or clarify very little. Everything is clear as it is. Ukraine is in a state of half-decay. The information space has been disrupted; industry is grinding to a halt; transportation links are being scaled down: Fuel is too expensive. Living standards are falling rapidly. Disintegration has also begun to affect the armed forces. The provinces are moving to a subsistence mode, isolating themselves from Kiev politically. It would be little exaggeration to say that Ukraine is held together only by the wish of the majority of regional elites to preserve the attributes of statehood and also by Russian natural gas supplies and Ostankino TV programs.... We are observing many of these processes also in Russia. There are two substantial differences, however. First, in Ukraine the situation is exponentially worse. Second, and this is the main thing, in Russia reform is under way and there are forces ready to continue it. The question is only about the pace and methods. In Ukraine, on the other hand, reforms have practically never begun in the first place. Moreover, there are no visible forces there yet capable of going through with them in earnest. I do not agree with the controversial memorandum by the U.S. intelligence service or with those in Russia who predict social chaos and collapse for Ukraine in the very near future. The Ukrainians are just as patient and maybe even more kind-hearted than their Russian brothers. Even so -- let me repeat -- I do not think that these qualities will last us or them for more than one and a half to two years. Neither do I share the malice of some of the Russian politicians who are gleefully rubbing their hands and waiting for Ukraine to come crawling on its knees. Such malice is amoral: The Ukrainians are our brothers, in trouble. Malice is out of place also because the social and political disintegration of Ukraine is a most serious threat to the security of Russia and the people of Russia. The imminent migration problem will aggravate, exacerbating unemployment, and the increasing drug flow will grow even more. It is terrible to think about the consequences of a loss of control over nuclear power stations, nuclear weapons, and chemical production facilities. It is almost inevitable that Russia will have to start pumping colossal resources into Ukraine like into a bottomless pit. In this connection I would like to ask the advocates of rapid unification: Do they understand that this will lead to a sharp fall in living standards in Russia itself? Let these well-fed politicians, speaking on behalf of the Russian people, ask the Russians themselves: Do they want to donate half of their earnings to unification? Especially in view of the fact that the price of full unification even with parts of Ukraine can be a social upheaval and collapse of Russia. There is yet another danger: An anti-Russian mood is growing in the West. There are not a few reasons for that: irritation with our state of disarray and a wish to safeguard against it, the fear of a revived Russian expansionism, and so forth. If under these conditions Ukraine begins to fall apart, and Russia will almost inevitably have to intervene in this process, there will be cause for a new round of "cold war." Whereas the first "cold war" was a tragedy, the second -- in the early eighties -- had elements of a tragicomedy; the third, in all likelihood, will be a farce: After all, there is no more ideological confrontation, and almost no contradiction between the fundamental interests of Russia and the West. Nonetheless, it is clear that Russia, with its present weakness, will have to pay a high price for it. Is there a chance to avoid the worst-case scenario? I do not know. It would be best if Russia and the West by joint political efforts forced the Ukrainian leadership to undertake reform in exchange for economic aid. Russia would obviously gain from Ukraine's economic openness, and the West from its political independence. Even if the West does not furnish mass assistance, one should insist on a dialogue with it on Ukraine's problems: at least to minimize possible damage. Yet there is also another option: to prevent the disintegration of Ukraine by demanding the removal of barriers and participation in privatization programs and at the same time promoting direct links with regions and cities. It is beneficial politically: We establish ties with actual people and actual interests. It is also beneficial economically: Ukrainian goods are relatively cheap. It is beneficial from the human point of view: We can help Ukraine survive in these difficult years. Moreover, one could hope that people articulating the real interests of Ukraine and the Ukrainians will be coming to power in Kiev and at the local level. And they, these interests, consist in ensuring the closest possible union with Russia. The abyss into which Ukraine's leadership has plunged it will never make it what Russia's foes hoped it would -- its strategic counterbalance. The very best on which the advocates of Ukrainian statehood can count is to preserve an independent but in actual fact economically semidependent state. This is not the worst possible option for Russia either. With such a pattern of relations with Ukraine as well as with other CIS states, we can emerge from the status of a milk cow into a state relieved of the burdens of empire, but retaining many of the benefits of its former geostrategic and geo-economic, so to speak, position. To achieve this (or any other desirable result), however, a vigorous, concentrated policy is needed. Which, in my opinion, does not exist.
