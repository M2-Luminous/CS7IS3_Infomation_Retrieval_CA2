FR941102-0-00018 FR941102-0-00004 Conforming Amendments to Part 5 Merger, Consolidation, Purchase and Assumption (Section 5.33(b)(6)) The proposal included a conforming amendment to 12 CFR 5.33(b)(6)(ii) which requires that all shareholders in a merger or consolidation transaction be adequately informed of all aspects of the transaction. The proposal amended §5.33(b)(6)(ii) to add that a bank required to file a registration statement with the OCC may use that registration statement to comply with the proxy statement requirements set forth in §5.33(b)(6)(ii). In addition, a bank subsidiary of a holding company required to file a registration statement with the SEC may use that registration statement to comply with OCC proxy statement requirements. The final rule adopts the conforming amendment to §5.33(b)(6)(ii) as proposed, with minor technical clarifying changes. Changes in Equity Capital (Section 5.46) and Subordinated Debt as Capital (Section 5.47) The proposal did not include any changes to 12 CFR 5.46 and 5.47. Former §5.46 required OCC preliminary approval for a change in capital due to a sale of preferred stock. Former §5.46 further specified that changes in equity capital must occur within 12 months of seeking preliminary approval. Former §5.47 required OCC approval for subordinated debt that is to be considered part of a bank's capital structure; a bank must receive preliminary approval prior to the issuance of subordinated debt and the subordinated debt must be issued within 12 months of the preliminary approval. The OCC requested comment on whether §§5.46 and 5.47 needed to be modified in order to enable banks to use the SEC rule on shelf registration in Rule 415 (17 CFR 230.415_Delayed or continuous offering and sale of securities). Shelf registration permits banks to register securities that are to be sold in the future and then to sell those securities when the market conditions are most favorable. The OCC received four comments on this issue. All of the commenters stated that because of the delays caused by the preliminary approval requirements in §§5.46 and 5.47, the OCC needed to amend those requirements in order for banks to take advantage of SEC Rule 415. The OCC agrees and has adopted a final rule that includes changes to §§5.46 and 5.47. The changes will enable most banks to use the SEC's rule on shelf registration and thereby reduce unnecessary regulatory burden. As adopted in the final rule, §5.46 no longer requires a bank to obtain preliminary approval of cash sales of preferred stock unless the OCC has notified the bank that preliminary approval is necessary. After selling preferred stock, a bank still must obtain final approval and certification. The final rule also changes the approval procedures in §5.47 for the issuance of subordinated debt. Under the new procedures, a bank need not obtain prior approval to issue subordinated debt unless the OCC has notified the bank that prior approval is necessary. A bank that has not been notified that it must obtain prior approval to issue subordinated debt must notify the OCC after issuing debt that is to be counted as tier 2 capital. Subordinated debt will qualify as tier 2 capital if it meets the requirements set forth in 12 CFR part 3, Appendix A section 2(b)(4) and complies with the OCC Guidelines for Subordinated Debt Instruments in the Comptroller's Manual for Corporate Activities. The OCC may solicit comments on §5.46 and §5.47 in connection with its proposed comprehensive revisions to Part 5 of the OCC's regulations.
