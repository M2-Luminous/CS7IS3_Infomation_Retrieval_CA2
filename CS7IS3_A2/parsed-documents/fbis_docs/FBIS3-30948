In line with the joint communique, both parties want to maintain the coalition until the elections in four years' time. The coalition members agreed to unanimously support the budget bill submitted by the government. They expressed very positive opinions on the "knowledge, competence, and activeness of Marek Borowski." The coalition agreement, as both sides unanimously stress, is still binding. Therefore, the candidate for the vacant post of the finance minister will be proposed by SLD. Borowski already knows his name, but, as he said, he cannot reveal it yet. Hours Before On Tuesday [8 February] Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak irrevocably accepted the resignation of Marek Borowski, deputy prime minister and finance minister. The president signed the prime minister's motion concerning his recall. The coalition talks, which started in the evening in the hotel of the Office of the Council of Ministers [URM] at Parkowa Street, were preceded by an hour-long meeting between Kwasniewski and Pawlak, which had not been the first one in the past two days. The prime minister's Press Secretary Ewa Wachowicz told the journalists, who had come to the URM seat in quite a large number, that there would be no comments either before or immediately after the meeting. The Council of Ministers, which held a session on that day, despite earlier declarations, did not issue its opinions on the Sejm committees' amendments to the budget bill (they were presented by Minister Borowski, who had already handed in his resignation). The government members met later in the Constitutional composition (only the prime minister and ministers) in order to discuss the situation that had developed after Marek Borowski's resignation. As we learned from one of the participants of this sitting, the meeting was held so that ministers would not find out about the events concerning the government from the mass media. The Left Miscalculated "The decision concerning the recall of Minister Marek Borowski was not made because I wanted this -- it was made because of the declaration of the interested parties," said Prime Minister Pawlak in Radio "Zet." The prime minister believes that Borowski's decision to submit his resignation was unnecessary. The response of SLD politicians to the prime minister's decision, or rather, its lack, suggests that they were taken aback by it. According to PSL members, Aleksander Kwasniewski and his cooperators made a second attempt to force PSL to make a decision that is favorable. They claim that the first attempt was when the composition of the cabinet was being negotiated. They say that the first list submitted in the Belvedere was fully agreed with SLD. SLD queried it and renegotiated the filling of the posts in the key economic ministries, which, according to the peasants, was a deliberate propaganda ploy of SLD. Pawlak, who was obliged to meet the deadlines set by the Constitution, had to agree to these SLD proposals. In PSL circles one can hear opinions that the issue of Borowski was a similar ploy. According to unofficial information, which was confirmed by several credible sources, Deputy Prime Minister Borowski knew earlier about the scheduled recall of his deputy; he consented to it, but kept delaying the decision to sign off on it. Thus, it was Pawlak who did it. The violent response of SLD was received by PSL as another propaganda trick, which was once again supposed to help SLD gain greater influence in the government as well as to limit the role of Prime Minister Pawlak and Minister Strak: Such a version of the developments seems to be borne out by unofficial statements of SLD politicians, who claim that Marek Borowski's resignation was a tactical ploy. It was supposed to force PSL to hold talks on the functioning of the government, economic policy, cadre policy, information policy, and the cooperation within the coalition -- that is, all the controversial issues. SLD accuses the prime minister of steering the work of the government rather inefficiently; it also points out that Minister Strak, when making decisions concerning the cadres in the state administration, favors his party colleagues. Prime Minister Pawlak, backed by his party, did not yield in this conflict. The peasants emphasize that they would not allow anyone to place them in a second position, just as it was in the time of the Polish People's Republic. For the time being SLD lost, or rather, it was outmaneuvered. Will it receive anything in return for Borowski's recall? There were speculations that it would be the recall of Michal Strak. According to credible sources, the prime minister did not agree to that. What Does the SLD Want? When the conflict between the prime minister and Minister Borowski came to the surface, SLD politicians started to say increasingly louder that the government head should sign as soon as possible appointments of the coalition's representatives in the presidential ministries, that is, in the Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. SLD politicians unofficially confirm that they want to force Pawlak to make such a decision. It would be a bargaining chip for Kwasniewski's party over the "issue of Kawalec." Despite the efforts of SLD leaders, the prime minister has so far been unable to make a decision on "strengthening the coalition" in the presidential ministries. SLD also wants a stronger position of the Presidium of the Government. It consists of the prime minister and the deputy prime ministers. It is an extra-constitutional body. In line with the SLD proposal, it would be the presidium, not only the prime minister, that would steer the work of the cabinet. To their surprise, journalists were admitted to the URM premises, where, in line with earlier official information, the coalition talks were supposed to be held. Fifteen minutes after the announced time when the talks were supposed to begin, the journalists were addressed by Ewa Wachowicz, who said that the talks had already begun, but she was not authorized to tell them where the meeting was being held. When asked bluntly whether the talks were being held at Parkowa Street, she replied: "I do not confirm this, but I do not deny it, either." Therefore, most of the journalists went to the hotel at Parkowa Street. Twenty minutes later, those few who decided to stay in URM saw the prime minister with two bodyguards walk toward his office. "We have only just started," he told the surprised journalists. The actual coalition talks began at Parkowa Street at approximately 2000 [1900 GMT].
