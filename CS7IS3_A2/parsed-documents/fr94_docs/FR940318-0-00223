Use with the necessary precautions. ␣ Dimethyl ether Acceptable DME is flammable. Use with the necessary precautions. Blends of DME with HCFCs are subject to section 610 restrictions. ␣ HFC&hyph;152a, HFC&hyph;134a, HFC&hyph;125 Acceptable HFC&hyph;134a, HFC&hyph;125 and HFC&hyph;152a are potential greenhouse gases. ␣ Alternative processes (pumps, mechanical pressure dispensers, non-spray dispensers) Acceptable ␣ Compressed Gases (Carbon dioxide, air, nitrogen, nitrous oxide) Acceptable CFC&hyph;11 as aerosol propellant HCFC&hyph;22, HCFC&hyph;142b Acceptable All aerosol propellant uses of HCFC&hyph;22 and HCFC&hyph;142b are already prohibited as of January 1, 1994 under Section 610 (d) of the Clean Air Act. Only one exemption exists. It is described in the section on aerosol substitutes. CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;113, MCF, HCFC&hyph;141b as aerosol solvents C6&hyph;C20 Petroleum hydrocarbons Acceptable Petroleum hydrocarbons are flammable. Use with the necessary precautions. Pesticide aerosols must adhere to FIFRA standards. ␣ Chlorinated solvents (trichloroethylene, perchloroethylene, methylene chloride) Acceptable Extensive regulations under other statutes govern use of these chemicals, including VOC standards, workplace standards, waste management standards, and pesticide formulation and handling standards. Should be used only for products where nonflammability is a critical feature. ␣ Oxygenated organic solvents (esters, ethers, alcohols, ketones) Acceptable These substitutes are flammable. Use with the necessary precautions. ␣ Terpenes Acceptable These substitutes are flammable. Use with the necessary precautions. ␣ Water-based formulations Acceptable CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;113, MCF as aerosol solvents HCFC&hyph;141b and its blends Acceptable All aerosol solvent uses of HCFC&hyph;141b, either by itself or blended with other compounds, are already prohibited as of January 1, 1994 under Section 610 (d) of the Clean Air Act. Limited exemptions exist. These are described in the section on aerosol substitutes.
