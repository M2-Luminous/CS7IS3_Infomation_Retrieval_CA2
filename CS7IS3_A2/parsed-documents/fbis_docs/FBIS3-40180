During this period, township industries grew at a rate faster than the industrial growth of the entire municipality by nearly 27 percentage points. If township industries continue to grow at this rate, in about two years, its production is expected to reach one-third of the total industrial output value in Shanghai, a city where big state-owned industries are concentrated. Since last year, a remarkable feature of Shanghai's new township enterprises is that there are more joint ventures. In 1992, Shanghai township enterprises established 1,100 new joint ventures. The number of such enterprises that appeared between January and October 1993 surpassed the 1992 record, bringing the total number of joint ventures in suburban Shanghai to upwards of 3,000, or 47 percent of the foreign-funded enterprises in the municipality. That is, in terms of number, they took up almost "one half of the world of foreign-funded industry." Now, Shanghai's townships, and even some villages, are focusing on the promotion of joint ventures as a way to make breakthroughs in developing their economies. Yutang Village in suburban Shanghai had had no foreign-funded enterprise before May 1992. In August 1993, only a little more than one year had elapsed--the village had eight enterprises with foreign investment. The total investment of these enterprises was $39.22 million, of which $29.18 million came from foreign investors. Now, most of them have begun production. In developing suburban enterprises with foreign investment, Shanghai has kept to "three principal methods": setting up joint ventures, transforming old enterprises by "grafting" new foreign-funded ventures on them, and developing new and high technology. Setting up joint ventures, and using foreign capital has solved township enterprises' acute shortage of funds. The "grafting" method has improved old enterprises and upgraded their products, and as a result, some loss-making enterprises have regained vitality and are making profits. By introducing advanced foreign technology and developing new products, township enterprises are able to gear their production to the international as well as domestic market instead of the domestic market alone. Statistics show that the value of exports by Shanghai's township enterprises was 11.934 billion yuan between January and October 1993. Of this, exports of joint ventures amounted to 3.239 billion yuan, up 118 percent compared with the same period in 1992. Foreign-funded enterprises have become a reinforcement force in Shanghai's suburbs in earning foreign exchange. Starting points, large-scale operations, and high efficiency are other features of the new township enterprises that have emerged in Shanghai's suburbs. Many of the township enterprises established in the last two years are characterized by their large-scale investments, high product quality, advanced technology, and bright market prospects. Meanwhile, some new township enterprises are developing toward enterprise groups. The Jiabao Industrial Corporation, which was originally formed by four township enterprises, now has seven sub-companies, and its operations have been expanded to include real estate, domestic and international trade, as well as hotel business. Its assets have soared from 63 million yuan to 690 million yuan. Both its output value and profits have increased sharply, and export foreign exchange earnings have doubled year after year. Now, this corporation is one of the top 10 large-scale township enterprises in China. Compared with old enterprises, Shanghai's new township enterprises are in a better condition, have more remarkable strong points, and more shining prospects for further development. But they are not completely without problems. Some major problems in their operations are: First, shortage of funds is still a rather striking problem. Due to an acute shortage of funds, some projects have been started, but cannot be completed and put into operation on time. A few foreign-funded enterprises exist in name only because their foreign capital has not been paid. Others are not running at full capacity due to insufficient revolving funds. Second, they lack professionals. To enter the overseas market, and hook up their operations with the international business community, township enterprises are in need of specially trained personnel in such fields as international trade, foreign languages, financial management, and accounting. For this reason, some enterprises have expressed the hope that the authorities concerned will make arrangements for training such professionals and will cooperate with institutions of higher learning in this regard to improve the quality of training. Third, there is insufficient labor. As most young and middle-aged laborers in Shanghai's rural areas are employed by either township enterprises or village-run enterprises, it is difficult for new enterprises to recruit workers. Some of the new township enterprises have to hire workers from other parts of the country. In some enterprises, child laborers hired from other places account for 80 percent of the labor force. This has brought about a series of new questions such as the workers' board and lodging, love and marriage, and even some public security problems. Fourth, with the development of the export-oriented economy, more and more township enterprise products are for export, and such products take up an increasing share of the township industry's total output. These township enterprises earnestly wish to do export business themselves. Right now, however, very few of them have obtained approval in this respect. For newly established enterprises, it is even harder to get such approval. The large number of new township enterprises in Shanghai have unique strong points, but the challenges confronting them are grim.
