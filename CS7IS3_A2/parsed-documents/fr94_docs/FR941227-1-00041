FR941227-1-00041 FR941227-1-00010 The Service received 11 substantive comments in response to the request for public comments on Dr. Atwood's data and analysis. Of particular note, Dr. William Link mathematician, and Grey Pendleton, biometrician, with the National Biological Survey (NBS) conducted new analyses of these data and presented it in a report (Link and Pendleton 1994). Their four conclusions were: (1) That the morphological characters in Atwood's data set vary along the geographical gradient, (2) That the changes in characters are more reasonably represented by discrete groupings than by a gradual pattern of change, and are thus consistent with the existence of subgroups within the population, (3) That there is at least 1 break north of site 5 (Atwood's BG27) [approximately 30 ○ N latitude], and (4) That there is at least 1 break south of site 5. Moreover, the Service received two additional statistical analyses (Dr. Atwood; and Dr. Karen Messer, Department of Mathematics, California State University, Fullerton) that supported a southern terminus of 30 ○ N latitude for the coastal California gnatcatcher. However, the Service received three significant comments that, for various reasons, did not support such a southern terminus (Dr. George Barrowclough, ornithologist from New York; Dr. Lyman McDonald, consultant from Wyoming; and Dr. James MacMahon and other colleagues, College of Science, Utah State University). In light of the NBS report (Link and Pendleton 1994), the Service reopens the comment period to ensure that the public may review and comment on this and other significant comments and analyses received during the original public comment period. The comment period is opened through January 26, 1995. References Cited Atwood, J.L. 1991.
