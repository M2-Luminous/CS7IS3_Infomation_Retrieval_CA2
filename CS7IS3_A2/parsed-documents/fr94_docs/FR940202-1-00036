FR940202-1-00036 FR940202-1-00014 The California red-legged frog is the largest native frog in the western United States (Wright and Wright 1949), ranging from 4 to 13 centimeters (1.5 to 5.1 inches) in length (Stebbins 1985). The abdomen and hind legs of adults are red; the back is characterized by small black flecks and larger irregular dark blotches with indistinct outlines on a brown, gray, olive, or reddish background color. Dorsal spots usually have light centers (Stebbins 1985). Dorsolateral folds are prominent on the back. Larvae range from 14 to 80 millimeters (mm) (0.6 to 3.1 inches) in length, and the background color of the body is dark brown and yellow with darker spots (Storer 1925). Several morphological and behavioral characteristics differentiate California red-legged frogs from northern red-legged frogs. Adult California red-legged frogs are significantly larger than northern red- legged frogs by 35 to 40 mm (1.4 to 1.6 inches) (Hayes and Miyamoto 1984). Dorsal spots of northern red-legged frogs usually lack light centers common to California red-legged frogs (Stebbins 1985), but this is not a strong diagnostic character. California red-legged frogs have paired vocal sacs and call in air (Hayes and Krempels 1986), whereas northern red-legged frogs lack vocal sacs (Hayes and Krempels 1986) and call underwater (Licht 1969). Female California red-legged frogs deposit egg masses on emergent vegetation so that the egg mass floats on the surface of the water (Hayes and Miyamoto 1984). Northern red-legged frogs also attach their egg masses to emergent vegetation, but the mass is submerged (Licht 1969). California red-legged frogs breed from November to March with earlier breeding records occurring in southern localities (Storer 1925). California red-legged frogs found in coastal drainages are rarely inactive (Jennings et al. 1992), whereas those found in interior sites may hibernate (Storer 1925). The California red-legged frog occupies a fairly distinct habitat, combining both specific aquatic and riparian components (Hayes and Jennings 1988, Jennings 1988b). The adults require a dense, shrubby or emergent riparian vegetation closely associated with deep (>0.7 meters) still or slow moving water (Jennings et al. 1992). The largest densities of California red-legged frogs currently are associated with deep-water pools with dense stands of overhanging willows ( Salix spp.) and an intermixed fringe of cattails ( Typha latifolia ) (Jennings 1988b). Well-vegetated terrestrial areas within the riparian corridor may provide important sheltering habitat during winter. California red- legged frogs estivate in small mammal burrows and moist leaf litter up to 26 meters (85 feet) from water in dense riparian vegetation (Rathbun et al. 1993). Egg masses that contain about 2,000 to 5,000 moderate-sized (2.0 to 2.8 mm (0.08 to 0.11 inches) in diameter), dark reddish brown eggs are typically attached to vertical emergent vegetation, such as bulrushes ( Scirpus spp.) or cattails ( Typha spp.) (Jennings et al. 1992). Eggs hatch in 6 to 14 days (Jennings 1988b). The most significant mortality factor in the pre-hatching stage is water salinity (Jennings et al. 1992). One hundred percent mortality occurs in eggs exposed to salinity levels greater than 4.5 parts per thousand (Jennings and Hayes 1990). Larvae undergo metamorphosis 3.5 to 7 months after hatching (Storer 1925, Wright and Wright 1949, Jennings and Hayes 1990). Of the various life stages, larvae probably experience the highest mortality rates, with less than 1 percent of eggs laid reaching metamorphosis (Jennings et al. 1992). Sexual maturity is reached at 3 to 4 years of age (Storer 1925, Jennings and Hayes 1985). California red-legged frogs may live 8 to 10 years (Jennings et al. 1992). The diet of California red-legged frogs is highly variable. Hayes and Tennant (1985) found invertebrates to be the most common food items. Vertebrates, such as Pacific tree frogs ( Hyla regilla ) and California mice ( Peromyscus californicus ), represented over half of the prey mass eaten by larger frogs (Hayes and Tennant 1985). Hayes and Tennant (1985) found juvenile frogs to be active diurnally and nocturnally, whereas adult frogs were largely nocturnal. Feeding activity probably occurs along the shoreline and on the surface of the water (Hayes and Tennant 1985). Larvae probably eat algae (Jennings et al. 1992). California red-legged frogs have sustained a 75 percent reduction in their geographic range in California as a result of several factors acting singly or in combination (Jennings et al. 1992). Habitat loss and alteration, combined with overexploitation and introduction of exotic predators, were significant factors in the California red-legged frog decline in the early to mid 1900s. California red-legged frogs were extirpated from the Central Valley probably in the 1960s. Remaining aggregations of California red-legged frogs in the Sierran foothills became fragmented and were later eliminated by reservoir construction, continued expansion of exotic predators, grazing, and drought. The pattern of disappearance of California red-legged frogs in southern California is similar to that seen in the Central Valley, except that urbanization and its associated roadway, large reservoir (exotic predators), and stream channelization projects were the primary factors causing population declines.
