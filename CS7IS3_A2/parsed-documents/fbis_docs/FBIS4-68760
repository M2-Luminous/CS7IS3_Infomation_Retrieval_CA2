Foreign Minister J�uri Luik made a presentation on behalf of the government. It did not include any analysis of the previous year. Predecessors were praised, the Meri-Manitski-Velliste line was proclaimed, and a promise made to continue along that line. The Foreign Commission of Riigikogu limited itself to a statistical report of its work. The greater part of the government coalition was not interested in the discussion. The government, or rather its foreign ministry, was represented by only a few people. The independent media was enthusiastic about the minister's presentation. The session hall of Riigikogu was aglow, if not sold off, in a glitter of pretense. We Lost Time in 1993 Estonia's foreign policy was not as successful as it was made out to be. We have lost time and missed out on international initiative. Actions taken have not always been sensible, nor have they been to the benefit of Estonia alone. We were too yielding, perhaps, to the wishes of super-states. We have given too much leeway to international organizations to dictate to us. The foreign politicians and officials visiting Estonia dispelled our vigilance, when they tapped us on the shoulder for human rights. Thus, we let United Nations stick us with an uncomfortable resolution regarding human rights. Now it is not quite clear whether we are violating it or not. The priorities and the orientation of our foreign policy have also remained unclear. Out of Estonia's political elite, every person has his or her own vision of what state or what organization we should be dealing with. We didn't quite understand it ourselves, who is responsible for foreign policy in Estonia, or who has the last word. There was a power struggle between factions. That also irritated Estonia's friends abroad. We waxed enthusiastic about international organizations. The rules of the game for UN, NATO, the European Union, CSCE and GATT were obviously not too well understood. We did not quite know the balance of power in UN and CSCE, which is controlled by Russia. For us, CSCE is a meaningless organization altogether, because it was created by the Soviet Union to further its imperialistic aims. Russia is very comfortable there. After all, representatives of CSCE have been promoting Russia's cause in Estonia quite unashamedly, gotten involved in our internal affairs, and fanned up international tensions in Narva. You can still remember what happened with the laws on aliens and local elections. I watch with trepidation, how the theoreticians and practitioners of our foreign policy adopt the theories of CSCE emmissaries on integrating aliens into Estonian society. This is both dangerous and harmful. Such integration will subject us to the control of a stronger nation, ruin our culture, make us into a biligual country, dilute our pragmatic attitude to life, and reduce the necessary immunity to resist harmful foreign political influences. Timidity About Russia During 1993, we have made many concessions harmful to the state of Estonia in the course of our dealings with our eastern neighbors. They had their way in fixing our sea borders. They have skilfully managed to delay removing troops and military pensioners from Estonia. They have been able to tell the world at large, without any protest from us, whatever they please about Estonia. They are about to get their way with the connecting regions treaty that is very harmful to Estonia's state security. They got voting rights for their legal and illegal citizens to participate in our local elections. They want to turn Estonia into an officially bilingual state. Their efforts toward changing the language law are continuing. They want Estonian citizenship for all of their people. This has already encouraged our governing officials to think about toning down the citizenship law. They have already obtained the right to apply for a residency permit for a portion of their military pensioners. They are not interested in economic cooperation. They are asking for greater political concessions, instead. With the tacit approval of the Western states, Russia has taken us into its sphere of influence. No protest. Velliste's foreign ministry explained that there was no need to react to anti-Estonian statements made by Russian politicians. That was supposed to increase the sympathy level toward us. However, Russia kept hammering away, but no sympathy was forthcoming. The government kept assuring us that the Western states and NATO would not leave us in trouble. How big would that trouble have to be? The government consoled us that there was no need to worry about the limited contingent of Russian troops in Estonia. They were supposed to shrink anyway, and not be dangerous at all. We were beginning to believe. Now we are told that they cannot leave because of cold weather. Up until August 30, we will go on believing that they will be gone by August 31. Just as the government wanted us to believe in their departure by the end of 1992, and then again by the end of 1993. The Foreign Commission of Riigikogu made repeated attempts during 1993 to encourage the foreign ministry to action that would be geared more to the interests of Estonia. Repeatedly, there has been talk of the conservative activity of our UN delegation, of the liberal stance of our negotiations with Russia, and of our lack of progress in setting up visa-free travel with other countries. The foreign commission asked why Canadian citizens can come to Estonia without a visa, while our citizens must pay 500 kroons for a visa. The need to set up rotation within our foreign delegations was pointed out to the foreign ministry. There have been detailed explanations of reasons why it would benefit our state to have the foreign ministry initiate a wide-ranging propaganda campaign to explain our positions. Members of the foreign commission recommended that the foreign ministry protest against the anti-Estonian statements made by the Russian politicians, and other acts harmful to the state committed within Estonia's territory by the "political tourists" from CSCE. Riigikogu and its foreign commission had to take the initiative, because motivating the government did not bear fruit. Now, the international public is aware of Riigikogu's position on the growth of imperialistic tendencies in Russia'a foreign policy. And also of the position of the foreign commission on negotiations being held with Russia and the presence of Russian troops in Estonia. Riigikogu has turned to parliaments and governments of the world asking them to influence Russia that it, as the legal successor to the Soviet Union, would acknowledge the occupation and annexation of Estonia. But even these undertakings had their opposition. Why irritate Russia? There have been quite a few members of the foreign commission and of Riigikogu who cannot stop their endless editing, which keeps putting off the passing of the resolution. Riigikogu's involvement in foreign policy issues seems to be paying off. The harsh statements made by Russia's politicians and members of the government have diminished in number. On February 20, Ostankino's [Russia's major network] News program referred to Riigikogu's statement about the precipitation of Russia's imperialistic tendencies. It was done with a touch of annoyance, but containedly. Russia does not respect neighbors who are whining, subservient or without opinions of their own. Foreign Ministry Like a Sailor's Wife The busy staff of the foreign ministry spent the year of 1993 either expecting or sending off its minister. The `flying minister' spent almost half of his work-year abroad explaining, at press conferences, that Estonia is regarded everywhere with benevolence and respect. We are being supported, we have learned. Last fall, however, when this support was needed at UN, we didn't get it because our `friends' threatened to walk out on the meeting. That was the way it was explained to us to justify the failed maneuvers in the matter of the human rights resolution relating to Estonia and Latvia. We found out that abstaining from the vote was a diplomatic coup and a concession to Latvia. We were told that the two Baltic states would be left at the mercy of the African countries, who would be happy to support Russia. Our `flying minister' had not yet gotten through to the African tribes. Now, one can always come back to the human rights problem. At Russia's insistence (or proposal), UN has even appointed a special counsel to the executive secretary for that purpose. We are wrapped up tightly with Latvia now. That is why we also have to share some other issues. Like that of the Skrunda radar station. I don't think that giving Russia the station is an internal matter for Latvia. This sly maneuver is as hazardous to their security as it is to ours. The staff at the foreign ministry is different from those found at other state offices. It includes many individuals whose thinking has evolved in other parts of the world. The rank-and-file Estonians often find it hard to share some high-ranking official's understanding of Estonia's situation, its relations with its neighbors, and its tactics for handling foreign relations. I can well understand how convictions that have been implanted in people in some distant motherland, can be different from those held in our native country here. Prominent figures from the other side of the Atlantic may think that Estonia should be yielding, accommodating and considerate of the complicated political and economic situation of our great neighbor. For that we should keep our state egotism at bay. One can assume that this is the order of the day in the minds of many ministry officials from some foreign land and that it becomes part of the policy being pursued. I sincerely hope I am wrong, although this is what we are seeing. I want to reiterate here to the columnist from HOMMIKULEHT (see HL April 18, 1993) that I was not `making faces' from the podium of Riigikogu and `believed sincerely' that the chief of foreign ministry's political department stated the momentary stance of some North-American country, maybe also that of the exile-Estonian leaders at the foreign ministry, to keep Estonia from approaching NATO. This young official reacted to Lithuania's desire to join NATO quite clearly: 1. it can cause a counter-reaction in the West; 2. it is not realistic; 3. we should wait to be invited. No commentary has been forthcoming. Riigikogu has difficulty understanding the Estonian language of the foreign ministry. Riigikogu received some documents that have caused anxiety. Like ratification of the famous `buttonhole', `sidecar' or the Baltic states economic cooperation law. Riigikogu has accommodated the foreign ministry to the maximum, and even violated its own procedures to get the matter settled fast. I am not complaining that the foreign ministry exerted a certain pressure on Riigikogu. We were even being lobbied by some of Estonia's outstanding industrial leaders. We believed their argument that unless this document is ratified during 1993, the Estonian industry will collapse. Nothing tragic happened, however, because the law is still not in effect. It would be nice to have less panic in the work of the foreign ministry in the future. Situation Is Far From Hopeless, even though we cannot give a satisfactory rating for the foreign policy of 1993. That part of the foreign minister's presentation at Riigikogu that deals with visions for the future of our foreign policy is quite factual. It seems that the orientation for foreign policy that has been quite confusing up until now, is beginning to take shape. Providing a logical direction for staff activity at the foreign ministry is also essential. The current staff needs a good airing out. Other countries have been imposing too much of their will and their ideology on us. The idealization of leading Western countries is bound to come to an end soon, as we start looking for allies among such countries that can sense the danger emanating from Russia on their own skin. Those who don't sense that danger get out from under every time an important resolution needs to be passed. They simply do not wish to spoil their relations with Russia for some small Baltic state. It's a good thing that the foreign minister spoke seriously about the need for close cooperation in the Baltic region. Such cooperation was hard to come by in 1993. A few visits or meetings between high ranking officials do not necessarily signify profound and coordinated relations. Due to our reserved stance toward countries with leftist governments, cooperation between the Baltic states was hampered because of Lithuania. Listening to J�uri Luik, one is likely to get the impression that we will also be seeking contact with such CIS countries, who would be our allies in the fight against imperialism. So, what if a theoretical course is taken for joining up with NATO and the European Union. For the time being, it will amount to nothing more than taking a political stance. But even that is something. I fear, though, that CSCE is an organization that is completely hollow and harmful to us, in addition to being a waste of time and money. The Western states we get our orientation from do not take this artificial organization seriously. This, too, affords an opportunity to demonstrate our attitude. There are problems with the UN. The latter is influenced largely by Russia and its satellites. We should have a strong delegation in New York who could stand up, at least to some degree, to the experienced diplomacy of Russia. It would be a shame if the presently known plans for restructuring our UN delegation were to be carried out. I fully agree with the expert opinion of HOMMIKULEHT, maintaining that foreign policy be left to the professionals. And therein lies the problem. It will take some time to turn amateurs into professionals who are capable of analysis and interaction. Right now, it's more like the twin games of the north: there are those who jump well, and others who ski splendidly. Winners would be those who can not only jump far, but also ski fast.
