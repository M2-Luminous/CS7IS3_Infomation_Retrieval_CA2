Pastrana noted that Castro has not made any pledges to Colombia, and he added that in order to strengthen commercial relations, which were interrupted more than a decade ago because of Cuban support for the Colombian guerrillas, the Cuban leader must clarify his relationship with the guerrillas. The presidential hopeful recalled that the top leader of the Army of National Liberation -- the former Spanish priest Manuel Perez -- has repeatedly said his movement is Cuba's mouthpiece in Colombia, and this, in turn, requires that Castro make a statement. Speaking in the town of Rioacha, Guajira, Pastrana said the resumption of commercial relations harms Colombia more than it benefits Cuba. "As everybody knows, a boycott of Colombian products in the United States has been announced," the conservative hopeful indicated. Last week, after the Colombian Government announced it will sell 20,000 barrels of oil a day to Cuba, the decision prompted a strong reaction among Cuban exiles in Miami, who have launched a campaign in the United States against the purchase of Colombian products.
