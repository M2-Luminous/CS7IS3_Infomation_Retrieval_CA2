This coinciding opinion was reported by Havana City historian Eusebio Leal when he spoke at a public ceremony in Havana's Cayo Hueso neighborhood where a plaque honoring Cuban emigrants who promoted the reencounter with the fatherland was unveiled. This activity, a preamble to "The Nation and the Emigrants" conference convoked by the Cuban Foreign Ministry for 22-24 April, was presided over by Jose Ramon Balaguer, member of the Politburo of the Communist Party of Cuba, Havana City Mayor Pedro Chavez, and other prominent government officials. Scores of Cubans who live in several countries and who were invited to the forum that will begin tomorrow in Havana's Conventions Palace attended the ceremony alongside local residents. Leal, who is also a parliamentary deputy, said: "Let us not be confused or forget what is essential: The main issue is not among Cubans. The main issue, and we must realize this, is the ongoing, stubborn, and tenacious position the great North American nation maintains toward Cuba's right to exist and to prevail." The Cuban emigrants on several occasions shouted slogans condemning the ongoing economic blockade imposed by Washington on the island more than three decades ago. The plaque, placed in the popular Trillo Park, is in remembrance of emigrants Carlos Muniz Varela (1953-79), Eulalio Jose Negrin (1941-79), Lourdes Casals Valdes (1938-81), Margarita Lejarza Vazquez (1950-85), Mauricio Miguel Gaston Roche (1947-86), Manuel Antonio de Dios Unanue (1943-92), and Eusebio Valdes Muno (1916-94). The memorial, Leal said, focuses on various outstanding efforts and events that are part of a yet-to-be-written Cuban history, a history in which the Cubans in and out of Cuba, the ones who live and those who are absent, are participants. He recalled the talks that began between the emigrants and the government in 1978 and noted that if the conference signifies "the right of Cubans to understand one another, to correspond with one another, to visit the tombs of their dead, to go anywhere in the world, and to exchange the common treasure of the same culture and the same language, it is welcome." "It is very important that," he noted, "when time accumulates so many differences, so many different viewpoints, we have started with something very important, such as seeking a term that will reflect the truth of the Cuban situation, so that it will be more human, so that it will correspond more to our history and that adequate term is emigration. The Cayo Hueso neighborhood was founded by emigrants of the keys, similarly named in the United States, who as a result of a terrible fire (an epilogue to the war to which they contributed their greatest sacrifice) which devoured their riches, were obliged to return, the city historian recalled. That is why this memorial has been unveiled here because it is not an uninhabited place of Havana and is very meaningful, he said.
