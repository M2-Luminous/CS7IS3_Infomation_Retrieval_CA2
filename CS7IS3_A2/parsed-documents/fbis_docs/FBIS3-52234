Jordan continued on the course of the great Arab revolt in defending Palestine, the right of its people to their land, and the right of the Arabs and Muslims in Palestine and in all the big homeland. In 1948, when they decided to enter Palestine militarily, in spite of all the perils and risks, this country had the honor to move and offer something. This Army, in particular, had had the honor of saving the major part of Palestine, and Jerusalem. We will remember the martyrs as long as we live, and generations to come will also remember them, not to mention the jihad, the sincerity, the courage, and the wisdom of the leadership which enabled much to be attained. Had it not been for this fact of saving the West Bank, there would not have been an opportunity now to discuss how to regain a specific part of the land either by us or by anyone else. No one should forget this fact. We do not say this to have others express gratitude that we have done this and performed this. This is a duty, an honor, and a commitment. We say this just to state a fact which we should not forget because many of us in this part of the world had forgotten many facts from which one could have benefited because they constitute features of what deserves to be adopted or from which advice and lessons could be learned. [passage omitted] The talk now is about the Jordanian-Palestinian relationship. This relationship is solid, deep, and unique. I frankly say that perhaps we wronged ourselves for many years by agreeing to be an object of attacks, insults, accusations, and the forging of facts. We tolerated these things and we did not deal with them as we should have done. This method, in itself, led to atmospheres fraught with skepticism and doubts, as if in 1948, 1949 and in all the years that followed and from the beginning, Jordan and its leadership have had an objective other than the noble objective of honorably defending this nation and protecting its right, and that Jordan sought to obtain something, or aspired to impose its control. Within this framework, all the Arab, Palestinian, and hostile forces intentionally or unintentionally contributed to sowing doubts and to negatively affecting the picture. However, had we not taken the stand we took in 1967 -- and we were aware of what the result would be -- there would have been an opportunity for an explosion in this country from within, and Israel would have occupied this country, not only the West Bank, but our entire territory as well [passage omitted] Going back to 1967 and the long years and suffering. A sisterly Arab country was ahead of us in signing a peace treaty with Israel. The situation then developed into an agreement between the Palestinian leadership, which represents the Palestinian Arab people, and the Israeli side. This leadership is the party that has the power, and our role is a supportive one in this case regardless of all other considerations. The agenda which deals with our issues was signed, and efforts began to discuss its various clauses, which are headlines for all issues important to us. This does not adversely affect the Palestinian rights on their national soil as far as we are concerned. This is the situation. In addition to this, there is coordination with our brothers within the framework of our utmost capabilities. I believe that the brothers in Syria are also on their way to discussing the dimensions dealing with Syria, and the same is the case with Lebanon. We are in contact with them. We make our own decisions, and we fulfill our obligations toward ourselves, but frankly we believe that there are thorny issues that need time before they are resolved, because this country has endured more than any other country since the beginning, and on all levels. All attempts and all pressures we suffered during the past period... [pauses] All quarters have been asking us to conclude a peace treaty. The answer to all of this was that the peace treaty comes at the end, when all presented issues are resolved in a satisfactory manner to us, of course, and to the concerned parties. Peace is not a document that we sign, then we start to negotiate. No, we should discuss everything, and when we reach an acceptable and reasonable result, and when we think that our brothers at that time will be in a similar position or ahead of us, then the comprehensive peace will be realized. This peace is what we have been calling for since the very beginning. This is our march and this what we are trying to do. Our preparations are complete, praise be to God, and we concentrate on three main issues. The issue of land; we have an occupied land that was occupied in the south shortly after 1967. The area of this occupied land is not small, and we insist that it should fully return to Jordanian sovereignty. There is also the subject of water. You hear much about peace as something that we can consider or leave. We should be aware of the fact and the reality. All reports and studies indicate that in the year 2010 there will not be enough drinking water for the people in Jordan. Practically, we consume less water than others do. This water is consumed by the people, not by agriculture, industry, or any other sector. This is a serious problem that is also facing others. If we consider only this dimension, it will be a great duty to discuss the future of the next generations and how they are going to live. At least, we have to do whatever we can to ease our consciences in the hope that we will achieve a just, comprehensive, and full peace that would restore rights to their rightful owners and give us the chance to have a rest even for once in preparation for a new phase, given that a state of just, comprehensive, and full peace would provide people with life opportunities that are completely different from those we have seen in terms of educational opportunities, peace of mind, future stability, security and work. We face constant siege and pressure. We will not accept anything that we do not believe to be right and just. Our heads will never bow to anyone other than Almighty God. But on the other hand, we want just and comprehensive peace. We want a life for your sons and for those who will come afterward. Israel is a small spot in a large ocean. If the desired peace is established the way it should, with the passage of time, the problem as it is at present will be resolved and done away with. If there are other means that could help ensure stability and guarantee the survival of future generations, I am personally unaware of such means. With regard to Jordanian-Palestinian relations, I have, as a matter of course, noted, among other things, three issues. These are territory, water resources, and the human individual in terms of the modalities of moving from our current status to the status that should prevail, the opportunities that must be made available to him, the kind of life he must enjoy, stability, the opportunities that would enable him to fulfill himself and achieve all that is possible at present and in the future so he may make up for lost opportunities, and so he may become strong and capable of coping with life and its future challenges. Last, but not least, there is the issue of Jerusalem. Jerusalem will remain in our hearts, consciences, minds, and chests. It will continue to shape our entire lives. This has been the case in the past since the inception of the Great Arab Revolt and continued until the establishment of this kingdom on this spot of earth and thereafter--throughout all stages, be they sweet or bitter, that is, in 1948, 1967, and to date. This will remain the case until doomsday. For in no way whatsoever shall we abandon our responsibilities toward Jerusalem. There are many sides which have their own formulas and views regarding the issue of Jerusalem. But, given the fact that the overall agreement reached between the Palestinians and Israelis was grounded in Security Council Resolution 242, then this agreement covers Jerusalem. If the [Palestinian] brothers were to succeed in their endeavors in the near future, Jerusalem might, God willing, become the symbol of Palestinian-Israeli reconciliation and peace. As regards holy shrines in Jerusalem and our responsibilities toward them, we will do our best to safeguard and protect these holy shrines. It is our firm belief...[pauses] We have lately called for the restoration of Islamic sovereignty over Islamic holy shrines in Jerusalem. This could be achieved through the creation of a nonpolitical body that might bring together the Islamic world and the splintered Islamic nation. It is hoped that such a proposal would enable this nation to play its role and perform its duty toward Jerusalem. If this were to be achieved, we would immensely assist such an endeavor to perform our duty in this regard. As a matter of course, we call for the continuation of inter-faith dialogue. We also believe that no single country should exercise sovereignty over the holy shrines of the children of Abraham, may God's peace be upon him. For no sovereignty except that of God should be exercised over these holy shrines. God might have willed that this city, which houses shrines that move the hearts of faithful people, lead a kind of life that is unprecedented throughout its long history. This would materialize someday if all faithful people were to choose to humble themselves before the Almighty God, to worship Him, and to respect one another within the context of just and honorable peace. We do not recognize the sovereignty of any party over Jerusalem and Islamic holy shrines there except that of the Almighty God. This is what we are attempting to promote on the universal, religious, Arab, and Islamic levels. We beseech God to make Jerusalem a meeting point for all Arabs and Muslims, just as Palestine should have been. We have been making enormous efforts to safeguard the future, and will continue to do so. This is the overall picture. I hope that I have managed to explain it to you, or to address some of its main features as they have unfolded during the recent past. On the Jordanian-Palestinian level, we held a meeting 48 hours ago. I personally regard that meeting as a decisive one. Both the climate and the responsibility require complete frankness. In that meeting, we were extremely frank, gave advice, and defined the fact that we are committed to what we agree on, and that we cannot tell our people that there is coordination unless there is an actual coordination. We cannot tell our people that there is agreement unless there is an actual agreement. We were promised that on Tuesday [4 January], to be exact, the brothers will come here in order to address the required priorities with all possible speed and with the needed perfection and clarity. For our part, we said that this would be the last opportunity. Otherwise, and henceforth, each side would separately assume its responsibilities. We made attempts and tolerated too much and we cannot proceed in this way. We would then frankly brief the people on all details. We will extend backing and support within the confines of our capabilities and resources, provided that the path has clear features. Commitment should mean commitment. We should not remain in a whirlpool of talks that do not yield tangible results. I ask God that the brothers would be at the required level. It goes without saying that recently I offered advice and tried to say that the situation has changed, that this leadership now must be a leadership for all the Palestinians in the inside and outside. The Palestinians must feel that they are part of the march at this criticial stage. Those who are capable of assuming responsibility should be prepared to do so. They must be given the chance to work in all fields. The question of credibility is very important. We agreed and disagreed tens of times. Then, we found that there are interpretations of what had been agreed. We disagree on these interpretations. However, the picture now is different. The situation is critical and calls for another method. We ask God to help our brothers adopt this method. We will extend support within the confines of our capabilities and resources. The issue of the bridges, about which you have heard perhaps, was also a point concerning which we blamed the brothers, too; the reports that we heard, namely, that they say that Jordan wishes Israeli control to remain on the crossings and bridges? We are not a party. We told the brothers that we are a state and they are now on the way to establishing their own state. We are on the bridges. We, who are sharing the pain and suffering of our people in the occupied territories, find it impossible to prefer--if this is possible--any presence on these bridges on the Palestinian side except the Palestinians. This climate and this venom is there. In my talks [with 'Arafat] about the confederation, I asked the brother president to drop this expression from his lexicon and absolutely not to discuss it with me, not in any form--not even any other formula, other type, or other approach that leads to this course. Brothers, let us be frank. Our enemies worked against us. Ignorant elements and many sides worked against us, harmed this real and unique relationship between relatives and brothers who lived together, and suffered together. Speaking about formulas for the future, we are now tackling differences which exist among our brothers and relatives in the Arab homeland within the framework of the latest formuals that they had agreed. We want to start from the base and reach the top. We need time to dispel these doubts and illusions. The Palestinians and Jordanians must know that they are brothers. If the problems stem from the highest echelons, let us start from a sound basis and let us fully offer our support and backing within the confines of our capabilities. Let us work and at the appropriate time and circumstances, people will decide the nature of the relationship which should be established. But, to create formulas and act on them, I believe is premature and out of place. [passage omitted]
