In an interview with the Jordan News Agency, Petra, Mr. al-Ghizawi said this step is aimed at organising the local labour market, a measure which is essential in the battle against unemployment, the minister added. The ministry's decision was made after the completion of a study of the labour market which aimed at identifying characteristics of job-seekers. The minister said that the ministry is making great efforts to encourage Jordanians to work in the agriculture sector, where the presence of a non-Jordanian labour force is prominent. He added that because of the low participation of Jordanians in this sector, the ministry will continue to depend on non-Jordanian labour.
