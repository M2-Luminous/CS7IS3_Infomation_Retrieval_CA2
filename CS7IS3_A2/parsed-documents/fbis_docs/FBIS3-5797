North Solomons Province Administrator Sam Tulo says the curfew comes following the murder of a police officer last week and an incident during which two rebels were shot dead. Mr. Tulo says all the attacks took place in northern Bougainville where rebels have stepped up action, particularly around the Wakunai government station. He says the situation is also tense in central Bougainville, where clashes between rebels and government troops have resulted in the death of one man and the wounding of four others.
