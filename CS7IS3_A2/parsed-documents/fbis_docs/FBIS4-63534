These figures are of particular interest, and provide reasons for pondering this issue. Thus, Belarusian Prime Minister Vyachaslaw Kebich received more supporting signatures than his rivals. He was supported not only by 203 deputies, but also by 400,000 Belarusian voters. These are impressive results, however, they can be explained if we consider that state officers were actively participating in this signature campaign. We have evidence of all these facts, therefore, it is ridiculous to cite any of them. Our editorial office as well as the editorial offices of other newspapers, and the Civilian Election Committee have such evidence. By the way, when we queried Alyaksandr Abramovich, chairman of the Central Commission for Holding Presidential Elections, he admitted that state bodies participate in election battles. However, a question arises: Is this good or bad? Can state bodies be really depoliticized and perform only the so-called function of social management? There are various opinions on this point. State bodies in states with the old democratic traditions are to a certain degree affected by a ruling party. Thus, what can be said about the states that are, in fact, shifting from one political system to another? The role of state bodies in these countries is continually increasing. The results of the first stage of a presidential race in Belarus demonstrate this very vividly. Belarusian Prime Minister Vyachaslaw Kebich, for whom the entire state system worked, collected a majority of votes. This could not be otherwise: Any other presidential candidate constitutes a certain threat to many employees of the Cabinet of Ministers, the oblast and rayon executive committees. Earlier we wrote that only Supreme Soviet Chairman Myacheslaw Hryb could change this situation by entering the campaign. In this case, the officers of state bodies would have to choose between him and Kebich. However, Myacheslaw Ivanavich did not risk taking this step. So, state officers could do nothing but work for Kebich. Only Molodechno became an interesting and peculiar exception. You know that Molodechno Major Henadz Karpenko is also a candidate for president. Therefore, the Molodechno Executive Committee did not work for Kebich. The result is very strange: Prime Minister Vyachaslaw Kebich has no supporters (zero!) there at all. This is a vivid example of the role of state bodies in political battles! By the way, the same refers to the role of powerful party structures. For example, the Belarusian Popular Front [BNF], which has devoted supporters in many cities and rayons of Belarus, managed to collect over 230,000 signatures during the signature campaign. The Party of Communists of Belarus [PKB] was also characterized by good organization: They collected some 200,000 signatures in support of Vasil Novikaw, secretary of the PKB Central Committee. Other candidates, who were supported by small or secondary parties, or by nonstable allies, had more difficulties. For example, the number of signatures in support of Henadz Karpenko was slightly over 100,000. If he did not have a list with 79 deputies' signatures, he would have been very upset now. It is clear that many difficulties are awaiting the candidates. However, we should realize that only a candidate, who is able to win in an honest battle, could become a proper president of the state. His rivals will have to take him into consideration. However, if the presidential battle is manipulative, when the Central Committee for Holding Presidential Elections comes under someone's influence and winks at law violations, then elections of such a president will only increase antagonism in the Republic. This situation could trigger a social explosion.
