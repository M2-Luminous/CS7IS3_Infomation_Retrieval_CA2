Hosokawa made the comment to reporters who asked how Japan will react to the U.S. decision. In Washington, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor Tuesday unveiled steps to impose hundreds of millions of dollars in trade sanctions in a dispute over access to the Japanese celluar phone market. Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said Japan has not breached a 1989 trade accord with the U.S., which was meant to increase imports of U.S. cellular phones. "We are concerned about the latest U.S. decision," the top government spokesman told a news conference. "We expect them to act sensibly." Takemura also said the Japanese Government will examine the content of the U.S. announcement and decide on what action it will take. Hosokawa is scheduled to call a meeting Thursday afternoon of subcabinet-level officials who negotiated with the U.S. In bilateral trade talks to discuss increasingly strained ties with the U.S. The trade negotiations broke down last week when Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton failed to strike a deal on a new framework to slash Japan's vast trade surplus and increase the share of imports in its markets. The mobile phone sector is not included in the framework talks.
