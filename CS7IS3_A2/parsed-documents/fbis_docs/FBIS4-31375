Peter Gosev, leader of the Democratic Party said at yesterday's press conference. As arguments for this, Gosev stated frequent and long-lasting blocking of the work of parliament, not by the opposition, but by the ruling party, which refuses to attend sessions or limits debates on "inconvenient" subjects. He also spoke of increased influence of political parties over the institutions of democracy, through unscrupulous party interfering into judicial matters, covering up for criminal charges against high state officials, and not starting bankruptcy proceedings in certain firms. "The highest police officials are leading a politics of destroying the opposition." Gosev said. In order to do this, according to Gosev, they are increasingly using satellite parties and individuals known to have been informants for former intelligence services. He also said the interior minister was turning into a Stalin-type policeman.
