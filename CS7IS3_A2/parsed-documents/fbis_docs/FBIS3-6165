Mr Uthai said after meeting with the head of a delegation of the Commission of the European Union, J Gwyn Morgan -- the second meeting of an EU representative with the Commerce Ministry -- that he had expressed his government's dissatisfaction over the French ban. The import ban is based on confusion over Thailand's foremost, competent export inspection authority. He indicated that if Thailand does not receive a timely and satisfactory response from the French Government, his agency may take the case to the GATT council to seek redress from the balance of a perceived selective practice against Thailand. Mr Morgan has urged the Thai Government to delay any decision to involve a GATT review and allow him his best effort to solve the current dispute. Mr Uthai will inform the Cabinet today of the French authority's actions but declined to elaborate on what short-term measures, if any, the Thai Government should take against France. The Thai Food Processors Association and the Thai Frozen Food Association has called for trade retaliation. "We hope the dispute will be resolved soon and will not jeopardise the existing relationship between our two countries," said Mr Uthai. Mr Morgan said yesterday: "On behalf of the European Union, we, in Brussels, will discuss with our French colleagues a remedy and resolution to this dispute as soon as possible". The French Government banned Thai fishery imports on February 9.
