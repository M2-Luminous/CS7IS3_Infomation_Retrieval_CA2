The growth in the managed care industry has been well-documented, although the rate of growth has not been uniform throughout the country.11 In the West Census region in 1992, for instance, 25 percent of the population was enrolled in some sort of HMO, compared with 7.8 percent in the South. The implementation of managed care plans has also differed throughout the country. The average managed care plan in the Pacific Census division contracts with 60 hospitals, while that in New England contracts with 22 hospitals. As managed care market power has grown, more hospitals have begun contracting with HMOs and PPOs (see Table 1&hyph;10). This trend is reflected in the increased importance of managed care as a source of revenue. In 1993, 15.6 percent of hospitals in the Far West and 7.2 percent of hospitals in the East Central part of the country reported that more than 25 percent of their net patient care revenues came from HMOs or PPOs (see Table 1&hyph;11). Urban hospitals received more, on average, from HMOs and PPOs than did rural hospitals, although 13.6 percent of rural hospitals reported receiving more than 10 percent of revenues from these sources. Arrangements With Physicians While hospitals provide the buildings, equipment, and staff necessary to furnish complex inpatient (and other) services, they cannot operate without the cooperation of physicians, who admit, treat, and discharge patients. Evidence suggests that a large portion of total health care expenditures (an estimated 50 percent to 80 percent or more) are directly influenced_if not directly controlled_by physicians.12 In addition, physicians may influence hospitals' nonoperating expenditures by advocating particular types of capital investments. As hospitals have assumed more financial risk, they have increasingly pressured physicians to control their costs and use of hospital services through internal management strategies and contractual relationships that call for shared financial risk with doctors. How well hospitals and physicians work together to control costs and improve quality is unclear. Reluctant to surrender their autonomy, physicians have largely been able to resist hospitals' efforts to modify their practice styles. Therefore, many hospital administrators concentrated more on maximizing revenues during the 1980s than on engaging physicians as partners in helping them curtail spending. This strategy seems to be changing in the 1990s as hospitals and physicians increasingly recognize their interrelated roles and responsibilities. The ability of hospitals and physicians to set up joint financial arrangements_in particular to contract with managed care organizations_has affected the way some hospitals deal with doctors. One recent trend is for hospitals to acquire physician practices and try to integrate physicians into hospital management to some degree. In 1993, almost 14 percent of hospitals surveyed had a formal physician/hospital organization (PHO), 7 percent had a management services organization (MSO), and 4 percent had a foundation that negotiated managed care contracts on behalf of the hospital and physicians as a unit (see Table 1&hyph;12).13 Such practice arrangements are less popular in the West Central region than in other parts of the country, and are more common in urban and teaching hospitals. These arrangements, however, are not unheard of in rural hospitals, where 14 percent of hospitals surveyed reported having some type of joint venture with physicians.
