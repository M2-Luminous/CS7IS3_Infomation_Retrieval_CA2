Noting that Comrade Kim Il-song, the respected leader of the Korean people, has put forward the greatest anthropocentric idea that guarantees human emancipation and boundless happiness for the people, he said this is no other than the great immortal chuche idea. "The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is further developing and enriching the chuche idea," he said, and continued: "The imperialists are most afraid of the truth that man is master of everything and decides everything, because they consider the popular masses their slaves and the target of exploitation. "The imperialists are now most afraid of Korean-style socialism with the chuche idea as a guideline and the singlehearted unity of Korea. "Genuine popular politics cannot be administered where there is no such a great anthropocentric idea as the chuche idea." Pointing out that "the chuche idea brings eternal freedom and happiness to the mankind, he stressed this is proved by the realities of Korea."
