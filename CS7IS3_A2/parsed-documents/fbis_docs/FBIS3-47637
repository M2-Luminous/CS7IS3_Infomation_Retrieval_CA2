Cho Sun-hwan of the United People's Party about a missing classified document, grilling them about how they had handled the material. The two are former assistant Yi Un-chae, 38, and former secretary Chong Chu-hun, 31. Noting that Chong made three visits to Japan between 1987 and 1993, the interrogation focused on whether he had any connection with Chochongnyon, the pro-Pyongyang Association of Korean Residents in Japan, a spokesman said. Chong lived in Japan between July 18, 1987, and Nov. 17, 1990, for study; and between Nov. 21, 1990, and April 13, 1993, for further study. He visited Japan from Sept. 30 to Oct. 3, 1993, on business. Chong and Yi were summoned for interrogation on Thursday afternoon after a tip that he planned to visit Japan again.
