Yesterday we had the bitter criticism by European Commission President Jacques Delors and the Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Yossi Beilin, who both accused Chamber of Deputies Speaker Irene Pivetti of having an anti-Semitic background. [passage omitted] Let's turn to the reactions in Italy. Stefano Bellini reports: [Bellini] Following the concerns expressed by Francois Mitterrand and Andreas Papandreou, another high profile figure -- Jacques Delors -- has also expressed concern. With anger in my heart -- these were his words -- I read the interview given by Gianfranco Fini on the positive aspects of fascism until 1938 and on the loss of European cultural identity as it was being freed from Nazi fascism. These opinions have brought a wave of criticism. The widow of Giorgio Almirante said Delors's views were a disgusting attack. Pierferdinando Casini from the Christian Democrat Center thundered that Italy is a serious country which merits respect. The Italian Foreign Ministry said that the president of the European Commission's views were personal and did not involve any government. Senate Speaker Carlo Scognamiglio defended Irene Pivetti and rejected the accusations of anti-Semitism made against her. Rosa Russo Jervolino is of a completely different opinion and she has rejected the offer made by the leader of the National Alliance to join the ruling coalition. Achille Occhetto said Delors's remarks were not meddling and that the European right-wing parties could draw comfort from the success of the Italian Right. This is what Gianfranco Fini told Luce Tommasi: [Begin recording] [Tommasi] Fini, what do you say to Jacques Delors and to Israel, following the reassuring comments made by Peres? [Fini] I don't think that I have to give any reply. I am happy that Shim'on Peres has stressed that there is no hostility on the part of the Israeli Government toward the Italian Government. More than ever I am convinced that the concerns of Jacques Delors will diminish shortly when everyone has understood what the guiding values of both the government and the National Alliance are. [end recording] [Bellini] Furthermore, Fini has given assurances that the National Alliance will not join the same grouping as Jean-Marie Le Pen's extremists in the European Parliament.
