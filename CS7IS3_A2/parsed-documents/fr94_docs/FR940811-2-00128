FR940811-2-00128 FR940811-2-00080 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Office of the Secretary [Docket 49707] U.S.-Argentina All-Cargo Frequencies Summary By this notice, we invite interested U.S. carriers to apply for allocation of the available frequencies for scheduled all-cargo operations in the U.S.-Argentina market during the period July 1, 1994 through December 1, 1996. Background Under the existing air services agreement between the United States and Argentina, U.S. carriers may operate a total of eight weekly frequencies for U.S.-Argentina all-cargo services. (Annex II of the 1985 U.S.-Argentina Air Transport Services Agreement (Agreement).) These frequencies are currently allocated to Federal Express (five weekly flights); Arrow Air (two weekly flights); and Florida West Airlines (one weekly flight). On July 19, 1994, delegations of the United States and Argentina signed a Memorandum of Consultations (MOC) which, in part, amends Annex II of the Agreement to expand the number of all-cargo frequencies available for scheduled U.S. air carrier services. Specifically, the MOC provides that designated carriers of the U.S. may operate round trip all-cargo frequencies with narrow-body equipment or their wide-body equivalents as follows: From July 1, 1994 until September 30, 1995, a total of 10 weekly frequencies; from October 1, 1995 until November 30, 1996, a total of 11 weekly frequencies; and beginning December 1, 1996, a total of 12 weekly frequencies. 1 Thus, in a progressive fashion, the total number of narrow-body frequencies that U.S. carriers may operate from July 1, 1994-December 1, 1996, will increase from eight to twelve weekly flights. 2 1 The MOC amendments to Annex II, section 3, specify that for the purpose of frequencies narrow-body aircraft may be substituted, at the discretion of the designated airline, by wide-body aircraft at the following rates of conversion: One wide-body aircraft ( i.e., L&hyph;1011, DC&hyph;10, A&hyph;300, B&hyph;747SP, B&hyph;767 or similar aircraft) shall be equivalent to 1.5 narrow-body aircraft ( i.e., DC&hyph;8, B&hyph;707, B&hyph;727, B&hyph;737, B&hyph;757, MD&hyph;80 or similar aircraft), except that one B&hyph;747&hyph;100 or similar aircraft will be equivalent to two narrow-body aircraft, and one B&hyph;747 Combi (with main deck cargo) shall be equivalent to 1.5 narrow-body passenger aircraft and one narrow- body all-cargo aircraft. 2 Pending conclusion of formal amendments to the Agreement, the delegations agreed to permit operations consistent with the amendments on the basis of comity and reciprocity. Applications Given the provisions of the July MOC, we invite all U.S. carriers interested in using the available frequencies to file their applications with the Department in Docket 49707. 3 3 We note that the three incumbent carriers currently have pending applications for renewal of previously awarded frequencies and/or exemption authority. Federal Express, Docket 48545; Arrow Air, Docket 48545; and Florida West, Docket 46971. In view of the increased availability of frequencies, we will require that these carriers file new applications in the established docket for all frequencies they request to operate including those for which they have outstanding applications for renewal. The carriers are free to seek consolidation of the previously filed applications into the new docket established here. All applications, however, must include all information specified in this order. Applications should include, at a minimum, the following information: (a) The number of weekly frequencies requested; (b) markets to be served (as well as the overall single-plane routing for the proposed operations); (c) frequencies per market and period of service in each market; (d) existing authority held to conduct the operations, if applicable; 4 (e) the aircraft to be used in each market and a statement of the number of frequencies required per aircraft type; and (f) proposed startup date. 4 Applicant carriers without the requisite underlying authority to serve Argentina should file exemption applications to serve the affected markets no later than August 15, 1994. Response dates to such applications will correspond to those set forth in this notice for applications for frequency applications. Such applications, with the exception of the procedural dates, should follow the general guidelines set forth in Subpart D of Part 302 of our regulations. Applicant carriers that have previously been allocated frequencies and operated flights during the past two years should also provide the following information with respect to those operations: (a) The number of flights previously allocated per year; (b) markets served and periods for each; (c) frequencies operated per market and period of service for each market; (d) aircraft type per market; and (e) manner of operation (nonstop, one-stop, two-stop, etc.) and routing of operations. 5 5 For any data applicable for less than the total period of service, state the period during which it is applicable. If there was a cessation of service, no matter how short, in any market for any period during the past two years, such interruption of service should be noted. If services were changed from one market to another this also should be indicated. Applicants are also free to submit any additional information that they believe will help us in making our decision. An original and 12 copies of each application should be filed with the Department's Docket Section, Room 4107, 400 Seventh Street S.W., Washington, D.C. 20590, in Docket 49707 and should be served on all parties on the attached list. Procedural Schedule Two of the additional frequencies are available now. In these circumstances, it is important that we complete the allocation process as quickly as possible. Therefore, we will require that applications and responsive pleadings be filed in accordance with the following schedule: Applications and Motions to Consolidate: August 15, 1994. Answers: August 22, 1994. Replies: August 29, 1994. We will serve this notice upon all U.S. air carriers licensed to conduct scheduled foreign all-cargo services with large aircraft. We will also publish the Notice in the Federal Register . By: Dated: August 5, 1994. Patrick V. Murphy, Acting Assistant Secretary for Aviation and International Affairs.
