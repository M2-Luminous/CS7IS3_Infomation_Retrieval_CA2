Argentine diplomats have always believed that the debt, contracted through the export of trucks and other vehicles to Cuba during Peron's last term, was "irrecoverable." Cuba had offered to Argentina to pay the debt through tourist leasings in the island, as it lacks the cash to pay it. Robaina's visit would take place at the completion of the negotiations undertaken by Cuban diplomats at the Argentine Foreign Ministry to renegotiate the debt.
