A correspondent of Serbian Banja Luka Television today reports about fierce internecine Muslim fighting. The news is that Bosnia-Herzegovina Army forces have launched a seemingly successful counteroffensive. [Unidentified Banja Luka TV correspondent] Following fierce attacks by artillery and infantry, members of the 5th Corps of the so-called Bosnia-Herzegovina Army today inflicted this year's first defeat on the autonomist army. In fighting that continued all last night and this morning, Alija Izetbegovic's soldiers seized all strategically important sites around Pecigrad in the municipality of Cazin, shifting their lines by 1 km toward Velika Kladusa, a town in which around 1,000 citizens of Pecigrad found shelter before the onslaught of Izetbegovic's killers today. Internecine Muslim fighting also took place near Buzim today, where the combatants of the 5th Corps occupied the villages of Sestanovci and Marjanovici. Both sides have reported dozens of casualties.
