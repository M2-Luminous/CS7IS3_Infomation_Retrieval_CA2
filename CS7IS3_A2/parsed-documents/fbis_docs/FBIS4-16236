According to Aliyev, the republic's leadership is now thoroughly considering a new draft agreement set forth by Russia and designed to put an end to the conflict over the Nagorno-Karabakh enclave. Azerbaijan agrees in principle to this document but deems it necessary to amend it with due regard for the republic's remarks and proposals, the president said. "If the Armenian side agrees to them, the document will be signed", Aliyev announced. He expects to meet in Moscow with his Armenian counterpart Levon Ter-Petrosyan. Speaking to newsmen at the Vnukovo airport, the Azeri leader expressed hope that "the present summit will help consolidate the CIS". Azerbaijan attaches great importance to mutual relations between CIS countries, which Aliyev believes should be discussed during the Moscow high-level meeting. We would like our Commonwealth to become more viable in all respects, the Azeri president stressed. He is convinced that the CIS can also have its say in settling the Armenian-Azeri conflict, "it should not just look from aside at the continued bloodshed on Azeri land". Aliyev described the current situation in the conflict zone as extremely grave. It became exacerbated following the fresh offensive launched by Armenian troops on four front segments a few days ago. The fighting resulted in huge casualties on both sides. The Azeri president believes it is high time the warring sides came to see reason. In this connection, he especially counts on assistance from the Commonwealth of Independent States.
