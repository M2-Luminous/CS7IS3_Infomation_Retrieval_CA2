During the speech, she will detail for the first time her clear and resolute approach to a solution of the Cyprus problem. Some 48 hours before her historic speech to the TPP parliamentary group, Ciller made a statement that may have a bearing on the meeting the parliament will hold on the Cyprus problem. Ciller expressed her views as directly as possible: "Several circles are making charges about the Cyprus problem. However, that is a wrong approach." She then continued with her important remarks. Heroic Statements "We have had to deal with that problem for 20 years. It has confronted us as an obstacle everywhere and at every opportunity. Turkey is the country that has suffered most from the state of no solution." Ciller said that she is determined to solve the problem. In fact, she said so in a very clear way: "I am determined to move toward a solution. I shall outline all that when I address the parliament on Tuesday." In her following statement, Ciller seemed to declare war on everyone who has obstructed a solution to the problem. She said: "I have studied past developments. Someone always did something to obstruct a solution to the problem when a settlement was close. Claims are being made that I promised Clinton that I would make a concession. I have not bargained with Clinton on anything. I have not made a concession in return for an economic aid package." Ciller made a prediction on the parliament's meeting tomorrow. She said: "I am aware that they [the deputies] will make heroic speeches tomorrow. However, I am determined this time." What does the Foreign Ministry contemplate on the matter? Ciller said that she had a telephone conversation with Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin yesterday morning. The parliament's meeting tomorrow was the only subject they discussed. The Foreign Ministry Convinced Me What is Hikmet Cetin's opinion on the matter? Prime Minister Ciller said: "I explained all that to Hikmet Cetin in the morning. He maintained similar views. In fact, the Foreign Ministry has convinced me. I held talks with Ambassador Inal Batu in New York and Ambassador Nuzhet Kandemir in Washington. That is how I made up my mind. On no other matter have I agreed with the Foreign Ministry as much as I have agreed with it on this problem." Ciller appealed to the people for a solution to the Cyprus problem. She also gave a guarantee. She said: "Come, let us resolve that problem. Let us remove the great obstacle against Turkey. Turkey is the country that stands to gain most from the solution to that problem. The solution of the Cyprus problem is in the interest of Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots. As the prime minister, I promise that I will safeguard the rights of the Turkish Cypriots." Concluding, Ciller reiterated: "We are closer to a solution than we have ever been before. It will be a pity if we waste that opportunity and fail to resolve the problem. In view of that, I appeal for the support of the people and the parliament." Ciller is the fifth prime minister I have talked with on the Cyprus problem since I have been a journalist. It was the first time I observed a Turkish prime minister maintain such a determined approach on the Cyprus problem. Former President Turgut Ozal expressed similar views in the past. However, his comments were made off the record. His views on the solution of the Cyprus problem were almost similar. He stressed that there was a good opportunity for the settlement of the problem after the Gulf War. The No-Solution Lobby However, Ozal was confronted with a very strong opposition. Everyone is aware of the existence of an "antisolution" lobby in Turkey. In view of that, I believe that Ciller's speech will be confronted with a strong resistance in the parliament tomorrow. However, the initiation for a realistic and calm process to achieve a solution to the Cyprus problem will be useful. It is common knowledge that Turkey is frequently confronted with that problem. So, Turkey has to make a realistic assessment of several of its problems. The Cyprus problem has become a serious factor that obstructs Turkey's important foreign relations and its effort to integrate with Europe. Meanwhile, the effects of the developments in southeastern Turkey on the significant economic crisis in the country must not be underestimated. Bringing all this to light may be embarrassing to many officials. We may even say that we are prepared to give up many things just for the sake of maintaining these problems. I Support Ciller However, we are living in a realistic world. We have observed the effects of the economic crisis on our daily lives. Many of us may not be able to visualize the cost we may have to pay in the near future. Nevertheless, the social wounds and problems that will be created when thousands of people lose their jobs have to be considered beforehand. In view of that, I support Prime Minister Ciller's determination to solve the Cyprus problem. Although I have criticized her on many other issues, I wish to clearly stress that I agree with her on that problem.
