Slovakia signed the association agreement last October. Speaking at a session of the UN European Economic Commission, Magvasi said that Slovakia's economic situation in 1993, the first year of its independence, was influenced by the split of Czechoslovakia and the ensuing split of the currency. The economy was also affected by the taxation reform and recession in advanced Western European countries, he added. Compared with 1992, when the gross domestic product dropped by 7 percent, the estimated decline of 3.7 percent last year was relatively favourable, Magvasi said. He added that consumer prices increased by 15 percent last year against 1992, and that the rate of unemployment had stabilised and reached 14.4 percent at the end of the year. Magvasi said that the fundamental goals of Slovakia's independent monetary policy in 1993 -- stabilisation of the national currency, minimisation of inflationary trends, maintenance of the balance of payments and increasing of convertible currency reserves -- were in harmony with the process of transformation. He said that by the end of 1994 Slovakia would like to accede to the agreement on the cross-border effects of industrial disasters. Magvasi also said that Slovakia would welcome acceleration of the construction of the key "North-South" transport artery which will effectively link the Scandinavian and Baltic states to southern Europe via Poland, Slovakia and Hungary.
