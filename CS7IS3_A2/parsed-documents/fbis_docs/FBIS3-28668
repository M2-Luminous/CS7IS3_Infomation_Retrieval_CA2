With regard to ultranationalist leader Zhirnovskiy, who has been making radical remarks and calling for territorial expansion, Yakovlev said that his influence on the Russian people is small, and his remarks should not be overestimated. Moreover, he said that the term territory has become a painful word to the Russians who lost territories as a result of the collapse of the Soviet Union and that if Japan presses Russia to solve the territorial issue by using such a word, nothing will be solved.
