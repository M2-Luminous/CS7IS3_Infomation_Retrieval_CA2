He was welcomed at Pulkovo airport by city Mayor Anatoliy Sobchak, head of the Leningrad regional administration Aleksandr Belyakov and other officials. St. Petersburg, called Leningrad at that time, was completely surrounded by German troops on September 8, 1941. It then had a population of 2,544,000, but only 800,000 people survived to see the holiday salute marking the city's liberation on Thursday January 27, 1944. About one million people, mostly women and children, were evacuated from the city in the period from January to November 1942 through the only lifeline over Lake Ladoga, 642,000 died from hunger, and about 20,000 were killed during air raids and shellings. The German Air Force and artillery demolished more than 3,000 buildings and damaged more than 7,000. The population of the city voluntarily worked Sundays, a total of 50 million working hours, to restore Leningrad. Its pre-war townscape was practically restored by 1947. From the airport President Yeltsin went to the Piskaryovskoye memorial cemetery to pay homage to hundreds of thousands of Leningraders buried there. Then he will visit the Marino settlement in Kirov district of Leningrad region, where he will be shown the "Lifting of the Leningrad Blockade" Diorama Museum. In the afternoon the president will attend the opening of the all-Russia "salute the victory" folk art festival at the "Oktyabrsky" grand concert hall. President Yeltsin will return to Moscow in the evening of the same day.
