According to broadcast reports from Seoul, the puppet defense ministry is reportedly examining a plan to bring in Patriot missiles from 1997 as part of the next-generation antiair defense project. The puppet defense ministry and the headquarters of the joint chiefs of staff are reportedly pushing ahead with the plan to bring in the Patriot missiles because Nike Hercules and Hawk antiair missiles were brought in more than 20 years ago and, furthermore, there is the need to counter the North's missiles. It was also learned that the puppet defense ministry secretly informed lawmakers of the national defense committee of the puppet national assembly of its plan some days ago. Before the national assembly interpellation session, an opposition lawmaker distributed a script that proved that the puppet defense ministry had included introduction of the Patriot missiles in the SAM-X project starting in 1997. In addition, it was known that the South Korean puppets are carefully examining the introduction of the Russian S-300 PMU missiles. In a script distributed for the national assembly interpellation in advance on 21 February, the puppet defense ministry revealed that it will decide on the ultramodern weapon systems, after conducting a comparative study of similar weapon systems from around the world, and thus hinted that the purchase of the Russian S-300 PMU missiles is under review. This clearly shows how much the South Korean puppets are running amok in the military reinforcement to prepare for a new war and reveals the rascals' antinational, bellicose colors. As is already known, in connection with the criminal acts of the U.S. and South Korean puppets to deploy the Patriot missiles, we cleared our stance on 31 January through the Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement. Voices opposing the deployment of the Patriot missile to South Korea are also strongly resounding among the South Korean people. One example of this is that on 19 February, hundreds of youth, students, and people in Seoul carried out demonstrations shaking their fists to protest the plan of the United States to deploy the Patriot missile to South Korea. They shouted slogans of "Yankees go home!" and "Do not import weapons!" and carried out demonstrations. Nevertheless, the South Korean puppets are planning to drag in the Patriot missile to South Korea at any cost and are even planning to drag in Russian-made missiles. This shows very well what the situation of the rascals' maneuver to prepare for a new war to invade the North is. The maneuver to indiscriminately import missiles by the puppets is an intolerable challenge toward all the people who desire the country's peace and peaceful reunification. It is also an act that can be carried out only by a group of war maniacs running toward the road of war and confrontation. It is clear to anyone that the deployment of up-to-date missiles including the Patriot missile to South Korea will bring about a very dangerous situation in which it will all the more aggravate the tense situation in our country and increase the danger of war. Moreover, launching a criminal maneuver of dragging in up-to-date missiles at a time when violent remarks that enhance war mania are being made everyday among the bellicose elements in the United States and South Korea cannot but be regarded as a grave matter. The Kim Yong-sam ring which is even planning to drag in missiles which are murderous weapons because it lacked even dragging in some 1,000 various nuclear weapons to South Korea to change it into the largest nuclear advance base of the Far East, is a very wicked nation-seller and a warmonger's group that greatly surpasses his predecessors, the military fascist dictatorial maniacs. All facts prove that if the bellicose group such as the Kim Yong-sam ring that does not even hesitate to push the nation toward nuclear calamity is left alone, the danger of war cannot be eliminated in our country. The Kim Yong-sam ring is trying to maintain the remainder of its dirty doomed life by clinging to the outside forces at the price of advancing as the shock brigade of the aggressive policy. However, this is a foolish act. This will only advance their destruction. The Kim Yong-sam ring must contemplate over the grave consequence which the reckless war maneuver will bring about, act with discretion, and immediately stop the maneuver to bring in up-to-date missiles including the Patriot missile.
