Data from the Statistics Institute show that in January 1994, the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which remains the main indicator of inflation in Albania, rose 2.02 percent compared with December 1992. In February, the CPI rose 1.70 percent compared with January. It seems that higher prices for fuel and passenger transportation tickets in particular led to a rise in the index. The high profit levels enjoyed by traders on the market also continues to exert a strong influence on inflation. Before reaching consumers, goods pass through the hands of several traders, which increases their price artificially. It was this phenomenon that obliged the government a short time ago to reverse its policy of price liberalization and impose a price ceiling on sugar. Starting from January, the CPI will be calculated on a new basis. "The year used as a basis for comparison will be 1994 instead of 1990," Statistics Institute specialists told GAZETA SHQIPTARE.
