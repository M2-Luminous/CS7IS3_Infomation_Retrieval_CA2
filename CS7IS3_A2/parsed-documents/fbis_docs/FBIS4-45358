A Foreign Ministry document that contains a protest note from the Panamanian Government to the U.S. Government says that the meeting was held in the area of Puerto Obaldia, San Blas Indian territory. The note points out that the meeting was held on 15 and 16 November 1992 when DEA agents Luis Mercado and Isaac Gallegos went to Puerto Obaldia and met with Colombian and Panamanian police officers. During this meeting, which was not authorized by Panama, the DEA agents covered subjects such as narcotics trafficking, subversion, communications, weapons, police coordination between Panama and Colombia, and public health problems. According to the note, agents Mercado and Gallegos also visited several government offices in Puerto Obaldia, without receiving authorization from Panamanian officials or from the officials responsible for the various areas. The Panamanian Foreign Ministry note advises the United States that all meetings of U.S. officials in Panama must be authorized first by Panamanian officials. The note adds that such actions could lead to an incident, inasmuch as the national authorities have orders not to allow foreign officials from holding meetings in national territory or gathering information without the prior authorization of the officials in charge.
