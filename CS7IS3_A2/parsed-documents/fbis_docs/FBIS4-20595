Ioffe Physico-Technical Institute, St. Petersburg, Russia; and Iwami Higashi, Institute of Physical and Chemical Research] [Text] Doping mechanism has been an actual problem of physics and chemistry of boron-rich compounds. This is a non-standard problem because of their complex lattices. The results of MgAlB[.sub]14[/] structure and doping study are summarized in this paper. MgAlB[.sub]14[/] was prepared by the solution melting method, Fe introduction (2 at%) was made in the process of hot pressing in vacuum. There are two types of voids I and II in the MgAlB[.sub]14[/] lattice: I is occupied by Mg and surrounded by 16 B atoms at 2,379-2,925 Angstrom (filling 78%), II is occupied by Al and surrounded by 12 B atom at 2,0663[sic]-2,824 Angstrom (filling 75%). Thus, the II void has a lower size and a lower symmetry. The Mossbauer spectrum of MgAlB[.sub]14[/] represents a single line (isomer shift � = 0,12mms[.sup]-1[/] and doublet (� = 1,8mms[.sup]-1[/], quadropoule splitting _D_ = 1mms[.sup]-1[/]. This means that Fe[.sup]+3[/] localized in I voids instead of Mg is a donor but Fe[.sup]+2[/] localized in II voids is an acceptor. The concentration ratio Fe[.sup]+3[/]/Fe[.sup]+2[/] = 3:1 which, as a result of compensation, leads to donor action. It is supported by the thermoelectric power: S = 400 �VK[.sup]-1[/] and 10 �VK[.sup]- 1[/] (300K) for undoped and doped material, respectively.
