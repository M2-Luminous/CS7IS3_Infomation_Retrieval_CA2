Members of the Emiliano Zapata Peasant Organization (Organizacion Campesina Emiliano Zapata--OCEZ), who belong to the pro-government Ayala Plan National Coordinating Board (OCEZ/CNPA), occupied the mayor's office in Chanal Municipality, and demanded the dismissal of local authorities who they claim are corrupt. Peasants and town residents have occupied another eight mayor offices in Chiapas for over a week. They are demanding the construction of public works or the dismissal of municipal authorities. In Chilon, another Chiapas municipality, some 600 peasants peacefully occupied 18 farms encompassing 3,000 hectares. They are claiming property rights to the land, while the National Coordinating Board of Indian Peoples (Coordinadora Nacional de Pueblos Indios--CNPI) did the same thing on 11 farms encompassing 14,000 hectares in Bachajon. Oscar Romeo Perez Cordova, a member of the Chilono Attorney General's Office, said he has received at least 18 complaints of land occupations from the land owners daily. The CNPI declared, for its part, that the lands occupied in Bachajon belong to its members, who were stripped of their land by ranchers and cattlemen of the region. The social unrest in Chiapas lies within the framework of the armed revolt of the EZLN, which in a recent communique urged the people to oust all the municipality mayors claiming they are illegitimate.
