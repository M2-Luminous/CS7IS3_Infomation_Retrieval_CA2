The Parliament feels that little or no account is being taken of its wish for institutional changes to allow a Union with 16 member states to function smoothly. Various speakers warned the Council of Ministers, which is leading the negotiations, that it was playing with fire by neglecting Parliament's complaints. They were referring to the Parliament's power to prevent enlargement. Fernand Herman (PSC) [Social Christian Party] best summed up the feelings of many MEP's [members of the European Parliament] when he said that it was not a question of being for or against the four countries. "On the contrary, in the entire Parliament there is probably nobody against the membership of new member states," he said. "The question is just whether the new members are joining under conditions which would allow the Union to act as effectively as it does at present." Many MEP's are convinced that a purely mechanical modification of the institutional rules, with every new member state getting a commissioner, some seats in Parliament and (weighted) voting rights in the Council, would be inadequate and only increase the chances of deadlock. But so far the Council has taken no account of Parliament's concerns, which have been aired on past occasions, and yesterday that put many MEP's in a touchy mood. In his reaction the Greek Council President Theodoros Pangalos pointed out that the negotiations had taken place on the basis of the Maastricht Treaty right from the beginning. "A treaty change does not take place during negotiations on enlargement, but at a special conference of the governments of the member states called together for that purpose," Pangalos said. In reality the Parliament realizes that. But, in exchange for its agreement to enlargement, it wants to win guarantees on the working methods of the 1996 conference on treaty changes, and participation in it. Following the Maastricht Treaty, the Parliament still has no decisive voice in treaty changes. Not much was revealed about the progress of the enlargement negotiations yesterday. Commissioner Hans van den Broek let it be known that he doubted whether the negotiations with the four countries could be completed by 1 March. The agricultural issue was becoming hard work, van den Broek said, and at the end of the negotiations budget contributions must be discussed. He said he could not guarantee all four countries would make a net contribution to the European budget, which the present member states had originally hoped for.
