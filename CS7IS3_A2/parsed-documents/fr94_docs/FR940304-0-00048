The cost of updated books will be an ongoing expense. Training costs will be recurring to the extent that staff turnover will occur. Coding costs will be ongoing. However, we believe that coding time and costs will probably be reduced with experience. Section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a final rule will have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. Such an analysis must conform to the provisions of section 604 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital as a hospital that is located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has fewer than 50 beds. We are not preparing a rural impact statement since we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this final rule will not have an impact on a significant number of small rural hospitals.
