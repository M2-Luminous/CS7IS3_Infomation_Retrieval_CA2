The oblast, in turmoil at the constant change of leaders (this is no joke, last year they changed governors three times!), has again been sent into a spin. In the local mass media and at meetings with the voters deputies of the Russian Federal Assembly -- Petr Shirshov, former chairman of Bryansk City Soviet, Oleg Shenkarev, leader of the Russian Federation Communist Party oblast organization, and other opponents of the course of reforms -- have been trying to mobilize public opinion in favor of reinstating the communist Yuriy Lodkin, previously ousted by the president, to the post of governor. The oblast duma cannot expand indefinitely. It has 27 seats. One-hundred-and-fifty-two deputies want to occupy them. Furthermore, it is mainly economic managers and leaders of production who wanted to contest those seats. A real danger emerged that instead of a constructive body here there might be a recurrence of the old party-economic aktiv. This, of course, was bound to affect the voters' attitude. Emerging from the woodwork, the partyocrats and opponents of the radical transformation of the country bombarded people with a torrent of propaganda that has been so well rehearsed in the past. Leaflets appeared in Bryansk "advising" voters to vote unfailingly for the communists and, of course, against the oblast Charter, which has been submitted to the residents' verdict. Such a familiar "corrupt leadership," such a familiar method! Victory at any price -- that is the usual principle of the opponents of the reforms. But it seems that the "champions of the people's well-being" had not given any thought to what actual work they would do on the voters' behalf should they happen to win. For example, how did Federation Council Deputy Petr Shirshov, recently elected chairman of the CIS Countries' Defense Committee, plan physically and geographically to combine that job with his work in the oblast duma? After all, Petr Petrovich was so busy that he could not even attend a prearranged news conference, and the candidate sent an assistant to represent his interests. Do these factors not explain the unprecedentedly low turnout of voters in Bryansk? By the end of polling none of the city electoral districts had managed to pass the necessary 25-percent target. It was only the turnout among rural inhabitants which made the elections in the oblast valid.
