The meeting was attended by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Vladimirovich Kozyrev, presidential aide Dmitriy Pyurikov and U.S. Ambassador in Moscow Thomas Pickering, according to the INTERFAX NEWS SERVICE. On Tuesday, Brown met with Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. Chernomyrdin told Brown that some import tariffs would be revised, mostly concerning previously agreed contracts whose implementation may be affected by the government's plans for the introduction of new import duties. Chernomyrdin added that the import duties on leasing two U.S. Boeing planes and various technologies will also be liable for revision. And he revealed that large quantities of inferior foodstuffs had been delivered to Russia, which has resulted in hundreds of poisoning cases. However, despite the change in tariffs Chernomyrdin called on foreign investors not to be afraid of the Russian market, as there is potential for considerable, and beneficial, joint activities. He explained that Russia is prepared for foreign investors to operate in its market place and that supporting legislation was being prepared. The prime minister also discussed with Brown broader access for Russian products to the West and said that Russia could guarantee delivery. "The recent decision to allow a delivery of Russian uranium to the United States was a breakthrough," he added. In reply Brown said that both the U.S. Government and the country's private sector are keen to support Russian reforms, but stressed that at the same time Russia should provide legislation to protect potential investors and iron out tax and tariff problems. Brown's visit to Russia comes at a time when trade exchanges between the two countries are expanding; U.S. exports to Russia reached 3 billion U.S. dollars in 1993, 40 percent more than the previous year, while last year U.S. imports from Russia grew by 262 percent to 1.7 billion dollars. Nevertheless, U.S. investment in Russia is still relatively very small, currently running at only one billion dollars. But according to Brown the United States believes there is great potential for increased capital investment, especially in the oil and gas industry. During his five-day stay in Moscow, Brown is expected to sign four trade documents with Russia. They include regulations for setting up a committee on the promotion of Russian-U.S. business cooperation, regulations for the establishment of U.S. funded business centers, a joint statement on bilateral trading relations, personnel training and standardization, and an agreement on making U.S. medicines available to the Russian market.
