He said none of the government agencies including the government, Finance Ministry, or NBB were making preparations for the union. Even the draft of an appropriate banking agreement is still pending discussion by experts, he said. The official went on to say that for the time being, talks were under way between officials of the NBB and Central Bank of Russia to discuss the creation of a payment union on the basis of the two countries' currencies. (The appropriate draft was sent to Belarus last month). The official said NBB President Stanislau Bagdankevich was still opposed to the endorsement of the agreement's Chapter 5, which provides for the abolition of the NBB. Nor does Bagdankevich accept the idea of a single budget or financing the country's deficit at the cost of credits from Russia's Finance Ministry. Head of the Belarussian finance ministry's budget department Ivan Zayash in an interview with INTERFAX ruled out any monetary union as it was originally conceived by the April agreement by 1 July on the grounds that some of its provisions had not been met yet. The two countries are still to decide how to unify their cash and non-cash resources and at what rate as well as how their budgets would function following the unification. More importantly, Moscow has so far granted only 10 billion rubles out of its promised 500 billion rubles credit to Belarus. It has now reaffirmed sending a further 50 billion rubles.
