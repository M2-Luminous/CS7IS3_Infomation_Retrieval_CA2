However, it seems that the United States is waging a fierce campaign through its secretary of state, Warren Christopher, to block the international community's will and continue the unjust blockade against Iraq. The Chinese representative to the Security Council has called on the Council to recognize the very positive developments represented by Iraq's implementation of the resolutions. He proposed passing a resolution on a partial lifting of the blockade. The Russian representative also spoke about the need to give Iraq the chance for further cooperation. For his part, the British representative admitted that progress is taking place and that the report which Ekeus submitted to the Council two days ago was encouraging. According to political observers, China, France, and Russia are exerting pressure toward lifting the blockade for "humanitarian and commercial" reasons. If we also add the British admission that Iraq is cooperating with the Security Council, it becomes clear that the United States has been left alone and is completely isolated. The international community is surrounding it from all sides to make it lift the unfair blockade on Iraq. A quick review of what has happened, recalls to memory the odious hostility which has characterized U.S. policy. Washington has secured resolutions from the Security Council to impose a blockade on Iraq and to carry out its criminal military aggression. It has done all that in the name of the international community and international legitimacy. And now that Iraq has fulfilled its obligations under Resolution 687 and approved permanent monitoring under Resolution 715 and now that Rolf Ekeus has acknowledged Iraq's full cooperation with UNSCOM, Washington cannot continue resisting the will of the international community, refusing to implement Clause 22 of Resolution 687 and calling "for the need to continue the blockade against Iraq." This U.S. double standard has been exposed. It must be said that the international community cannot continue forever following this reckless U.S. policy. The international community is inclined toward adopting a rational policy that acknowledges the interests of its nations, including those of Iraq, and takes into consideration the question of international peace and stability. The world understands that Iraq is the difficult figure in the region and that it is essential to deal with it with rationality, consideration, and good will. Any form of aggression or threat of aggression against Iraq will be useless. Iraq is strong by its symbol leader Saddam Husayn, its brave people, its experience, and great history. In view of all that, it must be said that the United States must adopt a different policy toward Iraq, taking into consideration the will of the international community and the lessons of past experiences. Armies and fleets will not scare Iraq, and the blockade will not weaken its will. Warren Christopher will see how the blockade will be defeated and how the will of good forces -- the will of Iraq and the freedom and peace-loving peoples -- will triumph.
