In a press interview the Armenian president claimed that 500 Turkish officers and some 1,000 officers and noncommissioned officers from the former Soviet republics are currently training the new Azerbaijani Army, which has recently achieved some success in the war, which has been going on for six years. Levon Ter-Petrosyan says that he has received assurances from London that there are no British "mercenaries" with the Azerbaijan Armed Forces. There have been reports that Western oil companies which have interests in Azerbaijan are recruiting Britons to help the Baku government recover the land it has lost to the Armenians. According to Western sources, the Armenians are occupying about 20 percent of Azerbaijan's territory. Nearly 1 million Azerbaijanis, that is one-sixth of the country's population, have been driven out of their cities and villages. Many of them are refugees on the border with Iran. Ter-Petrosyan said that the West and Russia must work together to end the conflict before it expands to include the entire region. Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan concludes a four-day visit to Britain today. At a working breakfast yesterday the president answered questions put to him by AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: [Taheri] What is the aim of your visit to London? [Ter-Petrosyan] The main aim of my visit is to ask British Prime Minister John Major to raise the issue of Nagorno-Karabakh during his upcoming visit to Moscow. He has agreed to renew peace endeavors. [Taheri] What exactly do you want to see happen in Nagorno-Karabakh? [Ter-Petrosyan] The ideal formula is for the people of Nagorno-Karabakh to obtain their right to self-determination. However, I am aware that the ideal formula cannot always be achieved. This is why we are looking for a compromise formula to end the war. We proposed that this aim be attained in three stages: First, a cease-fire. Second, consolidating the legal status of Nagorno-Karabakh through international arbitration, and that should be done in a manner that does not allow Azerbaijan to revoke or reverse the decision. And finally, lifting the blockade Azerbaijan is imposing on Armenia so as to coincide with the Armenian forces' withdrawal from the Azerbaijani territory it is currently occupying. [Taheri] You maintain that your government is not interfering in the Nagorno-Karabakh war. In what circumstances will you intervene? [Ter-Petrosyan] An all-out war will take place if the Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh are exposed to the danger of mass deportation or mass murder. [Taheri] Is that likely to happen? [Ter-Petrosyan] I hope not. But we have behind us a stormy and harsh history and we must always be on our guard. [Taheri] Did you expect the current state of war and the terrible suffering inflicted on all parties when you set up the "Nagorno-Karabakh Committee" some six years ago? [Ter-Petrosyan] Looking back from today's position often sheds a different light on historic events. However, let me tell you that we did not invent the Nagorno-Karabakh problem. It has existed since Stalin decided to offer it as a gift to Azerbaijan in 1921. The situation was going to explode there whether or not Armenia made a move. [Taheri] It seems that you want a special role for Russia in the region. Does that mean the effective return of "big brother" to the field? [Ter-Petrosyan] Yes. I must say that I understand that. There are Russian forces in all the former Soviet republics except Azerbaijan, Ukraine, and Belarus. Russia will return because it can see that other players are trying to control its zones of influence. [Taheri) What do you mean by "other players?" [Ter-Petrosyan] NATO forces, and regionally Turkey and Iran. [Taheri] How would you assess these players' role? [Ter-Petrosyan] The United States accepts Russia playing a peacekeeping role -- which is important. But Turkey and Iran have not achieved what they had hoped to achieve years ago, for example. [Taheri] What about your relationship with Iran and Turkey? [Ter-Petrosyan] Iran is a friendly state and a close partner. I am confident that that our relationship will deepen further. Iran has been neutral in the Nagorno-Karabakh issue, even though its public opinion naturally sympathizes with their Shiite Muslims in Azerbaijan. The West sees Iran as a state exporting fundamentalism. But it is in our region. Although it is an Islamic republic, it does not side with the Azerbaijani Shiites, whereas Turkey --- the secular government -- is 100 percent behind Azerbaijan. We want normal relations with Turkey, because it is our neighbor. But Turkish leaders -- so it seems -- cannot act against the feelings aroused against us by the media services and other pressure groups there. Nevertheless, we will not give up hope. We wish to establish normal relations, regardless of the harsh past. [Taheri] You dealt with several Azerbaijani presidents, including Ayaz Mutalibov, Geydar Aliyev, and Abdulfaz Elchibey. What is your opinion of these men? [Ter-Petrosyan] We had positive dealings with Mutalibov, but he was overthrown. Elchibey was the best one for us, because he angered both Iran and Russia, thus imposing isolation on himself. He naively played the Turkish nationalism card. Aliyev is the more intelligent and experienced. And he is trying to repair relations between Iran and Russia. [Taheri] What is the role of oil in this conflict? [Ter-Petrosyan] Azerbaijan has oil, and we get nothing from it. The West and Russia are interested in Azerbaijan's oil -- which is understood. But utilizing oil sources requires securing peaceful conditions first. Which is why everyone is seeking to end the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh. [Taheri] You are subject to an Azerbaijani blockade. Where do you obtain vital supplies from? [Ter-Petrosyan] Through Iran and Georgia by land and air. Of course, what we get is not sufficient, and our economy is suffering as a result of this situation. The blockade has prevented us from rebuilding what the earthquakes destroyed in cities and villages and putting the wheel of industry on the right track again. Our people are suffering a great deal. This reality is being exploited by former communists and other enemies of democracy. [Taheri] I sense from your statements that you are pessimistic. Are we to understand that economic difficulties are compelling you to take a reconciliatory position on Nagorno-Karabakh? [Ter-Petrosyan] We have economic difficulties, but I am not broke. As for the reconciliatory position, we agreed on the framework set by the peace agreement in Minsk, and we insist on its speedy implementation. Our region needs peace more than anything else today. Everyone in our region wants peace. [Taheri] A personal question: You and Kyrgyzstan President Askar Akayev are the only presidents in the former Soviet republics who have never been affiliated to the Comminist Party. Do you feel lonely and isolated at present? [Ter-Petrosyan] Even Akayev was a member of the Communist Party, but he was not among the high cadre. So I am really lonely. But all the people of Armenia support me.
