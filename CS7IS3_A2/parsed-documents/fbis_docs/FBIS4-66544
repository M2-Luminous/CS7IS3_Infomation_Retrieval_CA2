Commission on Human Rights today, called on the world community to wake up to the dangers posed by terrorism, and asked for its understanding of the problems that India faced from terrorism. At a press conference later, Dr. Singh, renewed the Government's call to Pakistan for a dialogue on Kashmir, stating that this was the "only course open" to restore peace. At the Commission's conference, he declared: "As we see it, our struggle against terrorism is part of a worldwide struggle to promote the rule of law as against the rule of the gun." He appealed to the world for "sympathy, understanding and support in our struggle against terrorism," and warned that the "world community must wake up before it is too late. Speaking two days after the Pakistani Prime Minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto's attack on the Indian policy on Kashmir, Dr. Singh focussed on the impact that Pakistani aid to Kashmiri separatism was having on India. "It is terrorism of unparalleled ferocity that we have been seeing in some parts of India. The sponsorship of terrorist violence from abroad, in blatant pursuit of territorial gains, seeks to destroy our secular, democratic, pluralistic civil order. The goal has been pursued with ruthlessness at the cost of thousands of lives...the misery inflicted by terrorists on peaceful citizens should be obvious from the fact that nearly 30,000 Indian citizens, both Hindu and Muslim, have had to flee their homes to other parts of India and have become refugees in their own homeland." Admits losses of security forces: Significantly, Dr. Singh acknowledged lapses on the part of the security forces. "It is not the claim of the Government of India, indeed no country and no Government can make such a claim, that no human rights violations ever occur in our territory. We are conscious that some abberations on the part of the law-enforcing authorities can and do take place particularly in confronting terrorism. We have no desire to put these aberrations under the carpet. We do, however, claim that we have an unswerving commitment to human rights and that we have in our legal system an effective remedial framework, as well as a strong tradition of punishing human rights violations wherever they are found to occur." Red Cross may be allowed: He also announced a further relaxation of the Government's earlier position of not letting foreign observers and human rights organisations into Jammu and Kashmir. The International Commission of Jurists has been the first international organisation to receive permission to go to Kashmir, and the International Committee of the Red Cross might be the next allowed in. Modalities of visits by the Red Cross were being discussed. Dr. Singh only made a brief reference to Ms. Bhutto's speech, when he said, "It is most unfortunate that the distinguished Prime Minister of Pakistan, for whom we have great respect and regard, has used this forum to convey a wholly erroneous view of the state of affairs in the Indian State of Jammu and Kashmir...it is our sincere hope that this forum will not be used to politicise the human rights issues." At the press conference, Dr. Singh, firmly ruled out the Pakistani suggestion for an independent team of outside investigators to look into whether Pakistan was sponsoring terrorism. "This is not something that requires proof. There are any number of reports, including from the U.S. Congress that documents this," he said.
