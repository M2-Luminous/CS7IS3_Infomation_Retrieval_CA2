Missouri Basin Municipal Power Agency [Docket No. IR&hyph;1096&hyph;001] Notice is hereby given that the Missouri Basin Municipal Power Agency (Missouri Basin) has filed on September 16, 1994, pursuant to Section 292.402 of the Commission's Regulations, a petition for waiver of certain obligations imposed under Sections 292.303(a) and 292.303(b) of the Commission's Regulations (18 CFR Part 292, Subpart C) which implement Section 210 of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA). Missouri Basin has duly implemented the Commission's PURPA Regulations by filing a PURPA implementation plan on March 1, 1982. Missouri Basin requests a waiver on behalf of its 58 member municipalities located in the states of Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota (Members). Specifically, Missouri Basin seeks a waiver of the requirement contained in 18 CFR 292.303(a) which would require these member electric cooperatives to purchase power made available from any qualifying facility (QF) and of the obligation in 18 CFR 292.303(b) which would require Missouri Basin to make sales to any QF.
