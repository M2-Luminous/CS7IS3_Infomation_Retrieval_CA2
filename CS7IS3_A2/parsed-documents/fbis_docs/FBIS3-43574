The spokesman noted that the last meeting between the SSA and the SNA was the one held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in December, and that there had never been any other meeting since. Dr. Hasan Ali described such reports as having emanated from people who did not (?know) the truth, the methodology of journalism, or the right of a person to express factual truths. Dr. Mireh said that the SSA committee for negotiations responsible for talking with the SNA is meeting unilaterally in Mogadishu, and is streamlining ways of continuing with December's Addis Ababa talks.
