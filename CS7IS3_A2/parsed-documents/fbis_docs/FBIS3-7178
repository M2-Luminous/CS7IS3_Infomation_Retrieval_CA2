(Toward a new era of friendship and cooperation) The honorable Takako Doi, speaker of the House of Representatives, the honorable Bunbei Hara, president of the House of Councilors, distinguished members of both houses of the Diet, Today, I have the honor of standing on the podium of the Diet, a major symbol of Japanese democracy. I am especially moved by this because I have been a firm believer in parliamentary democracy all my life. First, I would like to take this opportunity to convey warm and friendly greetings from the Korean people to the people of Japan. I am grateful to you for having arranged this significant occasion for me. And I salute you for pressing ahead with political reforms in your country. Distinguished members of the Diet, It was 100 years ago, in 1894, that Japan and China fought against each other on the Korean peninsula. Having won this Sino-Japanese war, Japan eventually crushed Korea under its feet. Though Korea was liberated in 1945, it was quickly divided into the South and the North and subsequently suffered a horrible fratricidal war. Korea still bears the national pain of being the only and last divided land on earth. As such, Korea-Japan relations for the past 100 years have tended to be marked more by strife and friction than by goodwill and cooperation. On behalf of the people of the Republic of Korea, I hereby propose to you and the Japanese people that we close this century of strife and friction and open a new era of genuine bilateral friendship and cooperation. In recent times, the Japanese people have achieved glistening national development. I believe the spirit of hard work and the unity of the Japanese people have combined with outstanding government and business leadership to make Japan as it is today. Japanese citizens from all walks of life greatly encouraged and supported me during the difficult times of my struggles for democracy. The steady advancement of Japanese democracy inspired me with the confidence that democracy could thrive in the Republic of Korea also, and I was able to refute the allegations that Asian soil was not fit for democracy to take root. I came also to be convinced that rapid growth could be achieved under democracy. It is my belief that increasingly close ties have been developing between the Republic of Korea and Japan on the strength of our shared ideals not only of market economics but of democracy as well. Over the past year, the Republic of Korea has pursued drastic change and reform in all aspects of national life. In particular, our determination to carry out political reforms and root out misconduct and corruption has never wavered. The enforcement of the law requiring public officials to register and disclose their assets has eliminated room for corruption among government officials and politicians. The real-name financial transaction system has severed collusive links between politics and business. Political reform bills have become law, fundamentally transforming electoral practices and political behavior. Korean democracy has thus come of age. Political reforms in both Korea and Japan are sparking reforms throughout Asia. Prime Minister Hosokawa and I have congratulated each other on the successful pursuit of reforms in each other's country. This is fostering a fine tradition of amity between the leaders of Korea and Japan. I would like to take this occasion to pay tribute to you once more for having embarked on an avenue to reforms in response to a call of the times. Distinguished members of the Diet, citizens of Japan, The world is now changing ever more rapidly. It is moving away from an age of distrust and confrontation and into an era of reconciliation and cooperation. Our planet is shrinking into one global village. National borders are being lowered, and global and regional cooperation is gaining force. The prediction of Toynbee that 21st century would be a Pacific century is coming true. Koreans and Japanese should now share new dreams -- dreams of a new Korea-Japan relationship, of a new Asia-Pacific region, of a new world. We should share a lofty and grand vision encompassing the spacious Pacific that can strike a responsive chord in the minds of two billion Asians. We must work together with a new attitude in order to realize such dreams. Saneatsu Mushanokoji, a noted Japanese novelist, painted a tomato and an eggplant on a large white dish and wrote on it: "I am I, you are you, but we should get along." But we should move beyond the implications of this beautiful work of art. Now is the time to build a larger regional community with a spirit of coexistence and shared prosperity, even while maintaining our own identities and diversity. In this way, we should be able to March into an Asia-Pacific age of peace and prosperity. Distinguished members of the Diet, Now, the peoples of Korea and Japan must open their hearts and minds to each other. We must put the past completely behind us. The Korean people are willing to look ahead and build a brighter future. To help forge a new Korea-Japan relationship crucial to ushering in a new Asia-Pacific age, the Japanese people should also muster the courage to squarely face the truths of history and live up to their lessons. We must not allow emotional residue or ethnic prejudices to remain unabated and obstruct the development of a mature bilateral partnership. In this context, I believe it is very important to promote goodwill and amity between the Korean residents in Japan and Japanese citizens. We have a saying in Korea which goes, "your neighbors are your cousins." Korea and Japan have long been "cousins." Should such close neighbors fail to build genuine mutual trust, it would be difficult for them to win the trust of others. Our two countries must now forge new ties of cooperation with new attitudes and new visions. The imperatives of the post-Cold War international situation urgently call for such a cooperative relationship. In particular, complementary bilateral economic cooperation is a mandate of the new times. We must endeavor to build ties of economic cooperation according to economic, rather than political, logic. Distinguished members of the Diet, Our two nations should work closely together to remove impediments to the peace and prosperity of this region with a new spirit of mutual trust and cooperation. In this regard, I take this occasion to thank your country for cooperating with us in the efforts to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue. The Republic of Korea firmly adheres to the position that the terms of the South-North Joint Declaration of the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula must be implemented without fail. We have thus been patiently endeavoring to peacefully resolve the North Korean nuclear issue through dialogue. Recently, however, North Korea has dishonored its international commitments: It has not only failed to properly deal with IAEA inspections but has also unilaterally broken off South-North dialogue. It is most regrettable that in that way the North has exacerbated suspicions about its nuclear intentions. Both the Korean and Japanese peoples have acutely experienced the horrors of war. Japan is the first and only country ever to suffer a nuclear attack. Korea is the first country to undergo a fratricidal ideological war. Spurred on by this shared bitter experience, we must strive together to take the lead in building lasting peace throughout this region. We must cooperate even more closely to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and bring under control arms races in the Asia-Pacific region. The time has come to initiate multilateral cooperation to ease tension and promote the common security of this region. Korea and Japan should also more closely pull together to induce openness and reform in North Korea and to promote the cause of peaceful unification of South and North Korea. Korean unification would greatly contribute not only to easing regional tension but also to boosting regional exchange and cooperation. This would serve to develop northeast Asia into the hub of prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region. My view is that such developments would certainly be in the national interest of Japan as well. I am certain that a unified Korea would be a trustworthy partner for Japan. I hope the people and Government of Japan will even more actively support Korean unification. Last but not least, I want to emphasize that our two countries must work closely together to promote coexistence among and the shared prosperity of all countries in the Asia-Pacific region. My view is that the future of the Asia-Pacific will be largely swayed by the triangular cooperative ties among Korea, the United States and Japan as well as cooperation among all Asian nations. The triad of Korea, the U.S. and Japan is the key to the coexistence among and shared prosperity of Asian nations and is central to the development of a Pacific community. By furthering these ties of cooperation, our two countries should be able to advance the peace and prosperity of Asia as a whole. Moreover, such efforts would lead to an early materialization of an Asia-Pacific community. The Republic of Korea is willing to join forces with Japan and China in playing responsible roles to that end. The world is keenly watching Japan's efforts to sharply change its course: Changes in Japan are bound to have a major impact not only on Asia but also on the world at large. As long as each and every member of the international community remains obsessed solely with its own prosperity, we will hardly be able to develop the whole world on a genuinely communal basis. Without a balanced development of this region, we can hardly expect genuine regional peace. To this end, we must also redress any excessive and persistent imbalance in economic relations between nations. Korea, Japan and China must join forces to play a joint central role to create a new Asia that will be able to contribute ever more greatly to the betterment of mankind. In the past century, the Pacific was often battered by political typhoons and quakes. Anticipating a Pacific age in the early 21st century, Korea and Japan should take joint responsibility for leading the effort to turn the Pacific into an ocean of peace and prosperity. To that end, it is imperative first to make the strait that divides our two countries into a sea of friendship and cooperation. I believe that before long, Koreans and Japanese will be able to travel to each others' countries as if they were traveling around their own lands. I believe that Tokyo, Seoul and Beijing will become truly next-door neighbors in the near future. Let us dash together toward that goal. I hope from the bottom of my heart that my speech today will be a new landmark in our progress toward a genuine Korea-Japan partnership. Thank you.
