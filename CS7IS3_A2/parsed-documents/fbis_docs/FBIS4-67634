Julia Birkbeck, 19, died within an hour of admission to Addenbrooke's hospital but Paul Bentley, 21, is responding to treatment. The students and staff who were in contact with them over the past seven days were traced by the Cambridge Health Authority and given antibiotics. Miss Birkbeck had been rowing on the Cam the previous day but the authority discounted the river as the source of the infection and said it was possible that a small dinner attended by Miss Birkbeck and Mr Bentley in college on Saturday night held the key to the outbreak of the severe meningococcal version of the disease. Suggestions that the Cam was the source of a bacterial infection which attacked three women members of a Cambridge college boat crew earlier this week, causing their hands to swell to twice their normal size, were similarly denied. Miss Birkbeck, from Glasgow, was a first-year modern language student at Girton College and all-round athlete. She took part in an energetic row with her college eight on Monday complaining of a headache before becoming sicker that night. She was admitted to the hospital's intensive care at 7:30 am on Tuesday and died an hour later. Mr. Bentley, from Essex, a medical student at Gonville and Caius College who was admitted three hours later, was said to be improving. Dr Roger Buttery, a Cambridge Health Authority consultant in communicable disease control, said more than 100 contacts of the two students had received an antibiotic prophylactic and been told to contact their GPs if symptoms of meningitis occurred. He said: "There is no possibility the outbreak had anything to do with the Cam, though we constantly stress that people shouldn't jump in because any river is infected. Whether the dinner party was a relevant connection with the outbreak is uncertain." Sarah Key, the dead woman's senior tutor, said: "She was so strong and so vital, it's almost impossible to think she has just died." [passage omitted] COPYRIGHT: TIMES NEWSPAPERS LIMITED, 1994
