The social snapshot provided by this is quite sufficient to arrive at certain conclusions regarding the current life of the "average" Maritime Kray resident. The latest survey showed that as of 1 April monetary income per family member has increased somewhat and amounts to 120,420 rubles [R]. Of this amount, 40 percent goes for food, and this expense continues to grow. Prices grew at a slower rate in March and even fell with respect to some products; this to a certain extent increased their consumption in some families. For instance, consumption of meat and meat products increased by 200 g, milk--by 700 g, and eggs--by three eggs. At the same time, consumption of fish and fish products declined because of higher prices. The statistics also registered that of the 12 groups of monitored basic foodstuffs, only potato consumption remains at the rational norm level (8.8 kg a month per person). As to meat and milk products, fish, vegetables and fruit, their consumption lags below the norm by a factor of 1.5 to three. The cost of the physiological maintenance minimum in March amounted to R96,149; 38 percent of kray residents have income below this level. Among them are first and foremost pensioners, whose average monthly pension amounted to only R43,000. Differentiation of the population by level of income and material situation may be seen from the table. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Kray population a-|in percent |families (thousan-| | |s of 1 April 1994 | |ds) | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Total |2,287 |100 |716 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Including with pe-| | | | |r capita monthly | | | | |income, rubles | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |up to 5,000 |9.1 |0.4 |2.9 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |5,001-10,000 |4.6 |0.2 |1.4 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |10,001-25,000 |86.9 |3.8 |27.2 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |25,001-40,000 |118.9 |5.2 |37.2 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |40,001-50,000 |80.0 |3.5 |25.1 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |50,001-70,000 |189.8 |8.3 |59.4 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |70,001-80,000 |153.3 |6.7 |48.0 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |80,001-96,150 |228.7 |10.0 |71.6 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |96,150-100,000 |73.2 |3.2 |22.9 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |100,001-200,000 |1,010.9 |44.2 |316.5 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |200,001-400,000 |288.2 |12.6 |90.2 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |over 400,000 |43.2 |1.9 |13.6 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- As we can see, there is considerable stratification of the kray population by income level. It should be noted that if the "poverty line" is defined as R96,000 and 38 percent of the kray population are below it, we can hardly call the situation of those with an income between R96,000 and R200,000 enviable. And such people account for 47 percent of the kray population. We should not assume, however, that the number of wealthy people with an income of R400,000 in the kray is precisely as the table shows. This is only the official data. In reality, there are many more rich people in the kray, but they do not particularly wish to advertise their income.
