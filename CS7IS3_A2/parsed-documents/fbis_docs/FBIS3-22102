The newly created bureau is a police organization with all the respective rights--to conduct operative work, to collect information, to arrest, and to implement searches, Bureau Chief Vilnis Kipens told DIENA today. The state police of all countries have a special department for dealing with drug addiction, he said. Foreign experts have acknowledged that in Latvia, which due to its geographical position is situated in the middle of all drug trafficking routes, narcobusiness is developing more quickly than in other countries. Moreover, since the chemical and pharmaceutical industries in Latvia are highly developed, a center for the Baltic states to combat drug addiction should be situated right here in Riga. "The problem of drug addiction in Latvia is not yet as alarming as in other foreign countries; however, the bureau was established just to keep abreast, and not to find ourselves in a situation of `running after the train.' Usually we begin to organize things only when the water is already flowing into our mouths," said Kipens. The bureau was officially opened on 22 February. Thus far it has 31 policemen on its staff. The bureau has two departments--one is the Riga department, consisting fully of the former seventh section of the Riga Criminal Police (for combating drug addiction), which will fight drug addiction in Riga. The general department will supervise chemical and pharmaceutical plants, the airport, and the seaport. We are also planning regional groups, cooperation with customs officers and national guards, with neighboring countries--Lithuania, which consistently supplies Latvia with poppies, Kaliningrad, as well as Ukraine and Russia, through which the drugs from the Caucasus and the Middle East are being delivered, stated V. Kipens. The latest report from the Interior Affairs Ministry says that on 10 March the bureau officers arrested three persons in a drug den on Zentene street 14 and confiscated drugs. At a similar spot on Maskavas street 285/2 on the same day five persons were arrested. V. Kipens emphasized that during a drug-induced craze, drug addicts are capable of committing any crime. On the night of 12 March, a group of drug addicts was arrested in the center of Riga. Besides drugs, the policemen discovered in their car a set of tools for breaking into cars, and a hand grenade. During the same night, one man was arrested in Riga in a state of narcotic intoxication, with two full syringes. The Bureau for Combating Drug Addiction appeals to the population of Latvia to inform the bureau about anyone having information on drug dens by calling the following numbers: 208478 or 208473.
