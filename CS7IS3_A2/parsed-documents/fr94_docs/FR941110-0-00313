FR941110-0-00313 FR941110-0-00019 One commenter argued that no resident consultation at all should be required for newly-developed vacant units, but the Department sees no justification for exempting such units from the requirement that pertains to vacant units in general. As a further provision in the direction of more local flexibility, the final rule deletes the interim rule's requirement for a public hearing, leaving it to the HA and the residents to work out methods of consultation that they find most appropriate and productive. While a public hearing may be advisable for larger undertakings, relatively informal consultation may be more appropriate in other situations. One commenter mistakenly asserted that ``there is no mention of resident involvement prior to implementation''. On the contrary, the interim rule strongly emphasized the requirement for resident input during the planning stage, and that requirement remains unchanged in the final rule. Sections 905.1006/906.6␣(Property That May Be Sold) In paragraph (a) of §§905.1006/906.6 ( Property that may be sold ), the final rule corrects the interim rule's unintended indication that only conventional rental units would be eligible for sale under the Section 5(h) Program. The final rule notes that a homeownership plan may provide for converting Turnkey III homes (and, in the case of an IHA, Mutual Help homes as well) to Section 5(h) homeownership, subject to the contractual rights of existing Turnkey III or Mutual Help homebuyers, and an appropriate ACC amendment. An HA might thus afford existing Turnkey III or Mutual Help homebuyers the option to terminate their Turnkey III or Mutual Help homebuyer agreements in favor of Section 5(h) purchase of their present homes, or might make vacant Turnkey III or Mutual Help units available for purchase under the terms of a Section 5(h) plan. One of the public comments asked whether the regulation applies to newly-constructed housing. The answer is yes, as expressly stated in the interim rule and restated in the final rule at paragraph (a) of §§905.1006/906.6. As a clarification, however, the final rule adds a cautionary note regarding a question that may arise in rare situations where the HA wants to consider Section 5(h) sale of units developed as replacement housing for public or Indian housing demolished or disposed of under the regulations implementing section 18 of the Act (for IHAs, subpart M of 24 CFR part 905; for PHAs, 24 CFR part 970). This calls attention to the fact that the demolition-disposition regulations require selection of the initial occupants of such replacement units solely on the basis of the requirements governing rental occupancy (or, in the case of replacement of Indian housing with new Mutual Help units, the homebuyer occupancy requirements of the Mutual Help Program). Paragraph (b) of these sections amplifies the provisions concerning the physical condition of the property, adding the Section 8 housing quality standards as an alternative measure for cases where no local code exists, along with a cross-reference to the regulatory requirements for accessibility by purchasers with disabilities. One commenter objected to the option for post-conveyance repair. The Department believes that this option should be retained, subject to the kind of protections for the homebuyer that are stipulated, including the final rule's addition of a maximum period of two years for completion of the work needed to satisfy the regulatory standard. As a further clarification, the option for a sound sweat equity arrangement has been added as another example of permissible means for making post-sale improvements. Sections 905.1007/906.7␣(Methods of Sale and Ownership) In §§905.1007/906.7 ( Methods of sale and ownership ), language has been inserted in subparagraph (b)(2)(ii) to make it clear that, in the context of sale of a multifamily building or a group of single-family dwellings via a resident-controlled entity, the prohibition against encumbrances applies only to encumbrances by the resident entity, prior to conveyance of individual units to residents. Thus, it would not be necessary to obtain additional HA consent for mortgages or other encumbrances that are incident to the purchase and financing of individual units, pursuant to the provisions of the homeownership plan and the agreement between the HA and the resident-controlled entity.
