The Estonian Foreign Ministry is seriously concerned in connection with Foreign Minister Kozyrev's remarks contained in his speech at the conference of ambassadors accredited to Russia, the CIS and the Baltic states. Kozyrev told the ambassadors that it is in Russia's strategic interests to preserve a military presence in these countries. The Estonian Foreign Ministry draws the attention of the Russian Federation's Foreign Ministry to the fact that international law does not allow for the protection of a country's strategic interests by way of a military presence on the territory of another country without that country's permission. Russia has taken upon itself an internationally recognized obligation according to Article 15 of the CSCE Helsinki Final Document to fully and promptly withdraw its troops from the Baltic states in an orderly manner. Foreign Minister Kozyrev's statements make Estonia doubt as to whether or not Russia wishes seriously to develop a good-neighborly policy with the Baltic states. Estonia, in good faith, is holding talks with Russia so as to complete the process of Russian troop withdrawal as soon as possible, and is convinced that only adherence to the obligations made in the Helsinki final document will enable Russia to seriously protect its strategic interests. The Estonian ambassador to Vienna will soon present an official enquiry to the CSCE security forum in connection with Andrey Kozyrev's remarks, as instructed by the Estonian Foreign Ministry, the Estonian Foreign Ministry statement notes.
