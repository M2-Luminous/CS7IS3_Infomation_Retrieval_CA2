During these eight years, GATT's China working group, charged with reviewing and considering China's application, has held 16 conferences and posed thousands of questions concerning all aspects of China's trade system to the Chinese delegation. This marathon-style review progress is rare in GATT history. The working group held its 16th meeting in Geneva between 15 and 18 March but clear progress remains elusive. Under the accord reached by the 110 nations participating in the Uruguay Round, a World Trade Organization [WTO] will be set up to replace GATT. In principle WTO is scheduled to be set up before July 1995. However, most nations now want to advance the date to January 1995. This development has given GATT accession negotiations extra urgency. To be a founding member of WTO, China must totally wrap up GATT accession talks by fall this year. Otherwise it will have to apply anew on even more stringent terms. Thus it can be said with certainty the next few months will be a critical period in China's push for GATT membership. The GATT China working group is responsible for all work relating to the resumption of China's status as a signatory to GATT. Its responsibilities can be divided into three parts: examining and reviewing China's foreign trade system; drafting the GATT accession agreement, including provisions on China's rights and obligations after it becomes a member; and tariff reduction negotiations between China and other GATT signatories. For a variety of reasons, the working group has always focused its energies on scrutinizing China's trade system. Both during the working group's 16th meeting and when he met with Director-General Sutherland of GATT, Gu Yongjiang, vice minister of foreign economic relations and trade who headed China's delegation to the negotiations, emphasized that China has met the conditions for admission and that the working group should speed up the negotiation process by wrapping up its consideration of China's trade system and starting to draft the admission agreement. Sutherland expressed his support for China's early accession, noting that without China, the future WTO would lack broad representativeness. To nudge the negotiation process along, the Chinese Government has introduced a string of foreign trade reforms in a concerted effort to create a new mechanism compatible with the rules by which the international trade system operates. Since the end of last year, in particular, it has unveiled several major reforms such as abolishing the mandatory import plan, reforming the import quota and import permit system, drastically narrowing the scope of import management, simplifying import procedures, and quickening the pace of tariff cuts. In 1992 it eliminated the import regulating tax and lowered the import tax twice. On top of that it lowered the tax rates on more than 280 commodities and did away with quota and permit management for the 280 commodities last year. These steps have opened the Chinese market even further. At the 16th meeting, the Chinese delegate made additional commitments on the issue of tariff and non-tariff reductions and concessions. This year, moreover, China has taken steps to reform its foreign exchange system and tax system. Under its original commitment to GATT, China was to reform its foreign exchange system within five years. As it turned out, it took China less than one year to do just that. Delegates from all nations who attended the China working group's 16th meeting welcomed China's reform measures. With the exception of the United States, all developed nations said unequivocally that the working group should speed up its deliberations and begin formal negotiations on China's GATT accession agreement as soon as possible so that China can rejoin GATT before WTO is established. During a visit to China last February, Bulitan, the EC delegate, presented China with a draft agreement, which was viewed by Chinese trade officials as a positive move that would prod the negotiation process forward. At the 16th meeting, the Chinese delegate and his EC counterpart exchanged ideas on the draft. The Japanese delegate indicated that Japan would open negotiations with China on tariff reductions. As of to date about 10 countries, including Australia and New Zealand, have opened negotiations with China on bilateral tariff reduction. With all these nations working hard to accelerate GATT accession negotiation, America's isolation becomes even more pronounced. The negative attitude of the United States to the resumption of China's GATT membership contrasted sharply with the atmosphere at the meeting. The U.S. delegate said the agreement should not be discussed before they figure out China's trade system and objected to China's accession "timetable." During bilateral Sino-U.S. contacts, the Americans invariably voice strong support for Chinese GATT membership. It is hard to tell what the Americans are up to. Within the United States there are some people who argue that Clinton's foreign policy, including of course his China policy, has yet to take shape. Whether or not China can rejoin GATT on schedule depends to a large extent on America's attitude. Observers say there are only two possible scenarios. In one scenario, the United States drives a hard bargain only to relent at the last moment. The other scenario depicts the United States as utterly determined to prevent China from becoming a founding member of the future WTO. Whichever scenario materializes, it is an irreversible trend for the Chinese economy to flourish and for China to take bold strides to join the world.
