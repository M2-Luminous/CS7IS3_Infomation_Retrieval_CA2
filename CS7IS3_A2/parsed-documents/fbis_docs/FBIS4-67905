But with growing domestic, industrial, and academic pressure, Washington may find it difficult to arm twist New Delhi into scrapping its ambitious missile programme. After the confirmation on 19 February that India is technologically moving towards a position from where it can deliver a nuclear device at a target about 2000 km away, the U.S. may announce new penalties to halt India's drive to master intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) know-how. New American laws on high-technology exports are round the corner. Indications from Washington suggest that the two-year ban on the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), imposed in May 1992, may be extended. With nonproliferation high on the Clinton Administration's agenda, Agni's successful test may only prompt the U.S. to order further restrictions. Already, the Clinton Administration has said that it wants to discuss with New Delhi, the steps to ``meet our overall nonproliferation goals and the requirements for waiving sanctions'' against ISRO. But, the U.S. has to contend with a powerful counterview. In the American debate on export controls, it is being argued that the restrictive regimes have not had the desired impact on proliferation. On the contrary, countries subjected to restrictions have gone ahead with their programmes. Some of them have even emerged competitors to American industry. The Council of Competitiveness, an organisation including chief executives of American business, university representatives and organised labour members, in a recent report has brought these arguments into focus. The study notes that the denial of super-computers to India and China have been a ``significant factor'' in driving these countries to master super-computing capabilities. ``The Chinese manufacturer poses a threat to western manufacturers in the Chinese market, and the Indian manufacturer has enjoyed a modest success in the world market,'' the study observes. On other counts too, the curbs have made a negative impact on American industry. As many as 120,000 American jobs were affected by these decisions, the study estimates. The U.S. also lost $6,000 millions in exports. Though the U.S. Congress is willing to look afresh at the export controls, the State Department continues to feel that restrictive regimes are useful tools. Nevertheless, Congress is considering a new export control package. Some of the ideas call for liberalising and simplifying export codes. Others aim at tightening restrictions on dual use exports. Despite the predominance of indigenous material in Indian missiles, American restrictions can affect India in a few critical areas. Indian missiles are still dependent on sophisticated American components. Some advanced chips, which can stand the rigours of military use, are purchased from the U.S. Indigenising is difficult because of Western curbs on the supply of machinery to fabricate components of such precision. From a commercial viewpoint, the enormous costs inhibit this. In addition, purchases from third sources are difficult. Most countries which possess these items are members of the multilateral Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR). Theoretically, India, at the moment, will have to contend with the U.S.-led regime of western technology restrictions, targeting Indian space and missile programmes. Restrictions inhibiting the flow of sophisticated technology are imposed under the MTCR. Made up of 22 countries, the regime aims at restricting missile development outside a predominantly western club. It provides for punitive action against any country developing missiles which can cause mass destruction more than 300 km. away. Penalties are enforced, mainly by denying advanced technology, which have both a military and civil use. MTCR members have or are expected to frame domestic laws restricting export of dual use knowhow. Laws have to be supplemented by lists of such technologies. Thus, after the MTCR charter was signed by seven developed countries in 1987, the U.S. passed the National Defence Authorisation Act (NDAA). In May 1992, the NDAA was invoked to impose a two-year ban on technology sales to the Indian Space Research Organisation along with the Russian space agency, Glavkosmos. Validation licences, which could permit American companies to sell items to the ISRO were put on hold for two years. It was argued that the cryogenic engines ISRO intended to procure from Russia could enable India to develop an Inter-Continental Ballistic Missile (ICBM). The GSLV [Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle] rocket which would enable India to launch satellites in the geosynchronous orbit could also yield the strategic missile, it was felt. Apparently, American fears were reinforced when India, for the second time in April 1992, tested the Agni missile. The SLV-3 rocket which was developed by the ISRO was modified to become the first stage of the Agni. Countering the American argument, India felt that the real U.S. concern was not security. A Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle would have enabled India to quickly enter the lucrative satellite launch market, so far the domain of the West, though China has broken into these exclusive western preserves. Tightening the screws on India further, the U.S. Commerce Department in 1992, made suitable amendments to target specific space and missile related projects. Amending the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), an interim order was passed to lay new restrictions on a range of projects. U.S. companies were told to obtain special validation licences destined for the Agni and Prithvi projects of the integrated guided missile development programme. ISRO's SLV-3, the Augmented Satellite Launch Vehicle (ASLV), the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and the (GSLV) also featured on this list. Since the restrictions were project centred, all enterprises in the U.S. and India which contributed to them were affected. As many as 78 institutions and 107 Indian industries contribute to the ISRO's programmes. After trying to scare India with the restrictions it can impose, the U.S. may now make a fresh bid to force the country to join the MTCR. But, this move is unlikely to succeed. Like the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), which India rejects, the MTCR is also discriminatory. Countries have joined the MTCR either as members or adherents. Unlike the original seven western trading partners, adherents do not participate in MTCR meetings. Neither are they involved in moving amendments and resolutions. It is extremely doubtful that adherents find access to sophisticated western technology, as a reward for acquiescence. Argentina, a MTCR adherent, had faced the humiliation of destroying the assemblies of the Condor 2 launchers, in the presence of Western verifiers. After Agni's launch, India will have to choose from one of the three options: convert Agni from a test to a ``battlefield'' weapon, continue with experiments after stating an intent only to develop and demonstrate IRBM technology, or drop the project altogether. One view making the rounds among defence experts here is that India should develop the missile, but not fit it with warheads. Retaining the option to ``arm'' the missile can also signal that India is driven not by belligerence, but with a desire to enhance security. This non-provocative deployment, with the deterrence spin-off in the neighbourhood, is also consistent with India's global position on missile development. Destruction of missiles is the responsibility of all, not of a select few. The move will have a significant impact. The powerful commercial lobby in the U.S. which says that restrictions on large countries, such as India and China, are potentially counterproductive, can also be armed with a new argument. This could well open the debate among MTCR members to include India as a missile power, and not as an adherent. There is a free exchange of technology among key MTCR members. But the regime enjoins on the members not to supply these items outside their fold. In the face of possible retaliation from the U.S. scientists have argued that there are ways to break the restrictions log-jam. One way to overcome dependence on items such as military grade chips, is to buy commercial grade components, which are available more easily. Technologically, it is feasible to use these chips in military hardware, after screening them suitably.
