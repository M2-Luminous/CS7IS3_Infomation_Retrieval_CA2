Our Washington correspondent Arye Golan has learned that the Jordanians are not prepared to engage in joint projects with Israel before progress is made in the negotiations between Israel and Syria and the outstanding problems between Israel and Jordan are solved. These problems are: the Palestinian refugees, use of the water sources, and areas in the 'Arava that Jordan claims to own. Our correspondent reports that Israeli and Jordanian experts discussed ways to prevent drug trafficking between the two countries. In addition, another week of peace talks between Israeli representatives and delegations from Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, and the Palestinians ended in Washington. Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin said the talks between Israel and Jordan were the most successful. On the Palestinian track, Major General Dani Rothschild and Sa'ib 'Urayqat began discussing the modalities of the elections to the autonomy council. They were joined by Ehud Shilat, the Interior Ministry's national supervisor of elections.
