FR940805-0-00053 FR940805-0-00019 FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY 44 CFR Part 65 [Docket No. FEMA&hyph;7102] Changes in Flood Elevation Determinations AGENCY: Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). ACTION: Interim rule. SUMMARY: This interim rule lists communities where modification of the base (100-year) flood elevations is appropriate because of new scientific or technical data. New flood insurance premium rates will be calculated from the modified base (100-year) flood elevations for new buildings and their contents. DATES: These modified base flood elevations are currently in effect on the dates listed in the table and revise the Flood Insurance Rate Map(s) in effect prior to this determination for each listed community. From the date of the second publication of these changes in a newspaper of local circulation, any person has ninety (90) days in which to request through the community that the Associate Director, Mitigation Directorate, reconsider the changes. The modified elevations may be changed during the 90-day period. ADDRESSES: The modified base (100-year) flood elevations for each community are available for inspection at the office of the Chief Executive Officer of each community. The respective addresses are listed in the following table. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Michael K. Buckley, P.E., Chief, Hazard Identification Branch, Mitigation Directorate, 500 C Street, SW., Washington, DC 20472, (202) 646&hyph;2756. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The modified base (100-year) flood elevations are not listed for each community in this interim rule. However, the address of the Chief Executive Officer of the community where the modified base (100-year) flood elevation determinations are available for inspection is provided. Any request for reconsideration must be based upon knowledge of changed conditions, or upon new scientific or technical data. The modifications are made pursuant to Section 201 of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4105, and are in accordance with the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. 4001 et seq., and with 44 CFR Part 65. For rating purposes, the currently effective community number is shown and must be used for all new policies and renewals. The modified base (100-year) flood elevations are the basis for the floodplain management measures that the community is required to either adopt or to show evidence of being already in effect in order to qualify or to remain qualified for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). These modified elevations, together with the floodplain management criteria required by 44 CFR 60.3, are the minimum that are required. They should not be construed to mean that the community must change any existing ordinances that are more stringent in their floodplain management requirements. The community may at any time enact stricter requirements of its own, or pursuant to policies established by other Federal, State, or regional entities. The changes in base flood elevations are in accordance with 44 CFR 65.4. National Environmental Policy Act This rule is categorically excluded from the requirements of 44 CFR Part 10, Environmental Consideration. No environmental impact assessment has been prepared. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Associate Director, Mitigation Directorate, certifies that this rule is exempt from the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act because modified base (100-year) flood elevations are required by the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4105, and are required to maintain community eligibility in the NFIP. No regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared. Regulatory Classification This proposed rule is not a significant regulatory action under the criteria of Section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993, Regulatory Planning and Review, 58 FR 51735.
