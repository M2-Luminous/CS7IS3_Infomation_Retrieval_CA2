[Words indistinct] an embargo against the Haitian authorities has failed to do little than hurt the people of Haiti, and they are fleeing their native country, flocking to the United States and The Bahamas. In fact, at this moment a session of the high-level segment of the UN global conference, Bahamian Prime Minister Hubert Ingraham spoke of this influx of refugees, saying it is a burden for his country. [Begin Ingraham recording] The Bahamas could be faced with large numbers of illegal Haitian immigrants who continue to pour into our country, creating excessive demands on our educational, housing, health, and welfare services, creating unregulated pressures on natural resources, including water, demands which we can ill-afford to meet. How can a nation of 280,000 people reasonably be expected to cope with the problems of millions of Haitians? Ill-equipped though we are to meet these demands on resources, The Bahamas is humane in its treatment of Haitian and Cuban shipwrecked persons. [end recording] Meanwhile, Guyanese President Cheddi Jagan, while not an advocate of military intervention, believes there is no other solution to the Haitian crisis: [Begin Jagan recording] I know what military occupation from imperialist powers has done to a lot of countries, but we have to look at the dialectics of the whole situation. First, Aristide was overwhelmingly elected by the people. Second, if he is not restored to power, it sends a wrong message to would-be dictators and military upstarts in different parts of the world because there is a movement throughout the world toward democratization and this can be endangered if Aristide is not returned to power. [end recording] President Clinton has [word indistinct] the support of Ricky Singh, president of the Caribbean Association of Media Workers, a nongovernmental organization accredited to the conference. Mr. Singh says the U.S. threat can be avoided, but he pointed out that (the other way), Caribbean people, and especially journalists, have a moral obligation to [word indistinct] the Haitian people. [Begin Singh recording] [Word indistinct] have to begin to interact with Haitian counterparts in terms of promoting a better understanding among the Haitian and the people of the rest of the Caribbean. There is a lot of ignorance abroad and a lot of prejudices among non-Haitian Caribbean people because we have [word indistinct] over the years all of the ugly caricatures of the Haitian masses. It is our problem that [word indistinct] ourselves from that process and beginning to relate more pragmatically and sensibly to the problems facing the Haitian masses. [end recording] So it is now a question of wait and see, to see if the U .S. will indeed send its troops to Haiti and what will be the outcome.
