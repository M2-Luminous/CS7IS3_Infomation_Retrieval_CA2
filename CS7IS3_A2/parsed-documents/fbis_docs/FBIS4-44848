This output, obtained using silicon elements measuring six by four cm at low temperatures and under low-light conditions, is the "highest output ever obtained anywhere in the world using silicon batteries without using special optical concentration devices to increase the quantity of sunlight being converted into electricity." This technical breakthrough was made by an industrial team led by DASA [German Aerospace], with CISE [Center for Data, Studies, and Experimentation] (Milan, Italy) as subcontractor. The photocells currently in use in all space activities provide an output of 10 to 20 percent in low-earth orbit and behave abnormally in deep space conditions. In general, they are not designed to function at temperatures as low as those encountered in that environment. In these difficult conditions, space probes have to draw on energy sources other than their solar panels, whose electricity output becomes too weak. Hitherto, probes launched into deep space have used thermonuclear generators such as the RIG [Radio-Isotope Thermoelectric Generator]. However, RIG technology is not available in Europe; for this reason ESA has been working hard to produce an energy source based on very high output photocells. Just under a year ago, the agency had already achieved an output of 23 percent with gallium arsenide (GaAs) elements.
