The accord was signed in Vilnius Tuesday [26 April] by Polish President Lech Walesa and Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas. In an interview with the LIETUVOS RYTAS newspaper, Landsbergis noted, however, that the signing was an important step in relations between the two countries. The opposition leader said the shortcomings in the treaty were partly compensated by Brazauskas' speech in the parliament after the signing ceremony. "The president spoke about important things, which should be understood as unwritten contents of the treaty," Landsbergis said. The Lithuanian opposition earlier sharply criticized the agreement and the Lithuanian Government for dropping a demand that the annexation of Vilnius and its region by Poland in 1920 be mentioned in the treaty.
