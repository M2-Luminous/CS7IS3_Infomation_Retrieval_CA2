The meeting, attended by Mali, the Unified Movement and Front of Azaouad [MFUA], and Algeria -- the mediating country -- is reviewing the progress made in the implementation of the national pact since it was signed. From Tamanrasset, our special correspondent Oumar Toure reports: [Begin recording] [Toure] The Tamanrasset meeting closely follows the second anniversary of the signing of the national pact on 11 April 1992 by Mali and the rebel Tuareg movements to consecrate the return of peace, security, and national reconciliation in Mali. The meeting is aimed at taking stock of the pact's implementation and at defining future priorities in line with the spirit of the pact. Already the pact has led to the creation of a peaceful atmosphere. What remains to be done now is to tackle the developmental aspect of the pact because, in reality, apart from its political nature, the pact is a real action program for development and integration and a real answer to the problem of exclusion, abandonment, and underdevelopment of our country's northern regions which sparked off the rebellion. Opening the Tamanrasset session, the Algerian representative restated his country's solidarity with the efforts to consolidate the gains of the national pact. He hailed the efforts that have so far been made since 11 April 1992. In his address, Sada Samake, the territorial administration and security minister who led the national delegation, said the Tamanrasset meeting is aimed at taking an objective look at the progress made in the implementation of the national pact. [Samake] Today, the national pact represents an important gain which we all need to preserve and consolidate. It is a mark of the return of peace even though acts of banditry continue to create an atmosphere of insecurity in our country's northern regions. From the military and security standpoint, decisive progress has been made with the integration of 640 fighters into the regular Army while special security units are being set up despite delays in the effective takeoff of the exercise. The present meeting will afford us another opportunity to give new impetus to the implementation of the national pact. It will enable us to take an objective look at the progress made and to identify existing shortcomings so as to work out ways and means of overcoming them. [Toure] The MFUA representative, (Sidi Mohamed Ould Zaibi), pointed out that the movements did not come to Tamanrasset to renegotiate the national pact because it is clear enough as it stands. [(Zaibi)] [passage omitted] We do not see ourselves as attending a renegotiation session of the national pact as it is clear. There is nothing to renegotiate. We only have to implement what has been agreed on by the two sides. The pact forms the historical yardstick for judging all sides. [Toure] All the movements are represented at the Tamanrasset meeting including the ministerial departments involved in handling the northern problem. Since 16 April, the deliberations have been going on behind closed doors and no information has filtered out. However, according to informed sources, MFUA representatives have demonstrated a lot of flexibility in their appreciation of the progress made so far in the implementation of the national pact.
