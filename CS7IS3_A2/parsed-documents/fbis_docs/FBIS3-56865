"Boris Yeltsin has to keep balance between various forces", he told TASS on Friday evidently meaning that the current government composition was a compromise of the president. An adequate substitution for Boris Fedorov, who had resigned as the finance minister, may be his first deputy Sergey Dubinin, Filippov said. Noted economist Grigoriy Yavlinskiy would hardly be invited to fill in the remaining vacant post of the first deputy prime minister, he added. "I think that Viktor Chernomyrdin will try to keep Oleg Soskovets as his only first deputy", Filippov said and added that he personally does not believe in Yavlinskiy's ability to reform the economy. "I do not believe in the possibility of reforming economy on the basis of speculative schemes like the '500 days' programme", he explained referring to the programme which Yavlinskiy had offered yet to former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev, but which was turned down.
