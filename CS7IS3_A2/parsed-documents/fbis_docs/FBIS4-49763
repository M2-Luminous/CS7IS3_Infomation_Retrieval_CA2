While the two issues are not directly related, MFN is an important principle within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), GATT secretary general Peter Sutherland said. "Therefore the U.S. attitude, as a major contracting party to the Chinese integration into the world economy, will be of considerable importance with regard to the conclusion of the negotiation for China's full accession into the World Trade Organisation (WTO)," Sutherland said. The WTO will replace GATT on January 1. If MFN is withdrawn, "it may signal difficulties vis-a-vis the conclusion of China's re-entry to the WTO," Sutherland said. U.S. President Bill Clinton must decide by June 3 on whether to renew MFN, which he has made conditional on improvements in China's human rights record. "The US attitude is of central importance and that attitude will be signalled one way or another by events in the MFN issue," he added. China, which was a founding member of GATT but left after the communists came to power in 1949, has made it clear that it attaches great political significance to being readmitted before the WTO's inception. Sutherland, who met Tuesday with Foreign Trade Minister Wu Yi, was speaking after giving a speech at an international seminar on the Chinese economy in which he warned that membership of the WTO was not "simply joining the club." "It means entering into contractual undertakings based on mutual benefit," he said. "There is a responsibility on the part of China to show flexibility and to give adequate assurances" to GATT members that it can honour the obligations required by membership, he added. While Chinese re-entry by year's end is possible, Sutherland told reporters that it would be a "difficult task." "It depends ultimately on the willingness of all the parties to become extremely active in the negotiations and on the Chinese side to be immediately responsive to the concerns about transparency and other issues."
