Shesertkina, identified by caption] [Text] [Shesterkina voice over video of truck emerging from reprocessing plant] The Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy, having examined the results of the operation and the state of all units of the complex for the vitrification of radioactive waste at the Mayak chemical combine, has authorized its continued operation. This furnace is the only one on the territory of the former USSR and the most efficient in the world, although this work is also done by Britain and France. Here industrial-grade plutonium for nuclear electric power stations is extracted from reprocessed nuclear fuel and the radioactive waste is vitrified and placed in storehouses. Beneath me are about 150 million curies of radioactivity rendered harmless from nuclear fuel used not only in Russia but also in Armenia, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Germany, Hungary, and Finland. It is all too obvious that, having our own nuclear electric power stations, an inconceivable number of missiles, icebreakers, and submarines, we have accumulated such a quantity of weapons-grade and industrial-grade plutonium, whose decay takes 24,000 years, that we are doomed to conducting our own reprocessing.
