The Chinese delegation visited U.S. Government research institutes, met with U.S. Government senior officials, and made contacts with people of U.S. high-tech enterprises. The nine-member delegation headed by Song Jian arrived in Washington on the evening of 10 April to attend the sixth meeting of the Sino-U.S. Science and Technology Cooperation Joint Committee at the invitation of John Gibbons, U.S. presidential science and technology advisor and head of the Science and Technology Policy Office of the White House. The principal members of the Chinese delegation include Liu Jiang, minister of Agriculture; Yan Hongmo, director of the State Maritime Bureau; Hu Qiheng, vice president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; Ba Denian [1572 1795 1628], president of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences; and Ye Ruqiu, deputy director of the State Environmental Protection Bureau. This morning, the Chinese delegation visited the U.S. National Standardization Technology Research Institute. Delegation members heard an introduction on the institute's "advanced technology plan" and "manufacturing and promoting cooperation partners project" and also visited two institute laboratories. This afternoon, Song Jian had a meeting with U.S. Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and exchanged opinions with him on cooperation in protecting wild animals. According to a Chinese delegation member who took part in the meeting, Babbitt pointed out that he was "deeply impressed" with China's protection of giant pandas and other rare wild animals and China's enforcement of laws against the trade of animals that are in imminent danger. Song Jian proposed that the two sides strengthen unified management on the issue of exhibition of giant pandas abroad. He said that, in addition, the two countries could cooperate to improve the technology of multiplying giant pandas. In a meeting with Neil Lane, chairman of the U.S. National Science Foundation, Song Jian expressed the hope of expanding cooperation in the field of "major sciences [da ke xue 1129 4430 1331]." Neil Lane was interested in China's desire to expand cooperation and invited China to take part in the plant genetic map project that is being undertaken in the United States. Later, Song Jian met with U.S. Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary and the two sides discussed prospects of cooperation in the utilization of conventional and new energy sources and nuclear energy. This afternoon, Song Jian also met with U.S. Deputy Defense Secretary Frank Wisner and discussed with him cooperation in utilizing military technologies by civilian sectors. The U.S. deputy defense secretary held that China started the work of having military technologies serve the civilian sectors relatively early and gained some experiences that the U.S. could borrow. This evening, the U.S.-China Trade Committee and several U.S. high-tech companies, mainly aerospace and aeronautics enterprises, gave a dinner party in honor of Song Jian and delegation members. More than 70 people attended the party. Chinese Ambassador to the United States Li Daoyu and several U.S. congressmen and former congressmen attended the party. Robert Rowe, former chairman of the U.S. House Science Committee, spoke at the dinner. He pointed out: Both China and the United States are big countries. The two should join efforts, cooperate with each other, and should not be entangled in issues like the most favored nation treatment. Starting tomorrow morning, the science and technology delegation and the U.S. side will take part in the biannual Sino-U.S. Science and Technology Cooperation Joint Committee meeting. The Chinese delegation will end its activities in the United States on 13 April. On the eve of his departure for the United States, Song Jian was interviewed jointly by XINHUA and KEJI RIBAO reporters. Song Jian pointed out: Sino-U.S. cooperation in science and technology has great potential and broad prospects because the cooperation can play a role in leading and promoting the constant development of the economy and trade of the two countries. He emphatically pointed out: Strengthening exchanges and cooperation between the two countries in science and technology is not only in accord with the basic interests of the two countries but also beneficial to the progress and development of all of mankind.
