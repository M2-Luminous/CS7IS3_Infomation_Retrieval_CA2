The Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA said Russian special envoy Vitaliy Churkin, who has been mediating between the Serbs and the United Nations, was also at the meeting in the Serb headquarters at Pale outside Sarajevo. The talks came a week after the Bosnian Serbs announced they were suspending contacts with the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] in the wake of the NATO raids against Serbs beseiging the eastern Moslem enclave of Gorazde Sunday and Monday. Since then Bosnian Serb harassment of UN forces has increased dramatically, with a large number of UN personnel held against their will in the exclusion zone around Sarajevo. Churkin has been in Pale, east of Sarajevo, for several days, trying to mediate with the Bosnian Serbs. Karadzic was also accompanied at the talks by his deputies, Nikola Koljevic and Biljana Plavsic, SRNA said the meeting in Pale was aimed at relaunching the Bosnian peace process, seriously jeapordized by events since the Gorazde air strikes. Radio Sarajevo Friday reported renewed fighting overnight in the besieged enclave of Gorazde. The casualty toll in Gorazde has risen to 12 dead, including three children, and 49 injured in the last 24 hours, the radio said.
