Freiberg is the last leg of this round of the Chancellor's election campaign through eastern Germany. Prior to that the CDU [Christian Democratic Union] chairman had attended the party conference of the Brandenburg CDU in Strausberg near Berlin. In the afternoon, Kohl had spoken in Kamenz. More than 10,000 people are crowding the Upper Market at the old silver mining town of Freiberg -- a home match for Kohl. "We heard that he is coming on the seven o'clock news and came here right away," a couple from Doebeln says. They have a small electrical supplies company; the chancellor can be sure of winning their votes: "We cannot complain, things have been going upward." The chancellor hits the right tone when he welcomes the political opposition first: "There they are, the representatives of the socialist migration," he calls over to a small bunch of protesters carrying the inevitable banners reading "The head is soft." People with posters saying "Messiah, let us have your message," do not stand a chance either. Their whistles are drowned in the crowd's laughter, people are shouting "Helmut," and in front somebody waves a black-red-and-gold flag. "Saxony will be your home country, Germany your fatherland, and Europe your future," Kohl calls out at the end of his speech, and minute-long applause fills the air. When the orchestra plays the national anthem, some are embarrassed that they still do not know the text after four years. The scenery at Freiberg is also favorable for Kohl: A great deal has changed in the town. The platform has been set up in front of the refurbished historic town hall; almost all the house facades shine with fresh paint; the university housing Germany's oldest mining college is attended by students from the West. Pretty pubs are emerging, and beer from Freiberg is popular also in the land's capital, Dresden. The people in Freiberg are proud of what they have achieved over the past few years and of the things they can show the chancellor. In the new laender, there is a clear shift toward the CDU. "There is a ray of hope in every village," Saxony's CDU deputy chairman Fritz Haehle says. According to an Infratest opinion poll, contentedness with the land governments has gone up in all the new laender governed by the CDU, including Berlin, since February. Eberhard Diepgen in Berlin (+ 16 percent) and Bernhard Vogel in Thuringia (+ 13 percent) have been able to gain the most in popularity. Over the same period, confidence in Manfred Stolpe's SPD-led [Social Democratic Party] Brandenburg government has declined by 9 percent, which for the first time makes Kurt Biedenkopf's CDU government (+ 3 percent) the most popular of all the new laender governments. The CDU is also ahead in Germany as a whole now. At the weekend, four research institutes announced that the Union is ahead of the Social Democrats. Forsa: 42 to 39 percent, Wickert: 39.9 to 37 percent. The figures indicated by Basis Research are 39 to 38 percent. And Emnid expects the CDU/CSU [Christian Social Union] to win the European elections at 40 percent, with the SPD winning only 38 percent of the votes. With regard to future chancellors, Forsa sees Kohl leading at 34 percent over his SPD opponent, Rudolf Scharping, who is currently supported by 32 percent of the population.
