This is because of the greater concern of such countries with how their workers can cope with competition from developing countries. Deputy Prime Minister Brigadier General Lee Hsien Loong made the point at the opening of the 10th ASEAN labor ministers meeting in Singapore. Gen. Lee said ASEAN must resolutely oppose attempts in international forums to increase any unreasonable standards and practices. These ignore the different stages of development and the different economic, political, and cultural context of the developing countries. He noted that ASEAN governments had adopted a non-adversarial approach to labor relations. Instead of compromising workers' rights, it in fact assures workers of more secure jobs and higher standards of living. As ASEAN's economies develop, this approach will have to revolve to meet change and needs, but the pace and direction of that revolution must be decided by the ASEAN countries themselves.
