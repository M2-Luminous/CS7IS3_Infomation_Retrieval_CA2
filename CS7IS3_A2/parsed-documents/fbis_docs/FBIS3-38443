In Bern on Monday [31 January], the PLO leader thanked Confederation President Otto Stich and Federal Council Member Flavio Cotti for their hospitality and for the support Switzerland has already given in the peace process. He said during a news conference that a lasting peace in the Near East was a necessity "for all." This was the Palestinian leader's first official meeting with members of the Swiss Government. Yasir 'Arafat arrived in Bern by helicopter from Davos around 1230 on Monday. The PLO leader had just ended a series of meetings with Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres on the sidelines of the Davos Forum. Despite a final meeting at night, the two men did not reach agreement on the implementation of Palestinian autonomy, for which the PLO-Israeli agreement signed in Washington last September makes provision. "Very Close" to an Agreement At the end of his talks with Mr. Stich and Mr. Cotti, a smiling Palestinian leader appeared before the press at the Bellevue Hotel, dressed in his khaki uniform and wearing his usual keffiyah. Speaking in halting English, Yasir 'Arafat said he had come "very close" to an agreement with Shim'on Peres in Davos. According to him, the Palestinian side was ready, but the Israelis asked for a few more days to consider it. "And, it takes two to tango." "I am a pragmatist, but I have strong hopes that this agreement will be signed in Cairo in a few days. If that is the case, it will still be called the `Davos agreement.'" Yasir 'Arafat and Shim'on Peres will meet again in Cairo on Sunday to try to finalize this agreement, which is encountering problems on three main points: the area of Jericho, the control of border crossing points, and the security of Israeli settlers. Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, who is rather optimistic, said on Monday that the draft agreement drawn up in Davos was "positive." When signed, it would make possible the gradual withdrawal of the Israeli army from those areas. PLO Office in Bern: Status Not Clear Yasir 'Arafat also asked Switzerland to play an active part in the rebuilding of the infrastructure "destroyed by the occupation" in the territories. "We need your support and your experts," he said. According to Mr. Stich, in addition to the financial aid (60 million francs) planned by Switzerland, discussions related in particular to technological cooperation and cooperation in the field of tourism. Referring to the forthcoming opening of a PLO office in Bern, Yasir 'Arafat explained in French that it would be the "General Delegation of Palestine." This title seems to contradict the status Bern intends to give that office, which, in its view, cannot represent the "Palestinian state" self-proclaimed in 1988. In accordance with international law, Bern only recognizes states defined by the three criteria of international law. These criteria, which must be recognized by the international community, include the notions of people, territory, and government. "An Open Man" "I have had a meeting with an open man, and it was a warm encounter," Otto Stich said in an initial news conference with Flavio Cotti. According to him, Mr. 'Arafat thanked Switzerland for having recognized "very early" that Israel's right to existence and to security within internationally recognized borders was inseparable from the Palestinian people's right to self-determination. Mr. Stich congratulated the Palestinian leader for his "courage" in daring to take a step toward peace and for sitting down at the same table as his former enemies. According to Flavio Cotti, talks with Yasir 'Arafat have made it possible to verify that preliminary bilateral talks (Israel-PLO, Israel-Jordan, Israel-Syria, and so forth) were a "more realistic" approach than multilateral negotiations.
