"The time for mild decisions has gone. Tough measures are need to avoid cruel and repressive ones," he said. Plyushch believes that it is necessary first of all to form a team of like-minded people in the new parliament to shoulder the entire responsibility. He is convinced that to do that there is no need to enter into confrontation or reorganise the new parliament. It is necessary simply to make competent use of those powers which the old one granted to the executive branch, he pointed out. The presidential candidate is of the opinion that it does not basically matter whom the Cabinet of Ministers would be accountable to -- the premier or the president. It is important that firm executive power be wielded by one body and act effectively. Plyushch is confident that in order to get the first sprouts of stabilisation now, it is enough to liberalise production, including foreign economic activities, reinstate the law on the state enterprise, bring into the operation the law on foreign activities and foreign investments and see to it that the production demonopolisation mechanism begins to operate and the law on the banking system is upgraded.
