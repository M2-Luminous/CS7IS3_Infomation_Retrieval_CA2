Successive procedures are outlined for choosing the parameters for this process of destruction of chlororganic wastes. The required degree of destruction of the initial toxic substance is determined on the basis of the MAC. The H/Cl ratio in the toxic substance is used in determining the composition of the heat carrier ensuring the bonding of chlorine in the destruction products. Computed data are given on the necessary degree of destruction for the most typical chlororganic wastes and the results of thermodynamic computations of the quantity of toxic products of destruction as a function of process temperature and composition of the heat carrier are presented. The feasibility of using E-plasmotrons as generators of a high-temperature medium for the thermal destruction of chlororganic toxic wastes is validated. Instead of large stationary plants it is deemed essential that small mobile apparatus be used, constructed on the modular principle so that one module can be replaced by another for accommodation to changing physicochemical properties of the wastes.
