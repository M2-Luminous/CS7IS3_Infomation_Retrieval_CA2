FR940920-1-00110 FR940920-1-00009 40 CFR Part 60 [AD-FRL&hyph;5068&hyph;8] Withdrawal of the 1991 Emission Guidelines for Municipal Waste Combustors AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Proposed withdrawal of 1991 emission guidelines (subpart Ca) and request for comment. SUMMARY: The EPA proposes to withdraw the emission guidelines for existing municipal waste combustors (MWC's) that were promulgated on February 11, 1991 in 40 CFR part 60, subpart Ca. The February 11, 1991 subpart Ca emission guidelines for MWC's would be replaced by more stringent guidelines being proposed under section 129 of the Clean Air Act (Act) as amended in 1990 (1990 Amendments). New emission guidelines that would replace those being proposed to be withdrawn in this document are being proposed in a separate document in today's Federal Register . DATES: Comments. Comments concerning this proposal to withdraw the subpart Ca emission guidelines must be submitted on or before November 4, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments. Comments should be submitted (in duplicate, if possible) to: Air and Radiation Docket and Information Center (Mail Code 6102), Attention: Docket No. A&hyph;89&hyph;08, room M1500, Central Mall, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460.

Summary of Proposed Withdrawal of the 1991 Emission Guidelines (Subpart Ca) On December 20, 1989, the EPA proposed emission guidelines for all sizes of existing MWC's (54 FR 52209). Those proposed guidelines were developed under section 111(d) of the Act as amended in 1977 and were promulgated on February 11, 1991. Section 111(d) of the Act of 1977 requires emission guidelines for designated existing sources of air pollution to reflect the application of best demonstrated technology (BDT). On November 15, 1990, just prior to the EPA's scheduled promulgation of the section 111(d) guidelines, the Act Amendments of 1990 were adopted. The 1990 Amendments added a new section 129 to the Act that applies to solid waste combustors including MWC's. Under authority of sections 111 and 129 of the Act of 1990, the EPA is required to promulgate revised guidelines for MWC's based upon the application of maximum achievable control technology (MACT). However, section 129 included a clause that directed the EPA to issue the emission guidelines developed based on BDT under the deadlines imposed in the consent decree issued from State of New York et al. v. Reilly (No. 89&hyph;1729 D.D.C.). Additionally, section 129 of the Act of 1990 directed the EPA to limit applicability of BDT-based guidelines to those MWC's with a unit capacity greater than 225 Mg/day (250 tons per day). Section 129 specified that revised MACT-based guidelines for units larger than 225 Mg/day capacity were to be adopted by the EPA within 1 year and that revised MACT-based guidelines for units smaller than 225 Mg/day were to be adopted within 2 years. Consistent with section 129, the EPA redrafted the BDT-based guidelines and limited applicability of the 1991 guidelines to MWC units larger than 225 Mg/day capacity. In a separate document in today's Federal Register , the EPA is proposing emission guidelines for MWC's that reflect the application of MACT as required by section 129. The proposed MACT-based guidelines are more stringent than the February 11, 1991 BDT-based guidelines and would apply to MWC units at plants with a capacity of greater than 35 Mg/day. The MACT-based guidelines would require MWC facilities to purchase and install different types of air pollution control equipment than the BDT-based guidelines. Therefore, the EPA proposes to withdraw the February 11, 1991 guidelines since their implementation would not be consistent with the MACT requirements of section 129. The February 11, 1991 emission guidelines were promulgated in 40 CFR part 60, subpart Ca. The MACT-based guidelines proposed in a separate document in today's Federal Register are proposed as 40 CFR part 60, subpart Cb. This notice proposes to withdraw the subpart Ca emission guidelines.
