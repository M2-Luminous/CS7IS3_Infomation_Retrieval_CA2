Enrique Bethancour, executive director of the Union of Banana-Exporting Countries (Upeb), said yesterday representatives of Upeb countries have decided to undertake the negotiations with the Europeans collectively and within the framework of GATT rules. Not all representatives of the countries that are members of this organization have agreed with this proposal, however. During the 5 February meeting in Panama City, it was decided to invite Colombia, Costa Rica, Venezuela, and Nicaragua, which to date have not accepted the proposal by the majority of Upeb members. Panama, Guatemala, and other producers, including Ecuador, the world's largest producer and not a Upeb member, maintain the negotiations must be held within the free trade framework established by GATT. Ricardo Fabrega, Panamanian commerce and industries minister, said on 4 February the proposal that would be analyzed in this meeting consisted of a specific quota, which he refused to disclose, and two tariff levels. He said the first tariff level would be established at 7 percent. There would be a second tariff level after the requested quota is filled, and this level would be reduced in the next seven years. Fabrega added the quota to be requested from the European Union would include the quantities sold to the Nordic countries and Austria, which will become EC members in 1995.
