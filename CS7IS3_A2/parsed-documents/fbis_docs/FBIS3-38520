"The bungling in the former Yugoslavia cannot continue much longer. The various member states will draw their own conclusions and once again intervene on their own initiative. There is a danger that the bad game of alliances will start again." [passage omitted] Claes undoubtedly agrees with Van Miert that things cannot continue like they are in the former Yugoslavia. But the question of how things should be done remains unanswered -- including by Claes. In the most recent issue of DOEN, the SP's party journal, the minister is painfully clear on this issue. "How should things go from here?" he wrote. "I have no precise answer. There are few alternatives to what we have tried, and what we are still trying: On the one hand, continuing to provide the maximum amount of humanitarian aid possible , and on the other hand bringing together the warring parties and trying to reach a peaceful settlement." In short, Claes, who also added that he has always opposed a military solution, does not know what to do. Under the Belgian presidency, he tried with great persistence to make something of the European recipe for Yugoslavia. Despite his efforts, the attempt was a complete failure. There was a great deal of talking, and cease-fires and Christmas cease-fires were agreed upon, but, as in the past, they held up for at most a couple of hours. The only, very relative success of 1993 was that a blazing row did not break out between Europe and the United States. Clinton, who as presidential candidate dreamed for a time of air strikes, under heavy European pressure gave up the idea. Since then the U.S. Government's interest in the conflict has chiefly declined. Clinton won the U.S. elections with a domestic program, and he is sticking to that consistently. In his State of the Union address last week there was no doubt that domestic affairs are the most important ones. There is not much leadership coming from the United States, except in the economic field. The Clinton Administration played an active role in the GATT negotiations: It took initiatives and was very active, on the audiovisual question among others. Ultimately that is so much more specific, especially in terms of jobs, than a risky peace operation in Bosnia. The Americans, certainly the Clinton generation, are a long way from forgetting Vietnam. Troops are only sent abroad for blitz operations, like in Panama and the Gulf. The Somalia experience has strengthened the convictions of the Washington war lords and political strategists that this approach should not be changed for the time being. If order has to be restored in the South and a long-term military presence becomes necessary, then this job should be contracted out to "third parties" -- if necessary to Belgians, but just as well to "legions" from Pakistan, India or former Third World countries. It is a new situation for Europe. During the Cold War it got used to energetic leadership from the United States, which took the initiative continually. That was not always equally pleasant or nice for the European allies, because it was frequently bad for the European ego but it was comfortable. All that was required was to stand in line and carry out what had been thought up in the Pentagon or State Department. Now things are happening differently. In contrast to the past, the United States is letting Europe take initiatives itself. In fact if there are problems in the Balkans, Europe's backyard, then the United States expects Europe, the economic great power, to clear things up. Washington will watch, but in contrast to the past, it no longer wants to organize everything unilaterally. The heaviest burden is now on Europe's shoulders. Partly as a result of the changed world situation and the end of the partition of Europe, the Union now has to deal with it. Up to now it has not proved capable of doing so. As long as the Maastricht Treaty had not been ratified, it could still be argued that the Union did not have the instruments to conduct efficient foreign policies. In the meantime it has been possible to observe empirically that this explanation does not hold true. Maastricht is now operational, and the indecision was not reduced but has, on the contrary, increased. For the United States, and the United Kingdom too, the Balkans remain an insignificant piece of land of little strategic importance. The area contains no useful raw materials and does not lie on the major sea lanes. Therefore its importance is very relative. Continental Europe should know better. For centuries the Balkans have been the continent's weak underbelly and if there is grumbling there, the entire European Constitution is undermined. That was once again proved at the start of this century when a Serbian nationalist's bullets caused the start of World War One. Nevertheless, the European leaders have assessed the disintegration of Yugoslavia wrongly, and above all they have underestimated it. It was catalogued as a regional conflict which did require some attention but did not in the least require inclusion in "intensive care." Wasn't it Marx who said that history never repeated itself, unless as a caricature? Therefore Sarajevo could never start a new world war. The end of the Soviet Union and the unanimity in the Security Council were other good reasons to not take the events in Bosnia too dramatically. This time the fire could not threaten the neighboring properties. This view remains, although little is left of the self-assurance of two years ago. "There is a very real risk of the conflict spreading, of so-called internationalization," Claes said. In recent days that risk has increased strongly. The prime ministers of Turkey and Pakistan are shortly to visit Bosnia, where there is something like an Islamic International. The fact that the Muslims are now better armed and able to adopt a more offensive attitude than a few months ago is not unrelated to this. And Vladimir Zhirinovskiy and the Russian nationalists have rediscovered the Serbs and will not permit any air strikes against their traditional ally. Daily the conflict is becoming less local, and more and more foreign powers are starting to get actively involved. Europe itself is not capable of making a coherent initiative. If the Germans, British, and French are not on different wave lengths, they are emphasizing different things. In any event that is the case with the present holder of the European presidency, Greece. Long before the European Union existed, this country chose its camp. Like the Russians, they are unconditionally on the side of the Serbs. Then, there is the question which General Briquemont formulated so urgently. "How is it possible that Europe, with 300 million inhabitants, is not capable of sending 40,000 troops to Bosnia?" According to Briquemont the move is absolutely necessary, in so far as the logic of peace and negotiations is followed. Briquemont left Sarajevo because his question was not answered. And the longer the United Nations and Europe continue to leave Briquemont's question unanswered, the greater the chance becomes that this Balkan conflict will in the end also become unmanageable.
