The source confirmed that Riak Machar had received a number of letters from Mubarak al-Fadil and Umar Nur al-Da'im through their contact, Hashim Muhammad Ali Ziyadah, expressing their regret that they did not consult one another in Washington to enable them to overthrow the government. They expressed their full support for him, as the lies of John Garang had become clear to them, as had the fact that the coup against Garang at Nasir was not Khartoum- inspired. They said that their support for him would be through the humanitarian organization which he founded under the name of Medical in Need [preceding three words in English]. They invited him and his group to attend the national constitutional congress which the opposition is planning to hold in Cairo, by sending his observers.
