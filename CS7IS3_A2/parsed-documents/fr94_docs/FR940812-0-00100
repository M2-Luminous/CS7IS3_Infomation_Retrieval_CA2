FR940812-0-00100 FR940812-0-00020 2. Paperwork Reduction Act The information collection requirements in this rule have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the ``Paperwork Reduction Act,'' 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq . They will amend the Information Collection Request for Ambient Air Quality Networks, which has been approved under OMB Control No. 2060&hyph;0084. The EPA has estimated the additional burden associated with this rule in reporting the data on a quarterly basis versus summary statistics on a yearly basis to be 11,000 hours. This includes an average of 50 hours per respondent (55 States and/or Territories) per quarter. This burden includes the editing, resolution of anomalies, and the updating of information on site location and environment. This estimate does not include the burden for reading the instructions, planning for report preparation, creating the information, or making electronic transmittal of data because these items were included in the previous labor estimate for the NAMS. It is also assumed that the State agencies are either AIRS users or operate storage and retrieval systems which allow automated submissions of data on a quarterly basis. The burdens for editing and anomaly resolution and for maintaining site information are assumed to be proportional to comparable functions for AIRS. 3. Other Reviews Executive Order 12866 . Under Executive Order 12866, (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; (2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order. It has been determined that this rule is not a ``signficant regulatory action'' under the terms of Executive Order 12866 and is, therefore, not subject to OMB review.

Statutory Authority The statutory authorities for today's final rule are Secs. 110, 301(a), and 319, Clean Air Act as amended, 42 U.S.C. 7410, 7101(a), and 7619. Dated: August 4, 1994. Carol M. Browner, Administrator. For the reasons set forth in the preamble, part 58 of chapter I of title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations is amended as follows: PART 58_AMBIENT AIR QUALITY SURVEILLANCE 1. The authority citation for part 58 is revised to read as follows: Authority: Sections 110, 301(a), and 319 of the Clean Air Act as amended (42 U.S.C. 7410, 7601(a), and 7619). 2. Section 58.1 is amended by redesignating paragraphs (p) through (y) as (q) through (z), and by adding a new paragraph (p) and revising the newly designated paragraph (q) to read as follows: ยง58.1 Definitions. * * * * * (p) Aerometric Information Retrieval System (AIRS)-Air Quality Subsystem (AQS) is EPA's computerized system for storing and reporting of information relating to ambient air quality data. (q) Storage and Retrieval of Aerometric Data (SAROAD) system is a computerized system which stores and reports information relating to ambient air quality. The SAROAD system has been replaced with the AIRS-AQS system; however, the SAROAD data reporting format continues to be used by some States and local air pollution agencies as an interface to AIRS on an interim basis.
