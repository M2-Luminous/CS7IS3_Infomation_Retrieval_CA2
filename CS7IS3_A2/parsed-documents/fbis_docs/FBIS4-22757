Vasilyev, chairman of the Russian Federation State Property Committee, given at the All-Russian Conference "Problems of Completion of Check Privatization and Development of the Stock Market" held in Izhevsk in late March: "Completion of Check Privatization: Problems of the Present and Future"] [Text] Check privatization is coming to a close. What are the results of it? To what degree was the path of market transformations chosen the correct one? What did the citizens of Russia receive? What will happen with the check investment funds? The participants in the All-Russian Conference "Problems of Completion of Check Privatization and Development of the Stock Market" held in Izhevsk in late March sought the answers to these questions. Today we are presenting an account of the speech made at this conference by the chairman of the Russian Federation State Property Committee [GKI], D. Vasilyev. Privatization has taken place. By 1994 most Russians had become stockholders. Last year 39,000 enterprises were privatized, in all 86,000 enterprises since the start of privatization. Thirty-one percent of the enterprises were privatized through the creation of joint stock companies, and 69 percent--through their sale. As a result, large and medium-sized enterprises became truly private and the state's share in them is now less than 25 percent. Half of the people employed in Russian industry work in these enterprises and half of the country's industrial potential is concentrated there. So, half of Russia is already bourgeois, although the other half remains socialist. Our job in the remaining 3 months is to privatize 70 percent of all enterprises, turn Russia into a more-or-less bourgeois country, and create the foundation for continued progress toward private ownership and market trade. At the present time, privatization encompasses all sectors of the national economy, including, despite the long-time opposition, the fuel and power engineering complex. The military-industrial complex has also embarked on privatization, and the proportion of enterprises banned from privatization there is only about 30 percent; the rest will be privatized, and most of those will undergo check auctions. Despite the difficulties, more than 85 million checks have been collected. This is of course not enough to say that all the problems have been resolved. As we certainly assumed, the situation in terms of regions is very differentiated. Even now, against the general background there are 10-15 outstanding "peredovik" [leader] regions (that is the old term, but there is no other as yet) where the number of people employed in private enterprises is on the order of 69 percent. They include St. Petersburg, Samara, Sverdlovsk and Vladimir oblasts, Arkhangelsk, and others. In those places the question being resolved is not so much privatization as it is attracting investments. The enterprises are preparing for a second issue, developing business plans, and deciding questions of raising economic efficiency. But the situation is more complicated in some regions. And accordingly certain social, economic, and political problems may arise there. These are regions where the number of checks collected is substantially lower. About 20 regions are included among those where less than 20 percent of the checks have been collected. The GKI's task is to provide them with all kinds of help. This is necessary since the population takes a fairly serious attitude toward the checks. But just what problems related to this will arise in the near future? What is the situation regarding use of the population's checks? Unfortunately, a large part of the population (this is an objective reality) have not used their privatization checks and are confused over how to do it. In accordance with Russian peculiarities, a large part of the population will go to give up their checks at the last minute. That is to say, if we do not take advantage of April and May to actively influence the behavior of people as investors, June will be a tense period for some territories. That means those regions where there are many checks and a sufficient number of privatized enterprises have not been readied. If we do not rectify the situation, disappointment awaits people. They will have the right to ask the question, why their vouchers were not supported with the necessary objects of investment. But what must be done to avert the looming conflict? The first direction is to speed up check auctions. In accordance with the instructions of Mr. Chubays, more than 160 of the largest enterprises in Russia are being put up for auction in May-June. Among them are more than six oil industry installations, Gazprom [Gas Industry], "Norilsknikel" [Norilsk Nickel], the largest nickel-producing monopoly enterprise, and most steamships. It is remarkable that for the first time military-industrial complex installations are being included in our schedule. They will be sold at interregional check auctions. Apart from GKI activity, it is important to assess the results of the work at the local level. How are the opportunities being utilized for those enterprises which are being sold throughout the country's territory (for example, the Russian Joint Stock Company YeES [Unified Power System] of Russia)? Very poorly. That is precisely how we can describe the situation where a region participates in an all-Russian check auction and collects 100-200, a maximum of 1,000 checks, and the enterprises put up for auction are enormous. Usually four regions collect 75 percent of the checks (Moscow, St. Petersburg, Yekaterinburg, and Omsk). The rest of the regions do a poor job of taking advantage of these opportunities. The reasons are on the surface, as always. Information-explanatory work is being handled extremely badly, and there is not enough of it--people do not know the elementary things. But they must know them; namely, what is being sold, at what times, and where the application can be made. A great deal depends on the local organs of power. We are going to survey the regions and find out how their organizational potential is being utilized. We can no longer talk about how there are no enterprises for sale now. Every week 5-7 major enterprises are put up for auction and they are sold within a month. So on the order of 23-30 major enterprises will be sold at the same time. Accordingly, the effectiveness of the use of receiving points will be raised, and so on. The second direction is regional check auctions. What is happening here? An ordinary person who makes rational judgments above all gives priority to local enterprises, since it is more convenient for him to participate in assembling stockholders, the location is more familiar, and the like. But, judging from the existence of plan schedules for regions (and there are now 55 of them in the GKI), by-no-means all territories are ready for this work. If the process of privatization is analyzed from the standpoint of selecting possible ways to create joint stock companies, clear preference is given to the second variant which allows the labor collective to obtain the controlling bloc of stock. Three-quarters of the enterprises which became joint stock companies chose this variant of privileges. One often hears that such an approach closes off opportunities to influence an enterprise and control it. I do not quite agree with that. For example, in St. Petersburg the danger of the second variant does not particularly disturb anyone, since a simple process occurs because the securities market is developed and privatized enterprises are fairly attractive. The altogether normal, healthy process of buying up stock from the enterprise's employees begins right during the closed subscription or after it is over. And two forces operate here; on the one hand, the director buys up the stock, and on the other, the outside investor, who usually acts through brokers. As a result, the proportion of the outside investor increases substantially if he puts effort into it. The picture is different in regions with an undeveloped securities market, where the directors face the task of making themselves the "chairmen of the kolkhoz" at their own enterprises. The solution to this situation is to continue to accelerate development of the stock market and buy up stock from the labor collective members and the directors. How much time will be needed to do that? In St. Petersburg this process takes an average of only 9 months. And essentially there is no enterprise where such an opportunity would not exist. Privatization in Russia has brought a new institution with it, check investment funds [ChIF]. We can now already say that ChIF's not only have come into existence, but they represent a real economic force. They have collected more than one-third of the vouchers and represent the interests of more than 30 million stockholders. Their activity does not contradict the fundamental interests of developing the Russian economy. When they interact with the management of privatized enterprises, ChIF's make such demands as investing in production and following a market strategy. The ChIF's are a new institution in the stock market which has the smallest interest in inflation; this distinguishes them from commercial banks. The latter pump preferential state credits through themselves and are completely indifferent to how they are used in the economy and whether they are returned or not. The ChIF's occupy an altogether different position. They have a real social base to resolve the question of financial stabilization. Such a base did not exist in 1992-1993 and accordingly the problem remained. The situation has changed now. And that inspires the hope that there will be a turn for the better in 1994-1995. The GKI is trying to assist the ChIF's, and that includes using measures envisioned in the state privatization program. Basic attention has been devoted to tax questions, the possibility of having blocs of enterprises' stock, and determination of the ways to conduct stockholder meetings. Today the question of corporate management is becoming the focus of the agenda after making enterprises joint stock companies is complete. Very soon the Law "On Joint Stock Companies" is to be discussed. I think that in connection with this the government faces serious disputes, since the question will arise: how will enterprises be managed when the lack of control over directors reaches the maximum. There is one more problem: who will participate in the capital of our enterprises? I have been, am, and will remain an opponent of commercial banks' participating in the capital of industrial enterprises. Only investment banks and investment institutions which will engage in long-term crediting but not cashier service to clients can have this right. Let them invest and participate in the capital of industrial enterprises. That is the fundamental issue. These and other important questions must be resolved soon. "Voucher" privatization is coming to an end, and we must determine what has been accomplished, and how, and where we should go from here. Life itself will answer many questions. But for now the agenda includes developing a strategy for the next stage of market reforms.
