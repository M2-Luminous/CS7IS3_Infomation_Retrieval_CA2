The Democratic Left Party (SDL) has distinguished itself by a stable organizational structure which made it possible to easily form a strong bloc. This will include the Slovak Green Party, the Social Democratic Party in Slovakia (SSDZ) and the Farmers' Movement, the daily reports, adding that "this is simply a professional political matter with a minimum risk." The Hungarian bloc is united by the idea of national demands and fear of Vladimir Meciar's return to power. This fact may be reflected in greater parliamentary representation of the ethnic Hungarian parties than two years ago, the paper states. The national bloc may be the most complicated, but its popularity is the highest, the paper notes. In addition to the HZDS (Movement for a Democratic Slovakia), it assembles the Slovak Farmers' Party and the nationally-orientated Slovak National Party (SNS) and possibly the Christian Social Union (KSU), the daily says. The HZDS is stabilized not only with respect to popularity, but also by its desire to regain power. However, the SNS is searching not only for its identity, but also for an internal foe. "It cannot offer the voter anything but a picture of the domestic and external foes of Slovakia," the paper says, adding that this tension in the national bloc cannot lead to undervaluing its "force in the struggle for posts and seats in the parliament," the paper notes. The bloc of the "noncollectivist" parties is united by the struggle against Meciar and by an effort to remain in government even after the elections, "but it is divided over how to achieve the objective." This has resulted in its division into the centrist bloc (the Democratic Union, National Democratic Party-New Alternative (NDS-NA), the bloc of the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) and the Permanent Conference of the Civic Institute, and finally the bloc of the Democratic Party (DS) and the Party of Slovak Entrepreneurs and Tradespeople (SZP), the paper reports. The elections are "in the offing," but the answer to the question of how the mentioned right-of-the-center parties will convince most voters about the force of their noncollectivist policy within a short time is still unknown, the paper notes. The Slovak right fared badly in the latest Federal (Czechoslovak) June 1992 elections -- apart from the KDH no party of this side of the spectrum got into parliament, the left-wing PRAVDA says. The paper points to DS Chairman Pavol Hagyari's effort "to unite on the right everything which can be united" in order to prevent the 1992 situation from being repeated. However, "the result of this effort does not correspond to the exerted effort," the paper notes. The DS, which has come into life by gradual merging of the right- wing parties, has not crossed in May the five-per-cent limit necessary for getting into parliament, the paper adds. The KDH offer of an "open list of candidates" implies one seat for the DS in every constituency. "If they accept the offer, a loss of face is looming, if they do not, they can lose themselves because the failure in elections will make them politically marginal figures," the paper notes. The ostensibly accommodating KDH offer to the right-wing parties would actually result in "their virtual demise," the independent NARODNA OBRODA comments on the issue. Along with the SSPZ the DS showed at the past weekend a different way to uniting the right: They formed a joint electoral bloc, the daily reports. This has one advantage -- it maintains the identity of the political parties, at the same time showing who and what structure is entering it, the paper adds. The KDH on the one hand, and the DS with the SZP on the other, have presented two strategies paving the way for a single objective -- taking advantage of every right-wing vote, the paper notes. "Hagyari has evidently forgotten the situation of two years ago when the Slovak right was routed," SLOVENSKY DENNIK, close to the KDH, says. The DS has entered the electoral competition with a bold statement that the DS-SZP bloc has almost opened its way to the parliament, the paper adds. "This is a fatal error at the expense of all Slovakia which even now will not be able to abandon the way of state paternationalism (combination of paternalism and nationalism), bureaucracy, and leftist fairy-tales," the paper concludes.
