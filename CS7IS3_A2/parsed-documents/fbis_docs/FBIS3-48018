Rubin, an assistant to President Clinton. Mr. Rubin, who is in charge of the National Economic Council (NEC), plays a key role in coordinating economic policy as a confidant of President Clinton. The Japanese Government appears to have concluded that to break the stalemate in Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, it is more effective to make direct contacts with the assistant than with U.S. trade officials who are anxious to score points at the talks. Despite his flexible attitude toward setting numerical targets, Mr. Rubin is making a tough demand that Japan make "efforts commensurate with an economic power," and the Japanese Government should not pin rosy hopes on him. The Japanese Government has been exploring contacts with Mr. Rubin through senior officials of major ministries who have recently visited Washington because the Japan-U.S economic framework talks remain stalled after government officials from the two countries have failed to smooth over their confrontation over the principle of setting numerical targets. The confrontation between the U.S. Trade Representative and the Japanese side is not likely to be addressed. At bilateral negotiations on the insurance sector, the U.S. Trade Representative, which has made the tough demand that Japan allow foreigners to attend the Insurance Deliberation Council and present the United States with a draft amendment to the Insurance Business Law, continues to stick by his demand. As for the improvement of institutions on the part of the United States, the U.S. side has refused to discuss it, claiming, "This is not subject to bilateral negotiations." On the other hand, U.S. Government officials, especially U.S. Trade Representative Kantor, have hinting at sanctions against Japan, which differs from White House and the State Department statements that the "United States will not link the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks to sanctions." The Japanese Government has good reason to count on Mr. Rubin, who is known as a leading troubleshooter, rather than listen to Mr. Kantor's proposal for cabinet-level consultations. Mr. Rubin earned a high reputation as a troubleshooter while successfully keeping the confrontation between the White House and the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) over monetary policy from spiraling out of control by using his economic sense fostered on Wall Street and his personal ties. It is a big mistake, however, to take his attitude as "soft with Japan." At a NEC meeting, he said: "Our goal is to have Japan fulfill it promises to rebuild Japan's economy into an economy driven by domestic demand and cut its current account surplus." He then instructed each government agency to work to achieve that goal. He has spearheaded the U.S. demand that Japan present the United States with measures to stimulate the economy and open the market. It is highly possible that if Japan tries to cultivate contacts with Mr. Rubin simply as a negotiating tactic without making a decision on the measures, it will get a strong punch from the U.S. Trade Representative.
