Chong Chong-uk, senior presidential secretary for foreign affairs and national security, said President Kim meant to say he could promote a summit meeting if a summit is determined to be helpful to the resolution of nuclear and other inter-Korean issues. "We therefore expect that if and when the exchange of special envoys are realized, they would have talks so that the nuclear and other pending questions could be successfully taken up at a summit meeting," Chong said. Another senior Chongwadae official said chances for the realization of a summit would depend on overall conditions such as the progress of U.S.-North Korea talks and the exchange of special envoys between the two sides of Korea. He stressed that President Kim's proposal for a summit does not run logically counter to the government's policy toward North Korea. "A summit was proposed with emphasis on the resolution of the nuclear question. But, once a summit meeting takes place, it could discuss overall issues pending between the two sides," he said.
