FBIS4-57071 "drlat093__a94003" FBIS-LAT-94-093-A Daily Report 7 May 1994 ANNEX Brazil Lula Leads Presidential Polls; Cardoso in 3d Lula Leads Presidential Polls; Cardoso in 3d PY1005012894 Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL in Portuguese 7 May 94 p 3 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY PY1005012894 Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL Portuguese BFN [Text] According to the last poll by IBOPE [Brazilian Public Opinion and Statistics Institute], PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] presidential candidate Fernando Henrique Cardoso has lost his second place to PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] Senator for Amapa Jose Sarney. The poll, the results of which were released yesterday, shows that PT [Workers Party] candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva's popularity has grown in all simulated elections, and he firmly holds the leading position. Cardoso's popularity has dropped in three simulated elections: one in which the PMDB candidate is Jose Sarney; another in which the PMDB candidate is former Sao Paulo Governor Orestes Quercia; and a third in which former Parana Governor Roberto Requiao is a contender. The percentage of undecided has remained stable at around 30 percent. In the simulated election in which Sarney is the PMDB candidate, Cardoso's popularity dropped from 16 percent in the last IBOPE poll to 13 percent, while Sarney scored 15 percent. With Quercia, Cardoso remained second, but with a lower percentage. While in the last IBOPE poll released on 17 April he had 17 percent, he now scored 15 percent. With Requiao, Cardoso's popularity drop has been smaller: He dropped from 17 to 16 percent. In the simulated election with the participation of Quercia, Lula rose from 33 percent previously to 36 percent; with Sarney from 30 to 32 percent; and with Requiao from 34 to 36 percent. Brizola Quercia's popularity, which stood at 5 percent, is, like that of Requiao, 4 percent, meaningless. Former Rio de Janeiro Governor Leonel Brizola's candidacy remained at 8 percent when confronted with Sarney and Quercia, and at 9 percent with Requiao. Lula continues to beat all contenders in simulated runoff elections. With Fernando Henrique Cardoso, he won by 48 to 29 percent, and with Sarney by 44 to 33 percent. According to IBOPE experts, it is still too early to attribute Cardoso's dropping popularity to the formalization of the alliance between the PSDB and the Liberal Front Party. They admit, however, that there is such a possibility, as the drop coincides with the problems that Cardoso has confronted within his own party, in which some sectors have rejected the alliance and have even threatened to sponsor a new ticket at the PSDB convention on 14 May in Contagem (Minas Gerais), with Deputy for Bahia Waldir Pires being kind of an anti-candidate. Progressive Renewal Party Senator for Santa Catarina Esperidiao Amin's popularity remains at 3 percent for all simulated elections. Liberal Party Deputy for Rio de Janeiro Flavio Rocha scored 2 percent in all cases.
