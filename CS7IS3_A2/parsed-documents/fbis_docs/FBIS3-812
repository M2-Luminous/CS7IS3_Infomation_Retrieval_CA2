[Mangope] Well, it is to look generally at the situation and to determine the strategy forward. [Correspondent] Doctor, what is your position in the politics right now? [Mangope] I have no intention to give up political activity. I am determined politically to fight because, as you are aware, there has in Bophuthatswana been a lot of looting that has taken place. The African National Congress [ANC], the [South African] Communist Party, and the National Party government have looted Bophuthatswana politically also, and I must fight to correct that situation. [Correspondent] Doctor, you have been dismissed as president of Bophuthatswana by the South African government. Do you accept it? [Mangope] When Mr. Pik Botha and Mr. Maharaj of the TEC [Transitional Executive Council] came to see me to tell me that I would no more be president, I told them first of all that I had done no wrong at all, constitutionally. I had not broken any law at all. I told them that they have no right whatsoever to remove me; it was the Batswana people who elected me as president, and to show that they were out to loot Bophuthatswana politically, they refused me even to address my people to tell them that they had come to tell me that I would no more be president. [Correspondent] Do you still regard yourself as president of Bophuthatswana? [Mangope] I am still president of Bophuthatswana. Constitutionally and legally, I am president of Bophuthatswana. [Correspondent] Where are you operating from at this point in time? What's the status of your office? [Mangope] Well, I'm operating from my private residence. [Correspondent] So the South African Government took over control of Bophuthatswana. What's your reaction on that? [Mangope] They didn't take over control. They looted control. There was a lot of criminal looting in Mmabatho, and the South African Government looted political power. [Correspondent] Doctor, in short, your reaction, your feelings on what has happened, the events of the past week, and your position right now? [Mangope] Well, I think it augurs frighteningly for the future. The future is bleak with the type of communistic political activity that I've seen. I think we have reason to be terribly concerned for the future. [Correspondent] Is your party going to take part in the election? [Mangope] Do you know, it is very interesting. When I told Mr. Pik Botha and Mr. Maharaj, after they had told me that I was deposed, that I would be taking part because I have political principles and convictions that I want to espouse, they said I would not be allowed. They have no right to stop me from taking part in politics. [Correspondent] Do you still have all your cabinet ministers in your government? [Mangope] My cabinet ministers are 100 percent behind me. My Christian Democratic Party is still intact. We are doing everything we can. If we are allowed, we want to register and fight the elections, because we want to expose the ANC, the Communist Party, the National Party government, for what they are. You know, Mr. Pik Botha came accompanied by Mr. Maharaj, who apparently came to ensure that Mr. Botha carried out his instructions -- Mr. Maharaj's instructions... [Correspondent, interrupting] Can I ask you, please, the last question from my side. The South African Government, the National Party government, gave independence to Bophuthatswana many years ago. Now the same National Party comes and says to you, fine, you are dismissed as president, and you are not independent anymore. [Mangope] If that is not a diamond bright example of dishonesty, then I don't know what is. Freedom and independence, once given, can never be taken back. [Correspondent] Are you considering any steps to gain control of Bophuthatswana? [Mangope] I am going to be about, politically. I am not done with it. I want to assure you that. I want to expose, for the good of South Africa, for the good of South Africa, I want to expose the ANC, the Communist Party, and the South African Government for what they are. For much too long, ever since the beginning of the negotiations, we have had secret deals between the National Party government and the Communist Party, and the ANC. As a result of that, as a result of such secret deals, such as is evidenced by the Record of Understanding, we have this flawed constitution. And I want to tell the South African public, you know, each time they have come to me, it has always been at night. Even Mr. Pik Botha and Mr. Maharaj got to my house at night. I don't know what the reason is for that. [Correspondent] What's your comment about this irony that in the 1988 attempted coup, Pik Botha came to your assistance, and today it is the same man who orders you out of office? [Mangope] Doesn't that expose the man for what he is? Does that not expose the man for what he is? [Correspondent] There's an observation that people voted with their feet to ensure that they have free political activity. Your comment? [Mangope] I told Mr. Botha and Mr. Maharaj on the 15th of this month, this is next Tuesday, that's tomorrow, my parliament would be taking a decision on whether to register or not, and flowing from that decision, free political activity would ensue. I also told them, flowing from that decision, that my parliament would endorse the South African law that puts into being the IEC [Independent Electoral Commission]. But do you know what? They would not allow me those two days only to put this matter to my parliament. They would not allow me to address my people, my people who elected me as president. They would not allow me to address my people and tell them that I had told Botha, that I had told Maharaj, that they do not have the right to remove me. They have no legal or constitutional right to remove me. They would not allow me that. [Correspondent] Do you still regard yourself, then, as the president? [Mangope] I am constitutionally and legally president. They have looted political power. [Correspondent] What is then going to happen to this parliamentary session? Are you going to go ahead outside of Mmabatho or whatever? [Mangope] Well, I think you should direct that question to Dr. van der Walt, who is the so-called administrator of Bophuthatswana.
