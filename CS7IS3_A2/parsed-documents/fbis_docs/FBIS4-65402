In his opinion, this can be achieved "because we live in a democratic society with all the necessary means for emerging from the mire into which you have plunged it. Under democracy, the citizens always have the last word, and, make no mistake about it, the people, who angrily observe the degrading spectacle of this government, will know how to use the polls to express unequivocally what they want. The Spanish people will soon have an opportunity to make their views known. Let us give them their say." In a tough tone, much applauded from the seats of his party, which even gave him a standing ovation at the end of his speech, and booed from the Socialist seats, the People's Party [PP] chairman expressed in the debate held in the Congress in Felipe Gonzalez' presence his conviction that there was government connivance in Roldan's escape because "all that we know is that you believed, for reasons that I prefer not to imagine, that the best thing was to leave him at large, while you looked the other way," and again attributed the greatest responsibility for the corruption cases to Gonzalez himself, among other things, in not allowing [Deputy Prime Minister] Serra's appearance before the Roldan committee. But the criticisms concerned not only the prime minister but also the nationalists supporting him, of whom he said that "they show him the steps he should take and excuse him from legitimizing his position in this house in return for a legitimization by telephone. It is they who have a hold over him." This support led him to say that it should be asked who is in charge in this country, and whether Gonzalez is "the right interlocutor, or whether it would be more effective to pick up that telephone through which they send him the assurances and instructions." However, in Jose Maria Aznar's opinion, this support does not give the government stability because "you people are experiencing the uncertainties of Damocles, waiting for another photocopy to fall on you," and without resolving anything, since all that he [Gonzalez] does is "drop his intimate associates to save his own position." In this connection, he referred to the reports published yesterday linking Serra with Roldan, and stated that "if what has been published is correct, we could guess why he appointed Mr. Roldan, why he protected him, and perhaps why he escaped. Because he was Mr. Serra's intimate and protege." In order to support his arguments, the People's Party chairman referred to headlines in foreign newspapers over the past few days, which he summed up with the remark: "Never was there greater brazenness; he [Gonzalez] stands his ground and defies us," adding that what worries him [Aznar] is "that his image may contaminate the post he holds and that he can say those things as Spanish prime minister." Aznar denied that Gonzalez has any chance of guaranteeing stability and combating corruption, "because you have facilitated the task of the corrupt; you are a hostage of your own past and, to cap it all, you allow Mr. Roldan to escape. Your part has been passivity, obstruction, and negligence, thinking not of Spain, the government, or the economic situation, but of yourself and saving your face," because, Aznar said, "you are threatened by a fugitive from justice who cannot be found, you are threatened by foreign investors, and you are constrained by your parliamentary allies, who dictate to you the resignations and even order your appearances. Spain is being governed by those who are constantly afraid that somebody may talk too much."
