Kim, chairman of the Kim Tae-chung Peace Foundation for the Asia- Pacific Region, told nearly 150 supporters here that the government should adopt a soft policy toward North Korea in order to bring about change. "The Cold War age is over and the conditions causing division of the Korean peninsula have disappeared. So if South and North Korea continue their exhausting competition, both will turn into third- rate countries," he warned. Kim called on the government to solve the nuclear problem through a "package deal," under which Western countries would recognize the Pyongyang Government while North Korea gave up nuclear weapons. In doing so, the government should secure the cooperation of China, he said. "North Korea will eventually abandon nuclear weapons and the United States will establish an embassy in Pyongyang," he predicted. This was Kim's first visit to Taegu since he was defeated in the presidential election in December 1992.
