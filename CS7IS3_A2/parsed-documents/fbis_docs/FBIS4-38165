FBIS4-38165 "drnes124_m_94010" FBIS-NES-94-124 Daily Report 28 Jun 1994 JORDAN IAF, PAAF Criticize Government Practices IAF, PAAF Criticize Government Practices JN2106174894 Amman AL-SABIL in Arabic 21-27 Jun 94 p 7 JN2106174894 Amman AL-SABIL Arabic BFN [Text] The Islamic Action Front [IAF] and the Pan-Arab Action Front [PAAF] have held a news conference in which they discussed developments in the national, Arab, and international arenas. IAF Secretary General Ishaq al-Farhan read out a joint statement issued by the two parties. The statement expresses both parties' concern over violations of citizens' liberties, guaranteed by the noble Islamic shari'ah, safeguarded by the Constitution, and imposed by the state of democracy adopted by our people. The statement deals with the following forms of violation: -- The detention of citizens for months without being referred to civilian courts, as well as their exposure up to now to psychological and physical torture. The statement adds: "The state organs still insist on preventing the people's deputies from visiting the prisons, particularly the General Intelligence prison, to acquaint themselves with conditions inside prisons, after reports have leaked regarding practices incompatible with man's dignity and rights. The statement calls for an immediate release of all prisoners and for compensating them for the harm they have suffered, particularly those who were taken from schools and consequently missed their school year. The statement also deals with restrictions imposed on the activities of political parties and their members. It says: "We feel the government does not treat the parties as national institutions established in accordance with the constitution and the law. Instead, it casts doubts on them, restricts their activity, and besieges them in order to prove that the party experience in Jordan has failed." The statement condemns administrative officers' insistence on preventing party activities, depending on an unfair interpretation of the law. They therefore prevent receptions, festivals, and seminars in public halls and squares as if they were telling the parties not to meet over a national cause. They also watch members of some parties and press them to resign from their parties, after their memberships have become obstacles preventing their professional stability and promotions while the government shows bias toward other pro-government parties and supports the party that constantly praises it." The statement refers to restrictions on the ulema and the educational institutions and says the government prevents them from playing the role they used to play even under martial law. The clearest example of that is that the former education minister's decision not to allow the use of school facilities during summer holidays and his cancellation of previous approvals by education directors." The statement adds: "The schools, which were built at the expense of the people's bread, should be centers of enlightenment in the region and should be used to serve the local community through educational and social programs with the approval, help, and supervision of competent authorities. We view the education minister's decision as determination to deprive students from educational programs, chief of which are plans for students to learn the Koran by heart. This activity is conducted by the Society for the Preservation of the Koran, licensed by the Ministry of Culture, in order to compensate for the Education Ministry's failure to carry out this task." Regarding interference concerning passports and restrictions on citizens who want to travel abroad, the statement says: "Every citizen has the right to have a passport and to travel abroad and return to the homeland." Regarding the new government, the statement says: "Our two parties also criticize the way the government was formed under these critical circumstances." It adds: "The prime minister who was asked to reshuffle the cabinet did not consult the parties and the parliamentary blocs. Therefore, the government's makeup was intended to satisfy certain sides at the expense of the national interests. So, the number of ministers was the largest in Jordan's history. It is enough for us to know that it includes eight ministers without portfolios. We also criticize the government because its makeup is aimed at weakening the opposition in the House of Representatives by securing an additional number of deputies in order to go ahead with plans to sign a unilateral reconciliation agreement with the Zionist enemy." The statement asks the government to convene an extraordinary session to present a statement to the House of Representatives, especially since only seven ministers have remained in the government that had received a slight majority by the House of Representatives. The statement emphasizes the following: 1. The Palestinian people's right to practice their legitimate right to resist in order to attain their objectives of liberation, return, and sovereignty on all their homeland. Hence, any attempt to deny them this right is an aggression against a natural right, and they have the right to reject and resist it. 2. The unity of our Palestinian people is a sacred unity that should be preserved and protected from any encroachment. Hence, we consider any encroachment on the unity of the Palestinian people as prohibited and criminal. The statement adds: "As for the Jordanian arena, after a suspension [of the peace negotiations] caused by the siege on the Gulf of Aqaba, the past two weeks witnessed unnatural acceleration that looks like a race with the Palestinian negotiator. Sub-agendas on borders, security, and water have been signed tackling details that our two parties believe represent a deviation from the so-called national constants that focussed on a comprehensive solution, the return of Jerusalem, and solving the problem of refugees. On normalization of relations with the Zionist enemy, the statement says: The Arab regimes, including the PLO, continue normalization measures through secret and open meetings and bilateral and collective meetings. These meetings were held in several Arab countries including Egypt, Oman, Qatar, and Morocco. If what has been announced is bad, undoubtedly what is hidden is worse. The Jordanian government has recently embarked on a major normalization step through the U.S.-Jordanian-Israeli meeting. By this step, the Jordanian government overlooked Madrid and Arab coordination with the cordon states. It relinquished its declared constants on the Palestine question, including the West Bank and holy Jerusalem, considering its problem with the enemy no more than the land the enemy occupied to the east of the river, the water problem, and the refugee problem. The statement also speaks about the Arab and international developments, and the situation in Yemen. It says: "The Arab masses and their pan-Arab and Islamic forces had been delighted by the propensity of Yemen in the north and south toward unity, shura, and democracy, and viewed this as a manifestation of the Arab-Islamic future" On the internal situation in Egypt, the statement says: "Our two parties have more than once expressed their concern for the violence that is going in beloved Egypt. Violence only begets violence, and we emphasized our condemnation of all sorts of violence regardless of the parties that are practicing it. We are confident that the ideal solution for the cycle of violence is through enhancing liberties, and entrenching shura and democracy." On the siege imposed on Iraq, the statement condemns the continuation of the siege, and urged the Arab and Islamic forces and parties to do all they can to end this unjust siege, starting with the neighboring states. It calls for more efforts to unify the position of the pan-Arab and Islamic forces on a specific program for lifting the siege and ending the harm to our people in Iraq and unleashing their capabilities in the interest of our Arab nation and the Islamic peoples.
