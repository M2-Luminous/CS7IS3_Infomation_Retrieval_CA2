In September, the opinion of "adding heat" prevailed again, so various localities vied with each other to prepare for another "great leap forward" round. Some economists note that the economic cycle of decontrol-chaos and tighted control-stagnation is getting shorter and shorter. A few months after the termination of the macro-control policy, phenomena reflecting economic disorder appeared everywhere, and high inflation had caused the further deterioration of various social problems. A widening gap not only exists between rich people and poor people, but also between the rich coastal cities and impoverished rural areas in the interior. More and more signs show that if the polarization of wealth cannot be mitigated in a short time, all kinds of trouble could break out. The people, especially the peasants, have a stronger tendency to stage "rebellions." The central authorities also feel that the situation is on the brink of going out of control. Recently, a taxation reform program was hastily put into practice in order to bring the situation under control and to redistribute wealth through taxation. After various taxes are raised substantially, wealth might naturally be shifted from the developed coastal areas to rural areas in the interior. However, this reform measure is being resisted by the "local lord economy [zhu hou jing ji 6175 0186 4737 3444]." Some Guangdong officials publicly announced that they would not collect value-added property taxes due to special local conditions. Such "defiant" statements caused a public uproar. Under pressure from public opinion, Guangdong Vice Governor Lu Ruihua was forced to announce that Guangdong would abide by Beijing's latest instructions. The current situation in mainland China is moving from one extreme to the other. In the past, it was stressed that "the whole country should be well-coordinated under the central leadership like pieces in a chess game"; but now, the country is as loose as a plate of sand. Facing another round of economic chaos, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, who is widely regarded as losing power and influence, has again frequently appeared on public occasions. The mainland mass media have carried many reports about his new instructions on economic work. This indicates that the reform-minded strongman is again playing a part of "taking on very important assignments at a time of national crisis." In mid-January, a four-day national banking work conference was held in Beijing. Principal officials in charge at various ministries and commissions of the State Council and provincial, municipal, and autonomous regional governments attended the meeting. However, the mainland mass media did not publish any reports about such an important meeting. It was said that the central authorities issued an instruction to unify propaganda practice in order to prevent any reports about financial policy "upsetting" the people. It was no wonder that the mass media all exercised "self-discipline" and kept silent, because many startling facts were revealed at the meeting and it would have been very "upsetting" if they had been made known to the public. Zhu Rongji, Zou Jiahua, and Li Lanqing attended the meeting and made separate speeches. These leaders who are in charge of economic affairs fiercely criticized the "local lord economy" and the tough words they used greatly shocked participants in the meeting. At the very beginning of his speech, Zhu Rongji criticized the eight provincial and autonomous regional governments of Guangdong, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, Guizhou, Liaoning, Hebei, and Guangxi by name. He sternly criticized them for going their own way, not studying and relaying central instructions, and knowingly adopting their own policies in violation of regulations laid down by the central authorities. This was reflected in the following facts: They continue to raise funds irregularly, and, in some cases, have even raised interest rates to 30 percent without regard to the relevant regulations laid down by the state; they have continued to increase investment in capital construction without authorization; withheld, concealed, and shifted foreign exchange earnings by various means; issued bonds in various forms without authorization, with the amount of such irregularly issued bonds exceeding 60 billion yuan since last December; distributed shares of state-owned enterprises to their workers in various disguised forms; sold new publicing housing to workers at prices lower than the construction costs; hoarded major producer goods in order to drive up prices, which disrupted the overall operation of the market and kept prices of production materials at high levels; and some provincial government departments have even delivered false reports and data to the State Council. Zhu Rongji also exposed the duplicitous behavior of some localities in covertly defying and violating central instructions. He said that some provincial government leaders have publicly expressed their willingness to follow central instructions at meetings, but they in fact went their own way under the pretext of "giving play to local initiative and creativity," and he described their behavior in defying organizational authority and discipline as pursuing selfish local interests and the partial interests of small groups, upholding individualism and anarchy as emancipating the mind, and breaking conventions. They have seriously violated the principle of a subordinate relationship between the central and local authorities. Zhu Rongji finally warned: "The central leadership will not allow some local leaders to use their powers and functions to do whatever they like in violation of central instructions. Such leaders must be dismissed from office and will not be forgiven." The warning to dismiss disobedient officials without exception shocked those attending the meeting. However, it was not hard to understand Zhu Rongji's feelings after they had listened to Zou Jiahua's report about the overall economic situation. Zou frankly admitted that the overall financial situation in the market was serious. Although the policy to strengthen economic macro- control last summer did achieved certain results in curbing and stabilizing the situation, the overall financial situation, especially the banking order and foreign exchange payments, was still imbalanced on the whole. Zou Jiahua said: The State Council required all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities to submit their reports on economic construction, reform, and financial conditions in 1993 by 8 January, but seven provinces and autonomous regions had not yet discussed their reports at local party committee standing committee meetings, and many provinces and municipalities had not yet worked out their 1994 work plans. In that case, how could subordinate localities and units handle their work, and how could they maintain uniformity with the central authorities and carry out central instructions? At the meeting, Li Lanqing called for "setting thinking right, changing position, and developing the economy." He explained: In- depth reform cannot rely on the inflow of a large amount of foreign funds. This is not only because foreign investment has to be digested, but also because foreign investment has its limitations. The central authorities will not relax or change the macro-control policy. Although "macro-control" was again mentioned at the meeting, the central leaders really find it a headache to see that the local authorities had not obeyed their instructions. Reportedly, in early January, Zhu Rongji expressed his opinion at a routine meeting of the Political Bureau, and said that localism and anarchy had made it impossible to ensure the effective implementation of central measures. Zhu added that this problem could not lie unsolved any longer and that we should face reality squarely and adopt organizational measures to solve the problem, and we must take action before problems occur to a serious degree. Zhu Rongji also expressed his feelings of helplessness. If the local authorities refuse to carry out central instructions and "if they continue to pursue their own policies without regard to the central authorities, what can be done?" In addition to dealing with the serious financial situation and the "centrifugal" tendencies of local officials, Zhu Rongji is also facing challenges and pressure from the conservatives. Recently, Yao Yilin openly challenged him, and asked when attending a State Council meeting in mid-January: "A vicious cycle has taken shape in the fields of capital construction, currency distribution, imports, and credit. Who should bear responsibility for this? I think no one can bear such responsibility. Does the comrade who took the decisions bear such responsibility?" Yao Yilin also made an alarming prediction: "If the reform measures do not match national strength and the people's endurance, the financial situation may continue to deteriorate, the renminbi may be devalued by a big margin once again, and serious inflation may occur. If social turmoil happens this year, it may spread turmoil caused by other factors, and even riots may occur. The consequences will thus be more serious than the political riots in 1989." At present, social pressures have become rather obvious, and complaints about high inflation have been heard directly by Zhongnanhai. On the morning of 18 January, Jiang Zemin inspected Beijing's Wangfujing Department Store and attended a discussion meeting where worker deputies and party committee members of the department store expressed five points to the general secretary. On 20 January, their opinions were published at a briefing of the General Office of the State Council. There was a response within two days, and this shows that the opinions had attracted attention from top leaders. The five points were: First, prices of grain, cooking oil, and other foodstuffs are increasing too quickly, and ordinary residents cannot endure this and are cursing the Communist Party and the government. Second, central leaders and Beijing municipal leaders should care about the livelihood of Beijing residents. Living standards of retired workers are declining drastically, while the number of retired workers is increasing. Third, as grain and cooking oil are sold by the state, how are their prices raised haphazardly? This has caused a disorderly situation in the market and serious concerns among the people. The people's confidence in the government has dropped. Fourth, it is said that the working class is the leading class of the country and that the workers are the masters of the state. In reality, however, they do not understand government policies and measures and have no right to take part in the policy-making process. Fifth, workers are now complaining that reform is going too far and that they cannot endure it. This has caused tense relations between workers and cadres. Sources in the department store said that when a top official such as the general secretary came to see them, the workers did not care about his face. The worker deputies delivered a petition to Jiang Zemin, which was entitled "Workers' Voices and Demands." Party committee cadres on the spot tried to discourage the workers from doing this by saying that they should deliver the petition to the general secretary through the party committee, and adding that this was just the opinion of some workers. A full meeting of workers was not held. Such remarks aroused indignation among the workers, and the atmosphere became rather tense. This made it hard for Jiang Zemin to back down with good grace, and he could only say that worker deputies represent the voice of all workers. A similar event occurred again on 22 January. When Jiang Zemin attended a discussion meeting of workers from some industrial enterprises in Beijing, deputies from the construction, chemical, and textile industries delivered a petition to him. According to an internal newsletter, worker representatives in some trades strongly demanded that workers' views should be reflected in the management of enterprises, that the interests of the vast number of ordinary workers be cared for and protected, and that the income gap between party and administrative cadres and ordinary workers in enterprises should not be widened further in the course of reform. Data showed that in the construction industry, the income of party and administrative cadres was 120-300 percent higher than for ordinary workers. In the chemical industry, wage ratio between cadres and workers was 2.3 to 1, and for bonuses the ratio was 4 to 1. Worker deputies from the textile industry said at the meeting: In the city, some 100,000 textile workers do not work full hours, and their status is at the third tier under the party committee secretaries and factory directors at the top and department and workshop heads in the second tier. Resentment against the corrupt practice of seeking private gains by making use of official functions and powers and against the widening gap between rich and the poor has become a serious social problem. According to the General Office of the Beijing Municipal CPC Committee, between last November and mid-January this year, Beijing municipal government leaders held discussion meetings in 120 factories, enterprises, and shops in order to discover workers' feelings. Beyond their expectations, over 60 percent of worker representatives required that the pace of reform be slowed down, because workers could no longer endure it. Some worker representatives even said that ordinary people did not care whether there was reform or not; if they could not endure it there would be strikes, and they could take to the streets to stage demonstrations and even rebellions. For the CPC leadership, the situation has become more serious than previously, and signs of "turmoil," which they are most afraid of, have appeared. The Mayor Li Qiyan of Beijing recently admitted at a bureau-level cadre meeting that workers are very realistic. If they cannot endure, they will curse the government and the Communist Party and could even take to the streets to stage demonstrations. He also revealed that last year, strikes, go slows, mass rallies, and petitions occurred in more than 40 factories, mines, business enterprises, and institutions. The Beijing Municipal CPC Committee and the Beijing Municipal Government received more than 1,200 complaint letters signed collectively. What Li Qiyan revealed was just the situation in the capital where the central leaders live. The situation in other places can be imagined. As Deng Xiaoping's days are numbered, will the CPC leadership be able to withstand the impact produced by reform? Economic reform has brought about certain threats against the authoritarian rule of the CPC. Will it continue to advance or will it backtrack? It seems that the answer will be found this year.
