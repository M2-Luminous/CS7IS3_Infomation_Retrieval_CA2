On the contrary, they favor the establishment of a free port on La Gonave Island where refugees can be received. The lower house of Congress adopted this nonconstraining amendment to the defense budget, by 223 to 201 votes. The amendment was presented by Representative (Porchugos), a Republican from Florida, and emphasizes its opinion to the executive. The vote came after the U.S. Navy, in charge of enforcing UN sanctions against Haiti, on 22 and 23 May, fired [words indistinct] against two Bahamas-registered ships, which ignored their orders by trying to break the embargo. In its amendment, the House of Representatives expresses its opposition to a military invasion of Haiti unless there is an urgent and known danger threatening U.S. interests or citizens. President Bill Clinton has not formally ruled out the use of force against the military that is exercising de facto power in Haiti. A new regime of sanctions imposed by the United Nations went into effect on 21 May. The text also proposes that a free port be opened in La Gonave, an island located off Port-au-Prince with 80,000 inhabitants and a small military contingent. This free port could be used to examine the requests of Haitian refugees who wish to be granted political asylum in the United States and as a base for President-in-Exile Jean-Bertrand Aristide. We have also learned from reliable sources that besides the eight U.S. ships stationed off Haiti to ensure enforcement of the international embargo, the aircraft carrier Eisenhower, and the helicopter carrier (Rusp) also embarked into Haitian seas, with 650 additional Marines whose mission is to enforce respect for the embargo. They stated: We are ready to carry out any action provided that its main objective is to drive the military out of power. For the time being, the White House confirmed that Bill Clinton has made no formal decisions about sending troops to Haiti in order to reinstate President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
