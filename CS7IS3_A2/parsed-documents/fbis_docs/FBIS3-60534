Is that right?'' (from reader N. Pavlovich's letter). A SEM DNEY correspondent has talked to Anatoliy Kozhemyakin, chief epidemiologist of the Belarusian Ministry of Health. [Kozhemyakin] These rumors are grounded. While Belarus recorded 22, 26, and 66 cases of diphtheria in 1990, 1991, and 1992, respectively, over the first 10 months of this year, we have registered already 80 patients with 38 in Minsk and 12 in its oblast. Unfortunately, we have death cases as well. It is too early to speak about an epidemic, but the disease has passed to the offensive. [Malakhovskaya] Anatoliy Kuzmich, what are the reasons for such a rapid spread of diphtheria? [Kozhemyakin] People perceive diphtheria as a children's infectious disease. However, no matter how paradoxical this may be, this disease has matured considerably. For example, among the 80 patients, 52 people were over the age of 15. This can be explained by the fact that the immunity acquired through vaccination weakens over the years. According to laboratory tests conducted in Belarus, about 40 percent of the population, mostly adults, have no diphtheria antibodies. Therefore, the chief sanitary inspector of Belarus has issued an order requiring that residents be immunized every 10 years beginning from 16 years of age. Certainly, we must strictly observe the terms of children's immunization. By the way, about 87 percent of the Belarusian population was immunized or repeatedly vaccinated against diphtheria last year. Although this is one of the best indicators among the CIS countries, it falls short of the 95 percent recommended by the World Health Organization [WHO]. [passage omitted] [Malakhovskaya] Anatoliy Kuzmich, we have information that an epidemic of diphtheria has already been registered in Russia. [Kozhemyakin] Not only in Russia, but also in Ukraine. About 8,000 cases of diphtheria have been recorded in Russia over the first nine months of this year with 254 deaths among them. People's constant migration aggravates the situation both in our republic and abroad. According to the WHO statistics, 6,324 diphtheria patients have been recorded in 18 European countries over the first eight months of this year, with Russia and Ukraine accounting for 97 percent.
