Nikulin is a member of the Crimean parliamentary delegation which is expected to meet the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet delegation in Kiev on Tuesday in order to discuss the present situation. "I do not think that the talks can fail. We have not only political goals. We want the Ukrainian people to see what in fact is happening in Crimea," Nikulin pointed out. He repeated that the Crimean parliament would not annul its law on restoration of the constitutional basis of the Crimean statehood adopted on 20 May 1994. This law by the Crimean parliament re-established the Crimean Constitution of 6 May 1992. In accordance with this version of the Constitution, relations between Ukraine and Crimea must be based on treaties and agreements and Crimean inhabitants have the right for dual citizenship. Nikulin stressed that the Russia bloc stood for a union on the treaty basis both with Ukraine and Russia. "We have never wanted to withdraw Crimea from Ukraine. I hope this issue will not be raised," he added. However, he emphasized that the issue on a new state status of Crimea could be considered if Ukraine made life of Crimeans within the composition of Ukraine unbearable. On possible reunification of Crimea with Russia, Nikulin said there was no such purpose as a state reunification. However, he admitted that certain Crimean parliamentarians spoke in favor of this. He said that the Crimean parliament would be satisfied with the maximum of economic and cultural rights within the composition of Ukraine. Nikulin confirmed that the Crimean parliament had no claims to the Ukrainian troops on Crimean territory since the troops had the right to be stationed in Crimea. He added that certain statements on the part of some Crimean politicians were just their point of view.
