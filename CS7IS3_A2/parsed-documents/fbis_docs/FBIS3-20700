Two licenses will be necessary -- one for business activity and the other for each separate transaction. They will be issued by the Trade and Industry Ministry with the agreement of the Defense, Foreign, and Interior Ministries only if the members of the company's statutory body and its authorized officers are Czech Republic citizens over the age of 21 who have a clean record and were never employed by or collaborated with the former State Security. The law stipulates that the license application must contain, among other things, "the reason for the import or export or -- as the case may be -- other handling of the military material" and the "name and address of the end-user." The application must be accompanied by a "document on its final utilization." In reply to a question from RUDE PRAVO on whether the licensing procedure for specific transactions will also include verification of the foreign trade partner to prevent the possible re-export of weapons from the Czech Republic to areas of conflict, O. Vychodil (Civic Democratic Party), the parliamentary rapporteur on the law, said: "Consideration will be given, from the foreign policy point of view, to whether the region for which the weapons are destined is or is not a crisis region. For this reason, the Foreign, Defense, and Interior Ministries will also express their opinion on the application for a license for this kind of business. Cooperation with the information and intelligence services is also envisaged." According to Vychodil, the bodies that grant the license will be responsible for safeguarding the Czech Republic's interests. "If a deal goes through and the weapons are re-exported because the entity has not been verified, this may cause foreign policy problems," said Vychodil to RUDE PRAVO. Large and small-caliber weapons, ammunition, bombs, torpedoes, shells, mines, military explosives, aircraft, helicopters, aircraft engines, aircraft equipment and the ground equipment associated with it, missiles, and warships are considered to be military materials. The law states unequivocally that weapons of mass destruction must not be included in this kind of business. If the law is infringed and the Czech Republic's vital interests are harmed by the deal, a fine of up to 30 million korunas may be imposed. The specific individual involved may also face up to 10 years imprisonment. A fine of up to 5 million korunas may be imposed for a commonplace infringement of the law. RDP Group Director General J. Vlcek described the approved law on the export of military materials as a good norm that has created the demarcation desired by weapons exporters. The RDP Group affiliates 40 Czech enterprises that produce military materials. In Vlcek's opinion, it is fitting that the appropriate ministries will make the decision on the permits and licenses so that possible scandals -- caused, for example, by competition -- will not be laid at the door of those who hold permits and licenses to conduct business in weapons. In reply to a question from RUDE PRAVO on whether the exporter -- who has to submit a document on the final utilization of the military material, including the name and address of the end- user -- is capable of guaranteeing that the weapons will not be re-exported, Vlcek said: "No. In my opinion, the Trade and Industry Ministry must verify this. After consulting the Foreign Ministry and other departments, it must determine whether the end-user put forward by us is the right one and whether, in his case, there is any risk of re-export to so-called crisis countries and regions." The law contains a strict control mechanism. For example, staff from the Trade and Industry Ministry have the right to demand from the exporter the appropriate documents, agreements, and notification about using the licenses at any time. In reply to a question on whether this may be abused for competitive reasons and whether it could slow down the deals already underway, Vlcek said that he has spoken to Minister Dlouhy about this. "The question for us is to make sure that the officials execute the authority accorded to them by law, but in no way exploit it or hold things up artificially," said Vlcek. According to him, detailed directives dealing with this issue -- and also, for example, permitting publicity for the production and export of military materials -- will be adopted soon. As he said, supplementary norms should deal with these issues, "but, definitely so that the law really creates conditions that do not hold back so-called clean trade, conditions that do not activate unnecessary barriers."
