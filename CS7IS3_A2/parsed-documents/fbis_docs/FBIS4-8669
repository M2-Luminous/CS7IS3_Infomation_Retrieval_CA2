Lech Walesa, who is in Litomysl, said that he does not believe that the coalition has serious thoughts about limiting presidential rights, but if it makes such an attempt then it will bear the consequences. Presidential Spokesman Andrzej Drzycimski stated that if amendments to the Constitution were passed in the Sejm, the president would then have to defend the Constitution. A group of Polish Peasant Party [PSL] and Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] deputies who tabled the bill with these amendments want the Sejm to have the power to appoint ministerial candidates put forward by the prime minister, should the president refuse to sign such a nomination. According to the bill, the dissolved Sejm would end its term of office only on the day of the first sitting of a newly elected parliament. The coalition needs a two-thirds majority in the Sejm to pass the amendments to the Constitution. To achieve such a majority, the SLD and PSL deputies require a dozen or so votes more.
