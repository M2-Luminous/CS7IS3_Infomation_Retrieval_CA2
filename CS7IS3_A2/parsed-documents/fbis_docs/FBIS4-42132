Ciller, who is currently in the United States, declared that the report drafted by the IMF delegation that visited Turkey at the beginning of the month was approved by IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus. According to information supplied by the Prime Minister's Press Center, Ciller issued the following statement on the subject: IMF Director Michel Camdessus called me today and informed me that he has approved the report of the IMF delegation that visited Turkey at the beginning of this month. Accordingly, the IMF will extend $713 million to Turkey within the framework of the stand-by agreement. Camdessus' decision on this matter will be put into effect by the IMF board of governors, which will convene at the beginning of July. The statement made by the IMF today is pleasing. Firstly, the negotiating process with the IMF was concluded at a fast rate. Secondly, as will be noted in Mr. Camdessus' statement, the IMF finds the economic program which was announced and effected by the Turkish Government on 5 April very comprehensive, realistic, and solid. The $713 million contribution to be received from the IMF within the stand-by agreement constitutes the maximum amount Turkey can receive from this organization. This, in turn, is a significant indication of the international support accorded to our program. The most important aspect of the IMF statement, in my view, is the fact that the program, which was prepared and effected by the Turkish Government itself, was endorsed without any argument. In other words, the IMF has fully approved our formula for the recovery of the Turkish economy. With the implementation of this program, Turkey will occupy the position it deserves among the strongest economies of Europe.
