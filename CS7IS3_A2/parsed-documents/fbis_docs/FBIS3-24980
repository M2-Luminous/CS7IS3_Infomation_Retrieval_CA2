I think that if God has not heard the prayers, then he must have already left our country. [passage omitted] Burundi ladies and gentlemen, Burundi has really suffered and greed has exacerbated the already bad situation. You have either heard about it or have seen it for yourselves: houses, bridges, schools, hospitals in many parts of the country have been destroyed because of the crisis which has just prevailed in Burundi. People killed one another, and those who managed to escape in the regions concerned became helpless refugees and fled elsewhere within the country. Others sought sanctuary in neighboring countries. The refugees who fled these troubles, who are outside the country, exceed 700,000. The internal refugees, excluding those in the valleys and in the bush, exceed 200,000. We have not yet clearly established the number of victims of this disaster, but you know that they number thousands, and that will take Burundi backwards economically and socially. All Burundians need peace and mutual trust so that they can live together once more. Mutual distrust and hatred among the people should be fought against strongly. Burundi is in bereavement [kubura]. All Burundians are in bereavement. Please overcome your anger so that hatred (?does not build). There is also a saying that by avenging your own people, you bring about the end of your family. Burundi is a common farm given to us by God. It will never be divided into two or three parts. Burundians should once more come together, unite in restoring peace, restoring security so that our country may prosper once more. Whoever dreams about worsening the situation so that Burundi remains in crisis, I call on you to strongly reject him without condoning evil. I take this opportunity to remind Burundians who still dream of destruction and [word indistinct], and, more particularly, members of some opposition parties, let them look at the misery confronting our helpless Burundian brothers and then stop their designs which can bring nothing to us other than adding insult to injury. The times we are living through are not right for arguments but rather for rescuing each other. We urge Burundians who still dream of shedding blood, all those who are behaving in a riotous manner, those who spend their time brandishing their weapons at each other--we urge them to remember that they did not create those they threaten and that they are not at all allowed to torture or (?harm) those of different political or ethnic affiliations. Respect for human life is upheld worldwide, and we are going to take swift measures to stop killings which are rampant in Burundi. In our programs, in which we believe and will be teaching, we must make all Burundians understand that it is an offense to abuse human rights. No matter who is concerned--whether he is a Hutu, Tutsi, or Twa--his life, his family, and his property must be respected. There is no tribe destined for extermination, no tribe to be trampled upon, no tribe better than another; a tribe for killing, one for preserving alone. All Burundians--whether they are Hutu, Tutsi, or Twa--are equal before God and the law. We call on all the registered parties of Burundi to work accordingly towards the goal of reconciliation and reconstruction. We call upon them to do their utmost to assist the government in strengthening peace and tranquility in the country for the benefit of all Burundians without bringing hatred among ethnic groups. I promise to always meet party leaders so that we may study how peace and tranquility are never disturbed again. However, members and leaders of parties must know that a party does not give the green light to its leaders or its members to be carefree, to intentionally break the law. The government will not hesitate to punish a law breaker, irrespective of his identity, even if he is a party leader. I also take this opportunity to remind the youth, because they have a great role to play in building the Burundi of tomorrow -- we call upon them to come back to their senses. We ask them to avoid deceitful advisers who want nothing from them other than to use them as tools. [passage omitted] Parents, who are in charge of education, are called upon to be a good example in upholding unity, peace and understanding. Let them avoid sowing seeds of division of any kind, because by so doing they will be digging a grave for Burundi. There is an old saying that he who steals while carrying a baby on his back teaches the latter to do the same. [passage omitted] Burundians, the recent killings that the country has been experiencing have caused clear mistrust amongst the people, especially on ethnic grounds. Many among you may be asking yourselves whether it is still possible for Burundians to live together as before. Most of you may be asking yourselves how the future government will behave so that citizens may once more live together in peace, government employees work hard for development once more, so that those who have fled their homes may return unhindered, so that those with arms may lay them down, so that the ever-increasing banditry may be stopped, and many other questions that we do not want to talk about. All those questions to yourselves are being asked at the right time and because of what has happened. However, there is no remedy other than all of us agreeing that the laws and rules of the country should be respected first so that we may work in peace. That is why we ask the security services to open their eyes more. They should work impartially, stop the bad actions which keep on causing problems in our country. We shall be very happy when we see them heeding this call, when they carry out their duties without hesitation (?and impartially). In summary, we are going to act fast to restore discipline in the country, discipline in the army, discipline in schools, discipline in leadership, discipline in the whole of Burundi so that Burundians may respect each other, respect the laws and pursue their work, the source of development. Nothing else will save Burundi apart from work, justice and respect for human rights. [passage omitted] Burundi ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow morning we will form the government that will help us to implement our programs to revive Burundi in all its sectors. You have heard for the past few days that we have been meeting party leaders, church leaders and representatives of international organizations, namely the United Nations and the OAU. You will hear later on about what we agreed on the government that we intend to form. However, I would like to tell you about the main points that we shall implement soon. First, the prime minister will be chosen after looking into the current political problems in the country, especially the current ethnic conflicts that we have been experiencing. We shall appoint him after assessing his wisdom and courage and after assessing whether he is committed to peace and democracy for all. As we agreed during the discussions that we held with other political leaders, we shall choose him from the largest opposition party. After studying his behaviour during the difficult times that we have undergone, after ensuring that he has had no hand in the recent killings and disturbances. The next prime minister will be a wise man or woman who unreservedly agrees to assist the president in his duty to implement programs so that the new Burundi we want takes root. Second, the men and women to be appointed to the Burundi Government will also show proof of leadership and enough knowledge in assisting the head of state to find solutions to the problems facing Burundi currently, whether political or economic. As you know, the task of forming the government belongs to the head of state in consultation with the prime minister. We shall carry out the job as soon as possible in accordance first, with the ideas of the Front for Democracy in Burundi [FRODEBU] party which won the elections. We shall also appoint senior government employees in consultation with the prime minister and ministers, bearing in mind the good of the country, and without discrimination. We ask all those charged with these duties to carry them out for the common good and that they show determination to revive our country. The main goals of the government that we shall form in the near future will be as follows: First, to pacify the country and do everything possible so that peace, tranquillity and mutual trust return among all Burundians. Second, to teach respect for human rights in the entire country. Third, to resettle the displaced without forgetting the previously planned repatriation of refugees from abroad. Concerning the revival of the economy. The government will strive to rebuild what has been destroyed in the recent disturbances. However, this is a job for everyone. The government will also revamp the country's economy through all the activities in our country. It will also continue the projects that had been halted due to the recent disturbances. [passage omitted] Burundi ladies and gentlemen, I cannot conclude this address without wholeheartedly thanking the Burundians and foreigners who made sacrifices or assisted in enabling Burundi to reach this stage. Allow me to particulary thank the Government of Burundi which was led by Her Excellency Sylvie Kinigi [short break in transmission] Ntibantunganya. We also thank those who contributed towards getting Burundi out of the crisis, particularly neighboring and friendly countries, international organizations such as the United Nations and OAU, private businessmen, religious leaders and whoever made any contribution to the return of peace or helped our victims. Please join me in hailing them. I take this opportunity to ask them to continue supporting us as they have always done. [passage omitted]
