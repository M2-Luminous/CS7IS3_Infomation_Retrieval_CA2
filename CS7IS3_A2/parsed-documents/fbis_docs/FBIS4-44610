Maximum single-device power is 2-3 W (at 4A-5A), while peak pulsed power of diode arrays is 100 W. Threshold current (density) is 2 mA/cm[.sup]2[/], and equivalent series resistance is 0.6-0.8 ohm. The series, which received a CAS S&T advancement award in 1990, is superior to the foreign-made LD60 product, and meets mid-to-late-80s international standards. These laser diodes are used in military firing simulators, missile laser fuses, remote-controlled detonators, security alarm systems, laser guidance units, and military night-vision equipment.
