This principle was imposed almost unanimously during the debate on the final draft of the Parliament's statutes. The opinions of the members of parliament differed somewhat when they tried to resolve the questions of remunerations. There was a lengthy debate on whether the members of parliament -- officials and ministers -- should get additional pay, but no decision was adopted. The members of parliament also resolved that only the author's honorarium for works of art and their performance, also for publications and books will qualify for payment for creative activity (hourly remuneration for pedagogical, scholarly-scientific work or consultation having been crossed out from the list). Following the vote, deputy chairman of parliament J. Bernatonis congratulated the members of parliament for "having supported the ideals of socialism." In the opinion of many members of parliament, there will be one more vote concerning this article, because it does not satisfy those who teach or work in the universities or similar institutions. Yesterday the parliament also took care of the publishing houses and their editorial personnel that specialize in periodicals. The parliament decided to allow them to privatize the premises they are renting that belong to the sphere of state regulation. When such premises are not being privatized, municipal or district boards are obligated to provide them with space of equal value. Just before the adoption of this decision, the members of parliament decided not to permit the privatization of the premises that are rented by the state information agency. The most vocal opposition to this was voiced by K. Snezko, a representative of the LDDP (Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party) faction, who had missed 78 meetings during two sessions and had never participated in the discussions. Most of the representatives of the parliamentary factions of the Right also voted against the decision or abstained themselves, because in their opinion it would help the LDDP to strength its influence in the newspapers. V. Zimnickas, who presented the report, was of a different opinion. He asserted that "if we want to preserve an independent press, we must help it." In the afternoon meeting, the President's adviser on state and legal questions R. Andrikis submitted to the members of parliament a "Law on Declaring Property and Income of the Inhabitants of the Republic of Lithuania," which is presented by the President. According to Mr. Andrikis, the main principles of this law are the linking of the declaration with taxes, the universal character of declaration, and the secrecy of the information on the declaration. Answering R. Ozolas, who asked how the new law essentially differed from the one that was earlier rejected by the president, R. Andrikis asserted that there was one difference: "the earlier law was a law on the listing of property." After the members of parliament had approved the submission of the new law on the declaration of property and taxes, the head of the Conservative faction A. Kubilius congratulated J. Bernatonis on his victory and publicly suggested that both of them declare their own and their family members' property and income. J. Bernatonis did not respond to this offer; when asked by LIETUVOS RYTAS, why he did not answer the question, he replied: "Because the members of the parliament did not have their health checked before the elections." Following the vote, social democrat N. Medvedevas said that he was going to lie down in front of the rostrum and block the new law until the experts have presented their conclusions on this law's potential consequences for Lithuania.
