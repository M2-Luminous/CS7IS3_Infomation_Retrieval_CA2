Foreign Relations Minister Roberto Robaina has commented on possible economic ties that might be established with Zambia and other topics of interest. [Begin recording] [Robaina] Our people want to find an economic solution to the situation we are facing. This economic solution does not only depend on finding business deals that are more or less advantageous. It also depends on what constitutes a need for us but which could become an investment opportunity for others. In all honesty, we have things that could be useful to other countries and, in this particular case, to Zambia. The foreign minister is visiting with this delegation to expand on the talks we began in Zambia and to contact the Ministries and institutes that control agriculture, tourism, sports, health, and education. [Unidentified reporter] What trade potential does... [pauses] What does Zambia have that Cuba needs, and what does Cuba have... [Robaina, interrupting] No, the potential is not excessively great. We cannot develop it based on whether or not great potential exists. We develop it by opening a path in the fields of education, health, and sports. We have attained significant results, and the Zambians are very interested in learning about these results and in establishing important economic trade under conditions of mutual benefit. [Reporter] Are there any Zambians here? [Robaina] There are Zambian students who are attending universities here mainly in the eastern provinces. [Reporter] They are not on the Isle of Pines? [Robaina] No. In the particular case of Zambia, they are studying at the university and [words indistinct]. [Reporter] How many are there? [Robaina] Just a few of them; not very many, but a few. [end recording] Robaina also discussed aspects relating to his next Latin American tour. [Begin recording] [Robaina] Soon, I will begin a tour through Latin America on an official visit that includes several countries. [Reporter] Which countries? [Robaina] Uruguay, Ecuador, Peru, and Argentina. [Reporter] And how about Paraguay? [Robaina] We are discussing the possibility of an official visit to Paraguay. We have no relations with Paraguay; we are trying to find a way. It all depends on a confirmation and any step that is taken is important, particularly any step that helps us know one another better. [Reporter] Any comments on the apology made by the Colombian daily EL TIEMPO about the... [Robaina, interrupting] There is a saying that goes like this: Sooner or later, life will prove you right. In this case, sooner or later, time proved we were right. [Reporter] What is the current status of relations with Colombia now that this issue has been resolved? [Robaina] Well, I would avoid using the term current status because we feel these relations were never affected. In other words, since relations were established, nothing has affected them as far as we are concerned. I believe that for those who had any doubts, life and reality have proved we were right. We have nothing to rectify because from the very beginning we voiced what our position was. [Reporter] What did EL TIEMPO say? [Robaina] EL TIEMPO said it regretted having published statements that were unfounded, and this evidently made it retract the story. I prefer that a final conclusion be made by those who read the newspaper's apology. We have nothing else to say. Whatever we had to say, we said it at the appropriate time. [Reporter] How about visits by Colombian officials to Cuba? [Robaina] These visits continue; there are no problems in this area. [Reporter] Including the visit by the foreign minister? [Robaina] That is right, including the visit by the foreign minister. [Reporter] What is your opinion of Gaviria's election to the post of OAS secretary general? [Robaina] I think comments on this topic should be made by those who are members of that organization. I think Gaviria is a conscientious person who has prestige and is well respected, and this will be helpful. [Reporter] He speaks about more solidarity and a strong relationship among all countries of the region. [Robaina] I think that this is a good thing for a new secretary general to say. [end recording] You have just heard statements made by Cuban foreign minister after receiving in Havana his Zambian counterpart, Remmy Mushota. In addition to the official talks with his counterpart, the Zambian visitor will also meet with the heads of the sugar industry; public health; the Sports Institute; the State Committee for Economic Cooperation; and Carlos Lage, vice president of the State Council.
