Requests for copies of EPA comments can be directed to the Office of Federal Activities at (202) 260&hyph;5076. An explanation of the ratings assigned to draft environmental impact statements (EISs) was published in FR dated April 10, 1993 (58 FR 18392). Draft EISs ERP No. D&hyph;AFS&hyph;K67021&hyph;NV Rating EC2, Jerritt Canyon Gold Mine Expansion Project, Implementation, Plan of Operation and COE Section 404 Permit, Humboldt National Forest, Mountain City Ranger District, Elko County, NV. Summary: EPA expressed environmental concerns regarding the proposed alternative due to potential impacts to water quality, water quantity, air quality and vegetation. EPA recommended that the final EIS provide additional information on these issues as well as cumulative impacts and wetlands mitigation. ERP No. D&hyph;FRA&hyph;B53010&hyph;00 Rating LO1, Northeast Corridor Improvement Project, Implementation, Electrification of the Rail Main Line from New Haven to Boston, Funding, COE Section 10 and 404 Permits, New Haven, CT and Boston, MA. Summary: EPA stated that the proposed project had the potential to improve region air quality and that other environmental resources within EPA's jurisdiction and expertise would not be significantly adversely affected by the proposed project. ERP No. DC&hyph;FHW&hyph;B40050&hyph;MA Rating EC2, Central Artery/I&hyph;93 Third Harbor Tunnel/I&hyph;90 Extension, Updated and Additional Information, Design Alternatives for the Charles River Crossing, Funding, US COE Section 10 and 404 Permits, US CGD Permits and EPA NPDES Permit, Suffolk County, MA. Summary: EPA expressed environmental concerns for Clean Air Act conformity requirements to be addressed, and the analysis of shading impacts and compensatory mitigation for adverse environmental impacts to waters of the United States. EPA commented that all three new design alternatives presented in the draft supplemental EIS would have less adverse environmental impact, and less adverse impact on parks and open space, than the alternative (Scheme Z) presented in the 1991 final supplemental EIS as the proposed action. ERP No. DS&hyph;AFS&hyph;K65136&hyph;CA Rating LO, Casa-Guard Timber Sale, Timber Harvesting, Updated Information concerning Impacts on the California Spotted Owl and Fish Creek Watershed and Reforestation, Sequoia National Forest, Cannell Meadow Ranger District, Tulare County, CA.

ERP No. DS&hyph;AFS&hyph;K65137&hyph;CA Rating LO, Cottonwood and Gulf Timber Sales, Timber Harvesting in the Breckenridge Compartment, Updated Information Concerning Withdrawal of the Golf Timber Sale and Impacts on the California Spotted Owl and Reforestation for the Cottonwood Timber Sale, Sequoia National Forest, Greenhorn Ranger District, Kern County, CA.

Final EISs No. F&hyph;COE&hyph;B40062&hyph;NH, Nashua-Hudson Circumferential Highway Improvements, Approval and COE Section 10 and 404 Permits, Towns of Hudson, Nashua and Litchfield, Hillsborough County, NH. Summary: EPA had environmental objections to the proposed action due to (1) significant degradation of waters of the United States, including wetlands; (2) potential adverse impacts to water supply resources; and (3) the lack of specific mitigation to offset the impacts to waters of the U.S. and drinking water supplies. EPA stated that the proposed action is a likely candidate for action under EPA's Section 404 (c) authority and recommended that the Corps of Engineers deny the Section 404 permit application.
