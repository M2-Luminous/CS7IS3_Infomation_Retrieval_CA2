Shahin] [Text] Amman--A group of prominent businessmen on Wednesday [23 March] officially launched a $200 million holding company to invest in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Kamal al-Sha'ir, a Jordanian businessman, was elected chairman of the company's 16- member board of directors. The Palestine Development and Investment Incorporated (PDII) is the first major Arab-led commercial enterprise to be launched since the Sept. 13 signing of the autonomy accord between Israel and the PLO. "This is a historic day for the economic and developmental future of the occupied territories," said Ahmad Quray', head of the Economic Department of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), addressing the audience at a ceremony launching PDII at the Amman Chamber of Industry. The ceremony, followed by the election of the board of directors, was attended by many of the 141 investors who constitute the financial backbone of much of the Palestinian community in the diaspora. They include Arab Bank Chairman 'Abd-al-Hamid Shuman, Hasib al-Sabbagh, Sa'id Khuri, Munib al-Masri, Ramzi Dallul, and 'Abd-al-Muhsin Qattan. Several leaders of the Jordanian business community such as Khalil al-Talhuni, Kamal al-Sha'ir, and Khaldun Abu-Hassan and Jordanian banks such as the Cairo Amman Bank and the Housing Bank are also founding members of the PDII. The opening was attended by Minister of Information Jawad al-'Anani and Palestinian Ambassador to Jordan al-Tayyib 'Abd-al-Rahim as well as Jerusalem-based Palestinian leader and leading peace negotiator Faysal al-Husayni. "We, in the occupied territories, welcome the venture with open arms," Mr. Husayni told the press. He stressed that in view of the economic difficulties and restraints faced by the people in the occupied territories, "all help is welcome." Mr. Quray', one of the Palestinian architects behind the Oslo peace accord, said: "Our information indicates that at least 50 per cent of the people in the occupied territories are unemployed; investment in housing and industries will change that." "We have estimated that we need to build 185,000 housing units in the occupied territories," he added. The founding members, who have thus far contributed just over half of the capital, or $100 million, say they hope to raise another $100 million. "In another six to eight months the number of founding investors could reach up to 300 or more and the capital investment would grow to $200 million," said company spokesman Raja'i al-Masri. "This is the first major initiative of its kind by the Palestinian private sector in the economic development of the occupied territories," said Mr. Quray'. The company was registered in Liberia as an off-shore share-holding firm in October 1993, and it will retain that status until the political and economic situation in the occupied territories becomes "more settled," Mr. al-Masri said. It was also announced at Wednesday's meeting that the PDII was a 49 per cent share-holder in the West Bank-based al-Ruwad Investment Group, which is a West Bank-registered share-holding company with an initial capital of $50 million. Al-Ruwad will act as PDII's largest subsidiary in the occupied territories, said Kamal Hassuni, a West Bank investor in PDII and director of Al-Ruwad. "West Bank and Gaza investors have 51 per cent of the shares and our first priority is to build badly needed housing units," Mr. Hassuni said. PDII will initially concentrate on housing, industry, light industry and the tourism. The ownership composition is in accordance with Jordanian laws implemented before the 1967 Israeli seizure of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. "Local residents must have the majority of the shares," said Raja Shihadah, a prominent Ramallah-based lawyer, who also addressed the audience and briefed investors on the legal aspects of investment in the occupied territories. Company shares will be made available to the public once PDII is listed at a stock market. "We don't expect that a Palestinian stock market will develop in the very near future but the PDII stocks will undoubtedly be listed in the stock markets of Arab capitals such as Amman, Beirut and Bahrain," said one of the founders of the company. The members of the board are: The Arab Bank Ltd, the Cairo-Amman Bank (Yazid Mufti), Said Co., al-Masirah Co., Nabil al-Shawwa, Ramzi Dallul, 'Azmi 'Abd-al-Hadi, Nidal Sukhtyan, Riad Sadiq, Husayn Sharqawi, Zuhdi Khury and the Housing Bank.
