In yesterday's European elections, this theme dominated everything else. And the results, which could be likened to a thunderbolt, at the very least bear witness to this discrepancy which affects the very core of our democracy. To be sure, one can seek comfort in the belief that this election was but a way for voters to release some steam. However, European elections have always provided a good snapshot of national voting trends. A nationwide proportional ballot, such an election is probably as reliable as any opinion poll. One would be mistaken to dismiss them as an inconsequential. There will be power shifts within the Right -- the UDF [French Democratic Union], RPR [Rally for the Republic], and National Front -- as a result of the election. During the campaign, it appeared clearly that the stage for the presidential election was being set, albeit in a covert manner: For potential contenders for the top job (Messrs. Chirac, Balladur, and Giscard d'Estaing, among others), supporting the UDF-RPR list was a mostly risk-free way of staking their claim. All of them went all out in their support for the majority list. Valery Giscard d'Estaing, whom no one can suspect of indecisiveness or incompetence in this area, was especially active; in particular he was the only one among the majority's main leaders to battle it out on television. His debate with [Socialist Party Secretary General] Michel Rocard on 8 June was his first televised duel since he last locked horns with Francois Mitterrand on 5 May 1981. However, the mediocre performance of the RPR-UDF list cannot be blamed on the former president of the Republic, nor on the prime minister or the Paris mayor. Truth be told, list leaders made too many mistakes, and they lacked ardor. In fact, the main lesson to be derived from this election is not so much the performance of the RPR-UDF list as the distribution of the votes among the three lists (Baudis, de Villiers, and Le Pen), on the one hand, and the abstention rate, on the other. Ten months before the presidential election, Europe was prone to a double risk: first of all, the risk of indifference, demonstrated by a high abstention rate; second, the risk of fierce opposition, reflected in the results of the de Villiers and Le Pen lists on the Right, and the Chevenement, Wurtz, and Laguiller lists on the Left. Given the 45-percent abstention rate, which remains high even though it is lower than that of 1989, and given the results of the de Villiers, Le Pen, Chevenement, Wurtz, Laguiller, and "Chasse-Peche" [hunters and fishermen] lists, this double risk has been confirmed. Presidential contenders will not be able to ignore such a negative reaction with respect to Europe. This is not only true for Michel Rocard, who moreover has to worry about Mr. Tapie, but also for the future UDF or RPR candidate or candidates. Indeed, this rejection hinges on a widespread resistance and aversion among the electorate of the parliamentary Right. Being against Europe also means being against technocracy, immigrant workers, the free flow of goods and people at the borders, etc. An "anti" and angry rhetoric has been gaining ground among right-wing voters, leading them somewhat away from the liberal model. Such rhetoric, such negative reflexes are a reflection of all the fears and distress of the times. Will future RPR or UDF candidates know how to thwart this trend? Will they be able to? They should not underestimate such trends which some people call "populism," "nationalism," or even "fascism," and nor should they believe that the old Right-Left divide will necessarily be revived at the time of the presidential election. There is no hard evidence that the so-called stray sheep who voted for de Villiers or Le Pen will heed the call for unity of the RPR-UDF candidate in May 1995. There was no foregoing evidence of the magnitude of the slide suffered by the Socialists and the Greens in last year's parliamentary election. And no evidence of yesterday's startling results either. Everything seems to point to a shift away from ideology toward the irrational, the emotional, and a kind of tribalism. In such a context, what will be the outcome of the battle to be fought in May 1995? There is more to this challenge than renewed growth or lower unemployment figures. It also refers to the growing irrational and emotional charge relayed and amplified by the electronic media. This is an issue which RPR and UDF presidential candidates cannot ignore.
