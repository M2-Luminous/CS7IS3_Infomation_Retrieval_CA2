Last year, the bank's total increase in individual savings was 50.5 billion yuan, roughly equal to total increases between 1986 and 1990. Since the beginning of last year, the bank, which is mainly in charge of issuing loans for major state construction projects, has done unprecedentedly brisk business in personal savings. Bank officials attributed the achievements to the contract system carried out in a bid to bring the workers' enthusiasm into full play. Taking advantage of the Central People's Bank raising interest rates in May and July last year, the construction bank held a 100-day savings promotion program from July 11 to October 20, 1993. The effort resulted in an increase of 22.5 billion yuan in personal savings.
