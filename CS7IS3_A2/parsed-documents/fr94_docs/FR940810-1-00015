FR940810-1-00015 FR940810-1-00004 Regulatory Evaluation This proposed rule would not be a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 on Federal Regulation and would not be significant under the Regulatory Policies and Procedures of the Department of Transportation [DOT Order 2100.5 (May 22, 1980)]. It has not been reviewed under E.O. 12866. Nonetheless, a Regulatory Evaluation is available in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under ADDRESSES . The marine industry would incur an estimated annual benefit of $250,000 as a result of this proposed rule. There is no cost associated with this rule, which would reduce the number of vessels affected by current standards. Small Entities The Coast Guard has determined that this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under ยง605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act [5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.] that this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Collection of Information This proposed rule would not increase the paperwork burden on the public. The only paperwork involves ship design calculations used in the development of stability information, but this information is already subject to review by the Coast Guard under 46 CFR 170.110. The Coast Guard previously submitted the requirements regarding its collection of this information, developed from these and other calculations, to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review under the Paperwork Reduction Act [44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.], and the OMB approved them. The applicable control numbers from OMB are 2115&hyph;0095, 2115&hyph;0114, 2115&hyph;0130, and 2115&hyph;0131. For further information, write or call the Information Requirements Division, M&hyph;34, Officer of the Secretary of Transportation, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20593, (202) 366&hyph;4735. Federalism The Coast Guard has analyzed this proposed rule in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and has determined that the rule would not have sufficient implications for federalism to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. This proposed rule would establish standards for damage stability of new domestic passenger vessels. The authority to establish these standards in all navigable waters of the United States is committed to the Coast Guard by Federal statutes. Furthermore, since passenger vessels tend to move from port to port in the national and international marketplace, standards for them should be of at least national scope to avoid unreasonably burdensome variances. Therefore, the Coast Guard intends this rule to preempt State action addressing these standards. Environment The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this proposed rule and concluded that, under paragraph 2.B.2.c of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this rule is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. This rule would require a minimal standard for damage stability of new domestic passenger vessels. It would not govern how potential pollutants or hazardous materials are carried on board these vessels, though stabler vessels should reduce the number of uncontrolled releases of pollutants or hazardous materials into the environment. It does not result in any_ 1. Significant cumulative impacts on the human environment; 2. Substantial controversy or substantial change to existing environmental conditions; 3. Impacts more than minimal on properties protected under sub- 4(f) of the DOT Act as superseded by Public Law 97&hyph;449, or under ยง106 of the National Historic Preservation Act; or 4. Inconsistencies with any Federal, State, or local laws or administrative determinations relating to the environment. A Determination of Categorical Exclusion is available in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under ADDRESSES . List of Subjects in 46 CFR Part 171 Marine Safety, Passenger vessels. For the reasons set out in this preamble, the Coast Guard proposes to amend Title 46, Chapter I, Code of Federal Regulations, as follows: PART 171_SPECIAL RULES PERTAINING TO VESSELS CARRYING PASSENGERS 1.

For the purposes of paragraphs (e) and (f), the following definitions apply: (1) New vessel means a vessel_ (i) For which a building contract is placed on or after [Insert date 90 days after date of publication of the final rule in the Federal Register .]; (ii) In the absence of a building contract, the keel of which is laid, or which is at a similar stage of construction, on or after [Insert date 90 days after date of publication of the final rule in the Federal Register .]; (iii) The delivery of which occurs on or after January 1, 1997; (iv) For which application for reflagging is made on or after January 1, 1997; or (v) That has undergone a major conversion_ (A) For which the conversion contract is placed on or after [Insert date 90 days after date of publication of the final rule in the Federal Register .]
