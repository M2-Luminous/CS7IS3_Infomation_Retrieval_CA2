Tajik opposition militants shell both Tajik villages and Russian border posts, says the document circulated by the Information Directorate of the Tajik Foreign Ministry. For instance, the border village of Parvar, Shuroabad District, which is in the area of operations of the 12th Border Post, Moskovskiy sector, was shelled with rockets for over 40 minutes on February 21. The eighth border post, Pyandzh River sector, was shelled from trench mortars on the night of February 18. As a result, one Russian guard was killed. There are enough facts indicating that similar provocations are being hatched at other sections of the Tajik-Afghan border. Taking into account the fact that Afghan authorities have no real possibilities to control and prevent these piratic actions and mindful of repeated statements made by the Tajik Government on its right to take resolute retaliatory measures, I must say that all weapons opening fire across the border will be immediately destroyed in future with the use of all types of arms in the possession of border troops. The statement stresses that field commanders of Afghan Mujahideen can understand possible consequences of such artillery duels which will only add privations and sufferings to the defenceless population of Afghan border regions. The general expressed hope that the well-being of their fellow countrymen is worth of bridling the presumptuous chieftains of Tajik armed opposition who do not give a farthing for the life of Afghan citizens providing shelter to them. "I hope for mutual understanding from leaders caring for their people and am ready to conduct a dialogue within my competence at all levels," the statement concludes.
