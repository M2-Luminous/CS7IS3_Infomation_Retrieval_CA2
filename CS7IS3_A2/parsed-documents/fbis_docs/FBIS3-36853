The report said that the situation in other sections of the front remained relatively calm, meaning that the sides were exchanging fire but did not mount offensives. The Azerbaijani army has lost up to 5,000 soldiers and officers, one warplane and 62 armoured vehicles, including 36 tanks, in the 1.5-month large-scale offensive it launched on December 18, 1993. It also lost 12 artillery guns, including three Grad missile launchers, and a large amount of other arms. Twenty six Azerbaijani soldiers have surrendered. The Karabakh side lost about 300 people and 24 armoured vehicles which have been fully made up for by seized Azerbaijani tanks and armoured personnel carriers. The Nagorno-Karabakh military explain the decline in the activity of the Azerbaijani army by considerable losses, especially among new recruiters who make up the bulk of its troops, and the absence of big positive results. Karabakh experts said that Azerbaijan's initial successes owed to its strength superiority. They were of a local nature and were eventually neutralised by the Karabakh forces.
