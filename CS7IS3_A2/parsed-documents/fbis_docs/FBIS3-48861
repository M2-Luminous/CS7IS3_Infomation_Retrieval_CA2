The officials admit it was a mistake for the Japanese Government to turn its back on the "general idea" that clearly admits to the low level of market openness in Japan. They feel that Japanese negotiators have lost sight of the broad trade issues involved and have been forced to focus their attention on countering U.S. negotiators on the "particulars" of the issues. The officials are concerned that, as a result, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's planned visit to the United States will achieve nothing. Their views apparently reflect such concerns. Vice ministerial talks were held in Washington on 25 January to discuss the issues, but both sides refused to make any concessions. At this rate, it has become increasingly unlikely that there will be practical results from the 11 February talks between Prime Minister Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton. With such grim prospects in view, officials in some quarters of the Foreign Ministry, including the Japanese Embassy in the United States, who watch Japanese-U.S. relations closely, have reportedly deepened their "concern about the growing feeling of distrust between Japanese and U.S. negotiators." In the framework trade talks, the United States has argued that the microeconomic (individual) sectors of government procurement, insurance services, and automobiles and auto parts in Japan "are less open than the U.S. and European markets, and the concept of horizontal international specialization (in which nations mutually import and export industrial products to supplement each other) is still underdeveloped there; therefore, it is necessary to resolve the problem by increasing imports in services as well as products to correct the imbalance in bilateral current account payments." The Japanese Foreign Ministry officials noted above feel this argument is essentially correct. Meanwhile, the Japanese Government officials directly in charge of trade negotiations have been at odds with U.S. negotiators. They have presented the following three principles to the Americans: 1) market access should proceed on a two-way basis; 2) the setting of numerical targets should be rejected; and 3) the scope of government responsibility must be clarified. The critical Foreign Ministry officials noted above complain that "although it is undeniable that the issue of Japanese market access has been taken lightly by Japanese negotiators, it seems they have devoted themselves to refuting U.S. arguments on the `particulars' of the three principles and rejected the `general idea' itself." Japanese negotiators have also demanded the United States abolish government control of insurance services and government procurement on the basis of a "two-way traffic" principle. The Foreign Ministry dissenters say: "Japan should actively deal with the government procurement system and insurance business market access as problems in themselves. Taking up U.S. problems could make the Americans think Japan is trying to avoid the real issues." The officials also say: "If demands on the United States are not kept to a minimum, the whole purpose of the framework trade talks will be lost." Such criticism has also been presented to Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata in the form of a statement of opinion. It has resulted in the unusual situation of bureaucratic domination of the trade talks being condemned by bureaucrats. The dissenters have also urged Japan to make more concessions on automobiles and auto parts, saying: "Although it is true there has been a lack of effort by U.S. automakers to export to Japan, there is, on the other hand, room for Japanese car dealer organizations to improve the closed nature of the market and understanding of the regulations involved." Among these critical Foreign Ministry bureaucrats, are some who feel no real progress in the framework trade talks can be made before the Japan-U.S. summit meeting. As a result they suggest that Prime Minister Hosokawa should take the opportunity to formally reexamine the improper attitude Japan has taken in the bilateral trade talks. Among the unfair claims Japan has made in the past are: "Japanese snow is different (so foreign-made skis cannot be imported)"; "there are no differences in prices between Japan and abroad"; "U.S.-made metal baseball bats are dangerous (so they cannot be imported)"; and "foreign drugs are too strong for the Japanese (so they cannot be imported)." The critics say Prime Minister Hosokawa should frankly admit that such a narrow-minded, erroneous approach has been taken solely by bureaucrats themselves. They also say that in certain circumstances, Hosokawa should even express an "apology," stressing the difference between "administration" and "bureaucracy" by clarifying that he does not intend to support such bureaucrats or their ideas. The critics feel that if Hosokawa can appear to have such a bold understanding and positive attitude toward market opening, the atmosphere in the United States would considerably improve even if concrete results are not achieved in the framework trade talks. They feel this would act as a "stop-gap measure" for several months and help put off the crisis.
