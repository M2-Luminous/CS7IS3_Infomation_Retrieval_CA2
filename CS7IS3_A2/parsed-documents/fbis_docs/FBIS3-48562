The panel, comprising 10 legislators each from the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors, held its first meeting after the lower house decided to set up the committee at a plenary session earlier in the day. The last-ditch attempt to work out a compromise came after the upper chamber voted down the Hosokawa administration's reform package last Friday. A total of 20 Social Democratic Party dissidents helped the opposition reject the package. The meeting ended after only 10 minutes, having elected Takushi Hirai, chief of Liberal Democratic Party upper house member, as chairman of the panel. It agreed to meet again Thursday afternoon. If two-thirds of the 20-member joint panel agree on a compromise plan, the amended version would then be sent to plenary sessions of both houses of the Diet for a vote. The bills would become law if passed by a majority vote of both houses. Meanwhile, the ruling coalition agreed to propose a compromise plan which increases the number of seats allocated for single-seat constituencies to 280 from the government-proposed 274 seats, reducing the number of seats for proportional representation from 226 to 220, coalition sources said. The compromise plan would also allow legislators of prefectural and town assemblies to accept corporate donations. The government package prohibits individual politicians from receiving political donations from corporations, allowing only political parties to receive such donations. Earlier in the day, the coalition worked out a different compromise version by which 300 single-seat districts would be created, while the remaining 200 proportional representation seats would be appropriated, they said. That version, compiled at a meeting of the leaders of seven coalition partners, also called for allowing business firms to donate to individual Diet members. However, the SDP, the biggest party in the coalition, rejected the plan, expressing disaffection over the dropping of a blanket ban on individual acceptance of corporate donations from the compromise version, they said. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa told reporters he will make his own decision on whether to resign or not if the pacakge is scrapped. Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said earlier in the day he can neither confirm nor deny whether the prime minister will resign if he fails to secure Diet approval for political reform. Asked about an adviser's comment on the possible resignation of the cabinet depending on the result of Diet debate on reform, the top government spokesman said, "I neither confirm nor deny that." Shusei Tanaka, a special adviser to Hosokawa, said Tuesday the premier may disband the cabinet and step down if he fails to get the measures put into law. Hosokawa has pledged to take political responsibility if he fails to achieve political reform during the current Diet session, which ends Saturday. The package cleared the lower house last November. Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata said Hosokawa should dissolve the lower house for a snap general election, rather than stepping down, if the political reform program fails to win parliamentary approval by Saturday. "I don't think a mass resignation of the cabinet is possible with such a high level of public support," he said. Hata also ruled out the possibility of carrying the government reform proposals over to the next regular session of the Diet, which begins next Monday. With Saturday's closure of the current Diet session approaching, the prospects of reaching a compromise over the package at the Diet panel are poor because of major differences between the coalition and the LDP. The legislation could also become law if passed a second time by the lower chamber by a majority of two-thirds or more of the members present. However, the coalition will need about 70 LDP rebels to secure a majority of two-thirds in the lower house and political analysts predict such a case unlikely although the LDP is divided over the package. Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan Federation of Employers Associations (Nikkeiren), a top business leader, called for early compromise on the political reform package so that the government can get down to the task of rebuilding Japan's economy.
