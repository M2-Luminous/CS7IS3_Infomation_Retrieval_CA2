FR940104-1-00038 FR940104-1-00009 Rear-wheel-only ABSs directly control only the rear wheels of the vehicle, using the select low method of control. A vehicle equipped with a rear-wheel-only ABS may still experience front wheel lockup during braking, since the front wheels are not controlled by the ABS. Rear-wheel-only systems have relatively less accident reduction potential than all-wheel systems, because front wheel lockup could result in a vehicle losing steering control. In a crash-threatening situation, maintaining steering control can be a critical factor in accident avoidance. D. Current Size of ABS Market ABSs are currently available on over 130 models of passenger cars and other light vehicles (light trucks and vans (LTVs), and sport utility vehicles). ABSs are offered as standard equipment on almost all top-of-the line models and as standard equipment or an option on an increasing number of mid-priced and low-priced models. For instance, the Chevrolet Cavalier with a manufacturer's suggested retail price of under $10,000 offers an ABS as standard equipment. Manufacturers of ABSs currently available on vehicles sold in the United States include Bendix, Bosch, Dewandre-WABCO, GM-Delco, Honda, Kelsey-Hayes, Nippondenso, Sumitomo, and Teves. In 1992, 2,682,218 of the passenger cars sold in the United States were equipped with an ABS. This represented approximately 32 percent of all passenger cars sold in this country during that year. Passenger cars that are equipped with an ABS typically have an all-wheel ABS that permits steering control since the system modulates the brake force at each wheel. That same year, approximately 3,600,000 of the other light vehicles sold in the United States were equipped with an ABS, and approximately 3,100,000 of those vehicles were equipped with a rear-wheel-only ABS. While rear-wheel-only systems provide benefits (e.g., improved stability during braking) for light trucks that frequently experience a wide range of loading levels, a rear-wheel-only ABS provides no ABS control to the front wheels. These nearly 6,300,000 ABS-equipped passenger cars and light trucks represented 49 percent of the 12.8 million light vehicles sold in the United States in 1992. Based on reports from industry, NHTSA estimates that over 75 percent of all new passenger cars and other light vehicles will be equipped with an ABS by 1996. II. NHTSA Activities Related to Braking Performance Over the years, NHTSA has studied the effectiveness of ABSs in avoiding crashes and reducing their severity. The agency conducted the Tri-Level Study of the Causes of Traffic Accidents, (DOT HS 801&hyph;631, Final Report, June 1975) to determine the effectiveness of ABSs. While this is not a recent study, its conclusions might still be relevant. Among these conclusions are that (1) rear-wheel-only ABSs had an accident reduction potential of one to four percent, (2) four wheel ABSs provide the greatest safety benefits and could reduce accidents by eight to 15 percent, (3) an ABS's ability to maintain control was found to be a more important safety attribute than its ability to improve stopping distance performance. NHTSA has also conducted test track evaluations of ABS equipped light vehicles. (Hiltner, Arehart, and Radlinski, ``Light Vehicle ABS Performance Evaluation,'' DOT HS 807 813, December 1991; and ``Light Vehicle ABS Performance Evaluation_Phase II,'' DOT HS 807 924, May 1992.) The December 1991 report describes tests conducted on ten light vehicles to evaluate the improvement in braking performance and vehicle stability and control resulting from each vehicle's ABS. The test program's purpose was to show the degree to which an ABS improves a given vehicle's brake performance, not to compare vehicles or similar ABSs to one another. Therefore, each vehicle was tested with the ABS ``on'' and with the ABS ``off'' or disabled. Eight of the ten vehicles were equipped with an all-wheel ABS. Each vehicle was run through a set of eighteen separate test conditions, using both panic stops and driver-best-effort stops in both the empty and loaded condition at speeds of 35 mph and 60 mph. Braking maneuvers consisted of straight line stops on a uniform surface, straight line stops on a split mu surface, stops in a 500 foot curve, and stops involving lane changes. The tests were conducted at 35, 45, 50, and 60 mph, at both the empty and loaded weight conditions. The tests were conducted on a variety of surfaces, including wet Jennite, gravel, and dry concrete. Among the findings in the December 1991 report were that (1) each ABS, and especially the all-wheel systems, improved the vehicle's lateral stability during panic braking; (2) the all-wheel systems shortened stopping distances on most hard paved surfaces, with improvements of up to 25 percent on wet concrete and up to 50 percent on wet Jennite; (3) each ABS lengthened the vehicle's stopping distances in panic stops on gravel, with increases exceeding 25 percent in some cases; and (4) the rear-wheel system enhanced the vehicle's lateral stability but did not reduce stopping distances in most panic brake applications.
