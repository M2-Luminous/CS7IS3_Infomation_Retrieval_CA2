He returned from a week-long visit overseas. Kukan noted that in the past Slovakia had been omitted when the applicants for European integration were mentioned. "I was repeatedly convinced that this would not happen as Slovakia was considered an equal member of the international community, while no difference is made between Slovakia and Poland, Hungary and other European states," he added. Kukan confirmed he was interested in establishing the Canadian Embassy in Slovakia. He assured the journalists that the non-existence of the embassy was not linked to the Quebec issue, but it was a question of money. The Canadian Government will either accredit its Viennese ambassador to Bratislava, or transfer the consular part of its Prague embassy to Vienna, Kukan reported. "We have scored lots of points," Kukan commented on the Slovak offer to train the Pakistani troops of the UN peace-keeping forces for Bosnia. He called naive the idea that the Slav states should present their own initiative to resolve the Bosnian conflict. "Let us be realistic, we have no means of forcing the Serbs to return to the negotiating table," he stated.
