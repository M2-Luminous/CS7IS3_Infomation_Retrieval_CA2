He said he deduced this from a talk with former Chief-of-Staff of the Czechoslovak Army Karel Pezl, during which negotiations on division of the state were underway. He stated that he and Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus managed to resolve the situation politically. "During a session of the federal army General Staff I asked Pezl whether he could give me a pledge that the staff officers were not preparing a military attack plan against Slovakia. He sweated something terrible and said he could not," Meciar reported. "There are other indications as well that this had been contemplated," Meciar stated, adding that it does Klaus honor that they were able to resolve the problem within 24 hours.
