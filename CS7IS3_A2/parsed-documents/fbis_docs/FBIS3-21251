The white paper focuses on the use of plutonium in nuclear power plants, an issue that has gained international attention, and gives a detailed account of the safety measures set forth by the Nuclear Safety Commission (Yasuyoshi Togo, chairman) for light water reactors (LWRs), advanced thermal converter reactors (ATRs), and fast breeder reactors (FBRs). The paper notes that plutonium use in power plants already has a good safety record and cites the fact that plutonium, converted from uranium, has been burned inside nuclear power plants and accounts for 30% of Japan's atomic energy. (Summary on p 7) The Nuclear Energy Safety White Paper consists of three parts. The first part describes the Nuclear Safety Commission's activities over the past year and its safety policies. The second part is a special edition about ensuring the safety of nuclear reactors that use plutonium for fuel. The third part contains data. In addition to presenting the Nuclear Safety Commission's policies, the first part of the paper also brings up the problems with Russia: nuclear energy safety measures there, its dumping of radioactive wastes into the ocean, the explosion at the Tomusk-7 military recycling plant, and so forth. This is the second time that the Nuclear Energy Safety White Paper features a special edition on the plutonium issue; last year, the paper discussed the nuclear fuel cycle. The Nuclear Energy White Paper also aims to reinforce, from the aspect of safety, understanding about the government's policies on plutonium use, which has caused apprehension in other countries. [p 7] [Text] ``Ensuring Safety in the Use of Plutonium in Nuclear Power Plant Facilities'' is the special edition in the 1993 Nuclear Energy Safety White Paper. While last year's paper took up the issue of plutonium production in the nuclear fuel cycle, this year's paper discusses the safety of plutonium use in the LWRs, ATRs, and FBRs of nuclear power plants. There are three basic policies on ensuring safety: to reduce the amounts of radioactive substances, to provide multiple forms of protection, and to isolate facilities that use plutonium from the public. The paper also introduces the characteristics of plutonium and explains that, although plutonium emits alpha rays and weak gamma rays, the alpha rays only escape about four centimeters into the air; the gamma rays are weak, too, so there is not much of a safety problem if simple shielding is provided. Regarding the effects when plutonium is taken into the human body, examples from past accidents have indicated the danger of cancer occurring due to the long-term effects of radiation in the body when plutonium is drawn into the lungs and then accumulates mainly in the lungs, liver, and bones. For that reason Japan is aiming for safety with the establishment of standard radiation dose values for bones (2.4 sieverts), lungs (3.0 sieverts), and the liver (5 sieverts), in addition to the conventional levels of radiation exposure. The paper also emphasizes that there are already results from the use of plutonium in nuclear power plants: because plutonium is produced inside reactors when uranium absorbs neutrons, plutonium is burned within reactors now. Owing to that, about 30% of the energy generated by LWRs is produced by the plutonium that is modified within the reactors. In other words, there is essentially no difference with the nuclear reactors that use uranium-plutonium mixed oxide fuel (MOX). Therefore, by taking into account the amount of plutonium that will be handled, safety measures can be maintained adequately. Based on such results, the paper notes that safety can be maintained in FBRs, which use plutonium only, by adequately implementing inspections of those parts of the FBRs that differ with LWRs. The paper takes up technical topics such as sodium as the FBR's coolant material and operation under high temperatures, breedable reactor cores that use MOX fuel, and the cover gas that isolates the surface of the liquid sodium from the air, then points out that FBR inspections covering that which differs from LWRs are implemented. The measures taken in dealing with sodium coolant, for example, involve verification of the suitability of the structural design of the equipment used for the sodium, and incorporating into the design safety measures to prevent chemical activation of the sodium by means of an inert gas, leakage detection, and suppression and reduction of the thermal effects of combustion. In addition, in an assessment of the completed Monju FBR, the paper presents an analysis of a hypothetical accident in which large amounts of radioactive substances are released. According to that analysis, if a a big accident such as leakage of the primary coolant or a hypothetical accident were to occur, the public would be separated far enough from the exposure dose. The Fugen ATR, which has already been in operation for 15 years, has not produced a single failed fuel element. Measures have also been taken to improve its void coefficient--the reaction when the coolant boils and many steam bubbles are formed--which had been considered a problem. As a result, nuclear reactor control with enough margin is now possible. As for LWRs, the paper states that loading one-third of the reactor core with MOX fuel will not affect the characteristics of the core. The reasons are that, in comparison with uranium, there is little drop in reactivity when MOX fuel is used, and that the nature of the reactor is such that if the reactivity rises it will then drop on its own. On the other hand, there is also a problem in that the control rods tend to lose their effectiveness and the output can grow large locally. Although there are items that need to be addressed in the design, the safety of [plutonium use in] LWRs was confirmed in demonstration tests using the No. 1 reactor of Kansai Electric Power Company's Mihama power plant. The paper also uses a question-and-answer format to explain in simple terms about social problems, e.g., Russia's dumping of low-level radioactive waste into the ocean, nuclear reactors and earthquakes, and the issue of acknowledgement of power plant workers' accidents involving leukemia.
