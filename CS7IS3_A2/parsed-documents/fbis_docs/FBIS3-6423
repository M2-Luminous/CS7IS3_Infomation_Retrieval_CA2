Although our side presented a revised draft agreement, no progress was made in discussions, as the North side again raised the issue of announcing a joint communique. Both sides agreed to meet again on 19 March. Because the two sides failed to settle the matter concerning procedures for the envoy exchange in today's contact, it has become impossible for an envoy exchange to be realized prior to 21 March. Accordingly, the United States is likely to officially notify North Korea of a delay in the third round of U.S.-North Korean talks. In today's contact, North Korea delayed discussions of practical problems, insisting that the South side should accept, without exception, its demand for the announcement of a joint communique on the agreement by the South and North to an envoy exchange, since the North side took the epochal measure of withdrawing its four demands in the last contact. The North side repeatedly stressed its unchanged stance, showing a strong position of not allowing the slightest concession [hanchiui yangbodo hoyong haji ankettanun kanghan ipchangul poimyo] on items regarding missions of special envoys, procedures, and schedule of their visits. In the last contact, they also failed to narrow their differences in opinion on these items and urged our side to accept its entire proposal.
