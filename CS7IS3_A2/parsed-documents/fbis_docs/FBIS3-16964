Mezhak, chairman of the Popular Party of the Crimea, by V. Danilov; place and date not given: "`Rossiya' Block Is True to Its Goals"] [Text] [Danilov] Many readers of our newspaper wonder if the "Rossiya" [Russia] bloc remains true to its basic principles proclaimed during the presidential campaign of Yuriy Meshkov? Did this program undergo any changes? [Mezhak] Let me put it straight, we are not going to back out of a single provision of our program that was adopted at a meeting of the bloc's Coordinating Council on 25 February. Our prime goals include the emergence and development of the Crimean Republic as an independent and law-abiding democratic state, overcoming the economic crisis, and creating conditions for a worthy life for Crimean residents, whose interests and rights we are going to uphold consistently. The "Rossiya" bloc still considers calling a referendum on the Republic's status a precondition for establishing the Crimean statehood. Its favorable outcome would lay firm the political and legal foundation for our state independence, which will enable us to conclude political and economic agreements with CIS states. The bloc's ultimate goal is to reestablish unity with Russia and other CIS countries and, at the initial stage, form an economic, political, and military union, with its consequent transformation into a confederation or federal state. [Danilov] According to a decision recently adopted by the Ukrainian Supreme Council, the Crimean Republic has no right to its own citizenship, its financial and monetary systems, and other trappings of statehood. Where would you see a way out of the legal "maze" of Ukrainian-Crimean relations? [Mezhak] First, the above decision by the Ukrainian Supreme Council is obviously overdue, since the Crimea already has its own banking and systems. It also established its own Crimean bank, and it was a result of the official negotiations with Kiev on power sharing. The Crimean citizenship issue has as strong a legal base. So, the Ukrainian Supreme Council's other statement about unconformity of the Crimean legislation with the Ukrainian one is largely a propagandist move. Second, it is no secret today that policy based on administrative restrictions and forcible measures is doomed to failure. Processes similar to the Crimean are under way in other Ukrainian regions. People striving for integration and unity cannot be repressed by directives from above. In his recent television appearance in the peninsula, Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov stressed that the following passage of the question that will be put to a referendum should bear the main emphasis: "...in a union with other CIS states." Ukraine is certainly among those states, so it would not be serious to call us separatists. [Danilov] What kind of Crimean statehood, which we are just beginning to build, do you envision? [Mezhak] One should provide all necessary conditions for the smooth operation of a multiparty system in the Crimea. The "Rossiya" bloc stands for the representative democracy allowing all social forces to actually participate in managing the state. We want to see the Crimean president as head of the state, and the executive branch head elected by and accountable to the Crimean Supreme Soviet. However, the best solution at this stage of the Crimean independence would be to have the president serve as head of state, which would guarantee observance of the Crimean Constitution, and at the same time be the head of the executive branch. One should ensure representative power for local governments, too. Finally, the "Rossiya" bloc considers Sevastopol an inalienable part of the Crimea and will seek to establish government bodies in the city based on the Crimean legislation. [Danilov] At present, all political parties and figures speak a lot about human rights. But talking, as everyone knows, does not necessarily mean doing. What steps does the "Rossiya" bloc plan to undertake in this sphere? [Mezhak] Our priority is to provide legislative support for the right of Crimean residents to dual citizenship; first citizenship would be Crimean, and the second depending on their choice. Another issue playing an important role in our program is the judicial reform providing for electiveness and independence of judges from the power elite, the jury, expansion of legal powers, the right of local courts to revoke decisions of local executive institutions. It is obvious that there can be no talk about human rights until we smash crime that has spread on an unheard-of scale. For this purpose, one should improve the material conditions of the public order forces. [Danilov] What are the main provisions of the bloc's economic program? [Mezhak] Recognition of the open-type economy matched with certain protectionist policies of the state with regard to Crimean manufacturers. Privatization of production means, transfer of property to private manufacturers with the preservation of a substantial part of the state sector. At the same time, the state would dominate industries of nationwide importance or enterprises losing money in the market conditions. One needs to conduct agricultural reform, demonopolize production, and pass a law on competition. Encouraging production should serve as the basic principle of the taxation system. A special place in our economic program was given to the economic sovereignty of the Crimea, which means its thorough financial independence (drafting the budget, setting taxes, managing credits and payments, etc.), independent economic policies giving the peninsula a free hand in establishing priorities in foreign economic links. A system of investment privileges needs to be guaranteed by the state to attract foreign capital to the Crimea. According to our concept, a broad social base for privatization should be ensured by personal accounts [imennoy shchet] or securities, including those on land, considering the interests of working teams. [Danilov] Can we say that the implementation of your bloc's economic program began after Yuriy Meshkov was elected president? [Mezhak] Nomination of the prominent Russian economist, Yevgeniy Saburov, testifies to the fact that the Crimean president and the "Rossiya" bloc keep the word they gave to Crimean residents during the presidential campaign. However, our government must find a firm foundation in the peninsula's legislative power so it can work undeterred. This is why the "Rossiya" bloc attaches such great importance to the upcoming elections to the Crimean legislature. [Danilov] What would you name as the core of your program's social policies? [Mezhak] The main principle of our social policy is supporting a specific individual instead of whole groups. The state is supposed to help those who are not in a position to make a living through their own work, and to create necessary conditions for those who can achieve good results in working for the public good. The state must guarantee its citizens free health care to the previous extent, and finance science and education. According to our program, Crimeans will get the chance to receive an education at Russian higher education institutions as a result of relevant agreements with the Russian Federation. In the sphere of ethnic relations, we will seek to strengthen a multinational state on the Crimean peninsula, whose citizens will enjoy equal rights and opportunities regardless of their nationality and creed.
