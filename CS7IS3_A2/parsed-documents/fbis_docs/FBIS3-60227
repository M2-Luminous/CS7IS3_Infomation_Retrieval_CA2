The situation has occurred because of relaxed enforcement of State laws and regulations on environmental protection. The findings are from a recent national inspection on environmental law enforcement by the State Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA). The investigation determined that many local policy makers sacrifice their environment for the sake of economic profit. Local governments must further tighten supervision over implementation of environmental laws and regulations and crack down on illegal conduct that endangers the environment, according to SEPA official Hu Baolin. Hu said his bureau will continue its publicity campaigns to raise environmental awareness across the nation, especially that of leaders at various levels. The agency will map out some new regulations and revise old ones in accord with changed economic and social situations. It hopes the central and local governments will increase their budgets for environmental work. SEPA, jointly with the environmental protection committees under the State Council and the National People's Congress (NPC), just concluded a four-month environmental inspection in seven provinces and regions. They include Heilongjiang, Shandong, Yunnan, Guangdong, Anhui and Jiangsu provinces and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. It is the first phase of a nation-wide environmental law enforcement inspection. The whole programme will take two years. This year's inspection focused on the enforcement of State laws on environmental protection and wild life preservation. The inspection discovered that a contract responsibility system has been introduced in many provinces to protect the environment. And environmental protection work has been included in provincial social and economic development programmes. The seven regions have altogether promulgated some 50 local regulations on environmental issues. Yet, some local leaders have neglected environmental problems while pursuing profits. Lunan County in Yunnan Province, for example, constructed a cement plant in the State "Stone Forest" scenic area. And a vice-governor of Dali Prefecture decided, without authorization, to stop collecting pollution charges from local industrial enterprises for three years. Jixi Iron and Steel Company in Heilongjiang Province, which is the biggest pollutant in the city, did not complete its pollution treatment projects on time and refused to hand over a fine of 10,000 yuan (about $1,724). In Hangzhou, capital city of Zhejiang Province, about 80 percent of the 56 enterprises inspected discharge untreated pollutants into the environment. Meanwhile, some harmful wastes have been imported into the country. Some small township enterprises, closed in the past by the State for contaminating the environment, have reemerged in some places.
