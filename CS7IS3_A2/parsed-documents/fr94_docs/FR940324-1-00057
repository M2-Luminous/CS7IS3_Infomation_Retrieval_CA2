(a) The coordinated Federal Lands Highways Program (FLHP) consists of the Forest Highways, Public Lands Highways, Park Roads, Parkways and Indian Reservation Roads as defined in 23 U.S.C. 101. The purpose is to treat all Federal Roads which are public roads under the same uniform policies as roads on the Federal-Aid Systems. (23 U.S.C. 204). (b) BIA shall coordinate management of IRR construction with the programs of the National Park Service, U.S. Forest Service, and the Public Lands Highways program of the FHWA. BIA management policies shall conform to policies for roads which are on the Federal-aid highways, including application of the FAR and Government Accounting Standards. (c) In planning and constructing IRR the BIA may enter into contracts with other Federal agencies, States, counties, cities, or tribal governments. In these contracts, the BIA or one of the other governmental agencies may be the lead agency, accepting contributions from the other agencies involved. When the BIA is the lead agency in a cooperative project with a State, county, local subdivision, or tribal government, reimbursement authority shall be issued to the BIA for crediting the funds received to the appropriation available for IRR construction projects. All projects shall be developed in accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act, the National Historic Preservation Act, and other Federal requirements. These projects are included as part of the continuing cooperative and comprehensive planning process used to develop Statewide transportation improvement programs by States. The projects will also be part of approved long-range and short-range plans in accordance with 23 U.S.C. 134, 135(e)(f) and 204(a). (d) Indian labor shall be used at the maximum practical level on projects using IRR construction funds or road maintenance funds. Since ceilings on Federal employment do not apply to construction and improvement of Indian reservation roads, staffing and overtime decisions shall be based upon project requirements, efficiency, the availability of Indian labor, and other governmental costs including unemployment compensation and welfare. The BIA shall assist the FHWA and the States to apply Indian preference to Federal-aid highway projects on or near Indian reservations. (e) The BIA shall cooperate with the FHWA in developing procedures to provide the information needed by the Secretary of Transportation in making the determination that a proposed obligation of IRR funds on a Federal-aid project is supplemental to, and not in lieu of, the obligation of a fair and equitable share of funds apportioned to the State pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 104. The Secretary may enter into an agreement with a State or subdivision of a State for supplementary funding in the construction and maintenance of IRR. At locations where road projects serve non-Indian land as well as Indian land, State participation shall be requested. Funds for IRR may be used in conjunction with Federal-aid funds on State Federal-aid highway projects, including projects in the Highway Bridge Replacement and Rehabilitation Program (HBRRP). Pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 144(g)(4), not less than one percent of the apportioned HBRRP funds is set aside in each State that has an Indian Reservation, as defined in 25 CFR 170.2, within its boundaries for projects to replace, rehabilitate, paint, or apply magnesium acetate to IRR bridges. The IRR funds can also be used for the required 20 percent State match requirements. (23 U.S.C. 144).
