He won 274 votes in the 511-seat lower house, and 127 in the 252-member upper chamber. Hata, head of the second-largest party within Japan's ruling seven-party coalition, was thus chosen to succeed Morihiro Hosokawa, who stepped down because of a financial scandal on April 8. Hata, 58 and foreign minister in Hosokawa's cabinet, is expected to form a new cabinet tonight, the second coalition government since last August.
