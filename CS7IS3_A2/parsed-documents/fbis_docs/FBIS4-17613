The meeting between Russia's Foreign Minister, Andrey Kozyrev, and the WEU Secretary General, Willem van Ekkelen, planned for Monday should be viewed in precisely this context, the director of the Russian Foreign Ministry's Department for European Cooperation, Yuriy Ushakov, told Interfax. According to him, the WEU is beginning to play a more active role in European affairs. "We would like to synchronize the pace of our cooperation with the WEU with the development of our interaction with the European Union in the economic and political areas," the diplomat said. Until recently the WEU did not play a noticeable role in European affairs, "because it was on the brink of death", he said. "The European Union reanimated that organization, when it took its decision on greater interaction with the WEU in Maastricht. So life itself has forced us to raise the level of relations with the WEU and develop them more extensively," Ushakov concluded.
