This meeting is convened at a crucial time in China's reform, opening up, and socialist modernization drive. Since the First Plenary Session of the Eighth National People's Congress, people of all nationalities across the country, under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the nucleus, and persistently taking as their guidance Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics as well as the basic line of the party, have implemented the guidelines of 14th CPC National Congress in a comprehensive manner; they have seized the opportunity to intensify reform and speed up development. The CPC Central Committee and State Council took the major step of macroeconomic regulation and control to solve the contradictions and problems in the march forward with noticeable success. The national economy has seen sustained, rapid, and healthy growth [chi xu kuai su jian kang fa zhan 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660 4099 1455]; heartening progress has been made in all undertakings of socialist construction with Chinese characteristics. With the adoption at the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee of "The Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Some Issues Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic Structure" as the hallmark, the reform of China's economic structure has entered a crucial phase of combining package reform with breakthroughs in key areas. Several major reform measures were simultaneously announced earlier this year, and efforts have been increased over the past two months or so to implement these reform plans. Ensuring the faithful implementation of these reform plans with all manner of support represents a gigantic and formidable task. The government work report, as well as other reports to be examined at the current session, will contain specific plans for attaining this year's tasks. Therefore, the success of this session is of great significance for reform and development in 1994 and thereafter. Over the past year, China has made remarkable progress in promoting socialist democracy and legality. New progress has been made in the work of the NPC and local people's congresses at all levels. Taking the theory of socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line as its guidance, and the reinforcement of socialist democracy and the socialist legal system as its fundamental tasks, the NPC Standing Committee has focused on the central task of economic development and has conscientiously performed the functions vested in it by the Constitution. It has done a great deal of fruitful work in strengthening legislative work, in improving the supervisory mechanism, in promoting reform and development, in safeguarding social stability, and so forth. It was a year in which more laws were adopted by the NPC Standing Committee than any other year. Especially noteworthy is the fact that economic legislation has been given top priority in the legislative agenda. A slew of major laws designed to standardize market practices, safeguard order in the marketplace, and increase macroeconomic regulation and control have been promulgated in good time; these laws include the Company Law, the Law Against Unethical Competition, and the Law on Protecting the Rights and Interests of Consumers. These laws have played, and will continue to play, an important function in pushing forward and safeguarding the healthy development of a socialist market economy. A market economy cries for development of the legal system; the legal system safeguards the market economy. As the reform of China's economic structure enters a new stage, development of a socialist democracy and the socialist legal system will also usher in a new phase. The people's congress system is China's fundamental political system. From the first session of the first NPC in 1954 up until now, China has practiced this system for exactly 40 years. During those 40 years, the NPC has undertaken an unforgettable journey. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, the NPC--the supreme organ of state power--has been playing an increasingly important role on the political scene of the state. Practice has shown that the people's congress system was established in line with China's reality; it is a system rooted deeply in China's reality with a long life-force and is a vital component of the socialist political system with Chinese characteristics. In the transition from a planned economy to a socialist market economic structure, the people's congress will play a still greater role as the organ for people to exercise the power of state. Seizing opportunities, deepening reform, opening up wider to the outside world, expediting development, and ensuring stability are requirements of overall importance for 1994 set by the entire party and the entire country by the CPC Central Committee. We are faced with formidable tasks of reform and development this year; meanwhile, preserving social and political stability requires us to bring into fuller play under the CPC leadership the role of people's congresses, government, and CPPCC committees at all levels, and to mobilize, unite, and coordinate the efforts of hundreds upon millions of people to ensure the smooth accomplishment of the various tasks. The NPC and people's congresses at all levels will certainly play an important role in properly handling the relationship between reform, development, and stability. Our forefathers said: "A right moment is hard to come by but easy to let slip. A right moment quickly seized is an opportunity. For this reason, the sage moves at the right moment, and the wise man springs into action at the opportune time." Today, China's socialist modernization drive is faced by a rare, excellent opportunity. Seizing the opportunity, "moving at the right moment," and "springing into action at the opportune time" are crucial to the accomplishment of our goals of struggle. By conscientiously exercising the power entrusted them by the people during the current session, and by speaking their minds freely in discussing matters of vital importance at the current session, the deputies will certainly make important contributions to the accomplishment of the session's agenda. We wish the NPC session complete success.
