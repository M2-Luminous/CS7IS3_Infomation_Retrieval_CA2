Introduction What is meant by Voluntary Export Restraints (VER) is that exporting nations or regions, under demands or pressures from an importing nation, will "voluntarily" impose restraints on exports to a particular country for certain goods for a given period of time. VER is a neo-protectionist measure in nature, with the following special features: 1. Nontransparency. VER are arranged privately between governments after bilateral consultations. Calling it "voluntary" is an excuse to bypass the principles of GATT, and conduct "grey area" measures. 2. Discrimination. VER is not restricted by GATT's "nondiscrimination principle." It usually has an anticipated purpose and is highly selective, directed at individual countries and individual producers. 3. Flexibility. VER is usually a short term measure, with a term of from three to five years. VER can be renewed, extended, or expanded. It is much more flexible than long term, fixed tariff measures, making it more direct and efficient for handling temporary trade disputes. Although under certain conditions these characteristics can make VER simpler, more direct, faster and more efficient than other trade protection measures such as tariffs, VER can have serious limitations. Trade experts consider VER to be one type of "imperfect protectionism." Trade protectionism itself will twist the disposition of resources, plus it is "imperfect," causing profit losses in importing countries which implement VER. This is because under VER, "scarcity of profit" caused by trade restraints will be gained by exporting countries. When tariffs are used, this part of the interest is obtained by the importing countries' governments by means of tariff income; under a quota system, most of them will be gained by importers with quotas by means of "quota rent." Obviously, a nation adopting VER is actually sacrificing the profits of its own domestic consumers, to increase the interests of its exporters or the exporting nation's government. Moreover, it is equivalent to pushing, even compelling, other nations to create export cartels to deal with its citizens. This is where VER is "imperfect." So, just from the standpoint of economic efficiency, based on the above analysis, VER is not at all more reasonable or efficient than other trade protection policies such as tariffs; on the contrary, to a certain degree, it turns out to be even worse. However, the statistical reality shows that in current international trade, VER is being used more frequently, affecting a growing number of nations, regions, and industrial areas. From 1981 to 1988, among all the nontariff policies adopted by the EC for imported industrial products, the VER proportion increased from 24.6 percent to 38.1 percent, while in the same period, the U.S. proportion grew from 59.3 percent to 66.5 percent, close to two-thirds. At the outset of the nineties, 15 percent of the world's trade had been arranged by VER. Why has VER, a kind of "imperfect protectionism," become such a popular instrument of trade policy? This article will try to find answers to this question from the standpoint of marketing strategy. II. VER's operating system and the combination of operations and marketing 1. The involvement of large enterprises. Before discussing VER's operating system, we must first pay attention to an important fact: VER is not just an activity or arrangement between governments. First, surveys show that 80 percent of VER are formal agreements between governments, while the remaining 20 percent are "informal" (that is, agreements between governments and industries) or "nongovernmental measures" (that is, agreements between industries or enterprises). Because the latter two forms of VER are usually entered into secretly, and therefore difficult to document, the above results may not be representative. But regardless of whether they are "informal" or "nongovernmental measures," they differ from common export cartels in that they usually have the approval or tacit consent of the importing nation's government. In 1971, the Japanese Steel Association announced it was implementing VER on its steel exports to the EC. This was the result of secret negotiations between the major steel corporations of Japan and Europe. Second, VER agreements between governments usually also have the enthusiastic participation of large enterprises. These enterprises are usually of large scale, and solid strength, so it is not difficult to forecast that in most VER arrangements, the interests of trade groups or large enterprises usually receive priority consideration. In return, these trade groups or large enterprises will be more obedient to their governments' control. For example, in the U.S.-Japan VER agreement on semiconductors, such major U.S. enterprises as Motorola, Intel, and Texas Instruments, and major Japanese enterprises like Toshiba, Hitachi, JVC, and Panasonic all participated in the initiation and negotiation of the agreement, and were decisive in its formulation and conclusion. It is just because the establishment of VER are so influenced by individual trade or enterprises, that this kind of measure tends to have administrative decisions concerning export quotas which are based on how specific enterprises compare with tariffs, quotas, etc., so it is easier to use to lay out a specific operating and marketing strategy based on a competitor's position, attraction of the target market, and product cycle. 2. VER's operating system and the combination of operations and marketing. Combining operations and marketing is one aspect of an enterprises's operating and marketing strategy; at the same time it is also a combination of the controllable variables of operation and marketing for enterprises to use in implementing operating and marketing strategies. Since the restraining policies of VER are usually manifested in restrictions on such variables of operating and marketing as prices, market size, etc., of exported products, therefore VER's own mechanisms can work directly or indirectly to combine operations and marketing, and become an efficient and precise measure for reflecting and conducting enterprises' operating and marketing strategies. This cannot be defeated by such trade protective measures as tariffs. The figures listed below are based on survey statistics from 289 VER agreements. In these VER arrangements, the individual variables restricted in operating and marketing combinations were distributed as follows: export amount in established markets (rate) 53% market share in established markets 25% increased export supply 10% the lowest export price in established markets 20% conditions and opportunities of distribution 30% assigned conditions [tiaojian] and opportunities [shiji] 1) VER's effect on pricing policies. As listed above, 20 percent of the sample VER agreements included provisions for the lowest export limited price. For example, in 1990, in the EC-Japan VER agreement on semiconductors, it stipulated that Japanese semiconductor manufacturers would set the lowest price at 9.5 percent higher than production cost for their "dynamic random chip." In addition to its direct influence on overseas manufacturers setting their export price to the importing nation, this kind of policy sometimes also limits their export price to third nations. For example, in 1986, a VER agreement on semiconductors between the United States and Japan implemented market price oversight on certain products in third countries. Since VER increasingly has been used as a way of avoiding anti-dumping and anti-subsidy punitive measures, this kind of lowest price policy becomes increasingly important in VER agreements. Its direct result is to cause the price of the exported product to rise in the importing nation's market. For example, the 1981 VER agreement on automobiles between the United States and Japan caused the total U.S. import price index to drop 5 percent during the period 1982 to 1985, while the automobile price index rose 7 percent. (2) VER's effect on product strategy. With the restriction of VER, exporters have to give up some of their price advantage, and in order to maintain their competitive position, they must turn to improving their products' nature, improving quality. This will push enterprises to continue expanding their product mix when determining their product strategy, developing new products (including new models, new designs, etc.), developing toward areas which have not been restricted by VER; constantly improving the level of their products, and strengthening their competitiveness. One interesting example is the automobile VER between the United States and Japan (1981-1985): although the number of automobiles exported to the United States from Japan decreased, Japanese enterprises were able to maintain their profit level in the automobile market by improving models and adding new models which were outside those restricted. (3) VER's effect on distribution strategy. VER's stipulations will often involve every aspect of distribution strategy in enterprises, for example, items concerning time of supply, "expected quantity" and "reserved quantity," mode of transport, port of entry, etc. They may even stipulate marketing channels in the importing nation. These detailed restrictive measures are very meaningful and important for importing nations to implement protections, and for exporters to strengthen monopolies. III. VER and competitive strategies. 1. Exporters' competitive strategies. As challengers to the overseas markets, exporters can implement a series of competitive strategies, including the following very typical ones: (1) Frontal attack strategy. Market challengers launch a direct attack on market leaders. This kind of direct confrontation will usually lead to a VER agreement. This was precisely the situation with U.S. semiconductors at the beginning of the eighties: the Toshiba Corporation of Japan--the second chip manufacturer in the world, launched an "attack" on the leading U.S. chip manufacturer, the Motorola Corporation, and their intense market battle led to a U.S.-Japan VER agreement in 1986. (2) Flank attack strategy. Exporting corporations try to avoid a frontal fight through bypassing the market leaders in exporting countries, and obtain a market share from the side. In the seventies and early eighties, while major U.S. automobile manufacturers were still devoted to making large-sized cars, Japanese corporations began concentrating on producing and exporting small-sized cars. (3) "Eating little fish" strategy. Market challengers turn to attacking and eliminating smaller competitors instead of fighting with the market leaders in importing countries. In the seventies and early eighties, European data control machine tool manufacturers adopted exactly this strategy to "attack" initially the same type of small enterprises in the U.S. market. Under VER arrangements, exporters usually must abandon the frontal attack strategy, and turn instead to the flank attack strategy or "eating little fish" strategy. At the same time, because VER leads to similar cartel activity by exporters, it gives them on the one hand the ability to share in monopoly profits, while on the other hand it makes them pay more attention to nonpricing competition under the stronger pressure of price competition. This makes for comprehensive improvement in their products' competitive ability. 2. Competitive advantage for manufacturers in importing countries. The competitive advantage for manufacturers in importing countries under VER acts chiefly as an advantage in protecting their market share and established profits, so actually it is a "protective advantage." This functions to: (1) Share markets with overseas manufacturers. With the stronger trend to internationalized production and sales and the increasing progress made in science, technology, and productive forces, more enterprises with strong technical and products advantages attempt to improve the level of their profits by means of expanding their quota in the international market. Therefore, manufacturers in importing countries are facing an increased risk of frontal attack from foreign market challengers. In this situation, importing countries try to reach agreement on sharing the market with the challengers, while the "imperfect" parts of VER mentioned above can be understood partly as designed to compensate or encourage the other side to accept this sort of agreement. For example, in mid- eighties, due to the implementation of VER, Japan increased the price of its video tapes exported to the EC market by 50 percent; steel prices in the EC market rose 14 to 16 percent. So, VER can make enterprises in importing countries negotiate with foreign challengers, attaining price and profit levels which would be impossible under other conditions. It is only in this way that VER receives the further protection and support of bilateral parties. For example, when Japanese automobile manufacturers went outside Congress to launch their opposition to replacing the U.S.-Japan VER agreement with quotas or a tariff on automobiles exported from Japan, they obtained support from the U.S. International Wholesalers Association and several major U.S. auto makers. (2) Restrain foreign manufacturers. Most VER agreements include a provision to restrict the market share of foreign manufacturers, with the purpose of limiting their market within a smaller scale. So, for the domestic industries that will implement protections, this kind of VER is more clear, reliable, and efficient, at least for the short term. In the seventies and eighties, France obligated Japan to voluntarily restrain the growth rate of its French market share to no more than 3 percent of its small car exports, which effectively limited Japanese imports, and protected domestic enterprises of the same type. IV. VER and market mix. Competitive strategy is closely related to market mix. It is not difficult to find that implementation of VER is concentrated in a small number of industries. These industries can generally be divided into two large categories: (1) industries in which the market mix is characteristically an oligarchical monopoly, such as steel, automobile, electrical products, etc.; (2) industries which have problems adjusting mix, and are in decline in the developed industrial countries, such as shoes, fabric products and clothing, etc. VER plays a different role in these two kinds of industries. 1. VER as a protective measure. VER chiefly is employed in the second type of industry as a kind of protective arrangement, and usually does not include the factor of importing countries and enterprises in exporting countries seeking a joint monopoly. However, due to the intrinsic "imperfection" of VER, this kind of protection functions very unsatisfactorily. As Jiadisi Pagewadi [6328 6611 2448 1584 2706 3907 5530] has noted, this sort of "imperfect protectionism" of VER on the one hand, goes along with the exporting countries, permitting them to continue exporting under import tariff conditions which are closer to free trade; on the other hand, it also goes along with the desire of policy makers in importing countries of wanting to conduct free trade while seeking to reduce the threat from imports. 2. VER promotes seeking joint monopolies. In the first kind of industry mentioned above, there commonly is an oligarchical monopoly market mix. When these industrial oligarchs expand into foreign markets, they meet intense competition. If they compete, both of them will be hurt; so they discuss sharing monopoly profits. Under VER agreements, importing countries threaten more severe trade restrictive measures; exporting governments also step up coercive measures, to eliminate apprehensions about violating anti-monopoly laws; in addition, VER itself establishes an operational system of regular inquiries, communication of information, and resolution of special problems, and all this has provided a strong impetus for importing countries and large enterprises and trade groups in exporting countries to seek joint monopolies. The result is a trend to further concentration in the steel, automobile, working machine tool and electric products industries. For example, in the electrical industry, the 25 largest corporations dominate 50 percent of the total output of electrical products, while the top 200 corporations dominate 80 percent of the world's gross output. So we can see from this, VER is an arrangement of monopoly agreements by large corporations or trade groups in the international market, and the government's involvement actually provides a "cover" for them from anti-monopoly laws' oversight restrictions, as well as help safeguard them from coercive measures taken against destructive and violating agreements. V. Conclusion VER is not only an "imperfect protectionism," but also a kind of forceful power. It can form precise and flexible operating strategies in global trade, which can be overcome by other measures such as tariffs, quotas, etc. To operate this weapon, besides governments, there are more individual large enterprises and trade groups taking advantage of VER, changing strong foreign competitors into collaborators, jointly sharing the market profits. At present, this kind of measure, which violates free competition global trade policy, is getting wild. As GATT expert Professor Jackson has observed: with trade policy becoming complicated and flexible, people will see more clearly that activities due to a lack of unified rules for international competition, especially activities among privately run enterprises, definitely will damage the objective of global free trade. Establishing unified rules and policy for international competition will very possibly become major topics in the next cycle of GATT negotiations. Major references: 1. Preusse, Heinz Gert.
