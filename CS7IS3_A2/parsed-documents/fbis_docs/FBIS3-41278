From now on, we must gear all our efforts toward prevention and education." This was how Raymond Kendall, the secretary general of Interpol, summed up the conclusions of the second pan-European conference on drug addiction, which brought together some 40 European health ministers at the Council of Europe. Prevention and education: Those were the main points of the conference, along with an underlying current of aid to the countries of eastern Europe, which are, for the moment, totally devoid of any legislation, institutions, or specialist personnel. Cooperation with the governments of the countries of eastern Europe, which are asking for a great deal of aid to combat drugs, "is slowly taking shape," explained Christopher Luckett, head of the drug division at the Pompidou group. "These countries have set up government committees on drug trafficking with which we are working," continued Luckett. Unlike our Western democracies, eastern Europe is not yet used to a high level of consumption of hard drugs. "In these countries, alcohol, solvents, and the abuse of medicines prevail," continued Luckett. The priority in the fight against drugs is therefore, as the Interpol head stressed, "to prevent the importation of a consumption market into eastern Europe. This is where prevention is essential," something which could be implemented through pan- European action. However, eastern Europe--a drug transit region via the historic Balkan route, which bypasses wars like the one in Yugoslavia, or which finds different ways--has primarily become a major production area. This is what really worries most of the participants at the Strasbourg conference. "Indeed, our biggest worry today, or at least the worry of the institutions which are fighting drug trafficking and production, is the implantation of tens of thousands of hectares with poppy and cannabis growing in the Asiatic republics of the former USSR: Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and Tajikistan have now become uncontrollable areas for us, where local and ethnic conflicts are mixed up with arms and drug trafficking, with the one financing the other." Luckett concludes that Europe has no weapons to fight this.
