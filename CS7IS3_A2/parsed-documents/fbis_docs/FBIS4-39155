Those Who Have Brought Meshkov to Power Are Not Content With His New Policy" -- "Postscript" by Aleksandr Anin] [Text] It was reported earlier that the Crimean parliament has rejected President Yuriy Meshkov's request to grant him additional powers. Following are some details of that session. At the very start of the resumed parliament session Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov moved to include in the agenda the question "On the Results of the 27 March 1994 Poll of Crimean Republic Citizens: On According Presidential Edicts the Power of Laws on Matters Which Temporarily Are Not Regulated by the Legislation of the Crimean Republic." Deputy Leonid Grach spoke up immediately: "This contradicts the constitution of Crimea on the inadmissibility of delegating powers from one branch of power to another." Deputy Boris Kizilov noted, "It is not clear yet who summed up the results of the poll and how," (the poll results were summed up by the president's team without the participation of the Crimean Central Election Commission -- NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA), "and therefore the poll results do not have legal force." Deputy Vasiliy Kiselev pointed out that many of Yuriy Meshkov's edicts have been issued in gross violation of the Crimean republic's constitution, continuing, "Any usurpation of power is illegal, the constitution says. Until we have changed this provision of the Constitution, we cannot grant the president such powers." Speaking one after another, deputies, with rare exception, maintained that they can tackle any questions and that there is no need to grant the president additional powers. Mikhail Kukushkin said, "All actions by the president are reminiscent of an election fever. He is trying to prod the deputies to climb on top an armored car again." In the end, the issue was taken off the agenda. Therefore, in spite of the fact that the majority of deputies were elected from the Rossiya bloc, which, incidentally, brought Yuriy Meshkov to power, there is no agreement between him and parliament. Observers believe that confrontation will only grow in the future. P.S. In supporting Yuriy Meshkov in presidential elections, the Rossiya bloc expected that its representatives would get key posts in the Cabinet of Ministers. Meshkov, however, invited Muscovite Yevgeniy Saburov to head the government, who in turn brought a Moscow team along to Simferopol. Rossiya and the Impeks-55 commercial and financial group behind it could probably agree with this if they knew exactly that in the upcoming privatization they would retain the supreme right to control land and real estate on the peninsula. But the fact is that no one is sure that the Saburov team will not fertilize Crimean privatization with Russian capital. Rather, there is a certitude to the contrary: As soon as Yevgeniy Saburov came to Simferopol, he said that he favors broad participation of foreign money in Crimea's economy. Today, having finally appreciated what Saburov meant by "foreign," yesterday's presidential support group would like to get rid of the visiting premier -- and the sooner, the better. By its latest demarche parliament warns Yuriy Meshkov, as it were, about the possible consequences he would face if he continues to keep his Moscow protege afloat.
