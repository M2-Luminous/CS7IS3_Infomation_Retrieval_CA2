The United States has been the most trustworthy nation for Japan since 1978, but the percentage of trust has fallen below 50 percent for the first time in 12 years. In addition, 20 percent of people in both Japan and the United States cited the other country as a potential military threat, displaying a swing in the sense of trust by citizens of both nations. The survey demonstrated anew that one of the most crucial problems confronting the cabinet of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata is to restore Japan-U.S. relations which have been strained by trade friction. The trade issue appears to have chilled the feelings Japanese and Americans have for each other. Japan was the most important nation for U.S. economic interests, third for British, German, and French economic interests, but was judged the 13th most trustworthy nation in the United States, the 10th in the United Kingdom, and the 11th in Germany and France. Moreover, according to a U.S. opinion poll complied by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on 29 April, the trust that the Americans place in Japan has clearly declined to the lowest level in the last 20 years. Asked to pick five nations from a list of 31 they considered the most trustworthy, 45 percent of Japanese respondents placed the United States at the top. However, the figure showed a drop of 6 percentage points from the previous survey conducted in 1992, falling below the 50 percent mark for the first time in 12 years (a 1982 poll recorded 49.6 percent). The degree of Japanese trust in the United States has been on the decline since the start of the 1990's because of worsening bilateral economic friction, but Japan's backlash against the administration of U.S. President Bill Clinton for its pressure to open Japanese markets seems to have rebounded as seen in the poll. In terms of how others see Japan, 10 percent of those surveyed in the United States said Japan was trustworthy, two percentage points more than the record low recorded in 1992 and the second lowest since the polls began. Japan obtained low marks in the survey on its trustworthiness as viewed by Europeans, scoring 12 percent (11th) in the United Kingdom, 18 percent (10th) in Germany, and 17 percent (11th) in France. In a similar query, Japanese respondents had a higher evaluation of these countries, giving the United Kingdom 40 percent (second), Germany 27 percent (fourth), and France 26 percent (fifth). However, the perception that Japan is economically important has filtered down to the countries where the survey took place. Japan sharply outdistanced Canada and the European Union as the nation most important to U.S. economic interests, gaining the top position with 53 percent. It also placed third in the United Kingdom, Germany, and France. In Japan, the United States overwhelmed other countries with 82 percent. Fifty-six percent of Japanese respondents put North Korea at the top of the list of nations that could become a military threat to their country, while the Middle East topped all others as an area that could become a military threat to the United States, the United Kingdom, and France. The former Soviet Union occupied first place in the survey in Germany. In addition, 21 percent of respondents in Japan listed the United States while 20 percent of the Americans cited Japan. Regarding Japan's economic clout in the 21st century, the predominant feeling is that it has reached its zenith since 39 percent of Japanese respondents said the economy will not change and 31 percent said it will become weaker, outnumbering 25 percent who said it will become stronger. However, respondents in the United States and the three European countries said the Japanese economy will grown stronger since they apparently see it as a primary factor pressuring their own economies.
