The two sides observed that the resumption of the work of the commission (the 18th Bulgarian-Korean commission was held in 1989), will improve bilateral trade and economic relations and sci-technical cooperation, the chairmen of the two sides of the commission -- Bulgarian Deputy Trade Minister Kiril Velev and the deputy chairman of the Foreign Economic Relations Committee of the DPRK Ku Bo Te [spelling of name as received] -- told a press conference. An agreement was reached to cover Bulgaria's 4-million-transferable-ruble surplus in bilateral commercial exchange by the end of 1995 with the import of raw materials and consumer goods, Mr. Velev said. Mr. Te said that the Government of the DPRK gives priority to foreign trade and to promoting and developing trade and economic relations with Bulgaria. Ms. Antoaneta Dincheva, expert at the "Countries in Transition" Department at the Ministry of Trade, told BTA that Bulgaria and the DPRK effected their payments in convertible currency at the current international prices on the main commodity exchanges. In June 1993 the two countries signed an Agreement on Trade and Economic Cooperation in order to wind up reciprocal payments in transferable rubles and granted each other most-favoured-nation status. The DPRK is interested in the export of raw materials for the Bulgarian silk industry, in the import of machines and equipment for the light and food processing industries, in cooperation in the production of electric and I.C.E. [internal-combustion-engined] lift trucks, as well as in the setting up in the DPRK of a joint enterprise for the production of fireproof bricks. In the field of agriculture the two sides showed interest in the exchange of genetic material of animal and plant origin and the Bulgarian side showed interest in importing silkworm grain [as received]. According to data of the Ministry of Trade, in 1993 bilateral commercial exchange amounted to U.S.$6,343,100, which is approximately 65 percent up from 1992 (U.S.$3,856,000). In 1991 this figure was U.S.$2,201,000. Bulgarian exports to the DPRK totalled U.S.$4,282,100 and imports from the DPRK U.S.$2,061,000. Last year the DPRK remained second among Bulgaria's partners of the former socialist countries in Asia, following China. Bulgarian exports to the DPRK comprise mainly base metals, textile materials, machines and equipment, transport devices, mineral and chemical products, and the structure of Bulgarian imports from the DPRK is dominated by textile raw materials, foodstuffs, cement products, plaster, ceramics, glass, instruments, etc. In the first three months of 1994 commercial exchange between Bulgaria and the DPRK exceeded U.S.$1,018,800. The delegation of the DPRK had meetings at the Ministry of Industry, the Agricultural Academy and with Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Trade Valentin Karabashev. The next joint Bulgarian-Korean commission is scheduled to be held in 1995 in Pyongyang.
