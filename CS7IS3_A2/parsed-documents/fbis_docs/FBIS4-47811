FBIS4-47811 "drafr086_a_94010" FBIS-AFR-94-086 Daily Report 4 May 1994 CENTRAL AFRICA Zaire Assembly Reportedly Invaded by Presidential Troops Assembly Reportedly Invaded by Presidential Troops BR0405121694 Brussels LA LIBRE BELGIQUE in French 4 May 94 p 5 BR0405121694 Brussels LA LIBRE BELGIQUE French BFN [Text] Tension mounted again in Kinshasa when, in the absence of Monsignor Monsengwo, president of the High Council of the Republic-Transitional Parliament (HCR-PT) (who is attending the Synod in Rome), an open conflict broke out between Second Deputy President Anzuluni (presidential faction) and the pro-Tshisekedi opposition. Mr. Ndjoko, representing the Tshisekedi team in Brussels, told LA LIBRE BELGIQUE that the seat of the assembly had been invaded by 600 agents of the Special Presidential Division (DSP) in civilian dress on Tuesday [3 May], while 1,200 of them in uniform surrounded the building to prevent access and 300 others, in civilian dress, searched the deputies. New Duplication According to Mr. Ndjoko, the USORAL [Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition and Allies] refused to take part in the plenary session on Tuesday in these conditions, while the members of the assembly office belonging to the opposition convened a plenary session on their side "to confirm" Mr. Tshisekedi as prime minister, in other words "a new duplication of the institutions." Zairian Ambassador to Brussels Kimbulu told us that there had been no deployment of force at the HCR-PT on Tuesday "either inside or outside," and that no plenary session was held on that day. "Between 0800 and 1200 GMT, councillors were registered in commissions. At 1400 GMT, the office met to count the commissions and those registered. That is all." On Monday, AFP press agency reports, the councillors had still not managed to determine the conditions in which the future prime minister, the object of the conflict, is to be appointed. This conflict took a violent turn last Thursday. Mr. Anzuluni had called in the forces of law and order, when the opposition was staging a disturbance to prevent the session from being held; two deputies, Mr. Mutshipaye Ilunga and Mr. Lumbu Lumbu, had ribs broken; Dr. Ntambwe had his skull fractured by a blow with the butt of a rifle and died from his injuries. Who for Prime Minister? According to Mr. Ndjoko, the opposition met on 18 April in the absence of the URD [Union for the Republic and Democracy] (a sub- platform of the USORAL) and the UDI [Union of Independent Democrats] (Kengo wa Dondo's party); 62 out of 80 were present and 54 voted for Tshisekedi. On 28 April, the HCR office eliminated the other candidates because they had been submitted individually and not through the USORAL. In presidential circles, it is being reaffirmed that the prime minister must be presented by the opposition but "after consultation with the political class," which, according to these circles, amounts to demanding a consensus on this person. And, according to Ambassador Kimbulu, the office has accepted six candidates: Mr. Tshisekedi, Mr. Kengo, Mr. Beyeye, Mr. Malumba Bangula, Mr. Lunda Bululu, and Mr. Mulumba Lukoji.
