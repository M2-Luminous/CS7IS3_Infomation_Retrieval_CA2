FBIS4-56272 "drlat084_r_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-084 Daily Report 28 Apr 1994 Peru Expert: Split Confirms Defeat Expert: Split Confirms Defeat PY3004001294 Madrid EFE in Spanish 2109 GMT 28 Apr 94 PY3004001294 Madrid EFE Spanish BFN [Text] Lima, 28 Apr (EFE) -- Today, Raul Gonzalez, an expert in Peruvian terrorist violence, stressed the split in the Shining Path is what confirms this Maoist group's "total defeat." The expert indicated that the split in this group, which took up arms in 1980, has been demonstrated by Shining Path documents, some of which have been delivered to Peruvian media. The expert noted that according to these documents the faction headed by Shining Path leader Abimael Guzman supports Guzman's peace talks with the government, whereas another faction rejects them and declares it will pursue the Shining Path war against Peruvian democracy. Gonzalez said Shining Path had experienced hard military blows in the past two years, after Guzman's capture, "but was able to resist and remain active thanks to its main political capital, namely party unity." The expert emphasized: "The Shining Path was monolithic while it kept this unity. Therefore, the Shining Path split, from a political viewpoint, may be comparable to Guzman's capture from a military viewpoint." He added: "The organization created by Abimael Guzman has not been entirely quashed. Nevertheless, after its split, Shining Path has experienced its worst political reversal and is going through a situation of overall defeat." Today, the opposition newspaper LA REPUBLICA published a police report that confirms the group's split. The newspaper reports that the faction opposing Guzman held a meeting in March in the Huanta Province mountains in southern Peru. During the meeting, this faction agreed to disregard Guzman's peace proposal. The report also indicates that during this meeting a new Shining Path "central committee" was formed, and that this "central committee" expelled from the party the leaders who remain loyal to Guzman and who support peace, describing them as "traitors, infiltrated people, capitulators, and old revisionists." According to the report, the new "committee" is headed by Shining Path leader Oscar Ramirez Durand, alias "Comrade Feliciano," one of the Shining Path founders. Today, former Deputy Carlos Tapia, another expert in Shining Path activities, stressed that "Shining Path no longer represents a threat, and in a way we may coexist with this type of violence as is the case with the IRA [Irish Republican Army] in Ireland and the ETA [Basque Homeland and Liberty] in Spain." Nevertheless, Tapia ruled out the possibility of the terrorist organization's immediate disappearance, "as the social processes that have been brewing for so long may not end overnight, and some time is required for their extinction."
