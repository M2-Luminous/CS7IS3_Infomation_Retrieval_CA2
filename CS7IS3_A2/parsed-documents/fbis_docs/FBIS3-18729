Washington is accusing the French Government of introducing veiled quotas aimed at allaying the anger of Breton fishermen. "False accusations," the Hotel Matignon [prime minister's office] retorted, stressing that "if the Americans are stepping up the pressure on international trade it is to cast doubt on the main achievement of the Uruguay Round which their Senate refuses to contemplate: the institutionalization of a World Trade Organization." In this affair, the Clinton Administration has acted under pressure from the National Fisheries Institute, the shipowners' lobby, arguing that Massachusetts fishermen were losing $200,000 a week because of the restrictions on imports imposed by France. And the U.S. Special Trade Representative Mickey Kantor threatened to introduce trade sanctions on $100 million of French exports, especially cheeses, because they are perishable. In Paris, the Quai d'Orsay [Foreign Ministry] immediately issued a warning to Washington, stating that the checks carried out by France were "perfectly in line with Community regulations." It added that "if the United States took the path of retaliatory measures against France, it would be responsible for escalating tensions at the very time preparations are under way for the Marrakesh conference, which will make it possible to sign the GATT agreements and to set up the World Trade Organization." According to official French figures, only 27.3 tonnes (out of 997) of American fish have been banned since the strengthening of border checks purely for public health reasons. They were batches "swollen" by chemical additives that retain water, which amounts to selling water for the price of fish. Paris and Washington have finally chosen the path of peace. Fisheries Minister Jean Puech agreed with Mickey Kantor that a team of American experts should examine the French checks. This team is expected in Paris today.
