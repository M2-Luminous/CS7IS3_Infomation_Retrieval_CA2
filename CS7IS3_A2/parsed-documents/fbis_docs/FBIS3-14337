It is one of the major items on the agenda in line with the objective of the grouping, that is to strengthen South-South cooperation. Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed is among the several leaders who are present in the Indian capital for the summit. Our correspondent Vasunta Rajkumaran has these details: [Begin recording] [Rajkumaran] Good morning! Though the summit does not draw the full participation of all the 15 heads of state or government, it will be no less significant with a perusal of the agenda reveals the commitment being attached by member countries to ensure the continued development of the G-15. One of the major topics to be discussed is the future course of the group in a fast changing world. This summit is being regarded as a watershed in the development of the group. It will provide the leaders an opportunity to look at the G-15 with fresh perspective. In fact, the group has the potential of becoming consultative partners with the G-7 on issues and policies affecting the international environment for accelerated growth and sustainable development. Malaysia views the G-15 as the beginning of a collaborative effort towards a North-South dialogue. The minister of foreign affairs, Datuk Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, says as there is a stronger call for a North-South dialogue, there is certainly a role for the G-15 in the future. [Badawi] We have begun to see lately that there is now also a stronger and stronger call for North-South dialogue. The North-South dialogue is something that we must have. But then we must begin with a successful South-South cooperation. I cannot see how a North-South dialogue can be successful as far as advancing the interest of the countries of the South as much as protecting the interests of the South if there is no effective South-South cooperation. And G-15 certainly emphasized on that. I would see G-15 as the beginning of a collaborative effort towards that. South-South cooperation has been much an idea. Since it is an idea, we talk about South-South cooperation. So G-15 tries to implement, tries to come out with projects that make South-South cooperation a reality. [Rajkumaran] The other major issues on the agenda are the questions of frequency of summit and the level and composition of the summit quorum. The foreign ministers at their meeting reached a consensus that the summit should be held every two years so as to ensure a better participation among the leaders. They have also proposed that heads who are genuinely unable to attend summits be allowed to send special envoys. [end recording]
