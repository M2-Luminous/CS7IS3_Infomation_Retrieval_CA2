Ayatollah Musavi-Ardabili, Tehran's substitute Friday prayer leader and former chief justice, told the morning daily 'SALAM' that those who imagined ties with the U.S. would help them make progress, were making a big blunder. Because, he stressed, in its relations with other nations, the U.S. adheres to no specific objective but its hegemonistic aims. Also commenting on relations with the U.S., Ayatollah Azari-Qomi told the daily that it was to the benefit of the Islamic Republic and Islam not to have ties with Washington. The ayatollah, a theologian at Qom Seminary, further added that although the Islamic Republic of Iran had fully severed ties with the U.S., still whispers were being heard inside the country on the resumption of ties with Washington. "These murmurs should be stopped under any circumstances and this could be done by the people themselves." Stressing that the slogan 'Down with the U.S.' should have a wider dimension, Ayatollah Azari-Qomi called on the press and officials to inform the public of the positive outcome of having no ties with the U.S.
