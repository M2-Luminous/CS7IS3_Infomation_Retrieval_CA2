In this regard, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, at a news conference held today at Aizu Wakamatsu City in Fukushima Prefecture where he is making a stump tour, touched on North Korea's suspected nuclear arms development and explained, without making a concrete reference to such measures as economic sanctions, the need to continue to carefully deal with the issue. [Begin Hata recording] I hope from the bottom of my heart that North Korea will talk without reserve by candidly accepting the opinion of international society. Also, we need to do our best to seek understanding of North Korea. [end recording] At the same time, Prime Minister Hata said that generally speaking, it is a matter of course for a nation to be able to deal with emergency situations. In this way, he generally admitted that the government is studying various possible measures Japan can take to deal with the situation. On the other hand, Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], held a news conference today in Hachinohe City in Aomori Prefecture. On how Japan should deal with the issue of North Korea's suspected nuclear arms development, he explained a negative view toward the idea of imposing sanctions against the DPRK by Japan, the United States, and the ROK. [Begin Kubo recording] I think Japan, the United States, and South Korea must be cautious about the idea of imposing sanctions without any decisions by the United Nations. I think the SDPJ, for its part, will take a negative position on the idea. [end recording] In making the remark, Secretary General Kubo indicated a negative view on the Japan-U.S.-ROK sanctions against North Korea. Moreover, he stated that the Japanese Government should do its utmost to solve the issue in an amicable way through dialogue. With regard to the future domestic political situation, Secretary General Kubo stated that if a no-confidence motion in the Hata cabinet is approved, there will be no other option but for the cabinet to resign en masse. He thus reiterated the view that the Hata cabinet should voluntarily resign en masse after the fiscal 1994 national budget passes the Diet.
