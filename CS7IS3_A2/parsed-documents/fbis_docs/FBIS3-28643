His emergence in the limelight is particularly conspicuous because he does not belong to the Sangdo-tong inner circle, the center of power. He consolidated his position during the reshuffle of the ruling hierarchy late last year which reaffirmed President Kim's abiding trust in him. The reshuffle was aimed at strengthening President Kim's governing in person and placing people in the Sangdo-tong inner circle in key positions. [passage omitted] It is said that it was none other Pak who advised Kim to set the strengthening of international competitiveness as the foremost goal of state administration in the new year and to use this goal as the cardinal criterion in selecting a new Cabinet. He was not directly involved in the reshuffle of the government and the party. Nevertheless, it is a common belief that he was virtually the only one whom President Kim consulted. Early this year Pak completed the reorganization of the presidential secretariat to assist the president more effectively in his second year of office, although the reorganization fell short of his original intentions. The reorganization will now free him to concentrate more on his advisory role. Unlike other veteran politicians in their fourth term in the National Assembly, Pak has his own views on a wide range of issues such as the unification issue and is reputed to be a very rational and resilient person. Yet "not exceeding the bounds" and knowing his place are the better known ingredients in his character. According to Blue House sources, Pak bore himself with dignity in the past year despite his not belonging to the Sangdo-tong inner circles, and his deportment must have given President Kim a strong impression. In taking control of state affairs in the early stage of his term in office, President Kim may have found it necessary to choose as his Blue House secretary general a person from whom he should keep a certain "distance" rather than one of his retainer group whom he could address by his first name except in public. Pak's modest personality and smooth human relations played a significant part in travelling the political road without a hitch. He is on intimate terms with Yi Won-chon, Blue House senior secretary for political affairs, who belongs to the Sangdo-tong inner circle. [passage omitted] Pak also has a friendly relationship with Hong In-kil, Blue House senior secretary for general affairs, who belongs to the Sangdo-tong inner circle. The two have worked together in the Blue House in the past year. Of course, Hong is courteous to Pak, his college senior, and plays the role of a "protective shield" for him. Clearly, Pak has become one of the handful of important "pillars" which President Kim can use. As Kim's perception of statecraft improves, he might need late this year or early next year a secretary general who is more of a manager than a political adviser, and it might become possible for him to appoint former Assemblyman So Sok-chae. Even in that event, it is generally speculated, Pak would be found "more useful" in some other capacity. One of those who know Pak well said: "It is a lie to say that politicians have no ambition. As far as Secretary General Pak is concerned, quiet deportment has become a habit." It is said that Pak sometimes hesitates to tell things straight to the president or the intensity of his advise is somewhat weak. But Blue House officials said, "a true adviser's role is to act quietly to make an opening for solving an outstanding issue."
