FR940429-2-00019 FR940429-2-00016 DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE Department of the Army Environmental Assessment (EA) and Finding of no Significant Impact (FNSI) For Draft Army Red-Cockaded Woodpecker Management Guidelines AGENCY: Department of the Army, DoD. ACTION: Notice of availability. SUMMARY: The Department of the Army has prepared an environmental assessment (EA) and made a finding of no significant impact (FNSI) for draft Army-wide guidelines for the management of the red-cockaded woodpecker (RCW) on federally-owned Army installations. The RCW is a federally listed endangered species found on Army installations in the southeastern United States, extending from North Carolina to Louisiana. Currently, the RCW is found on Fort Bragg, North Carolina; Fort Stewart, Georgia; Fort Jackson, South Carolina; Fort Benning, Georgia; Fort Polk, Louisiana; and Sunny Point Military Ocean Terminal, North Carolina. The following Army installations do not currently have RCWs but have had RCWs historically: Fort Gordon, Georgia; Fort McClellan, Alabama; and Louisiana Army Ammunition Point, Louisiana. The guidelines will be used by Army installations that manage RCW habitat as baseline standards in preparing and revising installation RCW management plans. The purpose of the guidelines is to ensure effective Army-wide RCW management in compliance with the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA). The new guidelines will replace existing guidelines approved in 1984. As part of the guidelines development process, the Army has prepared an EA and made a FNSI in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969. Additionally, the Army has prepared a biological assessment under the ESA to assess the effects of the guidelines on endangered and threatened species. The Army announced commencement of the guidelines development process in the Federal Register on February 16, 1993, and invited public participation (58 FR 8588). The EA addresses the comments received from the public and scientific community during the process. The EA concludes that the guidelines will not have a significant effect upon the environment. As a result, the Army has made a FNSI and proposes to approve Army RCW management guidelines, subject to completion of consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in accordance with the ESA. APPROVAL DATE: The Army will proceed to approve RCW management guidelines 30 days after publication of this notice. ADDRESSES: Written comments or requests to obtain a copy of the EA and FNSI, with supporting documentation, may be forwarded to the U.S. Army Construction Engineering Research Laboratories (USACERL), ATTN: Mr. Tim Hayden, P.O. Box 9005, Champaign, IL 61826.
