Recently, station reporter (Song Jian) interviewed Gao Lulin, director of the State Patent Office, in connection with the success China has achieved since implementation of the Patent Law nine years ago. Gao Lulin said: [Begin Gao recording] In 1985 when the Patent Law was first implemented, the Chinese government accepted approximately 17,000 patent applications. The number of applications increased every year. In 1993, the Chinese government accepted over 77,000 patent applications. Some 20 to 25 percent of all the 300,000 or so patent applications accepted have been exploited; some exploited patents have yielded very good economic results. The establishment of the patent (?system) and the popularization of the patent [word indistinct] have inevitably given rise to certain disputes over patent infringement. But China's people's courts and patent offices have effectively handled these disputes. According to incomplete statistics, by the end of last year, people's courts and patent offices had respectively handled 2,000 cases of patent disputes. Following the revision of the Patent Law and China's access to and coordination with the international patent systems, we can say provisions for patent protection as prescribed in China's Patent Law have basically met the requirements set by the World Organization for the Protection of Intellectual Rights as well as by GATT.
