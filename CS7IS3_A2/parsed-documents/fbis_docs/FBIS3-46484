The Thai officials attending the meeting concluded that Thailand should try its best to emphasize its attitude and intention [words indistinct] between the two countries. These Thai officials also called on the Thai Government to take (?steps) to assure Cambodia that the Thai Government fully supports the new Royal Government of Cambodia [RGC] and that Thailand does not interfere in Cambodia's internal affairs. This is another very important stance displayed by Thailand to contribute to the strengthening friendship and stability between the two countries, Cambodia and Thailand. They are moving forward in whichever direction toward national development. During his recent visit to Cambodia, His Excellency [H.E.] Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri also emphasized this matter. We believe that if Thailand adheres to the current stance that it recognizes only the RGC, Thai Prime Minister Chuan Likphai's coming visit to the Kingdom of Cambodia will certainly achieve good results in strengthening the relations between the two countries [words indistinct]. Moreover, this will further weaken the Khmer Rouge rebels [words indistinct] who are attempting to renew the war.
