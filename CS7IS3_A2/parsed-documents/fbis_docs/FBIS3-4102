As a result, after the enterprises had established themselves, they randomly used other people's trademarks and infringed upon the rights of the people who had registered the trademarks, to the extent that many disputes on use of trademarks have emerged and many enterprises fight to sell a commodity with the same trademark in the same market, causing chaos, a decrease in price, and damage to the reputation of the trademark. In light of the abovementioned situation, various economic and trade departments and commissions, as well as foreign trade bureaus, are hereby requested to seriously look into the problem of the use of trademarks for export goods by enterprises, when they declare import and export operation rights for production enterprises and approve the establishment of various kinds of foreign trade companies and foreign-funded enterprises. Regarding: Those production enterprises which have relied on the registered trademarks of other people for a long time but have been unable to obtain permission from the patent holders of the registered trademarks; the trademarks of commodities operated by enterprises and causing registration disputes between manufacturers and traders inside the country; those enterprises which have names the same as the registered trademarks of other people and their exports are the same or similar to the commodities with trademarks registered by other people; and regarding other activities which jeopardize the reputation of the registered trademarks of other people, which violate the law on trademarks, and which might cause disputes on use of trademarks, no declaration, examination, and approval is to be carried out. Regarding the disputes on the use of trademarks which have already emerged, the departments which gave the original declaration and approval should mediate a solution according to law. As for the cases which cannot be effectively settled by administrative mediation, which cannot be solved for a long time, which affect normal operation of enterprises, and which disrupt export order, the persons who possess the registered trademarks can report to the law enforcement organs for arbitration according to law.
