This was announced by Interior Minister Franz Loeschnak on Wednesday [5 January]. Thus, Austria is still right at the top of the list of European states -- "quite in contrast to the assumptions of the Greens and of other groups, which advocate unrestricted immigration to Austria," the minister said. A total of 10,879 asylum requests have been made since June 1992, of which 2,348 have not yet been decided, 528 have been retracted, 6,505 have been decided negatively, and 1,497 have been decided positively, Loeschnak said. In 1993, 4,743 applications for asylum were made. The main countries of origin of the asylum-seekers were Bosnia-Herzegovina (1,259), Iraq (541), the FRY (372), and Turkey (328). In 1993, the majority of the still open asylum procedures were dealt with; a total of 15,885 requests were decided, Loeschnak stressed. Of the asylum procedures that were decided positively in 1993, 543 affected persons from Bosnia-Herzegovina; thus, the recognition rate is 42 percent. At the end of 1993, 40,184 persons were included in the support campaign for people driven out of Bosnia-Herzegovina by the war; 13,527 were housed in large accommodations. The average influx into the support campaign was about 1,000 persons per month last year. From January to November 1993, 8,290 persons were deported by the immigration police and 4,956 persons were sent back after crossing the border illegally, Loeschnak said. [passage omitted]
