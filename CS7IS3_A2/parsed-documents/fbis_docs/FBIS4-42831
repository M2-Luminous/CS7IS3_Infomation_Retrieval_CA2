Among others, Federal Chancellor Franz Vranitzky, Vienna Mayor Helmut Zilk, and Economics Federation President Leopold Maderthaner, and Johann Hoechtl, chairman of the OeVP's Workers' and Employees' Association [OeAAB], appealed to all Austrians to participate in the referendum this coming Sunday [12 June] and to vote with yes. Vranitzky asked the EU supporters, in particular, to exercise their right to vote. Of course, all citizens should make use of their democratic right to vote. Asked about the result of the referendum, Vranitzky said that he did not expect an overwhelming decision. The result will be clear and unambiguous, albeit not overwhelming, the chancellor said. Economics Federation President Leopold Maderthaner and OeAAB Chairman Josef Hoechtl said that a clear majority was in favor of EU entry. Yet, the question was whether all these people would cast their vote on 12 June. For Maderthaner the question is whether, as of 1995, Austria would belong to West Europe or, together with Switzerland, to the group of states of the former East bloc and the former Yugoslavia. Both officials strongly warned against the threatening loss of jobs as a result of a negative referendum result. A total of 100,000 jobs were at stake, Hoechtl said: 43,000 new ones by the end of the century in the case of a positive outcome, or the loss of 60,000 in the case of a no. As a result of the rejection of the European Economic Area [EEA] 18 months ago, 150,000 jobs were lost in Switzerland. Only EU membership can safeguard Austria as a financial center, Maderthaner emphasized. In the case of a no, a dramatic slump in investment would have to be feared similarly to Switzerland, where investment has fallen to a minimum since the no to the EEA. Maderthaner emphasized that a no in the EU referendum would also threaten Austria's function as a bridge to--and center for--the states of the former East bloc. On the occasion of the 45th-anniversary celebration of the Lawyers' Association, Justice Minister Nikolaus Michalek welcomed the fact that the legal aid associations had taken a clear public position and, after a critical examination, said "yes" to EU entry. A study on "European integration under ecological and social criteria" was presented by the Greens on Tuesday. The study, which was sponsored by the Greens' think tank and carried out by the Advisory Council for Economic, Social and Environmental Alternatives, describes the alternative to the Maastricht Treaty in terms of economic and monetary policy. The authors emphasized that the study does not present a clear stand for or against Austrian EU entry. Madeleine Petrovic, chairwoman of the Greens caucus in the Austrian Parliament, emphasized that the question of yes or no on 12 June was beyond the scope of the study but that one could conclude the necessity for change. Johannes Voggenhuber, Greens spokesman for European affairs, emphasized that the Greens doesn't intend to teach the government a lesson on the day of the referendum, only wants to "teach the EU a lesson." Economist Wolfgang Polt said that economic and monetary union as envisioned under the Maastricht Treaty, would have positive effects on growth and cost and eliminate speculation in foreign currency. However, in his view, the treaty's convergence criteria are unattainable for most countries within the next 15-40 years. These criteria could be achieved only at the price of "stabilization crises." The creation of a single currency by 1999 is most unlikely. On Tuesday, the Freedom Party of Austria [FPOe] strongly criticized the Corrao Pirzio-Biroli, the EU ambassador to Austria, who said that if Austria were to vote with no on 12 June, membership would not be renegotiated. FPOe Chairman Joerg Haider spoke of a Federal Government "EU blackmailing campaign" along with "foreign helpers and panicmongers." The Association of Austrian Doctors has advocated Austrian EU entry on conditions that Finance Minister Ferdinand Lacina keeps his promise that the additional financial burden resulting from EU entry would be compensated as promised. On Tuesday, the Council of Catholic Laymen pointed to solidarity as a basic value of Catholic social teaching. As an integral part of the EU, Austria could do a lot for the poorer countries in the world, while as a poorer, isolated country, Austria could do nothing. A majority of the provincial government of Lower Austria decided on Tuesday to recommend a vote in favor of EU entry to the citizens of the province.
