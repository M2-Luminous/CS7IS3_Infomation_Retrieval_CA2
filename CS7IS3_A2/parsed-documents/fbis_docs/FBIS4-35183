Shim'on Peres, the Israeli foreign minister, said earlier in Washington that Syria's terms for negotiations are unacceptable and that it wants to wrest great concessions from Israel, especially with regard to full withdrawal from the Golan. It seems Israeli officials continue to block and hinder prospects for achieving a real breakthrough in the peace process based on the Security Council resolutions and the land-for-peace principle. What Peres terms great concessions is an outright fallacy. The Golan has been Syrian territory since time immemorial. It is an indivisible part of Syria. Therefore, Israel's withdrawal amounts to nothing more than a correction of an abnormal situation and the end of an aggression that has continued since 1967. Security Council resolutions have asked Israel to pull its troops out and not to change the identity of the Golan and the other occupied territories. The U.S. peace initiative was launched, in the first place, on the basis of Resolutions 242 and 338 and the land-for-peace principle, as well as the need to achieve a just and comprehensive settlement on all fronts of the conflict. The ABC's of justice suggest that occupation should be removed; usurped territory should be returned to its owners; and that Israel should submit to UN law and stop pursuing the law of the jungle. Humanity is preparing to enter the 21st Century. Occupation has been removed from all over the Earth. All nations have attained their freedom and independence. It is illogical that Israel should stay above international law, practicing a policy of occupation and terrorism and deeming the invasion of others' territories a legitimate right and the displacement of the residents of those territories a fact of life. Israel's claim will remain worthless until this claim is translated into actual, concrete stands toward peace. Since 1948, the rulers of Israel have been crying out for peace and at the same time igniting wars and carrying out attacks in the name of working to achieve peace. But, when the Arabs responded to the first serious U.S. initiative, the Israeli rulers' peaceful claims turned into obstacles and hindrances in the way of the progress of the peace process. Syria, along with Lebanon and Jordan, have proposed full peace in return for full withdrawal. However, the Israeli rulers rejected outright the principle of full withdrawal and hinted at the possibility of partial withdrawals in return for a series of impossible conditions and restrictions. In Lebanon's case, for example, the Israeli rulers have escalated their brutal land, air, and sea attacks against Lebanon, because Lebanon adheres to the implementation of Security Council Resolution 425. They deemed their message to Lebanon a message to all Arabs who ask for the withdrawal of the occupying Israeli forces to the 4 June 1967 lines. The rulers of Israel have also rejected a comprehensive withdrawal from the Golan under fabricated pretexts. They deliberately foiled any prospect for real progress on the Syrian-Israeli track. In fact, Rabin has gone as far as making a commitment to hold a public referendum on the Golan, as if Israel is above international and UN law and can simply occupy and annex the land of others while the owners of the land are not allowed to claim it or to defend its identity, culture, and history. These Israeli practices, in the Golan, southern Lebanon, and the Palestinian arena, clearly confirm that Israel does not want peace and that it has never abandoned its expansionist and aggressive schemes. It is no coincidence at all that the Government of Israel has threatened to occupy the Gaza Strip and Jericho once again if the Palestinian self-rule authorities do not abide by Israel's instructions. Peace in the eyes of the entire world means establishing justice and right and ending occupation, injustice, oppression, and terrorism. In Israel's book, however, peace is a cheap deal that guarantees that Israel will swallow as much as it can of others' territories that it has occupied by force, deception, and trickery. It is natural for Syria and the other Arab parties to reject such aggressive proposals and adhere to the restoration of all their occupied territories and to assert international law in the region. The Israelis are greatly mistaken if they think their maneuvers and tactics, which have exceeded all limits, will make the Arabs abandon their territories and rights. Syria said yesterday -- and it reiterates today and will reiterate tomorrow -- that there can be no relinquishment of any single iota of the soil of the Golan and that peace depends on the departure of the last Israeli soldier from the Golan and the establishment of a just and comprehensive solution in the region.
