The FSLN ratified the position that it "cannot endorse any agreement" with the characteristics of the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility [ESAF], a position that had already been presented to IMF Director Michael Camdessus. The FSLN communique affirms that "the nation cannot resist an adjustment plan like the one being planned." The communique also backs the demands of ranchers, businessmen, industrialists, and producers who want policy changes in favor of production. Originally convoked to discuss preparations for the FSLN Special Congress, the assembly dedicated a lot of time to analyzing the wave of massive evictions of humble families throughout the country and condemned the government and the Judicial Branch for the grave social consequences that these abuses will have. The assembly also supported the resistance that the Communal Movement has promoted against the evictions and urged the National Police not to lend themselves to unjust actions against townspeople. The Sandinist Assembly stated its backing for the work the Sandinist bench at the National Assembly is carrying out in favor of the Legislative Branch's independence and rejected the report that the U.S. State Department drafted on the human rights situation in Nicaragua, considering the report to be "biased and meddlesome." Regarding the organization of a special FSLN Congress session, the assembly confirmed that the session, which has been named Augusto Cesar Sandino -- for Sandinist Unity -- will be held on 20, 21, and 22 May. The Sandinist Assembly authorized department organizations to elect, as guests to the FSLN National Congress, a number of militants equal to 30 percent of the delegates to that congress. These guests may speak but have no vote. Of them, 50 percent must be women, and 50 percent must be between 16 and 25 years old. The FSLN will consult the National Council of Political Parties on the possibility of filling the vacancies left by deceased Congress members. The document "vehemently asks that public debates between Sandinists be free of insults and personal caustic remarks" and urged party members to accept and abide by whatever decisions are adopted by the majority at the Congress. Regarding electoral results in the Atlantic coast, the Sandinist Assembly accepted as valid complaints local Sandinists have filed because of the late delivery of material and economic support for their campaign. The Sandinist Assembly admitted that "the failure to adequately resolve political responsibilities in the Atlantic Coast" is an error of national FSLN organizations. The Sandinist Assembly especially acknowledged the work carried out under adverse conditions by the Sandinists on the coast, work that permitted the FSLN to emerge as "a decisive political force in both autonomous regions." The FSLN has backed the Atlantico Norte Sandinists' decision to convoke a coastal unity government tasked with struggling for full autonomy in the Atlantic Coast and extended an offer to the Atlantico Sur forces.
