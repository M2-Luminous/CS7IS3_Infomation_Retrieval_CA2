They discussed economic problems and hardships on the way to the market. In particular, the report presented by Akayev spoke about the poorly thought-out mechanism of settling payments between the branches of industry and enterprises. This negatively affects production and brings about a stop to work in plants and factories. Special attention was paid by Akayev and those who spoke during the discussion to agricultural issues. It was noted that owing to a timely allocation of a soft loan by the government, the spring field works were done in time. The fodder procurement campaign also began timely and in an organized way. Preparation for harvesting is in progress. The participants of the meeting outlined a number of concrete measures to improve work of the industry and agriculture.
