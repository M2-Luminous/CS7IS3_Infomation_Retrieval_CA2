Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera on Monday ordered the partial suspension of individual rights and the imposition of exchange controls as part of a strategy to reverse the decline of the economy and overcome the financial crisis. Announcing the drastic measures over radio and television, the president explained that they were necessary because the seriousness of the economic crisis produces "insecurity and distrust," affects national life, and threatens to disrupt public peace. An announcement published on Tuesday in the GACETA OFICIAL indicated that the sale of dollars will be resumed within six days in order to halt the sharp fall of the bolivar against the U.S. dollar, the price of which went up 85 bolivares in one month. Presidential spokesman Guillermo Alvarez Bajares announced that the Council of Ministers will meet today to implement the price and exchange controls and adopt other measures. Alvarez explained that individual rights were suspended to prevent the disruption of public order, "because there are groups interested in promoting disturbances," which could not be put down with the laws that exist in a de jure state. Venezuelans awoke yesterday amid great uncertainty because, although price increases were prohibited, merchants "speedily" changed the prices of products. [passage omitted]
