Under a preliminary contract signed Monday, Arianespace will launch three satellites in 2001, 2002 and 2005, the EUMETSAT statement said. The three Meteosat craft "will offer high performance meteological coverage until at least 2012," the statement said. The contracts for the three satellites will be negotiated separately "to allow EUMETSAT to benefit from a very competitive and attractive commercial situation," EUMETSAT director John Morgan said. EUMETSAT was set up in 1986 by 17 countries and provides weather satellite services for Europe from its base at Darmstadt-Eberstadt near Frankfurt.
