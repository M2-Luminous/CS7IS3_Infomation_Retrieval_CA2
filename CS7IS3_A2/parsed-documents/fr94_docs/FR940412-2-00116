FR940412-2-00116 FR940412-2-00085 Analysis of Proposed Consent Order To Aid Public Comment The Federal Trade Commission (``Commission'') has provisionally accepted an agreement containing a proposed Consent Order from Martin Marietta Corporation (``Martin Marietta''), under which Martin Marietta's satellite division would be prohibited from gaining access to any non-public information that Martin Marietta's expendable launch vehicle division receives from competing satellite producers in its capacity as a provider of launch vehicles. The proposed Consent Order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement or make final the agreement's proposed Order. Martin Marietta is a significant competitor in the market for the manufacture and sale of satellites. On December 22, 1993, Martin Marietta agreed to acquire General Dynamics Corporation's Space Systems Division, which manufactures the Atlas expendable launch vehicles. Following this acquisition, Martin Marietta would be the only United States supplier in the market for Atlas-class expendable launch vehicles as well as a competitor in the satellite market. The proposed complaint alleges that the acquisition, if consummated, would violate Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 45, and Section 7 of the Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 18, because Martin Marietta's satellite division could gain access to competitively significant and non-public information concerning other satellite suppliers' products. As a result, the proposed acquisition increases the likelihood that competition between satellite suppliers would decrease and that advancements in satellite research, innovation, and quality would be reduced. The proposed Consent Order prohibits Martin Marietta from disclosing any non-public information Martin Marietta receives in its capacity as a provider of expendable launch vehicles from a satellite owner or manufacturer to Martin Marietta's satellite division. Under the proposed Order, Martin Marietta may only use such information in its capacity as a provider of expendable launch vehicles. Non-public information is defined in the Order as any information not in the public domain furnished by a satellite owner or manufacturer to Martin Marietta's expendable launch vehicle division or General Dynamics in their capacity as providers of expendable launch vehicles and designated as proprietary information. The Commission anticipates that the effect of the proposed Order will be to maintain the opportunity for full competition in the market for the research, development, manufacture and sale of satellites by limiting the ability of one significant competitor to use information obtained from other competitors. Under the provisions of the Consent Order, Martin Marietta is also required to deliver a copy of the Order to any United States satellite owner or manufacturer prior to obtaining any information that is outside the public domain. One year from the date the Order becomes final and annually thereafter for nine (9) years, Martin Marietta will be required to provide to the Commission a report of its compliance with the Order. The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed Order, and it is not intended to constitute an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed Order or to modify in any way their terms. Donald S. Clark, Secretary.
