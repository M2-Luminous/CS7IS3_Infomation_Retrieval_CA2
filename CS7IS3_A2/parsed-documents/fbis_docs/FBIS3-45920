Xinjiang has undergone enormous changes in recent years with those seeking to split the Muslim-majority region from the rest of China "growing daily in ambition," the Public Security News [RENMIN GONGAN BAO] quoted Xinjiang's vice-director of police Abdula Xiti as saying. The separatists are publicly calling on Muslims in Xinjiang to fight socialism with Islam and seeking to weaken the unity of the Chinese state, Abdula said. Anti-Chinese demonstrations -- fuelled by Muslim activists in bordering former Soviet republics such as Kazakhstan and Tajikistan -- have multiplied in recent years, causing serious concerns within the Chinese leadership. Together with Tibet, Xinjiang is viewed by Beijing as a potential flashpoint for major ethnic unrest in China. Abdula said it was necessary to use "an iron hand" in dealing with the separatists and cracking down on their "illegal activities." In December last year, the communist party secretary for Tibet, Song Hanliang, said the government would take all necessary steps to suppress separatism spreading in the region.
