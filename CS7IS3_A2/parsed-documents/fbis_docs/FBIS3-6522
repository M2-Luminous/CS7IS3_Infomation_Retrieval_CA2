"The government has not yet decided, but the U.S. apparently does not appreciate the voluntary restrictions," Hiroshi Kumagai, minister of international trade and industry, said at a regular news conference. Japan has maintained a voluntary ceiling for its annual car exports to the U.S. since 1981, and is due to decide on a new limit at the end of the month. Kumagai said that U.S.-bound exports of cars manufactured in Japan have remained below the ceiling recently, mainly due to increased output at so-called transplant factories, or Japanese plants located in the U.S. The minister also cited the higher yen against the dollar as a reason why exports have slumped. Japan's voluntary restrictions on automobile exports are included among the trading practices criticized for lacking transparency at the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of global trade talks last December. Under the accord, trading nations agreed to end such practices within four years after the agreement is put into effect.
