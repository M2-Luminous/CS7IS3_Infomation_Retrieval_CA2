"I have read them, they say that [Northern League secretary] Bossi is saying goodbye to federalism...nonsense." Gianfranco Miglio is convinced that the lastest remarks made by the secretary have not changed the League's policy. Yet everybody heard those statements saying that federalist reform will be postponed a little because the first need is the people's "desire for government." The professor [Miglio] replies: "What does that have to do with it; Bossi's words were precise and measured; it takes a brazen face to interpret them as renouncing and abandoning federalism." A benevolent interpretation of Bossi's remarks? "Not at all," is his prompt reply, "even [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi agrees with what he says." [Vimercati] Excuse me, but how do you know? [Miglio] Because the Knight [Berlusconi nickname] called me and told me what he thinks. [Vimercati] Which is? [Miglio] He listened to what Bossi said and took his words for what they were: a go-ahead on moves to relaunch the economy, a strong warning on the League's decision to put federalism back in the center of the government's action. [Vimercati] In the center, but tomorrow, as we say. That is how problems are usually set aside. [Miglio] By the old political system perhaps. But certainly not by us. Berlusconi realizes this; he told me that he is ready to accede to our demands and is enthusiastic that he found us receptive to the problems of recovery. We will soon talk about these problems. We must meet... [Vimercati] Did you not fear, not even for a moment, that your plan for a federal Italy would be submerged forever? [Miglio] Never, absolutely not. It would be suicide for the League. Even Bossi told me: "I would not be so stupid to commit suicide in this way." [Vimercati] But a certain delay, at least, is foreseeable? [Miglio] I have always declared myself ready to write a federal constitution in 90 days. I repeat this. I have already started working. [Vimercati] Do you also fear, as Bossi does, the great power of Berlusconi? [Miglio] Let us say that rules are needed to prevent him from getting government action mixed up with his own personal business interests. First let us say that I do not agree with the idea of assigning him the Interior Ministry pro tempore. I will tell him this when I see him. A new man is needed there. [Vimercati] For example? [Miglio] The League has already decided: [League number two] Roberto Maroni. [Vimercati] Are you not afraid of ambushes in such a delicate ministry? [Miglio] There is that danger but I think that Roberto will succeed in avoiding the pitfalls especially if our proposal is accepted. [Vimercati] Which is? [Miglio] Removing the control of the secret service from the ministry's jurisdiction. [Vimercati] Let us get back to guarantees over Berlusconi's role. What do you say about the idea of assigning the role of guarantor to somebody like [Senator] Spadolini for example? [Miglio] Heaven help us! What need is there to invent other nonsense like this? Frankly, this idea seems quite odd. I have not discussed this with anybody, but I ask myself where all this frenzied activity to find a position for Spadolini comes from. [Vimercati] Perhaps it is just to compensate him for the bad joke you played on him in the Senate? [Miglio] That was no joke, it was a solemn democratic bashing. Look, with all the friendship I have for Spadolini, the best I could wish for him would be a kind of hibernation. Yes, he should be put away in the refrigerator as my wife recently did with the kid meat. [Vimercati] A life member of the Senate like kid meat? [Miglio] What I mean is that this country can survive even without Spadolioni. And anyway, I do not like this idea of placing somebody above the prime minister. It means putting him under guardianship, preventing him from carrrying out his job in government. In short, castrating him. [Vimercati] Then how will you pare the businessman-prime minister's finger nails? [Miglio] An advanced democracy must be able to achieve this objective by laying down an institutional procedure, with objective and general limits. No single man is needed: We have already seen how the publishing guarantor failed. [Vimercati] What about yourself, professor, what role do you hope to cut out for yourself in the second republic? [Miglio] There was talk of assigning me the Institutional Reform Ministry, but I am not concerned about these matters. I restrict my action to observing, studying, suggesting. There will be a recovery, perhaps even a boom, under the Berlusconi government because those wanting to make investments will find fertile ground before them. However, this energy will be wasted if there is no new state. That is why the issue of federalism will reemerge very quickly. [Vimercati] Let us keep to the present, today is 25 April: Do you agree with the League's decision to be present? [Miglio] I have three ideas regarding the Resistance Movement: first, we have foreign armed forces to thank for the final result, not the Italians, otherwise the neofascists would have won; second, it was a batttle for individual liberty; third, as with all civil wars, it brought with it a great deal of personal revenge. [Vimercati] But what does this day mean to you personally? [Miglio] I was in the Resistance movement, but with the Catholic groups. I do not like the Left's attempts to use this anniversary as a means of political revenge. You can be anti-Fascist without being a leftist.
