The Coalition Council is to discuss these questions in detail at the beginning of next week, he said. The coalition should take stand on two proposed changes in the election law. One concerns the proposal to increase the number of candidates on each party's slate from forty to fifty to ensure a sufficient number of substitutes are available when deputies get appointed to the cabinet suspended [as received] and when the as yet non-existent law on the conflict of interests is implemented. It is well known that the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) of ex-premier Vladimir Meciar has found itself in such a situation in parliament that if the law on the conflict of interests is passed the HZDS would have fewer substitutes from Central Slovakia than necessary. "A proposal was also raised for a change in the number of constituencies. While the HZDS has one slate for the whole of Slovakia, other political parties, on the contrary, want to have more constituencies," Kovac said. According to observers, the increase or decrease in the number of constituencies could, to a certain extent, influence the outcome of early parliamentary elections to be held in Slovakia at the turn between September and October. The idea of Slovakia to be perceived as one constituency would enable the HZDS to submit one slate headed by Meciar as the most popular Slovak politician. A well-known name at the head of the slate would certainly influence many voters. On the contrary, in case of the increase of the number of constituencies (from the current four) the absence of well-known politicians such as Milan Knazko, Jozef Moravcik, and others from the HZDS might result in the HZDS' failure. According to the latest public opinion polls, the HZDS leads in the election preferences with 32 percent of supporters. The April poll showed that the HZDS in the coalition with the Slovak National Party (SNS) would receive up to 36 percent of the vote, if elections were held today. The left-oriented parties would get 18 percent, parties on the right from the center 22 percent, and Hungarian minority parties 7 percent of the vote. The current government coalition would thus retain its majority in Parliament. Nevertheless, according to the polls, one in two Slovaks are convinced that Meciar's HZDS would win the elections.
