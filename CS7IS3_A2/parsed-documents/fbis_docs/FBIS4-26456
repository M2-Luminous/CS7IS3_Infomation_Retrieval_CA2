Successfully carrying out fiscal and taxation system reform is of great significance to accelerating the establishment of a socialist market economic structure; further straightening out interest relationships among various sectors; enhancing the enthusiasm of people at various levels; simultaneously increasing revenue and stimulating economic development; and to upgrading Anhui's economic level and overall strength. To ensure the smooth progress of reform, many areas have conscientiously studied and publicized the new fiscal and taxation systems. Although they have achieved some results in this respect, we should be aware that work done thus far is entirely insufficient. Quite a number of comrades, including many leading comrades and those directly engaged in economic work, have failed to attach sufficient importance to knowledge of fiscal and taxation system reform. Instead of carefully and thoroughly studying the new fiscal and taxation systems, they only understand them in general terms, and are not clear about how to handle problems encountered in the course of implementing the new systems. Therefore, they have not taken the initiative to adapt themselves to the new situation and to switch to a new idea for economic development. This state of affairs is entirely incompatible with the new situation. Anhui is now at the critical phase of accelerating development. Whether or not we can seize the opportunity, advance by taking advantage of the situation, and keep the development momentum, depends heavily on our ability to pass the test of fiscal and taxation system reform. To Anhui, the introduction of the new fiscal and taxation systems is both a challenge and an opportunity, and is both pressure and a motive force. Through implementing the new fiscal and taxation systems, we should redirect the guiding thought for economic work at different levels to optimizing structures and improving efficiency, in order to create new conditions and a new motive force for Anhui's economic development. Meanwhile, as the factors of increased spending have risen this year, we should handle the relationship among reform, development, and stability well. This also requires that we concentrate on doing our fiscal and taxation work well. Therefore, cadres at all levels, particularly leading cadres, must enhance their understanding of the importance of thoroughly studying the new fiscal and taxation systems. They should know that this is an important matter which has a bearing on Anhui's economic development as a whole, and therefore, they should do it well. Efforts should be made, through a thorough study of the new fiscal and taxation systems, to enhance Anhui people's awareness of opportunities and competition. We should make serious efforts to tackle reform of the fiscal and taxation systems, accelerate economic development, increase revenue and reduce expenditure, and ensure that there will be a surplus in the balance between revenue and expenditure this year; thereby laying the foundation for economic development and an increase in tax revenues in the future. In strengthening the study of fiscal and taxation system reform, it is necessary to conduct investigations in all localities. Leading cadres at all levels and comrades from various relevant departments should visit various localities, trades, and enterprises to specifically study and analyze the situation to obtain first-hand information. By combining qualitative and quantitative analysis, they should get a good picture of the local situation. On the basis of investigation and study, leading cadres and comrades of various departments should actively work to meet the requirements of the new fiscal and taxation systems, further straighten out their development plans, and readjust the economic structure. In particular, they should have a clear understanding of the following points: First, they should stick to the concept of development; keep in mind the importance of increasing tax revenues and boosting economic development; vigorously cultivate new trades for expanding the economy; promote the coordinated development of first, secondary, and tertiary industries; open up new avenues of financial resources; and make economic development the reliable basis for expanding tax revenues. Second, it is necessary to enhance awareness of efficiency, firmly establish the standard -- "economic development is based on efficiency, the improvement of efficiency is based on profits and taxes, and the increase in profits and taxes can be determined from the amount of profits and taxes delivered to the state"; accelerate readjustment of the economic structure; invest limited funds and resources in industries and products which comply with state industrial policies, give quick returns, and have high added value; and pay attention to efficiency in economic development. Third, it is necessary to change the concept of supporting enterprises by relying purely on reducing taxes and transferring profits; improve the relationship between the government and enterprises; and ensure that all taxes are collected; at the same time, after localities have strengthened their financial power, they should concentrate on supporting enterprises. Fourth, it is necessary to give equal importance to broadening sources of income and reducing expenditure, and resolutely put a stop to extravagance and wastefulness. Fiscal and taxation system reform is a specialized job and involves a wide range of subjects. It will be difficult to carry out if we do not work hard. All localities and departments should, on the basis of preliminary studies, make further efforts to conduct a comprehensive and systematic study to tackle existing problems and to increase their understanding of the reform. In particular, they should thoroughly study the new situation and contradictions which have emerged in the practice of the new systems. They should avoid being satisfied with a general and conceptual understanding, and overcome the tendency to simplify matters because they are difficult to understand. Leading cadres should take the lead in engaging in studies; personally conduct investigations and studies; and seize the initiative in leading economic work. Fiscal and taxation system reform involves various sectors and the vital interests of the masses. When new policies and regulations are promulgated, the relevant departments should see to it that they are quickly implemented in grass-roots areas and enterprises. They should promptly discover and sum up the work experiences of various localities, and vigorously popularize them to promote the smooth advance of fiscal and taxation system reform.
