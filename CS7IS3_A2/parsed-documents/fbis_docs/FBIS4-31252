UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] neither wants nor has the means to implement the NATO ultimatum or UN Security Council Resolution 913. At approximately 1800 last night, one fighter of the Bosnian Army was seriously wounded in the head inside the 3-km zone. He was fired at from the direction of (?Sjenokosa). He was in a position that could have only been fired on from inside the exclusion zone. UNPROFOR is allowing the Serbs that are not carrying any arms to freely enter the suburbs of Fazlagici, (?Huljderi), and Zubcici to loot what is still left in these settlements. Some 90 Serbs came to (?Huljderi) yesterday. They looted houses and loaded everything on tractors. After that, they freely passed by the blue helmets. [passage omitted]
