It goes without saying that the buildup of the combat power of the U.S. Forces in the ROK is aimed at North Korea. Therefore, the fact that our government has agreed to improve the combat capabilities of the U.S. Forces in the ROK can be explained in two ways. First, the government has figured that it may be of use in putting psychological pressure on North Korea to once and for all come to an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency for the early settlement of the nuclear issue. Second, it is out of necessity to substantially prepare against a possible "crisis on the Korean peninsula" that may be caused when North Korea changes its system on its own. The ROK and the United States have reportedly worked out such measures from the time North Korea declared its withdrawal from the Nuclear Proliferation Treaty and the U.S.-North Korean dialogue started. It was also learned that General Gary Luck, commander of U.S. Forces in Korea, pointed out problems in deploying reinforcements dispatched from the mainland for actual combat purposes in case a war breaks out and strongly requested the deployment of Patriot missiles late last year to break the brunt of the enemy's attack. In connection with these moves, relevant government official on 27 January said "North Korea has recently shown signs of breaking the power balance on the Korean peninsula by developing Nodong-1 and -2 missiles." He added that "We think it is time to reexamine the defense system of the U.S.-ROK Combined Forces Command." Stressing that Patriot missiles are only defensive weapons, he went as far as saying that "the Patriot missiles deployed in the ROK will be for `display' unless North Korea launches Scud missiles toward the ROK." Meanwhile, some in the Foreign Ministry hold that the rapid buildup of combat power of the U.S. Forces in the ROK, including the deployment of Patriot missiles, may provide a new excuse for North Korea to assume a hard-line stance on the nuclear issue. North Korea has, in fact, urged both the ROK and the United States to suspend the Team Spirit joint military exercise--a defensive exercise--maintaining that the exercise is aimed at attacking North Korea. Therefore, this may give North Korea enough room to persist that the recent "complementary measures for defense combat capabilities" of the U.S.-ROK Combined Forces Command also pose a threat to North Korea. It is worth noticing that China expressed its position through its Foreign Ministry spokesman by commenting that "we do not approve a conduct that undermines stability and peace on the Korean peninsula." In addition, some go as far as pointing out that the recent decision on building up combat power stemmed from the U.S.' domestic problems. Their rationale is that there is no reason for the United States to strengthen the ROK-U.S. Combined Forces Command by provoking North Korea at a time when the nuclear issue seems to be finding its way out through dialogue. In other words, it may be an adroit strategy hatched by the U.S. Administration designed to eventually sell the U.S. Forces weapons to the ROK Army.
