It makes no difference whether the government is behind the events in the radio. However, if it is not, then it should be ashamed of itself, Istvan Csurka, cochairman of the Hungarian Justice and Life Party [MIEP], said in his speech. According to estimates, at the MIEP's call some 4,000-6,000 people gathered at Szabadsag Square [in Budapest] on 15 March. Csurka was welcomed with flags in national colors and Arpad stripes ["arpadsavos," neo-Nazi symbol] and banners saying "We want Hungarians in television and radio!" and "Cheers for Csucs!" In his speech, he said that since 1848, the front has been lying between Hungarianness and foreignness, and now, "foreign mercenaries have reoccupied the public." According to Csurka, the liars have preserved their positions and their goal is to "spread the Marxist-Leninist system over the people." In his view, international financial support is behind the nation-destroying attitude. "We must not be afraid now: We are the majority, we are at home, and we have greater love for the homeland," Csurka said in conclusion. The crowd cheered Csurka and Csucs for a long time, while some people shouted unprintable abuse at two young people wearing blue ribbons [symbolizing protest against radio dismissals].
