Qian Qichen made the statement at a press conference in Beijing on Wednesday [16 March]. Li Peichun has a highlight. [Begin recording] China will spend about 52 billion yuan this year on defense, about 20 percent higher than last year. But Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said this doesn't mean China is trying to make itself into a regional power. The foreign minister said in 1993 the inflation rate was 13 percent and is expected to be 10 percent this year. So actual military spending remains the same. The foreign minister said China's military budget accounts for 1.7 percent of the gross domestic product. He said China's military budget is tiny compared to other countries, such as the United States and Japan. Qian Qichen said this is proof that China is concerned about economic development and not about being a military power. The Chinese foreign minister also said he was a bit disappointed with his talks with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher in Beijing last weekend. He said: Although the talks produced some agreements on specific measures to eliminate problems caused by the human rights issue, China was ready for more substantive talks. Qian Qichen said: Beijing invited Christopher in hopes the two sides could improve bilateral ties, but the foreign minister said there were events just before Christopher's arrival which showed that the United States was not being completely sincere. The foreign minister said both governments realized that the worsening of relations will have adverse effect on their economies. Dialogues will continue until June when the Clinton administration decides whether or not to renew China's MFN [most favored nation] status. Qian Qichen said any specific plan will be made in accordance with the wishes of both governments. He said neither country should interfere in the other's internal affairs. [end recording]
