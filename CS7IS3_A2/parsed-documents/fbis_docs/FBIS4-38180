He delivered a speech in which he outlined the government program in the transitional period. Over to Nourredine Daroui from Bordj Bou Arreridj: [Daroui] In his meeting with officials and members of the public, the minister talked about the internal situation in the country in general. [Begin Cherif recording] Regrettably, we notice that the spirit of factionalism and extremism has triumphed over wisdom and clear-sightedness. All Algerians have to overcome these beliefs that are so incompatible with the national interest and the spirit of fraternity and brotherliness which has enabled us, through the centuries, to preserve our personality with all its aspects. This is the spirit which led to the uprising of November [1954] and its intrinsic significance. [end recording] [Daroui] The interior minister also talked about the importance and objectives of the transitional period in all fields within the framework of action aimed at bringing the country out of the stifling crisis it is going through. He said: [Begin Cherif recording] The world is now watching, with astonishment, our acute disagreements and our confrontations and it is interfering in our affairs by supporting parties or deviant groups. Local and then legislative elections were held and democracy was nearly wiped out because some people regard it as blasphemy, while others see it as a means to remove others. Thus, we are now going through a transitional period which we hope will take us, once and for all, out of the contradictions and conflicts and lead us toward a bright future under democracy, the democracy which respects the country's ideals. [end recording] [Daroui] Regarding the real perspectives for the future, the interior minister pointed out that the best alternative is action on the ground. [passage omitted]
