Any additional incremental expenses not specifically identified above which are subsequently identified and determined to be properly allocated to one class of shares shall not be so allocated until approved by the SEC pursuant to an amended order. 2. The directors of a Fund, including a majority of the independent directors, will approve the creation of additional classes of shares from time to time by an affirmative vote prior to the creation of any such class. The minutes of the meetings of the directors regarding the deliberations of the directors with respect to the approvals necessary to create any additional class of shares will reflect in detail the reasons for the directors' determination that the creation is in the best interests of both the Fund involved and its shareholders. 3. The initial determination of the Class Expenses that will be allocated to a particular class and any subsequent changes thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the directors of a Fund, including a majority of the directors who are not interested persons of the Fund. Any person authorized to direct the allocation and disposition of monies paid or payable by the fund to meet Class Expenses shall provide to the directors, and the directors shall review, at least quarterly, a written report of the amounts so expended and the purposes for which such expenditures were made.
