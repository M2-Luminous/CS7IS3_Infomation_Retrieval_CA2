He has also expressed concern about the hiatus in the so-called peace talks and hopes of peace! What is worth pondering in this message is the allusion to the wounds on the body of the Islamic ummah, which have resulted in discord and rifts among the Muslims. It is important to see what these wounds are and who has inflicted them. 1. Unfortunately, one of the greatest problems of the Islamic world at present is that most of the rulers of the Islamic countries are affiliated with the dominant powers of the world. This situation is further aggravated when these servile rulers prefer to obey the great powers and honor them instead of following Islam and revering the views of the majority of their own people. These subservient rulers have always obstructed any progress or action by the Muslims and one of the reasons for the people's backwardness is these rulers. This is especially conspicuous among the Arab countries, where they lack legitimacy and popularity and where the people are even deprived of the right to elect their own officials. The Saudi regime is a perfect example of such a government. 2. Another wound that has been inflicted on the body of the Islamic ummah is from those who enjoy the privilege of administering the two holy mosques. Pilgramage is an Islamic issue and should not be allowed to become a victim to international politics. Unfortunately, the administrators of the two holy mosques implement policies that have been described by the great leader in his 'Id al-Fitr sermon yesterday as "obstructing" and "creating obstacles." These policies generate the impression in the minds of the Muslims that the pilgrimage also takes place in accordance with the whims and wishes of the United States and the great powers. The Saudi regime should not prevent the Muslims from participating in the grandest conclave of the Islamic world. 3. What is the justification for the Arab countries' efforts for peace with the Zionist regime, which is basically illegitimate, just when the uprising of the true owners of Palestine is assuming wider dimensions day by day? It is extremely unpleasant for Muslims to observe that a group who claims to govern an Islamic country is seeking to give official recognition to the Israeli Government in the occupied Palestinian territories and when there is a pause in this process they become displeased. 4. Who has dictated the plot for reducing oil prices in order to disrupt the economies of the oil exporters? Why is it that the policy of oil production and export of the Islamic countries that have the largest recognized oil reserves in the Islamic world should be decided by the United States and other international powers? 5. Who are those who are suffering losses from a slump in oil prices and its thousand-percent decrease? Why is Saudi Arabia opposing the reduction of its oil production, which would result in a rise in oil prices? As the Muslims of the world can see, the wounds of the Islamic ummah are not those mentioned by King Fahd but are those that have their roots in these affiliated regimes.
