A Shanghai official source believed that Jiang Zemin's return to Shanghai, where he had risen to power, has strong symbolic significance on the eve of the fifth anniversary of the 4 June incident and the fourth anniversary of the launch of the Pudong full development project. The source said that Jiang Zemin arrived in Shanghai on 26 April (Tuesday) by special plane in the company of the CPC Central Committee General Office director Zeng Qinghong (formerly deputy secretary of the Shanghai Municipality CPC Committee, and, as such, one of Jiang Zemin's henchmen). On the previous day (Monday) he received the visiting Canadian Governor Ramon John Hnatyshyn in Beijing, the last foreign guest that he was scheduled to entertain in April. On the afternoon of the same day -- when Jiang left Beijing -- the Central Military Commission called a forum to study the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, in which the officers in charge of the six major military regions were present. Jiang Zemin, as the chairman of the military commission, did not attend the forum, which was instead presided over by Liu Huaqing, vice chairman of the military commission. A Shanghai source revealed that Jiang Zemin stayed in Xijiao Guest House in Shanghai (the guesthouse where Deng Xiaoping used to stay when he came to Shanghai to pass the Chinese New Year). Most of the time he stayed in the guest house, except for the visit he paid the other day to the Pudong new zone. Over the past few days, he held meetings in the guest house with Shanghai leaders, including Wu Bangguo, a member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and secretary of the Shanghai Municipality CPC Committee, and Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju. It is said that they touched on such topics as the solution to problems that have arisen from the Pudong development project, the way to stabilize the commodity prices in the Shanghai market, and those issues facing state-owned large and medium enterprises in reform, for example, the shortage of funds, unemployment, and decrease in income. Turmoil Is Intolerable, and Large Companies Are Being Asked To Prop Up the Market The source disclosed that Jiang Zemin had specifically stressed the issue of stability during this tour of Shanghai. As Shanghai is one of China's industrial hubs, the country's primary financial source, and a metropolis which is home to many state-owned large and medium enterprises, Jiang Zemin held that maintaining stability in Shanghai is a task "no less important than maintaining stability in Beijing." Because Shanghai managed to remain stable in 1989, the city played a crucial role in the rapid return to stability throughout the country at that time. The Shanghai authorities tacitly knew about this idea -- "stability overrides everything." So, back in March, after the people's congress session, they raised the amount of living expense allowance for retired workers. Recently the department concerned in Shanghai has been trying to convince major companies on the stock market to join forces in "propping up the market" and keep the Shanghai Stock Index above 600 points. The argument is that any turmoil which may burst out among stock investors is absolutely intolerable on the eve of the anniversary of the 4 June incident. In spite of this, the Shanghai stock market still failed to keep the index above the 600 point level yesterday, when it dropped to 592. The Shanghai informed source said that Shanghai is the place where Jiang Zemin rose to power. He was promoted to the central leadership to replace Zhao Ziyang as CPC general secretary in the middle of his term of office as secretary of the Shanghai municipality party committee. Next month will mark the fifth anniversary of Jiang Zemin's Beijing posting (he was summoned to Beijing on 16 May 1989). Now, at this sensitive moment -- the anniversary of the 4 June incident is drawing ever nearer, China's economy is facing a lot of trouble, and political development is entering a post-Deng period -- Jiang Zemin's return to Shanghai could mean to support his henchmen and to consolidate his backyard, and this can be viewed as an event of strong symbolic significance. It is said that, since both State Council Premier Li Peng and Hu Jintao, member of the Political Bureau Standing Committee in charge of party affairs, are now on missions abroad, all the major operations of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council have been taken over by Zhu Rongji, acting premier and concurrently member of the Political Bureau Standing Committee, and Liu Huaqing, vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, while Jiang Zemin is away from Beijing. Two other senior members of the Political Bureau Standing Committee, Qiao Shi, who also is the chairman of the National People's Congress Standing Committee, and Li Ruihuan, who is the chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee, seldom attend to these matters. Since Jiang Zemin is to receive Kenyan President Daniel T. Arap Moi, who will arrive in Beijing on 3 May (next Tuesday), he is expected to return to Beijing in the next few days.
