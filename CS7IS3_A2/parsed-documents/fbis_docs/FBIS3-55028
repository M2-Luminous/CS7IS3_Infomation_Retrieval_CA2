Europe Invokes Zhirinovskiy To Press Over NATO PM0501114394 Moscow IZVESTIYA in Russian 5 Jan 94 First Edition p 1 PM0501114394 Moscow IZVESTIYA Language: Russian Article Type:BFN [Vladimir Nadein report: "Eastern Europe Awaits Bill Clinton and Asks for NATO Membership"] [Text] Washington -- Eastern Europe is calling for amendments to the Partnership for Peace program. At present opposition to this is not so tough, but, as an American diplomat put it, "if the East Europeans do not believe in partnership, it loses all point." Official State Department representatives have said that all diplomatic channels are being used on both sides of the ocean to ensure that no doubts linger: If the East Europeans reject partnership, it will not be to their benefit. However, today these arguments no longer work as they did prior to the recent parliamentary elections in Russia. When the charms of gradualism are praised in Warsaw or Prague, only one word is heard in response: Zhirinovskiy. Even Boris Yeltsin's offer of security guarantees, which Russia, along with NATO, is ready to give its former Warsaw Pact allies, is viewed in Warsaw, Prague, and Budapest in the light of 50 years of inequality. The Russian president's offer is presented as the latest piece of evidence: Look, our suspicions are not without foundation, Russia still considers itself the arbiter of its former satellites' fate. Of course no serious politician is entitled to ignore the staying power of Russian imperialism, as demonstrated by the vote for Zhirinovskiy. However, U.S. officials are coming increasingly to the conclusion that "recent expressions of regret over the results of the Russian elections are being voiced by the East Europeans to create as persuasive a case as possible for eventual NATO membership." However, this stance by the U.S. Administration is coming under criticism. Both the leaders of the Czech Republic, Poland, and Hungary and the representatives of the political opposition in those countries are asking for the criteria of NATO membership to be elaborated as a matter of urgency. The opinion is spreading among observers that U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher is coming around to the standpoint actively prmoted by Czech President Vaclav Havel: Namely that, while there is no need to revise Partnership for Peace at present, the terms which will open the organization's doors to Eastern Europe should be enshrined in a document at the upcoming meeting of heads of state and government in Brussels. However, the position of Strobe Talbott, recently special envoy for former Soviet Union affairs and now second in command at the U.S. State Department, remains immutable and firm: There are no new demarcation lines in Europe. Staffers close to Talbott maintain that in deliberately exaggerating the significance of the pro-Zhirinovskiy vote the East Europeans are pursuing perfectly natural aims: Full NATO membership means belonging to the Western world, which brings with it not so much security guarantees, the need for which is highly illusory, so much as entry to Western markets and an inflow of investments. The question to which American diplomacy has not yet formulated a definitive answer for itself probably goes as follows: Is democracy in Russia capable of curbing the onslaught of imperialist, chauvinist tendencies and preventing the state being run by radicals like Zhirinovskiy?
