According to department head Peter Bihari, both the increase in consumer activity and the acceleration in demand for investment will primarily increase the import of products. The growth of exports will not be able to keep pace with imports, and thus the trade deficit could be in excess of $3 billion. The expected budget deficit of 300-350 billion forints will have a similar effect. Such a deficit will be impossible to finance on the domestic financial market; according to indications the population's inclination to save is also waning. Thus, in any case, one will have to seek credit from foreign markets, or perhaps the next government will use up a portion of the foreign currency reserves. Incidentally, it was also said at the briefing that as of 2 March Budapest Bank increased interest payments on every short-term and long-term savings account. The increase is between 2 and 3 percent, depending on the term of the account; thus, for savings accounts with a term of 1-6 months, it will pay 16-19 percent instead of the previous 14-16.5 percent.
