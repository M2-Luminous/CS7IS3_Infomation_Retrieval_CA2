Mieno's four-year term as governor of the central bank is due to expire December 16. Matsushita, 68, joined the Finance Ministry in 1950 after graduating from the University of Tokyo. He served as vice finance minister, the ministry's highest post for bureaucrats, for two years from June 1982. Matsushita became president of Taiyo Kobe Bank after leaving the ministry and has been serving as chairman of Sakura Bank since April 1990, when the bank was set up through a merger of Taiyo Kobe Bank and Mitsui Bank. The sources, however, added some senior officials of the BOJ and the Finance Ministry have strongly recommended Yoshihiko Yoshino, 63, president of the Japan Development Bank, as Mieno's successor. Yoshino was also the former vice finance minister from 1986 to 1988. Former vice finance ministers and career BOJ officials have taken turns serving as BOJ governor for the past five terms. Mieno, who entered the central bank in 1947, assumed the BOJ's highest post in 1989 after serving as vice governor. The sources also said the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) is likely to name Mitsuhide Yamaguchi, currently president of the Export-Import Bank of Japan, as its next president. They said the TSE's current president Minoru Nagaoka, who will complete his second three-year term in May, will discuss the appointment with the Finance Ministry and leaders of the securities industry early next week. After approval by TSE member companies, Yamaguchi's appointment will be formally decided at the stock exchange's general meeting May 25, they said. Yamaguchi, 66, started his career in 1951 at the Finance Ministry and served in such positions as director general of the budget bureau before becoming vice finance minister in 1984. If Yamaguchi accepts the offer at the TSE, he will be the fifth former vice finance minister in a row to serve as its president. After resigning from the ministry in 1989, he served as the head of the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund before moving on to the Ex-Im Bank as president in May 1990.
