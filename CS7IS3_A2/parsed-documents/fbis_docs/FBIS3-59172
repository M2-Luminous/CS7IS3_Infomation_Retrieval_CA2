These will be Finland's only alternatives after negotiations are concluded. It would therefore be wrong to offer voters a "don't know" choice. Obviously none of the three choices would get a majority, so that the government and parliament would have been able to interpret the results of an advisory vote any way they saw fit. The working group had floundered about in the law regarding conducting plebiscites, which provides for the possibility of vote choices that are neither for or against. Fortunately, clear heads won out in this dispute over legalities, and the working group decided the issue unconditionally: that the procedural legislation was not applicable here. And in reality, there are no other choices than yes or no regarding EU membership. Nor should there be more than two choices provided in other plebiscites. According to the most recent HELSINGIN SANOMAT-Gallup poll, the percentage of those favoring EU membership has remained steady at 41 percent. The figure for those against, however, has gone down precipitously: for January 27 percent, while as late as November it was 41 percent, and in December 43 percent. Correspondingly, the figure for the "don't know" group has grown steeply to 32 percent. A third of voters are thusly confused about membership or have not made up their mind. The outcome of negotiations and the subsequent assessment of it will affect their final position. If the negotiations are completed more rapidly than scheduled, at the latest by the end of March, the plebiscite could be held in September or October.
