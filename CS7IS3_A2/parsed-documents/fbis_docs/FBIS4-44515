In China's 15 years of reform and opening, our property rights relations have undergone a great change. In the last two years in particular, our pace of property rights reform has clearly accelerated. I. The Ownership Structure As to the proportional structure of our national GVIO and retail commodity sales, from 1978 to the end of 1992, our ratio of output value to gross value of industrial output dropped from 77.6 percent to 48.3 percent for state industrial enterprises, with this ratio for collective industrial enterprises up from 22.4 percent to 38.2 percent, and for other industrial enterprises, such as foreign-funded enterprises, individual, and private, up from zero to 13.5 percent. In retail commodity sales, the state-sector percentage dropped from 54.6 percent in 1978 to 41.3 percent by 1992, with the percentage down for the collective sector from 43.3 percent to 27.9 percent, but up for other economic components from 2.1 percent to 30.8 percent. This shows that our unitary public-ownership system has been replaced by a group-ownership structure dominated by public ownership. II. Upgrading the Shareholding System In the last two years, China has created a good public climate for shareholding-system experiments, making these two years our historical stage of the best and fastest growth for shareholding-system enterprises. By the end of 1993, China had over 10,300 experimental shareholding enterprises in all fields, with 182 joint-stock companies from more than 20 provinces and autonomous regions throughout China listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen, for an overall stock market value (for A shares) of about 400 billion yuan. In 1993, while actively issuing shares to the public and continuing to expand the supply of experimental B shares offered to foreign investors, nine of our strongest state enterprises raised capital on international money markets. In addition, the number of urban shareholding enterprises had topped 100,000 by the end of 1993. And rural shareholding-cooperative enterprises have grown rapidly in number to 2.08 million, making up 10 percent of all township enterprises in China. III. Foreign-Investment Attraction and Capital Export China has basically evolved a new order of a "three-coast" open front along the coast, the rivers, and the borders and an overall opening on all levels in the hinterland regions, steadily improving our foreign investment climate. Statistics show that 126 countries and regions have invested in China, with the largest investment from Hong Kong, and next from Taiwan and the United States. We have accumulated 167,500 foreign-funded enterprises. By the end of 1993, China had approved 174,000 foreign-invested projects, for contracted foreign investment of $217.216 billion, and an actual foreign investment of $56.912 billion. China has become the country with the largest inflow of foreign investment in the world. In the last two years, foreign-funded enterprises have begun to gradually expand from coastal zones toward inland provinces and cities and western China. China is not only the largest recipient of foreign investment, but also the largest capital exporter among developing countries. China has set up and invested in 4,497 enterprises in over 120 countries and regions, with 2,927 being trading enterprises, and 1,570 non-trade ones, for an overall Chinese investment of $5.16 billion. IV. Practicing "State Ownership but Private Operation" for Small State Enterprises In the last two years, we have conducted reform experiments mostly in the forms of leasing and leased sale, which has become a reform hotspot for our state commercial, supply and marketing cooperative, and grain systems throughout China. Provinces or prefectures, cities, and counties in northeastern, northern, western, eastern, and south-central regions are practicing "state ownership but private operation" for enterprises on a large scale, with this percentage at 60 percent for Henan, 43 percent for Hebei, 20 percent for Anhui, 35 percent for Nanjing, 60 percent for Chongqing, and 60 percent for Beijing's commercial system. This reform has achieved marked success. V. Property-Rights Transaction Markets Over 20 provinces and more than 10 cities authorized to formulate their own plans independently throughout China, such as Shanxi, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Henan, Hunan, Hubei, Fujian, Sichuan, Jiangsu, Guangdong, Changchun, Shenyang, Dalian, Wuhan, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Chengdu, Nanning, Kunming, Wuxi, and Lanzhou, have established over 120 property-rights transaction markets of varying degrees and sizes. As China's property-rights transactions have just now started, their volume is still less than 1 percent of the proper market access, far below the property-rights transaction economies of scale. Analysis estimates that our domestic assets in urgent need of turnover amount to 1 trillion yuan, with 30-40 percent in a state of inefficiency or idle. This shows that China's property-rights markets and transactions are in urgent need of breakthroughs. VI. Individual and Private Economies By the end of 1993, China's private enterprises had grown to 238,000, employing 3.726 million, with registered capital of 68.05 billion yuan, and annual tax payments (including individual industrial and commercial operations) topping 29 billion yuan. Private enterprises accounted for respectively 4.1 percent, 18.1 percent, and 7.8 percent of our national industrial output value, retail commodity sales, and industrial and commercial taxes. Our private-economy industrial structure grew steadily more rational, with the percentage of private enterprises engaged in tertiary industries at 41.9 percent, of which private S&T advisory enterprises grew fastest to number 3,871, up 220 percent from the same period in 1992. Meanwhile, individual industrial and commercial household operations have also grown quickly. By the end of 1993, they had grown to 17.67 million throughout China, with registered capital of 85.48 billion yuan, employing 29.39 million. In addition, China's private S&T enterprises have also shown much vitality. Incomplete figures show that by the end of 1993, they had topped 50,000, employing more than 800,000, with gross income from technician trade exceeding 25 billion yuan. VII. Enterprise Mergers and Bankruptcy 1. As enterprise mergers began sooner, they have made smooth progress. Data for the 1980s show that 25 provinces and cities and 13 cities authorized to formulate their own plans independently throughout China merged 6,226 enterprises with 6,906 others, for newly moved stock assets of 8.25 billion yuan, reducing losing enterprises by 4,095 and enterprise losses by 522 million yuan. In the last two years, enterprise mergers have been even more successful. By the end of 1993, the number of merged enterprises had topped 10,000, cutting down on a large group of losing enterprises, and freeing up a large amount of idle assets. 2. A number of enterprises have been eliminated through market competition and gone bankrupt according to law. From the time our "Bankruptcy Law" took effect in 1988 through the first half of 1993, 356 enterprises went into legal bankruptcy due to poor management and longstanding losses, of which 88 were state-owned, and 268 were collective and other types of enterprises. Enterprise bankruptcy is an inevitable outcome of a market economy and the laws of competition. We need to improve our dynamics in this area so that, while continuing to set up and improve our social security system, we can promote more enterprise bankruptcy according to law, and establish as quickly as possible bankruptcy mechanisms suited to modern market-economy needs. VIII. Inventorying Assets and Funds The experimental job of inventorying assets and funds throughout China began in 1992. By 1993, the experimental scope had expanded quickly to 9,401 state enterprises, with 825,000 administrative-institution units conducting assets checks. These checks began to clarify "resources," reinforcing enterprise development stamina. After revaluation, the fixed assets of the 9,401 enterprises appreciated 42 percent, or 180 billion yuan. As to the checking of administrative units, by 31 December 1992, for 824,496 state administrative-institution units throughout China at and above the town and township level (not including Shanghai Municipality, enterprises, and military institutions), overall verified assets were worth 836.479 billion yuan, up 143.623 billion yuan from their pre-check book value of 692.856 billion yuan, or 20.7 percent. Our inventorying of assets and funds in 1994 will focus mainly on experiments in converting enterprise operating forces, practicing a state-assets oversight system, and setting up a modern enterprise system, with the number of experimental enterprises kept at about 10,000, mostly large and midsize ones. This will include 1,000 enterprises experimentally practicing the state-assets oversight system, 100 experimentally setting up a modern enterprise system, and other enterprise experiments in areas, such as incorporation and shareholding. As to state-assets property-rights registration, we completed in 1992 yearly property-rights registration for 1,373 grade-1 central enterprises, registering state assets worth 891.86 billion yuan, for state capital worth 634.92 billion yuan. We conducted a yearly registration for 15,357 enterprises below grade-2 with trustee management by all sectors, registering state assets worth 120.6 billion yuan. In addition, we also counted state assets. The data for 1992 show state assets throughout China worth more than 3 trillion yuan. IX. The State-Assets Management System 1. We have actively conducted comprehensive reform experiments of our state-assets management system. To promote the separation of government administration from business management, sever the administrative subordinate relations between enterprises and the government sector, and separate the government's administrative functions from its state-assets-ownership management functions, in 1992 in Tianjin, Shenzhen, Fujian's Quanzhou, and Sichuan's Deyang we first began to set up and prepare to set up full-time government management organs for state-assets ownership, establishing first in Shenzhen and then in Quanzhou city-level state-assets management commissions. Shanghai set up in 1993 a state-assets management commission. Shenzhen and Quanzhou have also conducted experiments in giving property-rights mechanisms access to enterprises, in which experimental enterprises set up ownership representative-agency boards of directors, to practice the president responsibility system under the leadership of a board of directors. 2. We have conducted experiments in establishing investment-management and special property-management companies subordinate to the State Administration of state property sector. Data from some provinces, cities, and regions show that by the end of 1992, 36 such companies had been set up. Cities, such as Shenzhen, Beijing, and Qingdao, have also set up special state-property management companies. Qingdao has removed its No 1 Light Industry Bureau, establishing the Qingdao Yiqing Industrial Corp to specially manage its state property. This corporation is commissioned by the municipal government to manage the state-enterprise assets of the former No 1 Light Industry Bureau, having used operations, such as investment, shareholding, mergers, joint operations, compensated transfers, assets transfers, and joint and contractual joint ventures, to optimize its industrial structure and product mix, achieving assets appreciation and profit maximization. 3. We have conducted reform experiments in authorized management of state property. In April 1993, the state set eight enterprise groups as China's first batch of authorized-management experiments for state property, in which the State Administration of State Property sector uniformly authorized the enterprise groups' core enterprises to manage the state property of their closely integrated member enterprises, establishing a property-rights link between the core enterprises and their closely-integrated members, making the core enterprise the enterprise group's parent company, and the closely integrated members its subsidiaries, to achieve group management, and bring overall advantages into full play. 4. State-property evaluation organs are essentially established, with evaluation services beginning to form up. Incomplete figures since 1990 show that there are now over 1,000 evaluation organs qualified for assets evaluation and authorized at the provincial level and above, with staffs of nearly 20,000. By June 1993, over 22,000 assets evaluations had been conducted throughout China, with the evaluated assets having an original book value of 290 billion yuan, and a net book value of 230 billion yuan, which appreciated to 360 billion yuan after evaluation, for an average appreciation rate of 57 percent. X. Legal Establishment Since reform and opening, China has drawn up and put into effect a series of laws and regulations concerning property-rights system-reform. We are now preparing to draw up others, such as a state property law, a shareholding-cooperation enterprise law, a real estate law, a stock law, an auction law, and a wholly foreign-owned enterprise law.
