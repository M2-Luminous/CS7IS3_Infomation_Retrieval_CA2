Al-Bahr, who is the chairman of the board of the [Kuwait] International Investment Corporation, said in an interview with AL-HAYAH that the Kuwaiti economy is experiencing a period of fundamental change, the results of which have yet to emerge. He said that other Gulf markets were compelled to enter this phase of change before Kuwait, in the eighties when oil prices dipped substantially, prompting the Gulf countries to reorder their economic priorities and restructure their paths. He said that these economies have begun to grow, each in its own way, within the past five to eight years. The Saudi economy was able to flourish and grow strongly based on private-sector growth, the recovery of its securities and real estate market, and the renewed profitability of organizations in the Saudi market. Al-Bahr described the Saudi economy as "strong with respect to professionalism, efficiency, and direction." He said that the UAE [United Arab Emirates] economy, especially in the emirate of Dubayy, takes after the Saudi economy. He noted that Kuwait is the only country that has emerged from these circumstances without having to adapt, because its investment returns have covered the drop in its oil revenues. He suggested that the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait forced the Kuwaiti Government to spend half of its financial reserves, which has in turn compelled Kuwait to reorder its economic priorities and to reorganize. He stressed that, if oil market conditions worsen, it will become even more necessary for Kuwait to adapt and to pursue the policies adopted by the other Gulf countries. Al-Bahr described the Kuwaiti economy as "fat and overstuffed. Its problem is that it has taken a liking to excess. It needs a strict diet to shed its opulence and lethargy to become a slim, flexible economy." By doing so, he stressed, it will have adopted a sound method for adapting to the current circumstances. He believes that oil should be used more efficiently to benefit the Kuwaiti economy, that alternatives should be sought, and that sole reliance upon a single source of income should be avoided. He said, "We in Kuwait have long clamored for improving the economy and finding alternatives to oil. However, in the short term, we can improve the economic situation by improving efficiency in the economy through less use and greater output. In other words, we should use oil income minimally to yield maximum results." He believes that this "can happen easily, because we have a large economy, even though it suffers from waste and incorrect use, which is the result of many years of ease and affluence." He said, "In coming years, Kuwait will undergo the painful cure we saw in the lean years of the economies of Saudi Arabia and the UAE, but we can bear this pain." He said, "Change will bring new opportunities to the Kuwaiti market. At the same time, many traditional areas of activity will experience difficulty in adapting to change, because the process of restructuring positions will be trying. A contractor who used to serve the public sector will be forced to face stiff competition in the private sector." Al-Bahr suggested that the coming phase will bring with it the expansion and promotion of the private sector through new projects and companies, the sale of shares, and the general public's ownership of the private sector. This means that there will be a larger supply of investment assets for the capital aggregate itself, and that new assets and investment opportunities will be added to the monetary aggregate. He attributed the recent slight improvement in the Kuwaiti market to the drop in interest rates. He said, "It stimulated investment activities. In addition, with the settlement of a difficult debt problem--which involved the state's purchase of bad debts from businessmen after Kuwait was liberated from the Iraqi invasion--large corporations have begun to adapt to their new positions." He said that medium-term investment prospects in Kuwait will remain stabile or decline. However, he expressed optimism about the economic situation in the long term--provided that the economy is successful in moving beyond the current phase--with respect to attracting greater levels of Gulf and international capital by creating flexible policies and advantageous systems--e.g., the tax system--and minimizing red tape in business transactions. Al-Bahr said that the flight of domestic and Gulf capital is due to insufficient investment opportunities, not to political factors that provoke fear. He said that enough funds exist to cover good investment activities. He emphasized the importance of extricating the Kuwaiti market from its crisis of red tape and paralyzed decisionmaking, which pose a major risk to the initiation of any project. On another subject, al-Bahr said that the Islamic capital market is considered a growing market and that half of the capital in the Gulf market will flow to Islamic financial organizations within the next five to 10 years. He attributed this to the specialized nature of this market, which frees it from competition with international organizations. He said that Islamic organizations will be among the most successful international organizations in the coming years. He estimated that between $30 billion and $40 billion are invested in these organizations. He expects that this figure will reach $100 billion within the next decade.
