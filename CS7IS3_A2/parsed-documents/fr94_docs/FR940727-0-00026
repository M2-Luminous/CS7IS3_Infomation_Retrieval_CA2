FR940727-0-00026 FR940727-0-00012 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;99&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;8981; AD 94&hyph;15&hyph;10] Airworthiness Directives; Aerospatiale Model ATR 42&hyph;300 and &hyph;320 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule; request for comments. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Aerospatiale Model ATR42&hyph;300 and &hyph;320 series airplanes. This action requires an inspection to verify that the cables supplying power to the aileron trim are adequately protected and to detect any damage to these cables. This amendment also requires installation of protective sleeves on unprotected cables, and replacement of damaged cables. This amendment is prompted by reports of a short circuit of these cables due to worn protective sleeves. The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent short circuiting of the cables that supply power to the aileron trim, which could lead to loss of aileron trim control. DATES: Effective August 11, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of August 11, 1994. Comments for inclusion in the Rules Docket must be received on or before September 26, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;99&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Aerospatiale, 316 Route de Bayonne, 31060 Toulouse, Cedex 03, France. This information may be examined at the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Sam Grober, Aerospace Engineer, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056; telephone (206) 227&hyph;1187; fax (206) 227&hyph;1320. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Direction Générale de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC), which is the airworthiness authority for France, recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Aerospatiale Model ATR42&hyph;300 and &hyph;320 series airplanes. The DGAC advises that the cables that supply power to the aileron trim short-circuited on an in-service airplane. Investigation revealed that the protective sleeve on these cables was worn. Short circuiting of the cables that supply power to the aileron trim, if not corrected, could result in loss of aileron trim control. Avions de Transport Regional has issued Service Bulletin ATR42&hyph;27&hyph;0070, dated December 20, 1993, which describes procedures for visually inspecting to verify that the protective sleeve on the cables that supply power to the aileron trim adequately protect the cables, and to detect damaged cables. This service bulletin also contains instructions for replacing damaged cables with cables that have been modified in accordance with Avions de Transport Regional Service Bulletin ATR42&hyph;27&hyph;0014, Revision 2, dated December 20, 1993. This latter service bulletin describes procedures for installation of protective sleeves (Modification A0014) on cables that are not adequately protected. The DGAC classified these service bulletins as mandatory and issued French Airworthiness Directive 94&hyph;004&hyph;054(B), dated January 5, 1994, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in France. This airplane model is manufactured in France and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of §21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the DGAC has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the DGAC, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, this AD is being issued to prevent loss of aileron trim control due to a short circuit in the cables that supply power to the aileron trim. This AD requires visually inspecting to verify that the cables that supply power to the aileron trim are adequately protected, and to detect damaged cables; replacing damaged cables with cables that have been previously modified; and installing protective sleeves on unprotected cables. The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletins described previously. This AD applies only to airplanes having manufacturer's serial numbers 003 through 072. For airplanes having manufacturer's serial numbers 073 and subsequent, a glass fabric adhesive tape has been applied to the cables prior to delivery of the airplane; therefore, these airplanes are not subject to the unsafe condition addressed by this AD action. Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective in less than 30 days.
