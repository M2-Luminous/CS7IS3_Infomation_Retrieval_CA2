Because despite the seeming simplicity of the matter, it is not all that simple to divide up state property without infringing upon the interests of both the individual and the state as a whole, and without undermining the economic foundations of the society in the effort. There can be no debate that mistakes and a struggle between departmental, local and group interests are not excluded on this road. All of these "collisions" may be discerned at the Pavlodar Irtysh Joint-Stock Company (formerly a meat-packing plant) and the Pavlodarmoloko State Joint-Stock Holding Company (formerly an oblast dairy industry association). They became the first-born of denationalization in Kazakhstan. Their experience was generalized at a republic seminar. In what way is it valuable? First of all in that an attempt was undertaken to combine the interests of meat and milk producers with those of the processors of these products--the meat-packing plants and dairies. "In our joint-stock company," said Zaure Nurmukhanova, the director of the Irtysh Joint-Stock Company, "there are presently 105 sovkhozes and kolkhozes. And each month another 5-6 farms submit applications for membership." Zaure Malgazhdarovna, might they be doing this out of desperation? Who are they going to give their livestock to, and where are they going to process the meat, if your enterprise holds a monopoly? "That's not at all the way it is. There's also the Ekibastuz Meat-Packing Plant in the oblast, after all, and we don't believe that we would have any serious competition if meat packing plants and sausage-making shops were to be established in the rayons. The simple fact is that our production is well-tuned, the procedures are fully developed, and we make maximum use of raw materials and by-products of slaughtering the animals (horns, hooves, hides, internal organs, blood etc.). Naturally the profit is larger as well. The stockholders themselves control the schedule of animal deliveries and meat prices, and determine the need for production renovation. With Almaty's help we have begun construction of a new meat-packing plant, and we are currently reorganizing the presently operating one for the production of sausages and smoked meats. Together with the oblasts's banks we have established a joint-stock company for the production of lidaz and other medical preparations. We have already erected the building frame, and the heat will be turned on in the winter. Or here's another example showing that we are taking over as the masters. As you know, the price of water has gone up, which has reflected upon product cost. So we drilled a well on the territory of the packing plant. It seems like a little thing, but last year this gave us a savings of 30 million rubles, while this year it will be somewhere around 200 million. Let me say one more thing. In the beginning some of the stockholders mistrusted us, and they sent over their own observers to see if we butcher the carcasses properly and if we are not hiding any of the meat products and profit. Today there are no misunderstandings, and our partners have persuaded themselves that we are working `for the same pocket'." But isn't there a merger of interests here between the producers and processors at the expense of the customers? "Are you referring to `jacking up' the prices? This also is disadvantageous. First of all, given today's wages and the large number of poor, the demand for meat products has fallen as it is. Second, the oblast agricultural committee has worked out an average purchase price for meat. The farms at which livestock breeding is not very profitable need to think about how to surpass this price. To be honest, though, disputes often arise at meetings of the board of stockholders. Citing the high cost of fuel, equipment and electric power, farmers demand a higher price for the meat they deliver. And so I have to persuade them, and at times prove by calculation, the such demands are unfair. As an economist, I know that this approach is far afield of market methodology, but the people couldn't withstand `shock therapy'." The Pavlodarmoloko State Joint-Stock Holding Company was born out of a conflict between two variants. The former oblast dairy association was constituted of independent rayon and city dairies, but they were bound together by shared economic stimulation funds and capital investments. "This," said Vladimir Samsonov, director of the Pavlodarmoloko holding company, "allowed us to build a big plant and a whole milk substitute shop in Pavlodar, a city dairy in Ekibastuz and an ice cream shop in Aksu, and to renovate several rural enterprises. According to the first variant our structure should have remained as before, with the one difference that the milk producers were to be included as stockholders. In the second the rayon and city dairies would have separated from us completely, and then joined the holding company on a voluntary basis. I am not opposed to such independence in principle, but many of them do not have the resources even to make the priority payments, and they are putting no thought into renovation and new procedures." "Vladimir Yemelyanovich, isn't there a longing here for the old methods of leadership? "That's got nothing to do with it! I've been working in the sector for more than a decade, and no matter what we are called, no matter what structural changes we make, our task is to process milk and get it to the customer. But now we've gotten to the point were last year we had to import ice cream into the oblast all the way from Rostov! Once I said to a certain dairy director: `Can't you set up ice cream production at your dairy, you do have vacant production space after all, don't you?' To which he replied, `Excuse me, but I'm independent and I decide for myself what I'm going to do.' All right, so let there be `minor principalities,' but then let them also maintain their businesses at the proper level, and not come to me with their hands outstretched, asking me to pay their debts. Because the only thing that they are really concerned about is increasing their own wages." Vladimir Samsonov also has his own opinion about mutual relations with milk producers. Before, in the words of the holding company's director, besides the basic taxes the oblast associations commonly transferred a certain percentage of their earnings to the producers. Now as much as 51 percent of the profit goes to the farmers. And in order to increase their total deductions, they inflate the prices of the milk they deliver. As in the Irtysh Joint-Stock Company, disputes and mutual reproaches are inevitable. Samsonov is making every effort to hold back this price race, so as not to be left with unsold goods. It should not be thought in this case that Samsonov is a conservative, or that he opposes a market economy. "I'm for it," he said at the beginning of our interview, "but on a civilized basis, and in honest partnership." He and his colleagues are seeking markets and the ways of making products cheaper and of developing new procedures. Quite simply, he is deeply troubled when he sees the tested system falling into ruin with the years, and the processing sector failing to receive adequate attention and priority consideration from either legislators or the government, and how the race for independence is damaging the overall effort. But Samsonov does have his opponents as well, who are also certain that it is time to abandon gigantomania, and to follow the example of developed countries by processing milk and other products deep in the countryside, at miniplants, thus reducing high transportation costs and product losses during shipping and transloading. Such is the content of the first experience of two Pavlodar joint-stock companies. They are essentially in the first stage of privatization, in which the state is providing support to them: by owning the controlling block of stocks, by setting prices, and by adopting particular decisions. But the stockholders are displaying increasingly greater independence and initiative. A contract system and testing of engineers and technicians with the purpose of preparing a reserve of middle-level executives were introduced at that same Irtysh company at Nurmukhanova's suggestion, and a system of stimulating the workers under which the theft of meat, which was a phenomenon of epidemic proportions in former years, would decline is operating. And as Zaure Malgazhdarovna said, the workers themselves come to her and suggest particular innovations and ideas helping to increase profit. And little by little Samsonov is breaking down the psychology of rising prices, persuading people that income could also be increased by selling relatively inexpensive products--that is, by hastening money turnover. The advantages of joint-stock ownership are already making themselves evident here. But there are many questions as well. No matter how you look at it, joint-stock companies--both producers and processors--are still monopolies. They dictate prices to the purchasers of their products. And the latter are forced to take them, because there are no serious alternatives in the oblast to the joint-stock companies. On the other hand, were we to do away with them all at once, we could be left with an unworkable situation in which small producers are unable not only to fight for a place in the market but even to maintain themselves. But that is how things will turn out if the state fails to adopt a multiprofile program for the development of processing industry, and if it does not accept the responsibility of supporting small processing enterprises for some period of time. After all, given the 10 percent profitability established for processors, they will not survive in the face of the current price gap between industrial and agricultural products. Moreover a large part of the expenses of the farmers has been transferred to the republic's citizens in the form of legalized deductions from the profits of holding companies, because in purchasing the milk and meat, the citizens are the ones who create this profit. This is perhaps an item of interest for the Antimonopoly Committee. In short, things are not all that simple. Nonetheless, privatization has begun in the processing sector, and it must be brought to its logical conclusion, as was done in economically developed countries. Producers and processors have not yet become the full masters of their production operations, but they are striving for this.
