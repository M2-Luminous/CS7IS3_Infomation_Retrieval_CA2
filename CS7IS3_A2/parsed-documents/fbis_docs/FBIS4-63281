Rutskoy, speaking during a telephone interview with AFP, said he answered all of the prosecutor's questions in writing, filling two and a half pages. Rutskoy on May 9 urged the overthrow of Yeltsin during a victory day rally to mark the 49th anniversary of the end of WWII in Europe. He told his audience at the time that by the 50th anniversary celebration of the conflict's end, Yeltsin's "police state" would no longer exist. He made similar comments at another opposition rally May 12. But on Thursday he said he told prosecutors that he had meant was that the government should be changed through "constitutional means." "I did not violate the constitution which guarantees each Russian citizen the freedom of ideas and expression," he said. The prosecutor's office has questioned various other people who took part in both rallies and is to decide Friday whether to launch an official investigation. Rutskoy and several other leaders of the failed October 1993 revolt against Yeltsin were amnestied by the new legislature in February.
