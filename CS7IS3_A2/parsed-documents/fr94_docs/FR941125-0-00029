FR941125-0-00029 FR941125-0-00015 Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policy and Procedures FRA has determined that this rule is nonsignificant under Executive Order 12866 and under the Department of Transportation's Regulatory Policy and Procedures. The Regulatory Flexibility Act The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 was enacted by Congress to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily and disproportionately burdened by Government regulations. FRA certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Federalism Implications This rule does not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, FRA has determined that this rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment. Paperwork Reduction Act This rule does not change any previously approved information collection requirements.
