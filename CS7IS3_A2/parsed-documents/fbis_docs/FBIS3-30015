Immediately after the conclusion of the court session, Pham Hung, chief judge of the Supreme People's Court, convened a news conference and answered a number of questions from journalists concerning this case. Comrade Pham Hung suggested that journalists give objective and accurate coverage to this public case in the mass media. Answering a question on whether the court trial was aimed at corrupt elements, the comrade chief judge of the People's Supreme Court said: This is not a corruption trial. The case, however, has taken place at a time when our party and state are launching an anticorruption campaign that aims not only at opposing theft and bribery, but also at achieving an important goal; namely, to struggle against wrongdoing, lack of responsibility, extravagance, and failure to act in accordance with one's duties and thereby incurring losses. All of these things must also be regarded as criminal activities. Therefore, we must take action against them.
