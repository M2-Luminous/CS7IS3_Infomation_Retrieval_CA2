FR940527-2-00130 FR940527-2-00109 PACIFIC NORTHWEST ELECTRIC POWER AND CONSERVATION PLANNING COUNCIL Power Plan Amendments: Columbia River Basin Fish and Wildlife Program May 17, 1994. AGENCY: Pacific Northwest Electric Power and Conservation Planning Council (Northwest Power Planning Council). ACTION: Notice of proposed amendments to the Columbia River Basin Fish and Wildlife Program (funding for resident fish projects above Hells Canyon and Pelton Dams). SUMMARY: Pursuant to the Pacific Electric Power Planning and Conservation Act (the Northwest Power Act, 16 U.S.C. section 839, et seq.) the Pacific Northwest Electric Power and Conservation Planning Council (Council) has proposed amendments to the Columbia River Basin Fish and Wildlife Program (program) to clarify funding responsibilities for resident fish substitution projects above Hells Canyon and Pelton Dams. Copies of the proposed amendments are available and comments are solicited. BACKGROUND: The Council's fish and wildlife program calls for various parties to consult and propose funding responsibilities for resident fish substitution projects above Hells Canyon and Pelton Dams. If the parties were unable to agree, the program commits the Council to initiate rulemaking to clarify these responsibilities. The parties have submitted agreements, and the Council is initiating rulemaking based on the agreements. The proposed amendments call for: Bonneville Power Administration to fund certain projects on the Duck Valley Indian Reservation and the Fort Hall Reservation; for various parties to identify projects for funding by the Idaho Power Company and the Bureau of Reclamation; and for Bonneville and Portland General Electric Company to share funding of certain projects associated with Pelton Dam. OPPORTUNITY FOR COMMENT: The Council will receive written comment on the proposed amendments through 5 p.m. Pacific time, June 17, 1994. Comments should be clearly marked ``Resident Fish Substitution Comments,'' and submitted to the Council's Public Affairs Division, 851 SW. Sixth Avenue, suite 1100, Portland, Oregon 97204. After the close of comment, the Council may initiate further consultations, or reopen the record for further written comment before making a final decision. A final decision is expected to be made in July 1994. HEARINGS: The Council is in the process of scheduling hearings in the four Northwest states. Please call the Council's public affairs division for information on the schedule and location for hearings, and watch for further information in the Council's newsletter, Update.
