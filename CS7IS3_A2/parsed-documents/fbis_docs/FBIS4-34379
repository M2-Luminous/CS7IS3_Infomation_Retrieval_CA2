This information was released today by Gustavo Sierra, vice president of the "Carlos J. Finlay" institute, which produces the vaccines. Sierra said: "Everything will be better now because there is the idea of organizing a program for fighting the outbreaks and even for steady use of the vaccine." He added: "This order opens a new stage in the use of Cuban vaccines in Brazil, where they will be used for controlling a meningitis outbreak in Rio de Janeiro." Gustavo Sierra, who heads the National Group for Human and Animal Vaccines, said the vaccines are sold practically all over Latin America, where they are in various phases of use, medical registration, or distribution. He reported that approximately 10 million doses of vaccines have been exported so far, adding that if the vaccines are properly used in a program, they can not only control outbreaks but even the disease itself in the long term. The "Finlay" institute will advise the Brazilian state of Rio de Janeiro in a $325 million "technology transfer" project that will permit local laboratories to produce the vaccine developed by Cuban scientists for controlling meningitis. According to sources in Rio de Janeiro's Secretariat of Industry and Commerce, the state government is planning to create a mixed enterprise for selling the vaccine and for vaccinating some 5 million people under 14 before 1995.
