This was stated by Foreign Ministry Spokesman Konstandinos Bikas today in response to a question on the recent charges by Turkey against our country. It is obvious, the Foreign Ministry spokesman added, that these charges are totally unfounded because they do not contribute to the normalization of relations between the two countries. Bikas concluded that Greece desires the normalization of relations between the two countries, which depends on Turkey's stance on the Cyprus issue, the respect of our sovereign rights in the Aegean and, of course, no more unfounded charges against our country. An ASSOCIATED PRESS dispatch relayed today from Ismir said that police arrested 17 Kurdish rebels who, it said, were trained in Greece. In addition, the Turkish Coast Guard confiscated three boats with explosives and ammunition.
