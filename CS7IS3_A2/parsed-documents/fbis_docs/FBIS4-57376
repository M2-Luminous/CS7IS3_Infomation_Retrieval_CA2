A discreet police patrol was established after General Rodolfo Stange returned to work this morning. [passage omitted] By 0800 everything was ready to receive Gen.

After 0900 Carabineros issued a brief communique stating that Gen. Stange, having taken the vacations to which he is entitled by law, has resumed his activities. [Begin recording] [Carabineros Social Communications Director Major Camilo Salinas] Complying with Defense Minister Edmundo Perez Yoma's orders, within the next few days the Carabineros High Command will focus its attention on drafting a modernization plan for the institution. [end recording] Carabineros sources have said this means Gen. Stange will not delegate his command nor his decision-making role, only minor tasks such as inspection visits and ceremonies. [passage omitted] Defense Minister Perez Yoma said the government is satisfied with the solution to the Stange case. He explained that while Gen. Stange is busy studying the modernization plan, his other duties will be discharged by Gen. Fernando Cordero, the second in command. After yesterday's hectic day, which ended with a brief communique on the solution to the Stange case, the defense minister explained the scope of this agreement. [Begin recording] [Perez Yoma] I believe this agreement, to a certain degree, safeguards the interest of both parties. [Unidentified reporter] Does this merely postpone the issues for another 30 days or is the problem definitely solved? [Perez Yoma] It by no means postpones the problem. It is the solution to a determined problem and we will assess the developments day by day. [Reporter] In 30 days time will he [Stange] leave the institution definitely or will he fully resume his duties? [Perez Yoma] There is nothing definite yet on the subject and we agreed we would not discuss the problem. I think we must let things take their course, we are right on top of the problem, and the best course is to let things return to normal, let calm return, and keep in permanent contact with Gen. Stange and assess the development of events. [Reporter] This means Gen. Cordero will assume these duties in his capacity as acting director general. [Perez Yoma] Naturally, he is the second in command. [end recording]
