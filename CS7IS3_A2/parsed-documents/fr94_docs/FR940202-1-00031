FR940202-1-00031 FR940202-1-00012 HHGFAA notes that presently, non-vessel-operating common carriers (``NVOCCs'') can combine their cargo to achieve containerload rates. It perceives no reason why these arrangements between NVOCCs should not serve as a basis for negotiating service contracts without the administrative burden and expense of establishing a formal shippers' association. Allegedly, an agreement containing terms set forth in the Proposed Rule would meet the 1984 Act's definition of a shippers' association. SPI notes that there is no requirement in the 1984 Act that shippers form a separate corporate entity to operate as a shippers' association and that the Commission has not required shippers' associations to be structured in any particular manner. It views the Proposed Rule as presenting shippers with a variety of options in forming shippers' associations, which it argues would be consistent with the policies of the 1984 Act. DOJ contends that the Proposed Rule simply reflects past Commission policy, and that it is a reasonable interpretation of legislative intent that is well within the Commission's rulemaking discretion. DOJ believes that the Proposed Rule is likely to promote efficiency. It suggests that regulatory impediments may be discouraging the formation of shippers' associations, noting that only one percent of service contracts are with shippers' associations. DOJ advises that the Proposed Rule will not create substantial antitrust risks for either carriers or shippers. As for carriers, DOJ notes that their statutory antitrust immunity is determined by compliance with the terms of the 1984 Act and it would not be diminished if shippers were in violation of the law. DOJ explains that the formation and operation of a shippers' association ordinarily creates no antitrust concerns. B. Comments Supporting the Proposed Rule With Modifications As it did in its comments on the ANPR, NITL favors permitting two or more shippers to enter into a joint service contract, regardless of whether they are members of a shippers' association. It believes that the Proposed Rule will still inhibit a large number of small and medium-sized shippers from accessing joint service contracts. NITL claims that two or more shippers would be required to operate as a de facto shippers' association in order to access a service contract. NITL further suggests that the standard for ``nonprofit basis'' is unclear and may also inhibit shippers. Lastly, NITL recommends that the process for memorializing the provisions for apportioning liability and authorizing the execution of a service contract should be left to the contracting parties. AISA finds the Proposed Rule helpful in that it clarifies that ``rate negotiator'' shippers' associations are bona fide shippers' associations under the 1984 Act, and that they do not require Government review. AISA contends, however, that Proviso (2) of the Proposed Rule, which requires that shippers' association agreements indicate which parties have the authority to execute a service contract on behalf of the combination, inadvertently limits the function of a shippers' association to solely that of negotiating and executing contracts. AISA further claims that Proviso (3), which requires the agreements to indicate whether liability is apportioned among the combination members, should be eliminated. AISA is concerned that Proviso (3) will foreclose other valid options for addressing membership liability and that carriers may use it to impose unilateral membership liability contract terms on shippers' associations. Lastly, AISA suggests that the clarification of ``consolidates'' be modified to include both ``rate negotiator'' and ``full service'' shippers' associations. FASA contends that the rule should specify a written agreement, and that any such agreement should be signed prior to negotiation or execution of a service contract. FASA notes that Proviso (3) of the Proposed Rule does not require that the agreement include an apportionment method but rather indicate only whether liability is apportioned. It suggests that this may result in simple ``yes'' or ``no'' answers. FASA also believes that the phrase ``profit-making enterprise'' is misleading and should instead read ``*␣*␣* is not organized for the purpose of profit.'' Lastly, FASA asserts that NVOCCs should not be eligible to form or join shippers' associations. Import S.A. likewise believes that the requisite agreement forming a shippers' association should be in writing and concluded prior to and independent of the execution of any service contract. Import S.A. suggests that the term ``nonprofit basis'' could use some clarification. It notes that an association organized on a nonprofit basis may in fact earn a profit during a particular period. It suggests, therefore, that the words ``it simply requires that an association itself not be a profit-making enterprise'' be deleted or be amended to state ``it simply requires that the association be organized on a nonprofit basis.'' Like FASA, Import S.A. also maintains that NVOCCs should be prohibited from forming or participating in shippers' associations. C. Comments Opposing the Proposed Rule The Nine Conferences contend that the Proposed Rule expands the meaning of ``shippers' association'' beyond the plain meaning of the 1984 Act and the intent of Congress. They explain that Congress explored many ways to balance the power of ocean carriers with the interests of small and medium shippers. One approach was antitrust immunity for shippers' councils, but this was rejected by the House. Another alternative, which arose in the Senate, was the shipper joint venture. As described by the None Conferences, this would have permitted loose affiliations of shippers, without any central organization and operating on their own behalf, to obtain service contracts. The conferences suggest that this concept is very similar to that advanced by the Proposed Rule. Congress is said to have specifically rejected shipper joint ventures and replaced that proposal, in Conference Committee, with shippers' associations.
