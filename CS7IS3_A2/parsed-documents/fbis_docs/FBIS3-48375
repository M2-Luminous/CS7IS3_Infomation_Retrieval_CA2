All her subtle and powerful movements remind people of a dancing girl in her twenties. Each time they see her dancing beautiful dances with a bright smile of happiness on fascinating stages, people are caught up in a flood of thought. It is because she is the prototype of Kum-hui, a heroine of the feature film "The Fate of Kum-hui and Un-hui", which deals with the fate of twin sisters living separated, one in the North and the other in the South of Korea. Born in South Korea where people were struggling for existence day in, day out, she was abandoned by her mother who was eking out her livelihood by dancing at cabarets. The poor child was embraced in the bosom of the DPRK during the fatherland liberation war and has since led a happy life under the utmost care and guidance of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. She loved dancing from her childhood. When she was a pupil of the Manwol Primary School in Kaesong, she appeared on the stage of national school children's art festivals several times to catch the fancy of experts. Seeing her rare talent, Comrade Kim Chong-il saw to it that she was trained at the Pyongyang University of Music and Dance for ten odd years till she became a full-fledged dancer. Later, she created many successful dance pieces at such leading art troupes as the Pibada Opera Troupe, the Mansudae Art Troupe and the Korean People's Army Song and Dance Ensemble. Comrade Kim Chong-il appreciated her performances on dozens of occasions and assigned her to the title roles of masterpieces and guided her with a kind hand, saying that she left good impressions and her movements were graceful and exquisite, yet lively. She performed the solo dances "youth," "shellfish dance" and "fan dance," showing her vibrant and elegant rhythmic movements and played the title role in "azalea of the homeland," one of the four masterpieces, "spring of the secret camp" and "the bosom of the mother party" and many other women's group dances. She performed many dances in operas including the revolutionary operas "sea of blood,"" the flower girl" and "a true daughter of the party". In this course she became a well-known popular dancer and people's actress. She, a dancing instructor of the Korean People's Song and Dance Ensemble, is devoting her wisdom and energy to the creation of dance works.
