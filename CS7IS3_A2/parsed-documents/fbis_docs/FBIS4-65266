He also made it clear that the Greek Cypriot side will make no suggestions before the National Council convenes to discuss the views that will be discussed with the Greek Government. In a statement to Greek radio in London before he left for Cyprus, Kliridhis added that the UN Security Council must consider seriously UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's report and that the permanent members must begin work on the next step. Kliridhis said it is difficult to define the U.S. stance if Washington still believes there is a chance for the intercommunal talks to resolve anything, either on the substance of the issue or the confidence-building measures. The president said there are no obstacles to convening a pannational conference, and that the Greek and Cypriot Governments still have to decide on the appropriate time. He added: Maybe it would be more suitable to begin with a meeting by our National Council with the Greek Government and then expand it to a pannational conference. Commenting on a statement by Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas about the prospects of Cyprus joining the European Union, Kliridhis said Denktas is concerned because he knows that when Europe makes it clear that it will accept Cyprus regardless of whether there is a solution to the Cyprus issue, Turkey will have to decide whether it is willing to solve it or continue to be an occupation force. Discussing Turkey's stance, Kliridhis said its views are identical to those of Denktas. He added: Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller wants to create the impression that she is trying to keep her promises, but domestic problems and the Turkish Cypriot leadership are keeping her from doing so.
