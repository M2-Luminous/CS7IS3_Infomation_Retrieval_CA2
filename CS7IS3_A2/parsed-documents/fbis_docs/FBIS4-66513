A package of changes that should allow customs to fully play its role in the country's economy and simplify procedures for users.... Cognizant of the vital importance of lowering customs duties, the customs services have opted for new customs clearance procedures for users. Elimination of the compensatory tax under the new "customs code" should give the system more flexibility. That tax is, first of all, fiscal, duty based, and covers unpaid imports. In fiscal terms, the new system will eliminate the compensatory tax per se and integrate its provisions respecting certain classes of goods into the "customs code," customs tariffs, the "turnover tax" (TCA), or the excise tax code. The measure providing for integration of the compensatory tax affects tobaccos and beers. It will also affect domestic consumption duties (wines, alcoholic beverages, lubricants), surety duties on all items made of precious metals, value-added tax on certain products and merchandise not subject to specific fiscal measures, and finally customs duties. In this optic, and as a stimulus to the country's productive apparatus, a reduction of the tax burden is planned for imports of raw materials and semimanufactures, to "oxygenate" enterprises and give them the ability to safeguard resources needed for economic recovery. Along the same lines, and the better to support domestic production, a hike in customs duty rates for products made in Algeria will be effected. This modification will also include substitution of a specific tax over and above the compensatory tax for certain nonessential and luxury products to be listed in an executive decree. The move to give the regulations (customs code) greater flexibility entails elimination of all obstacles to users and makes for better harmonization with international norms, so the state is not left to bear the burden by itself. The second measure, which is customs-related, will cover updating of previous duty thresholds. Its first objective is to increase exemptions from duties and taxes on changes of residence and on nonresidents; authorized ceilings will be raised from 800,000 Algerian dinars[DA] to 1 million for students and trainees, and to DA1.5 million for other nonresident nationals. Also, the maximum value of objects in the possession of travelers that may be summarily confiscated upon discovery is increased from DA1,000 to DA30,000. These so-called trivial items consist of perishable goods and clothing articles that customs may give to hospitals and hospices. The old law basically forced travelers to appear in court for any merchandise exceeding DA1,000 in value, which created an enormous caseload for customs officials. The reduction of caseload should spare the customs service a great many headaches. The second part of this package will give customs a more powerful deterrent against unlawful capital exports and give Treasury increased powers to recapture duties. This measure would contribute to the fight against unlawful capital flight. It involves extension of the obligatory security deposit, hitherto required only for temporary importation of materials and equipment for transformation, repair, etc., and for temporary exports. This measure was needed owing to constant abuses in this domain, with users failing to live up to the terms of their declarations. Up to now people enjoyed the use of duties and taxes belonging to the state. In effect, the state was supporting "one-way inflation." In some cases, products were never repatriated; in others, materials themselves were never returned. By way of example, some trawlers whose owners had made claims for temporary reimbursement never returned to the country. In some cases, trawlers that had been granted temporary reimbursement were operating outside Algeria's territorial waters without there being any means of monitoring to stop these practices. However, this measure will not be applied universally, since enterprises of respectable financial standing will be allowed to post unsecured bond. Utilization of banking products to execute discount settlements under the new customs regime is another example of meeting the customs service's concern for increased efficiency in handling customs duties. A first new product has already been introduced. This is interest on duty credit and delayed interest. Use of this product allows the state to avoid bearing real losses due to high rates of inflation. It is an effective contribution that will help resorb inflation by having everyone contribute. In addition to eliminating unfair competition against banks and contributing to better instrumentalization of the market economy, the new procedures provide incentives for importers to move merchandise out of depot sites more quickly. With regard to disputes over vehicles seized at the border in cases where they were used for purposes of fraud, the customs administration announces it will no longer confiscate vehicles automatically, so as not to inconvenience ordinary citizens. Risks of vehicle depreciation, the cumbersomeness of bureaucratic procedures, and the desire of the customs service to spare citizens unnecessary problems were the principal motives behind revision of this statute. The third measure, as previously noted, has to do with unpaid imports. The first point relates to revision of the list of items that cannot be imported or exported. This involves only products capable of effecting the Algerian market as a whole. It was decided to give domestic enterprises the opportunity to get organized before the country makes the transition to a market economy. Also, to ensure the country has an adequate food supply, exports of food staples have been suspended. The unofficial exchange rate, notably vis-a-vis Morocco (1 dirham to 8 Algerian dirhams), is a factor that encourages outflow of foodstuffs from the country. [sentence as published] Harmonization of customs laws and regulations should help protect the domestic economy and achieve a balance between taxation and social protection. But it remains to be seen how they will work in practice.
