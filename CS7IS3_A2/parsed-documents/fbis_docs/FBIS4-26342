The directive from the Press and Publication Administration (PPA) requires its regional branches to cooperate with local Public Security organs in starting a comprehensive search for pirated books and pornographic materials. China's publishing industry is a combination of State-owned printing houses, of which there are about 300, and over 60,000 privately-run or collectively-run printing workshops and book dealers. The PPA says that the private sector of the industry is the main target of scrutiny. Unlike large-sized publishers which have licenses to print books, many small printing houses often break regulations in order to make quick profits, said Huang Xiaoxin from the PPA's distribution department. They often illegally print best-sellers, reference works and indecent materials. The PPA estimates that out of the country's 100,000 new publications each year, some 1,500 titles are pirated. The nationwide battle against illegal and indecent publications has been particularly successful in Hunan and Guangdong provinces and Beijing where printing houses and backroom printing shops have been closed down and main offenders arrested, Huang said. According to PPA investigations, Hunan has over 4,000 small printing shops. In Changsha, the provincial capital, one shop was discovered to have been distributing pornographic books. The Guoxiao Book Shop had sold over 100,000 sexually offensive books to other shops in 27 provinces and municipalities. So far, 13 of the prime culprits have been arrested by police in connection with the Guoxiao case alone, Huang said. Also in Hunan, a county printing house was closed down for illegally printing 250,000 copies of the Xinhua Dictionary, the most popular dictionary among students. When police raided the premises some 50,000 illegal copies were confiscated. All those arrested for piracy in Hunan are awaiting trial, Huang said. Meanwhile, police in Jiangsu Province have apprehended a 35-year-old book merchant for pirating over a period of several years. Lu Ping, from Northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, was found to have made profits of 3 million yuan ($345,000) from his illegal business. Lu is now awaiting trial. If found guilty he could face the death penalty, Huang added. In Guangdong Province, investigators have discovered piracy involving a novel, "Zeng Guofan," which is about the famous Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) general who put down the Heavenly Kingdom uprisings. Huang said that he expected more printing house closures and arrests as the crackdown gained momentum.
