About one-third of the public does not know whether to support or oppose the agreement between Israel and the PLO, while one-half does not believe the agreement will lead to comprehensive peace with the Arab countries. According to the poll commissioned last month from Modi'in Ezrahi, 60 percent of the public support negotiations with the PLO, which represents only a 46-percent rise since last March. The poll further shows that 78 percent are either opposed to any withdrawal or agree to a very limited withdrawal from the Golan Heights. On the other hand, 16 percent support a partial withdrawal, and only 4 percent advocate a full withdrawal. As for voting trends, the poll points to a drop in support for Labor and Meretz and a surge in the strength of Likud and Tzomet. Labor would attain 26 percent of the vote if elections were held today (compared with 35 percent in the last election), Likud would rise from 25 to 30 percent, Meretz would drop from 9.5 to 5.6 percent, and Tzomet would rise from 6.35 to 9.78 percent. As for the agreement with the PLO, the poll shows that 14 percent support it very much, 21.6 percent support it, 11 percent oppose it, and 26 percent oppose it very much. Some 27 percent said they both support and oppose the agreement.
