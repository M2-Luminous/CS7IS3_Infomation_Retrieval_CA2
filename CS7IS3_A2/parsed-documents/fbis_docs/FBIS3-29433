Approximately 300 university students in Kwangju district staged anti-U.S. demonstrations in front of the American Center in Yangnim-tong, So-ku, Kwangju City. The students denounced the United States for recently strengthening pressure on the North regarding the nuclear issue and for creating a war atmosphere on the Korean peninsula. The university students strongly urged the United States to stop pressuring the North on the nuclear inspection issue and to discontinue the Team Spirit joint military exercise. It is said that the furious students threw approximately 100 paint bombs and stones at the American Center and staged strong demonstrations. In addition, approximately 50 university students rushed to the American Center in Taegu City and staged a surprise anti-U.S. demonstration. According to the radio report, the students threw dozens of paint bombs at the American Center, while chanting the slogan: "We oppose the United States aggravating tension on the Korean peninsula." The South Korean youth and students stage very justifiable struggles to prevent the war danger developing on the Korean peninsula, to establish durable peace, and to realize the independent and peaceful reunification of the country. As everyone knows, even though half a century has passed since our country was divided, our country has not been reunified. The danger of war -- not durable peace -- has been further increased on the Korean peninsula. This is because the United States has occupied South Korea and has run wild to bring about a new war. If the United States did not bring approximately 1,000 nuclear weapons of all kinds into South Korea, the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula would not arise. If the United States did not deploy tens of thousands of aggression forces in South Korea and did not run wild to bring about a new war, the situation of our country would not be tense. Worse still, the United States has been putting pressure on us to accept nuclear inspections and has openly revealed the inner intention to conduct the Team Spirit joint military exercise -- a test nuclear war and a preliminary war to invade the North. Now the U.S. warmongers say that if the Team Spirit joint military exercise cannot be conducted, they plan to conduct another joint military exercise targeted at our Republic. They are babbling that if the joint military exercise cannot be conducted in South Korea, they will conduct it even in Hawaii. In actuality, the U.S. Forces based in Okinawa will begin a military move regarded as the conduction of the Team Spirit-94 joint military exercise. Facts show that the Team Spirit war exercise will become a reality. In spite of the strong opposition by our people and the people of the world, if the Team Spirit war exercise is conducted, the tension in our country will be extremely aggravated and the dark cloud of nuclear war will hover over our people. Furthermore, at a time when tension has been extremely aggravated due to nuclear inspection moves by the United States and the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] against us, conducting the Team Spirit war exercise is very dangerous, like playing a war gamble on an arsenal depot. If such a very dangerous thing is overlooked, the irrevocable nuclear holocaust will be imposed upon our nation. Thus, in face of the fascist suppression, South Korean youth, students, and people are staging strong struggles calling for the United States to discontinue the Team Spirit war exercise. Our nation cannot fall a victim to nuclear holocaust. Whether they are in the North, South, or overseas, the people who think about the future of the country and the nation should rise up to the just struggle to prevent and frustrate the U.S. nuclear war moves through the unity of all nations. The United States should give up the moves to conduct the Team Spirit war exercise move as claimed by the South Korean people, it should get out of South Korea immediately by withdrawing its forces, nuclear weapons, and all aggression forces from South Korea. If the United States persistently conducts the Team Spirit war exercise in spite of our people's strong opposition, it should be entirely held responsible for the consequence arising therefrom.
