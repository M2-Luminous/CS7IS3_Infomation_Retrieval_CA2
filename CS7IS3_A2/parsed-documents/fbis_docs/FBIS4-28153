To the melody of the song "Our Father, Marshal Kim Chong-il" peculiar colorful scenes spread, rendering the dancing party all the more fascinating. The KCU members sang songs and danced, renewing their oath to constantly prepare themselves for General Kim Chong-il and for the motherland, deeply cherishing the faith that they will certainly win when there is the dear leader Mr. Kim Chong-il for them.
