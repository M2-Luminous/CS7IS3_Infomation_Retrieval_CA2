Strikers who had returned to work or made known their intention to do so as of 9:00 A.M. Monday, the fifth day of the strike, numbered 5,755, or 88 percent of all 6,540 people. They included 2, 766 locomotive engineers and 1,536 assistant engineers, 69 percent, according to the Korean National Railroad (KNR). To compel the remaining strikers to take up their posts, the KNR warned that those failing to return by 10:00 A.M. Monday will be sacked. It estimates that some 900 engineers and assistant engineers will not return by the deadline. As more engineers report back to work, the KNR will increase operations of commuter trains linked with the Seoul subway to 66.9 percent of the normal level by the weekend, while normalizing cargo train runs for such important freight as containers of export and import goods, oil and cement. To fill the openings left by those who remain on strike, the KNR will utilize some 500 retired and stand-by engineers to increase passenger and cargo transportation to 90 percent of the normal level and normalize commuter train operations in the capital area by mid- July. The KNR has already decided to sack 108 strikers, including 28 members of Chongihyop, an unregistered union of locomotive engineers which led the strike, and 70 engineers who abandoned their trains or took with them engine parts when the walkout started. Some 360 servicemen assigned to the KNR during the strike will be employed as engineers and to perform other jobs after training, if they so desire after discharge from military service, the KNR said. The KNR will also cite 539 workers who refused to strike and who persuaded many strikers to return to work. In a related development, organized workers of business groups such as Hyundai and Daewoo showed no signs of initiating a walkout Monday, the day Chonnodae (the National Council of Union Representatives) set for a nationwide strike of its member unions in sympathy with railroad and subway workers. As a result, the railroad and subway strikes are not likely to develop into a nationwide stoppage at business groups. According to the Labor Ministry, some of the 26 big company unions belonging to Chonnodae have already refused to follow Chonnodae's nationwide strike plan, though organized workers of Hyundai Heavy Industries began a partial strike Monday morning.
