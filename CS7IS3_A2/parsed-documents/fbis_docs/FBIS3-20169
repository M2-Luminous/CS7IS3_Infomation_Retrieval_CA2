The European Commission and the private steel companies have reached a draft agreement on the restructuring of the European Union's (EU) steel industry, a spokesman of the European executive announced on Thursday [24 March]. The steelmakers have committed themselves to new capacity reductions of 8 million tonnes in order to reach a global reduction of 19 million tonnes in the crisis-ridden hot-rolled product sector. But they asked for a delay to agree on the practical implementation of the reductions. "There is a time problem, but no problem on the fundamental issue," the spokesman said after a dinner on Wednesday which brought together the private managers with European Industry Commissioner Martin Bangemann and Karel Van Miert, his colleague responsible for competition. The Commission has decided to ask the EU's industry ministers, who are to meet on 22 April, to extend the Community support measures accompanying the restructuring of the sector until November. In early 1994, exasperated by the refusal of the steelmakers to accept capacity reductions, it threatened to suspend the release of the planned aid, some ECU500 million, for the social part of the plan. To the great relief of the Commission, the steelmakers promised to not request help from their national governments in order to stabilize their accounts between here and November 1994. And even if the managers of British Steel stayed away from the dinner on Wednesday, the Commission emphasized that Eurofer [European Steelmakers Association], the association which gathers the steelmakers together, said it also spoke in the name of the British company. However, the global restructuring plan has yet to be completed. And, even if it is completed next autumn, after a delay of one year which is not without consequence, industry experts point out that the figure of 19 million tonnes represents the minimum necessary to achieve a durable stabilization of the sector. The Commission estimated last year, when it presented a catastrophic assessment of the sector, that hot-rolled capacity would have to be reduced by between 19 and 25 million tonnes to restore balance in the market. The private steelmakers had already committed themselves to reducing their capacity by 5 million tonnes, while the public groups agreed to do the same for 6 million tonnes in exchange for a final aid package of ECU7 billion to stabilize the companies, often before their privatization. So 8 million tonnes still have to be found, and the private steelmakers have said they are prepared to give half of that, thanks to closures in Bresciani in Italy. The rest will be obtained via mergers or specialization agreements between the steelmakers. It is a delicate operation, and the Commission has warned that it will watch to see that competition is strictly respected to avoid the formation of dominant groups in this sensitive sector.
