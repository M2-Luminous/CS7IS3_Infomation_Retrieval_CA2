They considered him the key figure in this Moscow again enveloped in a climate of conspiracies, where there is again talk about troops being on a state of alert and about coups, as there was three years ago and again last summer. But Pavel Grachev, the Russian defense minister, who received his American counterpart William Perry yesterday morning, announcing that "Moscow will be ready by the end of March to join the program of cooperation for peace put forward by NATO," displayed great confidence, made quips, and tried to play matters down. "As long as I am in charge of the Army," he said, "there will be no military dictatorship." According to the general, the real problems facing the Russian Army, heir to the Red Army, are of a different kind -- a starvation budget, allocations "entirely insufficient not only for carrying out any reform but even for ensuring Russia's security." And it is only because of this, he said, "that I will struggle." [LA REPUBBLICA] General Grachev, everyone has been talking about a coup for weeks now. And Zhirinovskiy even went as far as to suggest a date -- by the summer. What do you think? [Grachev] I have heard enough about this business of a coup. We must stop fighting, otherwise soon we will not have anything left to eat. Now is the time to build. But I understand your question. You want to know what the Army would do in the event of a coup. And I will tell you that we are impartial. The Army makes a stand, as you have seen, only if it fears the start of a civil war. It cannot permit that. But as for the rest -- protests, disorder, demonstrations, or whatever else -- never: There are other bodies that must deal with that. [LA REPUBBLICA] And yet we often hear it said that amid so much chaos, in order to avert the worst and to try to govern the transitional stage without bloodshed, the possibility of a "government of discipline," with the Army's backing, may not be such a remote one. [Grachev] I think that the military must do its job and nothing more. It seems to me that absolutely nothing good can be expected if the Army starts leading the economy or agriculture. As long as I am defense minister, there will be no military dictatorships, and we will honor the Constitution. [LA REPUBBLICA] In the corridors of Parliament there are rumors circulating that Moscow's garrisons have been on a state of alert for several days. What can you tell us in this regard? [Grachev] That it is nonsense. Around Moscow there are only two major units that can really be placed on a state of alert and used for a military operation. They are the Tamanskaya and the Kantimirovskiya. The other troops are still at the training stage. So it is very easy to check how matters stand. [LA REPUBBLICA] You said that the Army's real major problem in the present stage is an economic one, which threatens to have serious political developments. Could you explain that to us better? [Grachev] I will simply tell you that the Finance Ministry has planned an allocation for military expenditures more or less equivalent to 46-47 percent of what we are asking for. I do not want to make any threats, nor do I intend to humiliate myself by begging. At government meetings I put forward concrete figures so that it is clear where such a policy could lead us. Our budget for 1994 was corrected in an attempt to tackle, first, the social problems of 120,000 homeless officers, thousands of people without jobs. This will consume 56 percent of our resources. At the same time, we cannot reduce beyond a certain point cash expenditure on technological and military modernization. But unless the Finance Ministry yields, we will be able to purchase only 25 percent of the weapons planned, which means the collapse of the military industries and an army of unemployed men. Not to mention scientific research. It would be really unfair to level charges of excessive militarization now. We are asking for the minimum. This, because we are now very close to the threshold that cannot be crossed, from the viewpoint of the country's security and of the social problems within the Armed Forces. [LA REPUBBLICA] General Grachev, you often talk abut the need to have a smaller Army, but one composed of "professionals." However, many people accuse you of being rather slow in implementing this reform. It is as though, after an initial stage of demoralization, Russia were again thinking about a policy of domination. [Grachev] We no longer need 4-5 million men under arms now. But there is a limit that it is dangerous to exceed when you are concerned about the country's security interests and social problems. This year we made reductions of 200,000, not 400,000, as some would have liked. In general, specialists are agreed that the Russian Army must have at least 1.9 million soldiers. No more, but no less either, keeping in mind our country's special geopolitical situation. At present we have only 120,000 men bound to the Army by contract.
