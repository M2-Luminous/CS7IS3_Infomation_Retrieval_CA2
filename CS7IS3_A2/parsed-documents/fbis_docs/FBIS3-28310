FBIS3-28310 "dreas025__a94022" FBIS-EAS-94-025-A Document Type:Daily Report 7 February 1994 ANNEX Japan Draft ASDF Research Report Said Compiled OW0602225394 Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 3 Feb 94 Morning Edition p 1 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0602225394 Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] It has been revealed that the Air Self Defense Force [ASDF] has been compiling a draft research report on operation plans regarding the action of its units in the event of emergency situations. A number of ASDF officials have provided verbal evidence. Among a number of points, the report suggests that an "exclusive zone" be designated in the airspace directly above international waters and adjacent to sovereign airspace, and in the event an unidentified aircraft enters this zone, the ASDF should be permitted to take the same course of action against such aircraft as when a violation of territorial airspace occurs -- such as firing warning shots -- even if the prime minister or the director general of the Defense Agency [DA] has not yet given orders to take defensive actions. Not only have such details been left unreported to the DA director general and to the intra-agency bureaus, but they go as far as to imply revision of the current SDF law. Consequently, this is expected to arouse much controversy. The draft report which has been worked out in secrecy by the ASDF is entitled, "Operational Regulations, Part 2." ASDF uniformed officials independently compiled the draft report on such points as inadequacies under the current SDF law regarding unit operations and civil support in emergency situations when a direct military threat is imminent to Japan and the surrounding areas. The draft report expressly states in its generalizations that "this is on the precondition that revisions would be made to the SDF law." It then lists, according to the type of operation, the particulars in detail. Current legislation only authorizes action against violation of the 12-mile territorial airspace. In the particulars, the draft report includes a suggestion that in order to have enough time to prepare against surprise attacks, a certain area outside the sovereign airspace should be designated as an "exclusive zone" and treated in the same manner as if it were within sovereign airspace. The size of the "zone" itself has not been indicated. In addition, the draft report touches on the issue of building facilities for holding enemy soldiers in custody should they be captured inside the country and on the issue of procedures regarding the utilization of commercial airports and recruitment of commercial ships and other means of transport during emergency situations. Copies of the draft report are in safe-keeping at ASDF regional headquarters, as well as at the Air Defense Command Headquarters (Fuchu, Tokyo). They are being treated as "defense secrets." The DA has traditionally formulated an annual defense buildup program (nenbo) for each fiscal year on the presumption of a military assault from the outside. Regarding basic matters which can be handled within the limitations of current legislation, the ASDF has worked out, within its defense buildup programs, concrete measures in the form of "operational regulations," which are equivalent to operation plans, and these have been channeled to the ASDF's various units. For example, they include key points regarding the process of advancing fighter units all over the nation to air bases which are located close to the site of conflicts and ways to reinforce aircraft scrambling readiness. In the backdrop of work being done on compiling the draft report are concerns among uniformed defense officials who point out that under current legislation the use of weapons is prohibited before an order is issued to take defensive action, even if it has been determined that an emergency situation exists, except in cases which necessitate action for self defense or emergency evacuation. Deep- rooted concerns have been particularly voiced in the ASDF pointing out there are many problems. For example, under current legislation, ASDF pilots cannot retaliate against enemy aircraft before an order has been issued to take defensive action unless a friendly aircraft has been shot down; procedures regarding action in response to surprise air attacks need to be worked out. A senior Air Staff official stated: "I can make absolutely no comments about details regarding operational regulations since the SDF Law designates them as confidential matters." Opinion is said to be divided even in light of international laws regarding the propriety of designating "exclusive zones" in the airspace over international waters according to the level of tension during a crisis. These exclusive zones are said to be similar to "security zones" which various nations have declared for such purposes as missile firing ranges and the air zones that the British military has set up during such instances as the Falkland War. However, the draft report does not give legal grounds for its proposed designation of exclusive zones.
