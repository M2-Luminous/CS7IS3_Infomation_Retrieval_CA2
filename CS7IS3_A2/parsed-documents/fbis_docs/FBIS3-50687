The political crisis talks also will tackle the problem of a massive exodus of Haitians. It is difficult today to prevent desperate Haitians from going aboard on flimsy boats in order to reach the coasts of Florida. President Jean-Bertrand Aristide demands the departure of the military officials before the designation of a new prime minister, his new spokesman Jean-Claude Martino said. During a statement in Creole on the Voice of America, Martino recalled the obstacles faced by the government of resigning Prime Minister Robert Malval, a government which could not function. As long as those obstacles are not removed, you can appoint another thousand governments; they will not be able to function, because those who prevent them (?form) an illegal government of dictatorship that fears neither God nor man and that has no other program than to kill Haitians and to make money, Martino said. Several Haitian parties, including the National Congress of Democratic Movements, which is one of the two rival branches of Haitian socialism and which favors Father Aristide, have demanded recently the quick appointment of a new prime minister by Mr. Aristide so as to get the country out of the crisis. [passage omitted] The U.S. State Department has let it be understood that the question of governing the country will have to be resolved before tackling the refugee problem. The State Department has coldly reacted to the idea of a conference on the problem of refugees on 15 January.
