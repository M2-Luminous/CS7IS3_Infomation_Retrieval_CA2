The leader of Russia's Choice parliamentary faction spoke here on Thursday at a colloquium "the Future of Reform in Russia" organised by the Konrad Adenauer Foundation. Gaydar said special anxiety is caused by the fact that under the decision of the State Duma not only politicians involved in plots and coups but also such characters as Barkashov, Anpilov, Terekhov and their associates will be absolved of responsibility. "I do not have the slightest doubt that upon the release from custody these people will resort to their former activity and will exert every effort to destabilise the situation and unleash bloody clashes in Moscow again on May 1 and 2, 1994", Gaydar said. He believes that chances for calm democratic development in Russia decreased considerably and Russian democracy is threatened.
