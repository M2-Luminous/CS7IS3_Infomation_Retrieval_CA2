In Australia's first policy statement on the Pacific since the end of the Cold War, Mr. Bilney warns that donor countries cannot continue giving aid if Pacific island governments don't pursue high economic growth. Mr. Bilney said past policies had not worked despite large injections of aid and growth is still low, unlike comparable Caribbean economies. Mr. Bilney said the South Pacific must urgently face problems like population explosion and deforestation to avoid a nightmare vision of mass unemployment, urban slums, and lawlessness. Among the most controversial areas in Australia's policy advice is selling off indebted national airlines and filling up land, which are generally held in commune to attract foreign investment.
