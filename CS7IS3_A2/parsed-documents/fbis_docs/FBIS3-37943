Meshkov and representatives of the Union of Entrepreneurs of Crimea [SPK]. Crimean business is actively establishing closer ties with the new authorities. Actually, they looked pretty good sitting at the same table during this meeting--the president of the Republic of Crimea, Yu. Meshkov, and the president of the Union of Entrepreneurs, A. Dudko, a gifted economist and the same kind of "generator of ideas." From the first minutes of the meeting a completely friendly atmosphere was established (to be sure, after a time of tense anticipation: The president was detained), and then it was reinforced by assurances of mutual support. A. Dudko gave a short briefing to the president of the Union of Entrepreneurs, which unites 14 regional divisions and more than 2,000 enterprises with hundreds of thousands of workers and, together with the leasing collectives, it is larger than the state sector. In addition to enterprises, the SPK includes banks and funds (including the recently created imeni E. Memetov insurance fund for fighting terrorism), and social organizations, and the Crimean Institute of Economics and Business Law, which it founded. The union maintains close business contacts with a number of far- abroad countries, particularly the Bavarian Academy of Management, where Sergey Shuriga and Aleksandr Dudko defended their doctoral dissertations. At the present time, the SPK is faced with the task of reorganizing itself to meet European standards in order to gain the opportunity to conclude tariff agreements with unions of employers of Europe. Regarding the current economic situation, A. Dudko noted that the entrepreneurs were especially alarmed by Ukraine's forthcoming monetary emission of 30 trillion, which can be advantageous only to the military-industrial complex of the continental part of the state and could bring complete ruin to Crimea. It will be pointless to do planting in the spring, because the production cost of agricultural products will rise so high that it will be much less expensive to deliver them from abroad. As immediate measures the entrepreneurs asked the president to issue edicts that would make it possible to stabilize the financial situation in our republic to a certain degree. SPK members who spoke at the meeting-conference expressed ideas and proposals aimed at economic improvement of Crimea. Naturally, the first thing all of them mentioned was the urgent task of reforming the tax system. They also spoke of the need for all- around support for small and medium-sized business in the situation of practically complete collapse of industry that has developed. The entrepreneurs are prepared to suggest to the president the corresponding programs and a package of normative documents. They also discussed concrete assistance to our republic, which can be provided because of personal contacts with entrepreneurs in Russia. In particular, P. Sukholeyster, a member of the council of the League of Entrepreneurs and Cooperators of Russia, reported that there is an agreement with the Republic of Komi for the delivery of 250,000 cubic meters of timber to Crimea. An original idea was expressed by Professor N.M. Pavlenko, first vice president of the International Intergovernmental Organization of Grapes and Wine. As he sees it, flower growing could be a real Klondike for Crimea. Half of Holland's economic prosperity is based on this branch. And what do they have that Crimea does not? A warm climate, a good scientific base--the Botanical Garden--and a large airport. President Yu. Meshkov liked the idea and, incidentally, he reported that there is a preliminary agreement on the creation of the Crimea-Russia airline company, which has been backed up by the delivery of aircraft fuel. Briefly, there will be technical possibilities of showering Russia with tulips, carnations, and Crimean roses. Those in attendance were very excited over the presence of the chairman of the republic Unity trade union, Ya. Reznikov. This time he not only spoke about his pet idea of tripartism, but also mentioned that there is a unique plan of "crazy fans from Alushta" to hold the Olympic Games in Crimea. Delirium? But no Winter Olympics has ever been held with a view of the sea. It is also possible to show off with the hypothesis that the legendary Atlantis is not far from Crimea. But to consider practical things, hosting the Olympics could bring Crimea the kind of investments that would make it a center of international tourism and a flourishing health resort for all time. Of course, one is almost automatically reminded of New Vasyuki.... But sometimes absolutely improbable things happen in real life. And indeed, why not? If there were the desire and enthusiasm. At least this idea seemed to evoke enthusiasm from the president, and he has proved to us through action that the person capable of original thinking will win. Yu. Meshkov expressed his readiness to consider attentively the prospects for entrepreneurial activity proposed by the SPK and their vision of changes in the areas of economics, law, and state structures. He emphasized that the Bavarian contacts of the Union of Entrepreneurs and the proposed rate agreements were especially valuable to the republic. The president also stated that strict steps would be taken to subdue mafia structures, which are not halting their activity. Honest entrepreneurs have a right to count on reliable protection from the state.
