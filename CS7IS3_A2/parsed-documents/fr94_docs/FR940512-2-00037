FR940512-2-00037 FR940512-2-00025 [Docket No. MG88&hyph;9&hyph;007] Transwestern Pipeline Co.; Filing May 6, 1994. Take notice that on April 25, 1994, Transwestern Pipeline Company (Transwestern) filed revised procedures under Order Nos. 497 et seq. 1 Transwestern's filing is in response to Order No. 497&hyph;F which, among other things, required Transwestern to show cause why it should not be required to remove the operating employee restrictions from its Standards E and F, 18 CFR 161.3 (e) and (f) (1993). 2 Transwestern filed, under protest, revised standards of conduct procedures that remove the reference to ``operating'' from its Standards E and F. Transwestern's filing also reflects that although it occupies office space in the same building as its marketing affiliate, Transwestern personnel are no longer located on the same floor. 1 Order No. 497, 53 FR 22139 (June 14, 1988), III FERC Stats. & Regs. ¶30,920 (1988(; Order No. 497&hyph;A ( order on rehearing ), 54 FR 52781 (December 22, 1989), III FERC Stats. & Regs. 30,868 (1989); Order No. 497&hyph;B ( order extending sunset date ), 55 FR 53291 (December 28, 1990), III FERC Stats. & Regs. ¶30,908 (1990); Order No. 497&hyph;C ( order extending sunset date ), 57 FR 9 (January 2, 1992), III FERC Stats. & Regs. ¶30,934 (1991), rehearing denied, 57 FR 5815 (February 18, 1992), 58 FERC ¶61,139 (1992); Tenneco Gas v.

Standard F provides that to the extent a pipeline provides to a marketing affiliate information related to transportation of natural gas, it must provide that information contemporaneously to all potential shippers, affiliated and nonaffiliated, on its system. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rules 211 or 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 or 385.214). All such motions to intervene or protests should be filed on or before May 23, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
