Papoulias will meet Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic at 2100 today. Papoulias said his talks in Belgrade were held in a warm atmosphere. Within the framework of the new Greek initiative to avert NATO intervention in Bosnia, Papoulias held talks with Serb President Slobodan Milosevic and said that both he and Milosevic ascertained that times are difficult but there is hope that worse might be avoided. He said: This will not only benefit Europe, but the Balkans too. The foreign minister said the Greek Presidency is considering convening the EU Council of Ministers before the NATO ultimatum expires. Papoulias said the procedure to withdraw the heavy weaponry from Sarajevo is proceeding well and this is hopeful. But he noted that this is not solely the Serb side's responsibility and that the Muslims should do the same to save peace and the EU peace plan, on which the Greek side insists. Asked if Greece will exercise its veto right at NATO against the air raids, Papoulias said Greece is considering using every available means to avert extensive clashes. The foreign minister said he and Milosevic discussed the possibility of the war spreading to the south, stressing that this would be a dramatic development -- the beginning of an armed clash that would have broader European dimensions. Papoulias said no one can rule out the participation of third forces. Replying to another question, Papoulias said the Greeks in Serbia are safe. He said: They consider it their second home and there is no need to abandon it. Papoulias said citizens from other Western countries are evacuated following their countries' evaluations and decisions.
