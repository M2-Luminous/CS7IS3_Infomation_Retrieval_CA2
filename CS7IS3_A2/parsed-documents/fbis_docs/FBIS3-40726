It is hoped that this small service will be useful. Legal Council of ABRAR Article 1 Article 1. Various types of checks are: 1) A normal check is a check issued by an individual on a personal bank account, and the holder has no guarantee other than the credit of the person who has issued it. 2) A verified check is a check issued by an individual on a personal current account in the bank, and the bank verifies the payment of the funds. 3) A certified check is a check that the bank issues upon the request of a customer, and its payment is guaranteed by the bank. 4) A traveler's check is a check that is issued by a bank and is payable by the branches of that bank or an agency of that bank. Article 2. Checks issued on banks that have been or will be established in Iran in accordance with Iranian laws and also their branches abroad are considered obligatory documents, and if the holder of the check goes to the bank and does not receive the total or a part of the funds due to lack of funds or for any other reason that causes the check to be returned and not paid, he can collect the total amount or the remainder from the issuer in accordance with the laws and regulations concerning the implementation of official documents. For the issuance of an indictment, the holder of the check must submit the original check and certificate cited in Article 3 or certificate cited in Article 4 to the local Document Records Executive Office. The Documents Records Executive Office shall issue an order for implementation if the signature on the check and that of the issuer are verified to be the same by the bank. The holder of the check includes the person to whom the check has been issued, the person in whose name the check has been endorsed, and the person holding the check (in regards to the checks issued to cash) or their legal representative. Article 3. The issuer of the check must on the day of issue have the equivalent funds in the bank (in cash or usable credit) and must not remove all or any portion of the funds for which he has issued a check in some way from the bank or instruct the check not to be paid. Also, he must not issue the check in such a way that the bank refuses to honor it due to the signature not matching, crossed out items on the check, or a discrepancy in the contents of the check, and the like. If a condition is made for the payment of the check, the bank shall disregard such a condition. Article 4. Whenever the funds for a check are not paid, for any reason cited in Article 2, the bank is responsible to state clearly on a special form on which the specific information concerning the check and the identity and full address of the issuer is mentioned the reason for not paying, to sign and seal it, and to give it to the holder of the check. That sheet must contain the verified signature of the issuer with the sample of the existing signature in the bank (within the normal banking limitations). The bank shall be responsible for informing the issuer of the check by immediately sending the second copy of this sheet to the last address of the owner of that account that exists in the bank. That sheet must contain the first and last name and the full address of the holder of the check. Article 5. If the funds in the account of the issuer of the check in the bank are less than the amount of the check, upon the request of the holder of the check, the bank is obliged to pay the available amount in the account to the holder of the check, and the holder of the check, by writing the amount received on the back of the check and submitting it to the bank, shall receive a certificate including the specifications of the check and the paid amount from the bank. The above-mentioned check will be considered insufficient funds for the amount that has not been paid, and the bank certificate in this case shall be for the holder of the check a substitute for the original check. In regards to this article also, the bank is obliged to send the announcement stated in the previous article to the owner of the account. Article 6. Banks are obliged to print the first and last name of the owner of the account on every check. Article 7. Anyone who commits a violation stated in Article 3 shall be sentenced to prison from six months to two years and, according to the case, the payment of a cash fine equivalent to one-fourth of the insufficient funds at the time that the check was submitted to the bank. Article 8. Checks that in Iran are issued on banks abroad and result in affidavits of insufficient funds shall be in penal terms subject to the regulations of this law. Article 9. If the issuer of the check pays the amount of the check in cash before the date of complaint to the holder, or upon the agreement of the private complainer an arrangement is made for its payment or he makes arrangements in the bank for it to be paid, he cannot be prosecuted. In the latter case, the above-mentioned bank is obliged to block up to the amount of the check in the account of the issuer and pay it to the holder of the check as soon as he comes in and submits the check. Article 10. Anyone who issues a check with the knowledge that his account is closed, shall be regarded as having issued a bad check and shall be sentenced to the maximum punishment stated in Article 7, and the set punishment shall not be postponed. Article 11. Offenses stated in this law cannot be prosecuted without the complaint of the holder of the check, and if the holder of the check does not go to the bank within six months after the date on which the check has been issued to collect the funds from the bank or does not make a complaint within six months after the issuance of the certificate of insufficient funds, he shall no longer have the right to a legal complaint. What is meant by the holder of the check in this article is the person who submits the check for the first time to the bank. To determine who has for the first time gone to the bank to collect the funds for the check, banks are obliged to write the full and precise identity of the holder with the date on the back of the check as soon as he goes to the bank. A person to whom the check is transferred after it has returned from the bank shall not have the right to a legal complaint unless the transfer was obligatory.[.sup]1.[/] If the holder of the check wants to collect the check through another person as his representative and preserve the right to a legal complaint, and if there are insufficient funds, he must write his name and address and explain that the person is his representative on the back of the check. In this case, the bank shall issue the announcement in Articles 3 and 4 in the name of the owner of the check, and his right to a legal complaint shall be preserved. Note. Whenever after a legal complaint the complainant transfers the check to another person or transfers his rights to the check in another manner, legal prosecution shall cease. Article 12. Whenever, prior to the issuance of the final ruling, the plaintiff withdraws his complaint or the accused person pays the amount of the check and late payment in cash to the holder of the check or arranges for the payment of the check and above-mentioned damages (12 percent annually from the date that the check is submitted to the bank) or deposits it in the Justice Department Fund or Records Executive Office, the investigative authority shall issue instructions to stop the prosecution. The issuance of the stopping of prosecution in the penal court shall not prevent the court from examining and issuing a ruling regarding other damages demanded. Whenever, after the issuance of the final ruling, the complainant withdraws his complaint or the convicted person in the above-mentioned ways pays the funds for the check, late payment damages, and other damages stated in the ruling, the implementation of the ruling shall stop and the convicted person will only be obliged to pay an amount equivalent to one-third of the cash fine stated in the ruling, which shall be collected for the government upon the order of the prosecutor. Article 13. Issuance of a check as guaranteed, or providing funds for conditional, dated, or blank with a signature are prohibited. If the other party makes a complaint and the funds are not paid, the issuer shall be sentenced to a jail term of six months to two years in addition to a cash fine of 100,000 rials[Rls] to Rls10 million. Article 14. The issuer of the check or his legal representative, by stating explicitly that the check has been lost, stolen or forged or obtained through deception or violation of trust or other such crime, can instruct the bank in writing not to pay the funds designated in the check. After verifying the identity of the person making the request, the bank shall refuse to pay the funds, and if the check is presented to the bank, it shall issue and submit a certificate of nonpayment with the reason stated on it. The holder of the check may make a complaint against the person who has issued instructions for nonpayment, and if the claim that has resulted in nonpayment is proven, in addition to the punishment stated in Article 7 of this law, he shall be condemned to pay all the damages to the holder of the check. Note 1. The interested party in this article is the person in whose name the check is issued or endorsed or to whom the check has been transferred (or to whom the check made out to cash has been transferred). In a case when the interested party instructs nonpayment, the bank is obliged to keep the amount of the check in a blocked account until the examining authority has made a decision or the person who has requested it changes his mind. Note 2. The person issuing the instructions is obliged to submit his complaint to the judicial authorities after announcing it to the bank and submitting a certificate of his complaint to the bank within a maximum period of one week, otherwise, after the period has ended, the bank shall pay the funds for the check upon the request of the holder from the available funds. Article 15. The holder of the check can demand the amount of the check and his losses in the penal court that examines the case. Article 16. Examination of all penal and legal complaints and disputes concerning checks in the Prosecutor's Office and the court, up to the completion of adjudication, shall be immediate and shall takes precedence over other cases. Article 17. The existence of a check in the hands of the issuer is proof that its funds have been paid and the complainant has withdrawn his complaint, unless the contrary is proven. Article 18. If the funds for the check are not provided in the bank, the examining authority is obliged to obtain from the accused a cash bond or bank security (which is valid until the final decision). If the issuers of the check are more than one person, the prosecuting authority may divide the amount of the bond or bank security in ratio to the responsibility of each, and if that is not clear, equally among all of them. If one of the accused has paid the equivalent of the total amount of the check in bonds or bank security, appropriate security will be obtained from the other accused persons. In the instances stated in Article 14 also, according to the case, if the funds for the check are not provided in the bank, as long as no justifiable evidence and proof of the claim of the issuer of the check or the beneficiary is available, the examining authority shall collect the above-mentioned security. Also, if the accused requests time to pay the funds for the check, the examining authority may, if he finds it appropriate, grant him up to one month by receiving another appropriate security. In this case, if the accused does not pay the funds for the check within the set period, the above-mentioned security will be converted to bonds. Note. If the bond or banking security mentioned in this article is deposited, the security required from the property of the accused is not permissible. In this case, the losses of the private claimant shall be paid from the bond or the bank security. Article 19. If the check has been issued on behalf of the owner of the account, whether an actual or legal person, the issuer of the check and the owner of the account shall both be responsible for the payment of the check, and the executive order and the ruling on the losses shall be issued on the basis of the responsibility of both. In addition, the signatory of the check, according to the regulations of this law, has the legal responsibility unless he proves that failure to pay is evidenced by the action of the owner of the account or his next representative, in which case the person who has caused the failure to pay shall be legally responsible. Article 20. The civil responsibility of the endorser of a check shall continue on the basis of laws and regulations. Article 21. Banks are responsible for closing all current accounts of individuals who have issued bad checks more than once and whose prosecution has resulted in the issuance of a bill of indictment and to refuse to open another current account for them for three more years. The responsible member of the branch of any bank that does not act in accordance with the above-mentioned duty, according to each case, considering the circumstances, resources, number of times, and the offense, shall be sentenced to one of the punishments stated in Article 9 of the law of investigation of administrative violations by the Administrative Violations Investigation Committee. Note 1. The Central Bank of the Islamic Republic of Iran is responsible for keeping a record of individuals who have issued bad checks regularly and place the list of the names of these persons at the disposal of all the banks in the country for the implementation of this law. Note 2. The rules and regulations concerning the denial of the right of individuals to open a current account and the procedures to respond to the announcements of the banks shall be on the basis of bylaws that will be prepared within a period of three months by the Central Bank of the Islamic Republic and ratified by the Cabinet. Article 22. If the accused is not accessible, the last address of the accused in the bank shall be considered his last legal residence and any sort of notification shall be sent to that address, unless the accused, in the manner stated in the penal adjudication regulations, has given another address. Whenever the accused is not identified with the banking address or the address he has given or such a location does not exist, the verification of the official shall be regarded as notice of papers, and investigation shall continue without the necessity of summoning the accused through the press.
