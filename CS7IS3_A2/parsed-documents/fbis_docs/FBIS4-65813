Endowed with a Monetary Policy Council -- an independent group that defines monetary policy -- its legally defined objective is to contain inflation and to ensure that a solid currency contributes to healthy expansion. He is not sure that public opinion -- including that of those in charge politically -- fully supports this goal, but Jean-Claude Trichet hopes that it will be convinced, by the results, that monetary stability draws the economy into a virtuous circle of lasting growth, which in turn promotes new jobs. [Drancourt] I propose that the underlying theme of this interview be the relationship between money and employment. For many people, the strong franc policy of which you are the driving force and the symbol is partly the cause of unemployment. [Trichet] I know that certain people believe this in good faith. Allow me simply to recall certain facts: - in general in the world, those economies with stable currencies are also economies with low unemployment rates: western Germany, Japan, and Switzerland, to mention just a few examples. - the medium-term growth of the French economy has not suffered from the stable money strategy of the last seven and a half years, during which our currency has taken up its position as one of Europe's most stable currencies: Since 1986, annual economic growth has been 2.3 percent in Western Germany, 2.1 percent in France, 1.8 percent in Great Britain. - the French recession will have been one of the shortest of those recorded by the other major industrial countries. The real problem of the French economy is to understand why it creates fewer jobs for every one percent growth in gross domestic product than comparable industrial economies. This is a vital question which "challenges", as they say, everyone in a position of responsibility. In my opinion, we must do everything possible to enrich the "job content" of France's growth. This presupposes a whole range of structural reforms, none of which is easy to design and to translate into hard facts. Coming to monetary policy itself, my own conviction, shared by those responsible for the currencies of the major countries, is that there is no contradiction, but rather complementarity, between a monetary strategy of stability and credibility and our ability to obtain for our economy the best possible means of financing with which to promote growth and job creation. For a given currency, market interest rates, which are defined in the last analysis by national and international investors, depend on the judgment by these people of the long-term value of the currency. If a country's currency is "credible," investors accept lower market rates. Nowadays this is clearly visible: The ranking of currencies according to the greater "resistance" to the rise in long-term U.S. rates coincides with their "credibility" ranking. [Drancourt] In his recent book "Les Infortunes de la Prosperite" [The Misfortunes of Prosperity], Daniel Cohen, a professor at the Ecole Normale Superieure, evokes good old Keynes. To end the crisis of his time, he recommended the "euthanasia" of modest income which represented 30 percent of domestic product prior to 1914. A transfer took place in the form of social protection. This would not have been possible without monetary erosion. The author suggests attacking today's retired people, by sacrificing monetary solidity, in order to give work to the working generation. What do you think of this approach? [Trichet] One must examine what it means to be part of a world economy in which modern economies are closely interlinked and observe that a country like France is not able on its own to change the shape of this economy. In the 1970's and 1980's, a vast world market was created. Almost every country, including the former Soviet Union, adhered to its operating rules. In this vast market, obtaining the best possible interest rates demands a currency with maximum possible credibility. For this reason I do not know any central bank manager who would sing the praises of monetary erosion. As to the question of whether, in the West in general and in Europe in particular, achieving a balance between the working and retired populations and between young and old is being done well, that is another matter. No doubt we have to concern ourselves with our demographic development, which is ineluctably increasing the proportion of the non-working population, and to draw the necessary consequences. But I do not believe that these questions are directly linked to monetary policy. [Drancourt] Without reverting to the Bible, which recommends that debts be wiped out every 50 years, one notes a nostalgia for monetary instability among certain entrepreneurs and other social categories. Indeed, in their mind, this is one way of questioning acquired positions, the establishment, and promoting innovation. [Trichet] In the long term, one sees clearly that countries like Germany, Switzerland and Japan, for example, who have opted for a policy of monetary stability, have had no cause to repent. Good monetary management has promoted the progress of their economies and their standard of living. Small- and medium-sized businesses are strong in these countries. Enterprise creation is active. And Japan is not the last when it comes to innovation. Finally I observe that the feeling which the Bank of France gains from its very many contacts with small, medium and large-sized enterprises (we question 12,000 of them every month) is that the interest of the economy and of business in having a solid monetary base is very widely understood by those in charge of the economy. [Drancourt] A strong currency forces companies, so to speak, to "find their way out through the top." However, for a long time, in France, some counted on the easy way out. Today they are suffering competition from low-salary economies. If one is in the category of enterprises which count on inflation to get them out of difficulties, one can always find an Asian country which is cheaper. But it will take time for every company to move into the higher category. Those who are not yet that far blame the strong currency and its supporters for their difficulties and those which result for employment in particular. [Trichet] Yes, I believe that one can say this: once the currency is stable, fleeing forward is not a paying proposition. If inflation can make things easier in the short term, the bill becomes heavy when the time comes to put one's house in order. When France used to give in to the temptation of inflation, it then had to pick up the inevitable costs of regaining control. This is what used to be known as the "cooling down plan." The advantage which it thought it had gained was quickly lost. Lax monetary policy can be like a drug. It procures satisfaction, but this is short-lived. Then you have to pay the bill. I notice that those countries which have not ceded to this temptation have, ultimately, done better. In any event, I would remind you that the Bank of France's Monetary Policy Council is bound by law to watch over price stability. [Drancourt] Does not a country with an aging population need ultimately to be able to invest capital which secures long-term earnings, which is one way of guaranteeing its future resources? [Trichet] Allow me to pose the question differently, without reference to population data. In an economy based on international trade, a country like France, with strong industrial traditions, needs to take global positions in a whole series of activities and industries. It has to be in a position to invest large amounts, in particular abroad, something which, moreover, we have been doing for a number of years: We were the second largest international industrial investor in 1992. To carry out such a policy, it is better to have a stable currency with a strong global purchasing power. [Drancourt] From now on the Bank of France is autonomous. What does this mean in terms of responsibility? [Trichet] Under the law we have a clear responsibility. The Monetary Policy Council defines our country's monetary policy with the concern to ensure price stability. It may not receive or solicit instructions from anyone. Public opinion, it seems to me, does not question this independence, in particular as the Monetary Policy Council consists of a woman and men with recognized competence and with rich and varied experience. [Drancourt] But there are nonetheless people who do not accept the Bank's independence, saying that this does not permit the necessary adaptation. [Trichet] The Bank's independence is, indeed, something new in France. Like any new institution, it needs to take its place in the institutional landscape of our country, as is the case in Switzerland, the United States or the Netherlands, for example, not to mention Germany. But independence does not in any way mean that the Bank of France is outside the field of democracy. The law itself scrupulously organizes the Monetary Policy Council's relations with the government and the Bank of France's relations with the president of the Republic and with parliament. With regard to the latter, the law states that the National Assembly's Finance Committee can ask at any time to hear the governor. And the governor can ask at any time to be heard by the Finance Committee. This is a very strong link, as you can see. Finally, in any democracy, any institution -- whatever it may be -- must constantly listen, meditate, decide, explain and, if possible, convince. This is what the Monetary Policy Council is determined to do. And it is what we are all doing together, methodically, not only in Paris but in every region of France. [Drancourt] You are, in a way, the ringmaster. Monetary policy which has been set presupposes, for example, that public deficits do not increase and that public companies are better managed. [Trichet] All Europeans, with the exception of Luxembourg, are currently having serious problems with the management of public finances. And I say: all European members of the European Union [EU], whatever their monetary policies. This is why 11 European governments have begun "convergence programs" aimed at regaining control of public deficits. Last November [Economics Minister] Alphandery presented a convergence plan at the same time as the German Government. The budget minister in turn presented a five-year bill relating to the state budget which was voted last January. In the letter I sent, as required by law, to the president of the Republic and to parliament, I indicated that I was very pleased at the commitments made by the French Government and that it was naturally important that they be respected. [Drancourt] You mention the Maastricht Treaty. Part of public opinion seems to believe that it is not applicable and even seems to have forgotten it. [Trichet] The central banks are not there to make laws but to apply them. The Maastricht Treaty has been signed, ratified, and constitutionally approved by the 12 countries of the EU. It is the law of these countries. If one day the Treaty is amended, we will apply the amended Treaty. But today my European colleagues and I are naturally responsible for applying the Treaty, and that is what we are doing, all together, within the European Monetary Institute presided over by Mr. Lamfalussy, with its offices in Frankfurt, and whose director general is Mr. Raymond, a Frenchman. [Drancourt] Despite this, we see countries like Great Britain and Italy carrying out their own foreign exchange policies. Either one wants Europe and one follows the rules. Or one does not follow the rules and does not want Europe. While waiting for Maastricht to be implemented, how does one correct the risks of unfair competition? [Trichet] I believe, like you, that one cannot at one and the same time construct a single market and even a simple common market and neglect the question of monetary organization. The risk indeed would be that of the erratic handling of exchange policy creating new and invisible barriers, in contradiction to the idea of the elimination of all borders. The founders of the Treaty of Rome got it right when they said that foreign exchange questions were questions of common interest. And yet at the time of the signature of the Treaty of Rome, all currencies were bound by the very strict "Bretton Woods" exchange system. In Europe I remind you that nine economies out of 12 are part of the Exchange Rate Mechanism, which is managed jointly by the "12." Finally, I am struck to see that the North American countries has just given themselves an embryonic monetary organization to accompany the single market which is being created between the United States, Mexico, and Canada. There is no better illustration of the pertinence of the European approach. [Drancourt] Some politicians, if they carry their logic to the extreme, recommend that France leave the European accords on monetary matters. What would happen in this case? [Trichet] This is a question which, as you know, has to be answered by the government. It is Mr. Alphandery whom you should pose the question to. Everyone knows what his convictions are in this area! [Drancourt] We are going through a deflationary period. Would it be wrong in these conditions to increase money supply? [Trichet] Allow me me to offer two comments, the first about the "deflationary period," the second about the "economic situation" and the Monetary Policy Council's strategy. First of all I should emphasize that for several months now the Bank of France has been observing that the narrow monetary aggregates--known as "M1" and "M2"' in our jargon--are proving much more dynamic. During the past seven months, they have grown at an average annual rate of seven percent. Here we have a clear sign of monetary dynamism accompanying and supporting the movement of recovery which has been under way since November 1993. We are not at all in a "deflationary" situation. Secondly, I notice that everyone today agrees to say that the economy is moving again: the experts, the European institutions, even industrialists. The Bank of France is very glad about this recovery, which it was the first to observe through its monthly survey of almost 12,000 business leaders. Let us remember that the Monetary Policy Council had clearly indicated, from the time it was established, that it placed France's monetary policy within the context of sustained medium-term growth of the order of 3 percent a year. At the time -- this was at the end of January -- the return to growth seemed a long way off and our forecasts somewhat fanciful. Today we have got there and I am convinced that our monetary policy had more than a little hand in this! [Drancourt] As long as interest rates were higher than growth rates, companies had an interest in "putting their money on the markets" and reducing their debt rather than investing. Has the time come for reinvestment? [Trichet] The period of "deceleration" of investment appears to be behind us, and it seems that we are now, fortunately enough, coming into a period of renewed investment. That is what INSEE [National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies] is telling us. Everything is pushing in this direction. First of all the fact that industries in the manufacturing sector have a self-financing rate of, on average, well above 100 percent. This means that they are able to invest more. Secondly, the fact that order books have filled up again, in particular with orders from abroad and orders due to stock movements, and that industrial capacity utilization is rising. The very sizeable fall in short-term interest rates is also naturally acting in favor of manufacturing investment. Today, the three-month rates are at around 5.5 percent instead of 12 percent more than a year ago. Finally the fact that our long-term interest rates are able -- despite pressure from the United States -- to remain at a relatively low level close to the best rates seen in Europe and, when possible, below U.S. rates, is a further advantage for investment in France.
