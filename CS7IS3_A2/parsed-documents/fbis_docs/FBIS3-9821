Their talks focused on the further improvement of the already successful and friendly cooperation between the two countries, both in the bilateral and international fields. They paid particular attention to some aspects of economic cooperation. Speaking about the Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis, President Lilic expressed the hope that we are not far from peace, which he said was a condition for stability in the entire region. President Lilic stressed that the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] has nothing against the Muslim-Croat federation, provided that it is not to the detriment of the Serb side; he also said there would be neither a solution nor peace in this former Yugoslav republic without an equitable agreement reached between all three sides and the observance of the right of each of the nations to self-determination. As regards the FRY, it will continue to strive in a persistent, active, and constructive way toward reaching a permanent and just resolution of the crisis on the territory of former Yugoslavia, as it has done since the very outset of the crisis, President Lilic concluded.
