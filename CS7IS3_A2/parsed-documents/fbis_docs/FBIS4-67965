The 300,000 kilowatt Cashma is modeled after the Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant in coastal Zhejiang Province, which was designed and built entirely by China itself. It is the first nuclear power plant China has ever exported to a foreign country. The contract obliged CNNC to provide training in basic theories to Pakistani engineers and technicians to ensure Cashma's safe operation and maintenance. The trainees are to receive on-job training at Qinshan at the end of the course. According to CNNC officials, some 62 Chinese scientists were organized to prepare a set of 17 textbooks in 14 subjects for the training course, which were examined and approved by the China Institute of Atomic Energy, the National Nuclear Safety Administration and the prestigious Qinghua University. The textbooks were accepted by the Pakistani side, the officials said.
