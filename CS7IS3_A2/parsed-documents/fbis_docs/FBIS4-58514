FBIS4-58514 "drnes087_m_94004" FBIS-NES-94-087 Daily Report 3 May 1994 JORDAN Israeli-Palestinian Economic Agreement Criticized Israeli-Palestinian Economic Agreement Criticized Called `Abrogation' of PLO-Jordan Accord JN0305135294 Amman AL-RA'Y in Arabic 3 May 94 p 26 JN0305135294 Amman AL-RA'Y Arabic BFN ["Headlines" column by Fahd al-Fanik: "Israeli-Palestinian Customs Union"] [Text] The economic agreement between Israel and the PLO signed in Paris on 29 April falls short of the minimum requirements of the economic cooperation accord between Jordan and the PLO. The PLO-Israeli agreement amounts to a unilateral abrogation of the one concluded between Jordan and the PLO. We may have to await the publication of the full texts and annexes of the Paris agreement, which are said to be lengthy and detailed. The salient points as reported by AFP, however, are sufficient to understand the drift of the agreement. For some reason or other, the Jordanian Government wants to assess the agreement in a different light. It may be that it does not want to strain relations with the PLO or the sponsors of the agreement. Or it may be that the Jordanian Government does not want to disrupt the peace process or interfere in the Palestinian decisionmaking process, even if it is at the expense of Jordanian interests. The Jordanian-Palestinian economic cooperation agreement signed in Amman on 7 January 1994 provides for the Jordanian dinar to be in circulation in the West Bank and Gaza, along with other Arab and foreign currencies. The Paris agreement expressly states the shekel will be legal tender, among other currencies. The Jordanian-Palestinian agreement grants Jordan's Central Bank the right to oversee the banking and monetary systems in the West Bank and Gaza during the transition period. The Israeli-Palestinian agreement sanctions the institution of a local monetary agency to fulfill that role. However, the proposed Palestinian monetary agency will be controlled by the Israeli monetary agency. The Jordanian-Palestinian agreement envisages increased trade between Jordan and Palestine. Under the Paris agreement, there will be a joint customs authority on the West Bank's border with Jordan and Gaza's border with Egypt, meaning a customs union administered by Israel and incorporating the West Bank and Gaza. As a consequence, the Palestinian market will continue to be captive to Israeli products, and the Palestinian consumers and investors will continue to be exploited by Israel as they are now under occupation. The only difference will be that, instead of the exploitation taking place under the coercion of occupation, it will now take place with the blessing of the Palestinian side. As for some Jordanian products being allowed onto the Palestinian market, this will be conditional on prior Israeli approval. Furthermore, only a limited number, with a maximum of $15 million worth, of unimportant Jordanian goods that Israel does not produce will be allowed in annually. In a nutshell, the Paris economic agreement sacrifices Jordanian and Palestinian interests and confirms the West Bank and Gaza as adjuncts to the Israeli economy, thus detaching the Palestinian economy from the Jordanian economy. It is a unilaterally submissive agreement.
