An ITAR-TASS correspondent was told by a high-ranking official in the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry that an understanding to this effect was reached at a sitting of the CIS Council of Foreign Ministers, which ended here today. It was attended by the heads of the Foreign Ministries of Russia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, and Tajikistan, and by ambassadors and deputy ministers from seven other Commonwealth countries. According to the Russian diplomat, the leaders of the foreign policy departments considered "a huge agenda." The sittings of the Council passed off "on the whole in a constructive spirit," and the discussions enabled a step forward to be taken in the discussion of important issues, although final decisions on many of them have yet to be taken. Thus, experts have been instructed to put the finishing touches to a draft declaration on observance of the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and inviolability of the borders of the Commonwealth states. The high-ranking diplomat described a group of problems connected with the sharing out of non-military marine vessels of the former USSR with the states of the CIS and the Baltic area as "a difficult question" that "will be looked at again." Those attending the sitting confined themselves to deciding to set up a group of experts. Cognizance was taken of a paper from the Council of Border Troop Commanders about the progress of the talks between the Russian Federation, Central Asian, and Transcaucasian states on cooperation on guarding the borders with third countries. Those attending the forum decided to uphold the idea of creating within the CIS a permanent consultative commission for peacekeeping activities. The sitting also discussed matters connected with NATO's "Partnership for Peace" program. Permanent consultations between the Foreign Ministries on the participation of the CIS states in implementing it will now come into being. The prospects for CIS-CSCE cooperation were examined. A proposal put forward by Kazakhstan to hold a special session of the UN General Assembly on problems of the post-confrontation period "was, on the whole, supported". It was decided, however, to continue the discussion. Russia, Belarus, and the Ukraine were instructed to prepare the text of a joint message from the CIS countries to the peoples of the Commonwealth and the world community in connection with the 50th anniversary of victory in the Great Patriotic War. The timing of the next sitting of the Foreign Ministers' Council was determined. It will take place in June on the eve of the next Council of Heads of State. A joint sitting of the CIS Council of Foreign Ministers and the Council of Defense Ministers of the states participating in the Treaty on Collective Security was held in the afternoon. It considered a package of documents regulating the activities of the Collective Security Council and its secretariat, which were set up in December last year. Further work on these documents is required before they are submitted at the next sitting of the Council of Heads of State. They must be adopted in order to set in motion the mechanism that has been created. Another question that the Foreign and Defense Ministers examined concerned a protocol to the Treaty on Collective Security. The point is that two countries, Russia and Azerbaijan, have proposed amendments to the document. In the course of discussion, the ministers concluded that it was not a good idea to modify the actual text of the treaty, but that the changes that life prompted could be expressed in a declaration. A decision to draw up such a declaration was adopted. Consideration was given to a number of possible measures to boost the effectiveness of the functioning of the collective peacekeeping forces in the Republic of Tajikistan and to stabilize the situation on the Tajik-Afghan border.
