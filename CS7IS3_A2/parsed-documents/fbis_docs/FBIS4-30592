Pak Chol-on was found guilty of taking bribes by the Supreme Court Tuesday, resulting in the loss of his National Assembly seat. The highest court dismissed an appeal lodged by Pak, a lawmaker from the United People's Party convicted earlier of bribery and sentenced to one and a half years in prison and fined 600 million won (about 743,500 U.S. dollars) at an appellate court on March 14. Pak, once called the "crown prince" during the days of the No Tae-u government, was arrested in May last year on charges of taking bribes totaling 600 million won in three installments from the country's slot-machine kingpins -- brothers Chong Tok-chin and Chong Tok-il -- in October and November 1990. With the Supreme Court's decision, Pak also lost the right to run for parliament or other public office for five years from this November when his prison term ends. This means he cannot run in the 15th general election slated for the first half of 1996 and signals the likely end of his political career. His application for bail was automatically rejected. A by-election to replace him will be held within 90 days in the Susong-A electoral district of Taegu City.
