Due to a technical problem several minutes of this broadcast were lost at the beginning. Borys Oliynyk asks Oleksandr Moroz to explain his economic program. Moroz replies: "With regard to the economy, when there will be normal authority and when this authority adopts a strategy of economic reforms that will be accepted by the people, then society may be consolidated and these problems may be resolved. In the last few days I worked with a group of scientists on such a strategy. It is called the basic directions of establishing a national economy of Ukraine. The main point is to make the economy work in the interests of the working individual--an honest individual who earns a living with his labor and his intellect. People understand that it is impossible to live like this because it is not fair." Moroz goes on to expound on his economic program. He says these were stabilizing the money system, changing the credit policy in order to protect the producer, changing the country's import and export policies, and reforming the banking system. "It is important that relations between the state and the producer are fair and they should be built on economic laws so that the individual has the possibility of realizing his work, intellectual, and other potentials," adds Moroz. He goes on to say that the economy should be based on a "state regulated market." He criticized the present system which, he said, some people called reforms but really meant that Ukrainian goods were being sold abroad for pennies. One result of this was that hard currency was being stored abroad and this was a crime that should be stopped. He also criticizes the shortage of books in schools and advocated supporting Ukrainian culture and education through raising the profile of the intelligentsia. Borys Oliynyk then asks Moroz to comment on the rising level of unemployment and organized crime. Moroz replies: "Much has to be done in order to bring order to the state. You were right in saying that one of the biggest concerns for people's honor was the turmoil, uncertainty, and even fear." He adds that in order to fight organized crime it is necessary to make use of the security service and some military formations, as well as the internal affairs bodies. By way of conclusion, Oleksandr Moroz says that Ukraine should be a powerful state in the world community and that he would like the people of Ukraine to build a state with a society that was in a process of progressive development.
