In June, 1991, the Academy of Nuclear Power centralized the opinions of experts to develop China's nuclear power industry and sent a written report to General Secretary Jiang Zemin. On 15 June 1991, General Secretary Jiang made important comments regarding acceleration of China's nuclear power base area construction. According to the general secretary's comments, under the concern and support of the State Planning Commission, National Defense Science, Technology, and Industry Commission, Sichuan Provincial CPC Committee, Sichuan Provincial Government, and China Nuclear Industry Corporation during the past two years, the Academy of Nuclear Power organized the relevant experts to speed up the preliminary design for this project. The Second Academy of Nuclear Industry also gave great support in the preliminary design. On 29 April 1993, Chengdu City and the Chengdu High and New-Tech Industry Development Zone Management Committee organized relevant experts to conduct a preview of the preliminary design. The experts feel that the external conditions for construction of this project have been basically implemented, the design conforms to the state's environmental protection stipulations, and the operational safety and fire-fighting designs were rational. The new reactor experimental base area is tracking the world's advanced nuclear power technical levels and will build 11 experimental devices including an experimental shock-resistance device, main pump testing console device, control rod drive line cold state hydraulic experimental device, drive line earthquake resistance experimental vertical device, complete core hydraulic simulation experimental device, large thermodynamics experimental device, and so on for the primary equipment for the reactor. These experimental devices are essential for China's nuclear power development and after they are completed they will assume responsibility for preliminary research on the key technologies for China's nuclear power and for development research for the technology in the initial phase of the nuclear power project, which is very important for achieving a shift to domestic production of nuclear power equipment in China. Based on the state's needs, the Academy of Nuclear Power will move quickly to work on the construction blueprint design and construction preparatory work, strengthen management, strictly control investments, determine project quality in accordance with its experimental tasks, strive to play a role as quickly as possible, and contribute to the development of China's nuclear power industry.
