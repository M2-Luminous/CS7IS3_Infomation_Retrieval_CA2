FR941116-2-00065 FR941116-2-00052 [Finance Docket No. 32605] Missouri Pacific Railroad Company, Union Pacific Railroad Company, and Central Kansas Railway L.L.C._Joint Relocation Project Exemption_in Kansas On October 20, 1994, Missouri Pacific Railroad Company (MP) and Union Pacific Railroad Company (UP) filed a notice of exemption under 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(5) to relocate a line of railroad at Salina, in Saline County, KS. 1 The joint relocation project involves the: (1) acquisition by MP/UP of overhead trackage rights on approximately 1.7 miles of parallel line belonging to the Central Kansas Railway L.L.C. (CK) between mileposts 20.4 and 22.1; (2) construction of a new connection at milepost 186.63 on UP's east-west main line, just to the south of the jointly owned CK/UP Union Depot, to give MP/UP access to the CK trackage rights; and (3) incidental abandonment and discontinuance by MP of a 0.78-mile portion of its Trigo Industrial Lead between milepost 494.65 and milepost 495.43. The parties have stated their intention to consummate the transaction on or after the October 27, 1994 effective date of the exemption. The Railway Labor Executives' Association petitioned for imposition of labor protective conditions. 1 UP, a class I rail carrier, owns a main line that extends generally in an east-west route through Salina. Another UP line extends generally in a southern route from the east-west UP route near Salina. MP, a class I rail carrier and UP's corporate affiliate, owns and operates the Trigo Industrial Lead, a line that partially parallels UP's east-west route. The Trigo Industrial Lead also crosses the UP southern route at Salina. CK, a limited liability rail carrier, owns a short line of railroad at Salina that parallels to the south UP's east-west route and is near the jointly owned UP/CK Union Depot. MP/UP contend that service to shippers will not be disrupted and otherwise that there will be no adverse effect on shippers. The proposed joint relocation project is intended to facilitate their interchange capabilities, and the connecting track will give them access to the Trigo Industrial Lead to ensure continued rail service to MP's customers. Citing Denver & R.G.W.R. Co.-JT. Proj.-Relocation Over BN , 4 I.C.C.2d 95 (1987) ( Joint Project ), they further contend that the proposed joint relocation project will not involve a change in service to shippers, an expansion into new territory, or a change in existing competitive situations. The Commission generally does not assume jurisdiction over the incidental abandonment, discontinuance, and construction components of a relocation project if, as alleged here, none of the criteria set out in Joint Project will be triggered. Accordingly, the proposed abandonment, discontinuance, and construction are not subject to Commission jurisdiction. The remainder of the joint relocation project involves UP/MP's acquisition of overhead trackage rights from CK. The Commission has determined that line relocations may also embrace trackage rights transactions such as the one proposed here. See D.T. & I.R._Trackage Rights , 363 I.C.C. 878 (1981). Because the joint relocation project will not disrupt service to shippers, the proposed trackage rights qualify for exemption under the class exemption procedures at 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(5). As a condition to the use of this exemption, any employees affected by the trackage rights agreement will be protected by the conditions imposed in Norfolk and Western Ry. Co._Trackage Rights_BN , 354 I.C.C. 605 (1978), as modified in Mendocino Coast Ry., Inc._Lease and Operation , 360 I.C.C. 653 (1980). Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke will not stay the transaction. Pleadings must be filed with the Commission and served on: Joseph D. Anthofer, and Jeanna L. Regier, 1416 Dodge Street, Room 830, Omaha, NE 68179. Dated: November 4, 1994. By the Commission, David M. Konschnik, Director, Office of Proceedings. Vernon A. Williams, Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;28196 Filed 11&hyph;15&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7035&hyph;01&hyph;P
