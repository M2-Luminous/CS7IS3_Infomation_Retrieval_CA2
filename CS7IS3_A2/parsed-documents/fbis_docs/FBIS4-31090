This is the result of many factors--their geographic position, a predominance of inefficient industry, etc. We discussed the method by which the Ministry of Economics is dealing with this fact with Stanislav Zalud, deputy economics minister (ODS [Civic Democratic Party]). [Stonis] At the Ministry of Economics, you are responsible for the so-called development of regional activities in the Czech Republic. How can those activities be fulfilled without resulting in significant drawdowns of resources from the state budget? [Zalud] The best way to realize regional policy is to support individual regional projects. It is not a matter of thinking up something in Prague--the regions themselves must decide regarding the speed and quality of realization of individual activities. A whole series of support systems exist--support for activities, for ideas, for programs or connecting various related matters. I frequently hear the question asked how we can implement regional policy when we have no means at our disposal for it in the budget. One can also achieve regional policy by proving capable of implementing it even on the basis of other resources. I do not require any of my own resources to initiate what I am trying to do. The value of the individual projects that are beginning to be realized in the individual regions lies in the fact that they are related. In that case, the expending of resources is efficient. [Stonis] Can you be specific? [Zalud] First of all, our ministry has established the Czech-Moravian Development and Guarantee Bank, which does not provide funds directly to entrepreneurs, but provides guarantees for individual projects. Furthermore, we are offering a broad pallet of programs supported by domestic or foreign resources. Of course, the efforts are joined by finances resulting from such programs as PHARE [Economic Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary], Overtura, Ecos, and HGP [expansion unknown]. I consider it to be a success that the PHARE program has changed and will no longer mean only technical assistance, as has been the case thus far. Finally, for the first time, it is joining in with massive utilization of its resources for individual investments. We had lacked that thus far. The regions will be helped the most if an adequate technical infrastructure exists there--communications, energy network, etc. If this infrastructure will function, then entrepreneurs will also become active in the regions. Of course, a potential entrepreneur frequently comes to find out that if he wants to start a business and employ people he must, for example, first build a wastewater purification capacity and this results in financial ruin for him even before he opens his business. For us, for the time being, this frequently represents an insurmountable handicap. [Stonis] Some political parties have recently drawn attention to the fact that the Czech Republic is beginning to break down into a rich Bohemia and a poor Moravia. Are they correct? [Zalud] It is true everywhere in the world that the opportunities at the disposal of individual regions are not equal. This is given by the geographic situation, by the physical conditions, by the climate, etc. In this context, these are not new theses in any way. One of the tasks of regional policy is to balance these great differences. But not by expending great resources in individual regions which might disappear there like in a black hole. We are attempting to balance the chances at the disposal of regions, but not by the across-the-board use of subsidies. [Stonis] Are there then actually some regions in Moravia which are actually poorer than regions in Bohemia? [Zalud] I believe that it continues to be a matter of some kind of unresolved injustice, which is not always objective. I believe that Moravia has the means of being economically as successful as Bohemia. I anticipate, moreover, that it could show more self-awareness and develop greater activity. I frequently remind investors that, from the business standpoint, there are other towns than the city of Prague which are attractive. For example, Ostrava: I do not believe that it is only black, but that it is attractive from the business standpoint in many respects and has many opportunities, even when it comes to tourism. [Stonis] Of course, some regions--for example, in the okreses of Znojmo, Bruntal, or Novy Jicin--unemployment continues to be relatively high. Do you believe that these regions have the same opportunity to be economically successful? [Zalud] These regions are the subjects of extraordinary attention. Because they suffer from long-term and persistently higher unemployment than exists elsewhere, the state has invested certain resources in these areas. Now, it is only a matter of these resources being correctly utilized. It is important for okres offices, in collaboration with labor offices, to select those most advantageous steps. One can polemicize as to whether they have adequate resources for this or not. But these are resources which the state was able to release on an immediate basis. [Stonis] Nevertheless, is this regional unemployment dramatic or not from your standpoint? [Zalud] It is not. Together with the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, we have worked out some common material in which we have dealt in detail with unemployment in these regions. Last week, we had a basic meeting on redistribution of additional resources and unemployment in these regions has, in the meantime, quietly and imperceptibly declined. I want to say that the numbers are highly mobile and in no way dramatic. Just the mere input of a certain amount of resources, which would, in a certain way, solve transportation access to some locations, is contributing to an immediate improvement in the situation. [Stonis] Your name is coming up in conjunction with the privatization of the former military area of Mlada-Ralsko. The press continues to carry occasional polemics as to whether the decision on utilizing this territory is correct. Do you believe that the dispute regarding this military area has definitively come to an end? [Zalud] Privatization has definitively been decided on by government resolution. It is true that there is always someone in the press who is trying to create the impression that there is yet another method by which privatization could be accomplished. Perhaps he simply forgot the fact that the decision has already been made. But these are matters with which we are familiar. This happens with all large investment decisions--for example, regarding the building of a highway. They are long the subject of polemics and then a decision is made, the highway is traveled for six years and arguments continue to be heard regarding the fact that it could have taken another route. Regarding the military area of Ralsko-Mlada, this looks to me like the same problem. [Stonis] What specifically will happen in this area in the immediate future? [Zalud] In view of the fact that preparation of the actual privatization process, in harmony with the given procedures, requires a certain amount of time, the government approved the proposal made by our minister on 17 November 1993, with the exception of approving Resolution No. 404/1993, calling for the transfer of property to the city of Benatky nad Jizerou, Straz pod Ralskem, Vsejany, and Mukarov. A similar proposal, whose scope is essential to assure the continuing functioning of the community, has been worked out for the community of Ralsko. The actual procedure for transferring property within the areas of Ralsko and Mlada is realized on the basis of a schedule of tasks approved by the government on 22 December of last year. Preparation for actual privatization is being handled by the Privum budgetary organization, established by the Ministry of Economics. The initial proposals for part of the property in the area of Mlada have already been worked out and turned over for public announcement. Part of the privatization project in the above-listed areas also involves property operated by the Prague Military Forests and Farms, state enterprise, the predominant portion of which was already published on 8 April. An essential condition regarding the territory of former military areas is the working out of the appropriate territorial planning documentation. The territory of Dobra Voda was handled within the framework of the territorial region of the Sumava. The territorial plans for Ralsko and Mlada have been worked out and have been discussed--currently preparations for their approval are under way.
