FBIS4-18903 "drweu070__a94056" FBIS-WEU-94-070-A Daily Report 12 April 1994 ANNEX Turkey Cetin Demands German `Unconditional No' on Terrorism Cetin Demands German `Unconditional No' on Terrorism AU0804184094 Hamburg DPA in German 1639 GMT 8 Apr 94--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU0804184094 Hamburg DPA German BFN [Text] Ankara -- Turkey's Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin has called upon Germany to issue a "clear and unconditional no to terrorism." Cetin told DPA in Ankara on Friday [8 April] that he has no doubt that accusations saying that German arms are used in internal conflicts against Kurdish extremists, against the rules of bilateral and NATO agreements, will prove false. Turkey is facing "separatist terrorism by the Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK]." Turkey must, therefore, be allowed "to defend itself with the means of a democratic constitutional state." PKK terrorism must not be regarded as a fight for freedom by the Kurds, the Social Democratic foreign minister of Kurdish descent said. According to the semi-official news agency ANADOLU, the parliamentary state secretary in the Federal Interior Ministry, Eduard Lintner, said at a German-Turkish symposium in Istanbul on Friday that the suspension of German arms supplies is mainly due to "aggressive television programs" directed against Turkey. According to Anadolu, Lintner said: "Some leftist groups are out of work now that South Africa is no longer a topic, and now they are concentrating on Turkey." According to the ANADOLU report, Lintner went on to say that Germany is the country where the PKK is most active outside Turkey. This has created the impression that the Kurds are those that are "oppressed" and the Turks are the "oppressors." It is, therefore, necessary to tell the German public the truth, Lintner said, according to ANADOLU.
