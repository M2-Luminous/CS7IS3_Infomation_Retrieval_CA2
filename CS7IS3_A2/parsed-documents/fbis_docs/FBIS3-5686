Keiretsu dealings and other commercial practices which have come under attack by other countries are also expected to become the subjects of study by these groups. The U.S. Government has asked the Japanese Government to move up the target for finalizing the deregulation enforcement five-year plan, which is now set for completion by March 1995, to mid-July, when the summit of industrialized nations (Naples summit) will be held. The government is due to discuss measures including this point at the 10 March cabinet ministers meeting on foreign economic issues. The government held a ministers meeting on 9 March to discuss issues concerning the Japanese-U.S. economic framework talks and agreed that the market-liberalization measures now under study should be finalized in two groups -- the first measures by the end of March and the second measures by the time of the summit in July. During a news conference on the evening of the same day, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said that the government will set up immediately, in addition to the existing deregulation working group on land and housing issues, a similar working group on the information communications sector and another on the distribution sector by the end of the month. These working groups will deal with issues related to market access and regulations governing imports, and they will study deregulation measures that would lead to the promotion of imports. Meanwhile, in relation to this question, a government source on the same evening noted, "Even among cabinet members, views are emerging on the need to review Japan's commercial practices." According to the Foreign Ministry, the United States has requested Japan to add to the "deregulation enforcement plan" deregulation measures concerning the distribution sector as well as measures for improving the transferability of land. The United States has also asked about the schedule for finalizing the plan, and it noted with respect to the deadline for implementing the plan, "We hope that Japan will not try to adhere to the implementation deadline of five years but rather will facilitate its implementation before that."
