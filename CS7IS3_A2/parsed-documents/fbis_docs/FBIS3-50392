Krajisnik headed a Srpska republic delegation at the talks with the Muslim side at Sarajevo Airport. He specified that the two sides had discussed the exchange and release of prisoners and the situation following the arrest of Serb medical personnel in the Muslim part of Sarajevo. "There were certain political topics on the agenda too," Krajisnik added. He said that both sides agreed to exchange 85 prisoners each, and that the Serbs again pointed to the problem of prisons in Gorazde [in eastern Bosnia] and Tarcin [southwest of Sarajevo]. The talks were also attended by a representative of the International Committee of the Red Cross [ICRC], so it was agreed that, with the mediation and participation of that humanitarian organization, a mixed Serb-Muslim delegation should visit the prison in Gorazde, while, according to Krajisnik, "there are mutual problems" concerning Tarcin. He explained that the families of the Serbs held in Tarcin prevent humanitarian aid convoys from reaching the territories under Muslim control, making their passage conditional on the release of the prisoners from Tarcin. It was agreed that a Srpska republic representative should go to Tarcin with ICRC officials and, if possible, arrange an exchange of prisoners, Krajisnik said. He added that the ICRC got involved in the case of the Serb doctors held in the Central Prison in Sarajevo, but that the Muslim side had started making their release conditional on "reciprocal measures." "If there are Muslim doctors on our territory who would like to cross to their territory, we are ready to resolve this matter immediately," Krajisnik said. He reiterated that the arrest of the Serb doctors was an extremely unreasonable act, adding that he was hoping the problem would be resolved soon. Revealing more details on political topics discussed at the meeting today, the speaker of the People's Assembly of the Srpska republic mentioned an idea presented by Silajdzic that in this phase hostilities should cease, or maybe even complete peace be restored, separation lines between warring sides be drawn up along the present front lines, and the civilian population be allowed to move freely between Visoko and Sarajevo, Sarajevo and Tarcin, and also along roads leading from Sarajevo to the Serb-controlled territories. "I have the impression that the Muslim side wants a cease-fire, which is encouraging, especially if they adhere to these standpoints following additional consultations," Krajisnik stated. According to him, this would not only be an act of restoring trust, but would also create a climate in which political negotiations on all contentious issues would continue in an atmosphere of peace, not under war conditions. Krajisnik also expressed reservations in this connection, stressing that he had clearly told the Muslim side that what might be lurking behind this proposal was the aim of buying time to obtain certain military advantages such as further armament, and mopping up the front facing the Croat side. "We shall accept an invitation for peace, preferably for a permanent peace, but I clearly told Silajdzic we had doubts about the peace-making intentions of a part of the Muslim leadership, which is trying to resolve the situation through the war," Krajisnik said. The Srpska republic assembly speaker stressed that he had drawn the Muslim side's attention to the fact that the Serbs were ready to accept any military challenge, and that they could not be swindled and cheated. In conclusion Krajisnik said that an agreement was reached for the two delegations to meet once again before 10 February, about which they would be in phone contact as phone lines between the two sides are restored. He explained that all this is aimed at overcoming distrust through direct contacts, "so that the atmosphere ahead of the forthcoming round of Geneva negotiations is as favorable as possible."
