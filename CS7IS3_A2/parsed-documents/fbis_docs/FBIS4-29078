Science, Technology and Environment Minister Law Hieng Ding said Tuesday, he made the request to UNEP Under Secretary-General Elizabeth Dowdeswell since UNEP had been an active and strong supporter of international chemical safety programmes. Dowdeswell was also briefed on the discussion I had with Danish Environment Minister Svend Auken, Law told reporters after receiving Dowdeswell, who is on a two-day official visit here. Monday, Malaysia and Denmark agreed to work together in formulating an international regulation to control the trafficking of banned and restricted chemicals like DDT [dichloro-diphenyl-trichloro-ethane] from industrialised nations to developing countries. Law said during their one-hour meeting, they also discussed a wide range of subjects, among them, the role of UNEP in the restructuring of the global environmental facilities, where he hoped UNEP could play a much bigger role. He said they also discussed Agenda 21, the world's action plan to protect the environment. Malaysia also suggested a possible dialogue among Southeast Asian countries, Australia and New Zealand on environment matters. Dowdeswell, who is on her first visit here, said the UNEP was very keen to work with Malaysia and Denmark on enforcing the ban on toxic chemicals dumping since UNEP had been promoting chemical safety.
