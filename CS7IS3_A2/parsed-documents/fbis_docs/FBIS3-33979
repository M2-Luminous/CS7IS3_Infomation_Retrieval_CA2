Addressing the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva today, she described the gross human rights violations against innocent and unarmed Kashmiris as reminiscent of the darkest days of the Nazi Germany. She said the situation there is intolerable. The people of held Kashmir are demanding just their freedom. They cannot be suppressed indefinitely. She pointed out that despite its repression, India has failed to impose its will on the indomitable people of Jammu and Kashmir, and intensity of their resistance has grown. The Kashmiri political leadership, representing over (?30) parties and groups, has unanimously declared not to contemplate any solution involving the continuation of Indian rule. The prime minister's address was warmly and repeatedly applauded by the audience. Referring to the recently held Pak-India talks, the prime minister said Pakistan had hoped to meaningfully address all aspects of the dispute. Pakistan stressed upon India to seek a peaceful rather than a military solution to the Kashmir dispute, and take visible steps to reduce repression. Instead the repression increased. Over 40,000 Kashmiri men, women, and children have been killed so far. The prime minister demanded that the representatives of Kashmiri people should be allowed to come and inform the commission of the repression to which they are being subjected, and the commission should investigate these violations of human rights. Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto said: It is time for the world community to prevail upon India to remove its additional forces from held Kashmir, in order to put an end to its repression. It is also time for the world community to force India to free the imprisoned Kashmiri leaders, lift the Draconian emergency laws and stop its army to commit all forms of atrocities in Kashmir, and, finally, allow international human rights organizations, humanitarian organizations, and media men to visit Kashmir to ascertain the facts and provide help to the suffering Kashmiris. She said the settlement of the Kashmir dispute based on the wishes of the people is the key to peace and progress in South Asia, reiterating that Pakistan is committed to seeking a peaceful solution of the Kashmir dispute, as it would pave the way to normalization of relations between Pakistan and India. [sentence as heard] The prime minister also urged the world community to help preserve the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Bosnia and demanded that the consequences of ethnic cleansing must be reversed. She said the genocide in Bosnia has been continuing for the past two years. The Security Council has failed to help the victims of aggression. Humanitarian help has become an excuse to avoid collective action against the aggressor. The European Community approved high sounding principles but failed to stop the aggressor. This state of affairs should end in order to ensure peace, freedom, and justice for the Bosnian people. The prime minister said Pakistan's aim is to provide a life of dignity to its people by banishing poverty and illiteracy, ensuring the rights of women and their full participation in society, providing full protection to our children and safeguarding the basic rights of minorities. Later, addressing a news conference, the prime minister urged India to reduce its level of repression in occupied Kashmir. This would be a visible signal from New Delhi that it is sincere in holding talks over the Kashmiri dispute. Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto said Pakistan cannot afford to ignore what is happening in held Kashmir, because it is our common responsibility to ensure that the Kashmiris get the right of self determination.
