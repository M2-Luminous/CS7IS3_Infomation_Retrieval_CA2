Ex-inmates will be treated with more flexible policies to steer them toward a new life, a circular published this week said. The circular urged local governments and Party committees to help re-settle and educate these ex-inmates. Presently, about 300,000 inmates every year finish their sentences, posing a societal dilemma: How should they be resettled to prevent them from committing new crimes? The matter is even more important because of the new socialist market economy China is striving to establish. The principle measures in the circular include providing technical skill training and ideological education for inmates while serving their terms; then help them find a job or start their own business, after being released from prison. They will enjoy the same rights as non-convicts to open up businesses or engage in other economic affairs. They should not be discriminated against in getting jobs, furthering education, buying houses and land or receiving social subsidies. However, the circular also stressed re-educating them to keep them from becoming career criminals. Through China's reform-through-labour camps, the rate of repeat criminals has always been low, lingering between 6-8 per cent. Two similar circulars were published in the 1950s and 1980s, but the new sheet includes measures in light of the new socialist market economy. Incomplete statistics from the Justice Ministry showed rural people accounted for 56.9 per cent of all criminals, urban workers 18.6, and vagrants 12.2. Convicts have had particularly tough times getting jobs once they are released from prison despite government efforts. The resettlement and re-education measure, signed by the Commission for the Comprehensive Management of Public Security (CCMPS) with five other ministries, was viewed as an important step toward improving public security. The circular covers those ex-convicts who left prisons in the past three years and still have not found jobs.
