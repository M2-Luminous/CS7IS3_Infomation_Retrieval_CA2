In an interview with INTERFAX-Ukraine about the first round of general elections, the minister pointed to a polarization of views of the first group of 49 candidates who had won parliamentary seats. "A radical shift either way will not help consolidate our independence," he said. Zlenko stressed that any crucial policy shift may cause a similar change of heart towards Ukraine by the international community.
