The attack by the outlawed Ulster Volunteer Force took place as the Government planned its response to Sinn Fein's questions about future policy on Northern Ireland. The two dead men, both electricians, one in his 40's and the other in his 20's, were believed to come from the mid-Ulster area. Their names were not being released until relatives had been informed. Witnesses said the men were hit by automatic fire during their lunchbreak as they sat in a car on a building site in the Tiger's Bay area of the city. Police later made several arrests and seized firearms during raids in the area. The murders bring to 17 the number of terrorist killings in the province in the past month. [Passage omitted]
