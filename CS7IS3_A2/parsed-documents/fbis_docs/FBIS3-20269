However, "this freedom means that international relations must be organized better." Addressing the 91st Interparliamentary Union Conference [IPU] at UNESCO Headquarters, which ends its work on Saturday, the prime minister reaffirmed the authority of the United Nations, which "remains the only organization with the legitimacy enabling it to make decisions and act on behalf of the entire international community." According to Edouard Balladur, the United Nations should not be "deprived of the control of executing the decisions it adopts," and, to this end, it must "be given the means which it is currently lacking." "Admittedly, defense organizations can act in support, as is the case in the former Yugoslavia, but they cannot act instead and in place of the United Nations," insisted Balladur, who has asked Senator Francois Trucy for a report on the adaptation of French military resources for missions carried out within the UN framework. The prime minister then added that "a great deal remains to be done," especially in the area of improving civil and military procedures. Praise for the French-Speaking World The prime minister, who has proposed a "pact of stability in Europe," which will be launched at a conference in Paris 26-27 May, said that it was not a question of "a new institution or a new declaration," but of an "exercise in preventive diplomacy," aimed at "stanching any sources of divergence or friction" between the countries "with a calling to join the European Union." This document, Balladur insisted, "will mark the entry of our continent into a new era of stability and prosperity." [passage omitted]
