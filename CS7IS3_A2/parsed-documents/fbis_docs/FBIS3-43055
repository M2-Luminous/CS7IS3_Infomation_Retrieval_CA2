The researchers had earlier ascertained that hypobaric hypoxia destabilizes erythrocyte membranes and results in an increase in serum levels of extraerythrocyte hemoglobin, total peroxidase activity, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity. Such hypoxia also changes the permeability of lysosomal membranes and the activity of lysosomal peptide hydrolases and disrupts the structures of the mitochondrial membrane and the catalytic properties of monoaminooxidase. Since the psychotropic drug pirazidol inhibits lipid peroxidation rate, the researchers hypothesized that the administration of the drug ahead of time would stabilize membranes and help to raise the body's resistance to hypoxia. In white male rats confined for three hours in an altitude chamber with an atmospheric pressure of 0.029 mPa, the administration of the pirazidol prevented a rise in the serum levels of hemoglobin, total iron, and total peroxidase activity. The overall activity of lysosomal acidic peptide hydrolases in all tissues and the free activity in the brain and liver did not differ from control, and the pulmonary activity of enzymes in soluble fraction was even 27 percent lower than in control animals. The administration of the drug also prevented any change in substrate specificity in mitochondrial fraction, as well as enzyme release to soluble fraction. References 28: 20 Russian, 8 Western.
