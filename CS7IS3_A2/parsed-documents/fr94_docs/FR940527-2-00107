(``the Act''), the Supercomputer Automotive Applications Partnership has filed written notifications simultaneously with the Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commission disclosing (1) the identities of the parties and (2) the nature and objectives of the venture. The notifications were filed for the purpose of invoking the Act's provisions limiting the recovery of antitrust plaintiffs to actual damages under specified circumstances. Pursuant to section 6(b) of the Act, the identities of the parties are General Motors Corporation, Detroit, MI; Chrysler Corporation, Highland Park, MI; and Ford Motor Company, Dearborn, MI. The parties intend to identify opportunities for joining aspects of their independent research and development efforts pertaining to use of supercomputer technology in automotive applications. The four initial opportunities identified are visualization; crash analysis of composite structures; structural mechanics (mesh generation); and CFD (combustion, aerodynamics and sprays). The objectives are to avoid inefficient duplication of effort and expense while conducting or directing research in this area, collect, exchange and, where appropriate, license or otherwise disseminate the results of the research, work closely with various governmental and private agencies and perform further acts allowed by the National Cooperative Research and Production Act that would advance the Partnership's objectives.
