FR940607-0-00056 FR940607-0-00017 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background Title XI of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA), 12 U.S.C. 3331 et seq., directs each Federal banking agency to publish appraisal regulations for federally related transactions within its jurisdiction. The purpose of the legislation is to protect federal financial and public policy interests in real estate related transactions by requiring that real estate appraisals utilized in connection with federally related transactions are performed in writing, in accordance with uniform standards, and by individuals whose competency has been demonstrated and whose professional conduct will be subject to effective supervision. See 12 U.S.C. 3331. Section 1121(4) of FIRREA, 12 U.S.C. 3350(4), defines a federally related transaction as a real estate-related financial transaction that is regulated or engaged in by a federal financial institutions regulatory agency and requires the services of an appraiser. A real estate-related financial transaction is defined as any transaction that involves: (i) The sale, lease, purchase, investment in or exchange of real property, including interests in property, or the financing thereof; (ii) The refinancing of real property or interests in real property; and (iii) The use of real property or interests in real property as security for a loan or investment, including mortgage-backed securities. See 12 U.S.C. 3350(5) (FIRREA section 1121(5)). In their appraisal regulations, the agencies identify categories of real estate-related financial transactions that do not require the services of an appraiser in order to protect federal financial and public policy interests or to satisfy principles of safe and sound banking. These real estate-related financial transactions are not federally related transactions under the statutory and regulatory definitions. Accordingly, they are subject to neither Title XI of FIRREA nor those provisions of the agencies' regulations governing appraisals. In December 1992, Congress confirmed that the agencies may set a threshold level below which the services of state certified or licensed appraisers are not required in connection with federally related transactions if the agencies determine in writing that the threshold does not represent a threat to the safety and soundness of financial institutions. See Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, Public Law 102&hyph;550, section 954 (amending 12 U.S.C. 3341). The agencies jointly published a proposed rule to amend their appraisal regulations on June 4, 1993. See 58 FR 31878. The agencies published a notice of the availability of supplemental information concerning the proposed rule and invited further comments on November 10, 1993. See 58 FR 59688. The agencies are issuing this joint final rule under their authority to issue rules to implement Title XI of FIRREA and each agency's authority to prescribe rules and regulations to carry out its responsibility to ensure that the institutions under its supervision conduct their activities in accordance with safe and sound banking principles. This final rule is intended to protect federal financial and public policy interests and the safety and soundness of financial institutions, while reducing duplication, costs and regulatory burden.
