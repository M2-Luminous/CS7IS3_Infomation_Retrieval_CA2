Addressing students of the Russian Government's Finance Academy in Moscow on Monday, he voiced doubt that his country would act toward any East European economic integration. "We favor a free market with our partners in Poland and Hungary, and in this sense are open to East and West alike." He reported that at a meeting with Russia's Premier Chernomyrdin on Tuesday he would sign a treaty on mutual investment guarantees and one of the topics for discussion with Chernomyrdin will be Russia's debt to Czech enterprises. In his speech before academy students, Klaus focused on the consistence with which his cabinet had proceeded from the administrative command economy to a market-oriented economy. As a result, the Czech kron has for 40 months now been a model of stability not only for the post-communist states but also for some western democracies. He pointed out that the Czech Republic, unlike neighboring East European countries, is trying hard to halt relentless western investment. He claimed that the transition to a market economy should start primarily with macroeconomic transformations and a deficit-free budget. "There must be a man who can say "no" without fear of attack from the opposition and newspaper lampooning but who should be in close touch with society through the press," Klaus said. He described as a delusion the desire to attract western capital by all kinds of privileges. There is nothing more important for a government in a transitional period, according to Klaus, than to pave the way for economic recovery by curbing inflation, liberalizing prices and foreign trade, and privatizing property as soon as possible. Klaus is paying an official visit to Russia.
