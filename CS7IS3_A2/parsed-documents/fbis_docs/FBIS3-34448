The Palestinian president then left for a meeting with Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid at the Arab League. Palestinian and Israeli delegations, led respectively by Ahmad Quray', alias Abu-'Ala', the head of the PLO Economic Department, and Uri Savir, director general of the Israeli Foreign Ministry, continued their "marathon talks" aiming to overcome the difficulties facing the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho Agreement signed on 13 September 1993. Commenting on his talks until dawn with president 'Arafat and Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa, Peres said some topics were discussed in private. We are trying to overcome some obstacles. Asked if he was optimistic, Peres said: We should not be making statements or forecasts now while the negotiations are under way. When we finish our work, we will make statements. Peres said things are moving forward. Faysal al-Husayni, a member of the Palestinian delegation and the man in charge of the occupied territories, said there is some progress in the talks and that further discussions will be held to reach results. Elsewhere, president 'Arafat received Torje Larsen, the Norwegian Government's envoy, in the al-Andalus Palace this morning. Afterward, Larsen said he is in Cairo to follow the current Palestinian-Israeli negotiations closely. Sources close to the Palestinian and Israeli negotiators told MENA of cautious optimism prevailing during the marathon talks, which have been going on continuously for two days. The sources said that during his meeting with 'Arafat and Peres yesterday, President Husni Mubarak emphasized the need to reach an agreement during the current talks. He humored his guests by saying: You will not leave Cairo until you reach an agreement. The same sources said that Peres will not leave Cairo this evening as scheduled. He will resume talks until tomorrow, Thursday, before heading for Geneva to attend a conference for the Jewish community in Europe. MENA has learned that the major points of dispute are security control of the crossing points, settlements security, issues pertaining to the roads leading to Gaza settlements, and the area of Jericho. To put it simply, the dispute persisting between the Israeli and Palestinian sides throughout all earlier rounds has revolved around Palestinian control of symbols of national sovereignty in the context of self-rule and the Israeli fear that granting the Palestinians such control might lead to the establishment of a Palestinian state. Sources close to the Israeli delegation have said that the Israeli military institution, represented in the delegation by General Uzi Dayan, head of the political planning department of the Israeli Army Staff Command, refuses to grant the Palestinians security control over crossing points between Jordan and Jericho and between Egypt and Gaza under the excuse of preserving Israel's security.
