Pavlovskis signed an order appointing Command Captain Janis Adamsons, the present Deputy Commander of the Naval Forces to the position of Border Guards Brigade Commander. Thus, control of the land borders will be overseen by a navy man. In this connection, "Labrit" is offering a brief short-order interview with the new Border Guards Brigade Commander. [Stale] Did you agree to this position willingly? [Adamsons] I am an officer, and in the army it is assumed that the orders of a higher ranking officer are to be followed, regardless of whether they concern changing over to another post or retirement. I was satisfied with my present post and also with the work I had contributed in forming the Naval Forces. The actual offer to become the Border Guards Brigade Commander was unexpected, although I am a professional coast guard. [Stale] How did you become a coast guard by profession? [Adamsons] I studied at the Russian Naval War School. For 13 years, I served in the Far East in various leadership positions as a coast guard. I was last stationed in Russia at the Coast Guard Training Center in Nahodka, where I served as deputy head of the training center. [Stale] In your opinion, what is the weakest point in the present overland border protection plan? [Adamsons] I will be able to answer this question one month from now, after I have familiarized myself with all overland border problems. I guarantee that the information will be available to the press. [Stale] What are the main activity objectives of the new Border Guards Brigade Commander? [Adamsons] To strengthen overland border control, protection and defense, involving the participation of those people who are serving in the Border Guard at present. The main objective is to organize regular cooperation among the state institutions involved with border control -- the Ministry of Internal Affairs, National Guard, Customs. Until now, while serving in the Naval Forces, there was good cooperation among these institutions. I hope the situation continues.
