He said that Ukraine is short of money for fully-fledged cooperation with NATO. However, the participation of one or two representatives of the Ukrainian general staff is possible in planning training operations. Grechanynov said that Ukraine's involvement in peace-keeping operations in Bosnia-Herzegovina effectively means participation in the Partnership for Peace program.
