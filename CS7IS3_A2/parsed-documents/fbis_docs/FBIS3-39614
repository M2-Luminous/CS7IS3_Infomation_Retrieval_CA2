Speaking ahead of a meeting in London this weekend with John Major, he again highlighted hopes that their peace initiative would prompt a permanent end to Northern Ireland-linked terrorism. Mr Reynolds told the Irish parliament he was still "cautiously optimistic" about the success prospects of the two-month-old joint declaration. The Irish premier, who meets Mr Major before the two leaders attend Saturday's Twickenham rugby international between England and Ireland, said they would be reviewing recent Northern Ireland political developments. Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew and Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring -- joint chairmen of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference -- will also be at the talks. Mr Reynolds said the meeting would focus primarily on issues connected with the peace declaration. "We will review progress, share assessments of the current position and examine approaches of attaining our common objective of a lasting peace with justice in Ireland." He said the advancement of political dialogue through a resumed inter-party talks process would be discussed too. Mr Reynolds refused to agree that Sinn Fein's annual conference at the end of this month would signal the deadline for its response to the peace bid. Mr Reynolds is due to go to the U.S. for a period including St Patrick's Day, March 17, when he will meet President Clinton. He said he would "avail of every appropriate opportunity to present and promote in a balanced way the complexities of the Northern Ireland conflict, as well as our efforts towards its peaceful resolution. "This will be of particular importance during my discussions with President Clinton and congressional leaders."
