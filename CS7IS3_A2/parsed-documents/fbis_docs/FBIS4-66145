The aim of this conference is to avoid new border and minority problems in Central and East European countries that plan to join the EU. [Begin recording] [Solana] What means do we have at our disposal? We have the idea that, ultimately these countries will become EU members. That is a good incentive. We can also help them financially so some of these problems can be solved. This is the aim of this conference, all of it in the framework of the CSCE. We hope that in a year's time, that is to say in 1995, the situation will be stable. [end recording]
