FBIS4-7265 "dreas082_m_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-082 Daily Report 28 Apr 1994 Thailand UN Cambodian Monitoring From Thai Soil Rejected UN Cambodian Monitoring From Thai Soil Rejected BK2804022994 Bangkok THE NATION in English 28 Apr 94 p A8 BK2804022994 Bangkok THE NATION English BFN [Excerpt] Thailand has no involvement in the continuing Cambodian conflict, which is between the Phnom Penh government and the Khmer Rouge, and any monitoring along the border should be on Cambodian soil, Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri said. Phnom Penh has an absolute right to request United Nations officers based in the capital to monitor the situation along the Thai-Cambodian border, Prasong said. "But if the UN officers want to conduct any monitoring on the Thai side, they have to ask the Thai government first. We, Thailand, are not a party to the conflict and therefore we should have nothing to do with the border monitoring," he said. The minister was referring to a report that Cambodia is requesting the UN to extend the operations of its 30-strong mission based in Phnom Penh to allow them to monitor the border situation. He stressed that any monitoring from Thai soil would require prior approval from Bangkok. Bangkok had earlier turned down a request by the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac) to set up checkpoints on the Thai side of the border, saying it would be a violation of the nation's sovereignty. A senior Foreign Ministry official said yesterday the Phnom Penh request to the United Nations was apparently based on suspicions that Thailand still supports the guerrilla faction. The official, who asked for anonymity, said the Cambodian conflict would become an international issue if the UN mission was involved in a military confrontation with the guerrillas. Thailand would probably reject any request for the UN mission to operate on Thai soil, the official said, and as a result would again be accused of helping the Khmer Rouge. Minister Prasong said the Burapha task force was still investigating the most recent spillover from fighting inside Cambodia which resulted in two Thai villagers being seriously injured at Rongklu market in Sa Kaeo's Aranyaprathet district. Prasong said he was ready to explain Thailand's position to Cambodian Foreign Minister Prince Norodom Sirivut, who is visiting Indonesia and France, and was confident that any misunderstandings could be settled at government level.
