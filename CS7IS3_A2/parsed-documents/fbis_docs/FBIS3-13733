He said that after contacts with a number of officials, we opted to keep silent for a while and to allow quiet diplomacy to resolve the issue so that it may not be misinterpreted. We maintained this stance because we believe that through dialogue, understanding, and discussions we may find serious solutions to all problems, whereas other means would lead nowhere. Ja'ja' said that certain state officials began about 10 days ago to point the finger at the LF as responsible for the bombing of the Sayyidat al-Najat Church and other bombings. He wondered if it is possible to try a case before a court hearing even begins. He pointed out that the recent statement issued by the Internal Security Forces Directorate looks as if the explosive charge was prepared at the LF main headquarters. He asked: If this is true, is it possible to occupy the center? He said that the case should be referred to the judiciary to hear the case and hand down a verdict, because accusing people falsely is inadmissible. Ja'ja' stressed that the LF, as always, will side with justice to the end. He pointed out that the LF has offered 10,000 martyrs in defense of churches in all Lebanese areas, and wondered if it is reasonable for the LF to bomb a church anywhere. Ja'ja' noted that what is happening these days may be the last link in a chain before suppressing political freedoms in Lebanon. He said: As for me, the situation is very clear. Every time a security incident occurs, it is used as a pretext to take further security measures to apply more pressure on the opposition parties, individuals, and politicians instead of hunting down the perpetrators. He wonders if political opposition is not allowed in Lebanon. If it is not allowed, he said, let them say so clearly so that everyone will shoulder his responsibilities. He added: We set forth our basic demand at the first news conference we held after the bombing of the Sayyidat al-Najat Church: We want to learn who bombed the church. He hoped that the state would find the perpetrators. He said that the judiciary will decide this; otherwise, why do countries take judicial measures in such cases? He said: We truly wish that the case be referred to the judiciary to hand down its verdict. Ja'ja' said that the bombing of the church led to the deployment of security forces in LF centers and surrounding Ghidras [LF headquarters], although the investigations for the past 10 days have not led to the bombers. He called for finding the culprits responsible for the crime of bombing the church and proceeding with judicial measures to find the culprits.
