"I am keen to ensure that assets that are not directly linked to the delivery of the reconstruction and development programme, that are merely a symbol of the white glory macho projects of the past, are sold. I have absolutely no reservations about that," Mr Naidoo said in an interview. These funding "windfalls", Mr Naidoo said, could include power stations that had been mothballed, and embassies abroad. "We are reviewing all our assets," he said. The government would also have to assess all its properties abroad. Properties that could go first were those owned by the former TBVC [Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda, Ciskei] states. He would also support moving away from holding on to embassies that were more the style of Western countries and not in line with a developing Third World country like South Africa. "We don't have to live the lifestyles of First World Western countries. We are a developing country and we must relate to that reality and first strive towards a sustainable economy," he said. Mr Naidoo said there were four other sources of funding for the reconstruction and development programme. These were slices from the Budget, which would increase year by year. One of the scenarios put forward by the National Institute for Economic Policy was that by the end of five years, this would have totalled R[Rand]80- billion, with R39-billion being spent in the fifth year. Other sources of funding were development aid from foreign donors, and contributions from the private sector and non-governmental organisations.
