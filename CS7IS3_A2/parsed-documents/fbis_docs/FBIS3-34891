In his meetings with the Israeli leaders, Juppe expressed France's intention to strengthen bilateral relations and also discussed the peace process. [passage omitted] Juppe stressed in his meeting with Rabin the tightening of defense ties between the two countries. He said that the visit by French Defense Minister Francois Leotard next month "would spur cooperation in the fields of research, development, and technology. There are many contingency plans, and the time has come to look to air them out, and begin to consider their implementation." Prior to Leotard's visit, the director of France's defense procurement agency (DGA) will arrive in Israel. Peres, who fathered the defense ties with France when they peaked in the '50's, welcomed France's intention to renew the security dialogue "which was severed for many years." Juppe also expressed support for setting up a political-strategic dialogue in joint Foreign Ministry working groups. [passage omitted] Peres told his guest that Israel will not compromise in the talks with the Palestinians on issues linked to the security of its citizens, and that the latest terrorist acts only sharpen the need to be more careful about the security aspects of the agreement. Referring to the Syrian track, Peres said that he returned less optimistic from his trip to the United States. "It is our feeling that the Syrian president did not hand down new guidelines to the head of his delegation to the Washington talks," Peres said. Juppe agreed with Peres that the Syrians need to make more progress in the negotiations. He said that France's message to his Arab interlocutors is clear: encourage progress in the negotiations. "France is leading the efforts to expand economic aid to the territories and the entire region," Juppe said, and stressed that his country attaches a great deal of importance to the multilateral track and will continue to play a leading role there. Peres expressed satisfaction with the French contribution to the multilaterals and said that the private sector must be encouraged to join the inter-government activity.

The scope of the permanent aid via the EC is 20 percent of the EC's total aid to the Palestinians. In addition, France helps public institutions and volunteer organizations. Last year total direct French aid to the Palestinians reached 12 million francs, or $ 2.5 million. France last year also handed out 18 million francs to the UN Relief and Works Agency.]
