Reacting to a recent article by U.S. National Security Adviser Tony Lake in FOREIGN AFFAIRS magazine, in which Lake discusses what he calls the double containment policy, 'Aziz told INA that these advisers are involving their president in incorrect positions and pushing U.S. policy in the region to a dead end. Tariq 'Aziz added that the position announced by U.S. National Security Adviser Tony Lake -- in which he adopts the views of his professional Zionist assistant, Martin Indyk -- reflects a rancorous, hostile, colonialist attitude, as well as the shallow thinking of U.S. President Bill Clinton's advisers. 'Aziz said: Tony Lake speaks of peoples and nations as if he is playing a computer game. He forgets the facts of history and the will of the peoples, which, in the end, is the decisive factor that determines results. Tariq 'Aziz explains that this adviser, who lacks sufficient knowledge of history, the social and political facts of the region, and conditions inside Iraq, cannot provide any convincing evidence to prove the policy he is promoting has achieved any of its objectives. He noted that the insistence on maintaining the blockade against Iraq is not only a hostile and evil course, but is also the wrong course and will not achieve any of the declared objectives stated by the U.S. policy planners. He stressed that Iraq is a deep-rooted country that has a superb ability to stand fast and that its people are strongly behind their national leadership and have proved this on the ground. He also said the reports Tony Lake mentions about the domestic situation inside Iraq are silly and are based on sources with no credibility whatsoever. This information, 'Aziz added, is given to the U.S. Administration by elements who are paid for their worthless services by U.S. intelligence services and the governments of Jabir [Kuwait] and Fahd [Saudi Arabia]. Tariq 'Aziz said the game of containing peoples and states by applying pressure and extortion is a losing game that will lead to a dead end. He said the correct way to build security and stability in the region and the world is to show respect for the will of the peoples and their legitimate interests, and to deal with them in a civilized manner. Regarding Iraq's position on issues of security and stability in the region that were discussed by Tony Lake, the deputy prime minister said: Iraq was, and will remain, a principal factor influencing security and stability in the region. The policy of weakening Iraq that the United States has been following will not improve the state of security and stability, as suggested by Lake. Instead, it has led to increasing tension and chaos, and led, in effect, to indirect U.S. occupation of the Arabian Peninsula and the Gulf. It also led -- and this is clearly a fact -- to the impoverishment of the states of the Peninsula and the Gulf and the squandering of their wealth. These states were very rich before the aggression against Iraq, but are now in debt and have lost all their reserves. Their future is no longer guaranteed. This reality is one of the factors threatening security and stability in the region. These facts also refute this shallow and wrong course which Clinton's advisers are promoting. Tariq 'Aziz said: These advisers are involving their president in wrong positions. In the most recent letter they prepared for him to send to Congress on policy toward Iraq, they included lies and flagrant falsehoods. The content of that letter contradicts the statements and documents issued by the UN Security Council Special Commission and the International Atomic Energy Agency. It also includes silly allegations that do not agree with reason and logic or geographic facts in Iraq. 'Aziz added: Such advisers are pushing U.S. policy in the region to a dead end. The allies in the region, referred to by Lake in his article as pillars that guarantee this policy, are now weaker in all aspects -- political, economic, and security -- than they were before the aggression against Iraq. So, how can they guarantee for Mr. Lake the objectives he has drawn for U.S. policy in the region? Tariq 'Aziz said: Iraq has fulfilled its obligations as stipulated by UN Security Council resolutions. This dictates that Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687 should be implemented immediately and without setting any additional conditions.
