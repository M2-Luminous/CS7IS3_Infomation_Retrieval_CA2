The monitoring of the cease-fire and communication between the opponents would be secured by UNPROFOR according to the procedure coordinated with the legitimate authorities in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Bosnia-Herzegovina delegation also insists on guarantees for the unimpaired passage of humanitarian organizations throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina, the immediate release of all civilians held by the aggressor side, the unconditional and immediate opening of Tuzla airport for the delivery of goods for civilian purposes, the cessation of ethnic cleansing, and the effective implementation of all Security Council resolutions regarding the protection of security zones.
