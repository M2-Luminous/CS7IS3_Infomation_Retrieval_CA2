A Survey of Peasant Households in the Region"] [Text] Recently, 275 cadres of Hedi county in the Autonomous Region fanned out into the rural areas to conduct a large-scale peasant households survey; they came to understand peasants desires and demands through direct investigation into the basic conditions in rural areas and face-to-face contacts and exchanges with both the rural grass-roots cadres and peasants themselves. I. Reactions of Peasants A. The survey shows that 95.4 percent of the households considered the situation in rural area to be generally good, but 60.5 percent were ambivalent; while pleased that conditions are generally good, the peasants were worried that there are still numerous problems of concern to them. The situation is generally good, they felt, because the policy on contract responsibility remains effective, that this good policy was not altered but has continued to be refined since coming into effect; that under market guidance, rural production and the rural economy are on track to stable development and the trend shows that grain production and income are on the increase; and that rural livelihood has improved markedly and the peasants are fully confident that they will become well-off. With respect to problems in rural areas which have remained unsolved, however, the peasants expressed a great deal of concerns. 1) A majority of the households felt that agriculture is still in an unfavorable environment today, and some peasants compared the situation to two persistent sicknesses of "malaria" and "edema," [waxing and waning in enthusiasm for agriculture on one hand and an excessively bloated condition on the other] for although agriculture has long been considered to occupy an important position [in the economy], it is basically still weak. If the two "sicknesses" were not cured, it would be difficult for rural areas and the rural economy to advance to the next stage. 2) 87.4 percent were very much worried that policy measures designed to protect them and agriculture will continue, particularly measures to increase government input in agriculture, reduce the social burdens on peasants, control the unhealthy tendencies, and permit and encourage peasants to seek employment in secondary and tertiary industries in the cities. 3) The peasants surveyed anxiously looked forward to seeing their agricultural production and enterprises get in the market channels as soon as possible and having their income increased, but the gap between their need and the actual situation remains considerable. The survey demonstrates that irrational structure in rural enterprises is the greatest inhibiting factor. In 1992, among model village households, the ratios of income derived from grain, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline products and fishery were 73:3:17:2:5; the ratios of income from growing grain versus cash and other crops were 79:13:8, and nonfarm income was 40 percent of total income. In 24.3 percent of model village households, the per capita income was as low as 300 yuan. 4) The pressure of agricultural surplus labor in rural areas is increasingly severe. The annual labor transfer rate in model village households is only 0.8 percent, and one-third of the labor force is idle reflecting a trend of declining labor productivity; in over 70 percent of the households, real income is showing slow growth or negative growth. B. On rural reforms and rural policies, the survey shows that the peasants placed their greatest hope in both these areas, and their major demand is that reforms should be pursued even more rigorously to achieve breakthroughs proceeding on a foundation of basic policy stability. 1) 77.3 percent of the households felt that the joint household contract responsibility system should remain unchanged over the long term; 48.5 percent felt that changes would not be necessary in contract land and that the system can operate satisfactorily by voluntary transfer [of contract land]. 2) 54.2 percent considered that application of reforms and other policy measures should differentiate among households and not treat all of them equally, for income discrepancy is normal and some people should be permitted to become well-off first; but 28.9 percent felt that from the start attention should be paid to preventing the gap between rich and poor from growing too wide, and achieving common prosperity through coordinated reform policy measures. 3) All 100 percent of the households felt that rural reforms and policies should focus on the crucial issues of assisting peasants achieve breakthroughs in a market economy within a broad framework, particularly in breaking down the duality which divides urban and rural areas, and adjusting the enterprise structure and social services system. 4) 49.3 percent felt that further efforts should be made to perfect policy and reform measures and to coordinate with other plans as important as those for a market economy. In the survey, the peasants revealed four difficult issues in rural reform that must be addressed and resolved: First, the discrepancy between urban and rural reforms whereby many measures which benefit rural economic development and increase rural income cannot be implemented because of incompatibility with urban reforms. Second, with policies being formulated in different quarters, forceful coordination and supervision of policy implementation are lacking, and peasants themselves could hardly resolve policies which are contradictory; some good policies lack firmness and corollary measures to ensure their implementation; at present, insufficiently firm policies are a particularly notable problem. Third, the lack of clear-sighted policies which affect the crucial question of economic development today. Policies which peasants have anxiously awaited are still pending, creating numerous difficulties which peasants cannot solve in a timely way under condition of a market economy. Fourth, propaganda and education for peasants on reform policies are inadequate. Channels for peasants to learn about and understand these policies are limited, and feedback on peasants needs is not timely which affects the enthusiasm of peasants to participate in implementing the policies. C. Views toward the rural areas and economy. On evaluating the enthusiasm for production, especially grain production, views of the peasants varied considerably. The survey indicates that 59.3 percent of the households considered there is a future if agriculture is handled well; 63.4 percent felt that to ensure adequate grain production, continued efforts are required; 60.2 percent felt that with grain prices freed, and if grain can be sold under such conditions, they would be willing to increase input in agricultural production; and more than 90 percent felt that even if a large part of the labor force were diverted to various nonfarm pursuits and enterprises, contract land should not be abandoned. The peasants surveyed also gave their reactions to the various factors which affect grain production enthusiasm under the present system. 1) 40.7 percent felt that if the relative benefits of agriculture were to continue to decline and the grain market remained in its slump, they would consider abandoning farming; 2) 56.4 percent felt that when more grain is grown than can be sold, "prices obviously would drop given the glut in supplies." Some considered that given the current situation of grain in surplus and money in short supply, it is more important to hang on to cash and wait to see if protective policy measures would have any effect in reviving prices; 3) 16.2 percent felt that the current shortage of capital has resulted in insufficient agricultural input, and fragmentation of land use has affected raising of agricultural productivity. On the various avenues for developing the rural economy, views of the rural cadres and peasants are: 1) Developing the rural economy should begin by developing various forms of enterprises. Household enterprises should be preserved and their enterprise structure adjusted according to market demands. 2) It is necessary to take advantage of any opportunity to adjust the enterprise structure, particularly by allowing different forms of ownership to freely evolve in rural enterprises. In 1992, the income peasants households derived from rural enterprises was only 18.8 percent of their total income, lower than the national average but with considerable growth potential. 3) The collective economy should be firmly supported. In 1992 the villages surveyed had fixed assets valued at 35,318,500 yuan, averaging 318,100 yuan per village, which constituted an important productive force in the rural areas. To develop the collective economy at the village level, it is necessary to perfect a dual-level operating system by vigorously developing basic infrastructure enterprises, rural enterprises and strengthened services for rural areas. D. Views on development of the rural society. The survey shows the peasants to be eager for more rapid social development in the rural areas: 1) 85.7 percent felt that the pace of social development in rural areas should be stepped up; 90.5 percent would be willing to contribute some capital or labor toward building up and improving the rural areas and markets. 2) 82.6 percent felt that small cities, townships and market towns should be built up. 3) 27.8 percent indicated they would consider settling in such small cities, townships and market towns. In social development, which aspects should be emphasized in the near term? The peasants generally felt that building infrastructure facilities is important. 1) 51.6 percent felt that priority should be given to building up townships and villages to meet requirements of a developing market economy; 25.1 percent felt that social development should benefit village residents and improve village appearance; 22.4 percent felt that the focus should be on unifying water supply system to solve problems of potable and clean water. 2) 41.9 percent expressed concern over their feeling of insecurity due to the poor public security in certain parts of the region where such cases are increasing in number; they therefore felt that safety and security of peasant households should be given priority in any social development. 3) 92.4 percent advocated vigorous promotion and building of spiritual culture. All the households without exception wanted the authorities to grasp the problems with both hands and resolutely carry out the basic tasks of improving the peasant society. On promoting a spiritual culture, views of the peasants are: 1) Propaganda on law and order is inadequate, building of a legal system has been lagging, and understanding of the concept of a legal system is weak. On law and order propaganda, 50.3 percent said it has been sporadic; 18.9 percent said there has been no such propaganda. 2) The building of a spiritual culture is considered a soft task and this is reflected in work the government carries out in rural areas. 3) Many aspects of building a spiritual culture are divorced from the reality of peasants life, and activities which emphasize only form without firm substantive objectives have produced [unfavorable] side effects among the peasants. 4) Building a spiritual culture will naturally take a period of time and must take into account both [agricultural] production and the reality of peasants life. More than one-half of the households surveyed suggested that henceforth government work teams should be trained before they are sent to rural areas to carry out model propaganda education on a regular basis. E. Views toward grass-roots level development. According to estimates by agricultural cadres, 82 percent of the households considered the behavior of grass-roots level cadres to be good or basically good; 85.6 percent felt that the cadre-peasant relationship is harmonious. The peasants also felt, however, that there are too many such cadres, that "many dragons are not necessarily needed to fight drought." In model villages, there is an average of 5.8 cadres per village. The peasants felt that the basis of their assignment should be sending small numbers of well-trained cadres, numbers which peasants can afford to support and which will also fully demonstrate the cadre enthusiasm and potentials. Improving the grass-roots level cadres means first improving the party rank and file, that is the relatively uniform view of the peasants surveyed. The survey shows that 38.5 percent of the households felt that a majority of party rank and file are effective, but 18.9 percent do not have a very good basic impression of them in the rural areas. II. Hopes, Opinions and Demands of Peasants The peasants surveyed expressed some of their hopes, opinions and demands which may be summed up in terms of the following: 1. The peasants hoped that leaders at every level will visit rural areas, and come to their villages and households for face-to-face conversations and draw out what is in their hearts. At present, the real situation in rural areas becomes diluted as it is reported upward level by level, and there is discrepancy between propaganda and reality, e.g. over the extent to which peasants are supposed to be well-off today. 2. They hoped that central and local governments will be resolute in applying real efforts to carry work in rural areas; if agriculture is considered the foundation of the national economy, then work in this area should be given that degree of emphasis; with agriculture the topic of meetings, slogans and government documents, the peasants anxiously hoped that this emphasis will lead quickly to many good policies which will benefit them when implemented. 3. The party holds peasants in high regard and gives them an important political status, the peasants surveyed were most grateful and pleased. But despite the high political status, peasants felt that if they were not able to catch up economically, their social status will not be any higher. Today the urban-rural gap is getting wider, and the peasants though anxious cannot do anything about this; they therefore hoped that their leaders will truly open up the gates to the cities, tear down the "bamboo wattled wall," give more thoughts to how to increase peasants income, narrow the [rural and urban] discrepancy in incomes, and draw closer together the hearts and minds of both rural and urban residents. 4. Stabilizing and perfecting basic policies for rural areas please all the peasants surveyed. While at this time it is correct to emphasize stabilization of the joint household responsibility system, it is not enough, for many other policies should also be stabilized. For example, some peasants were afraid that the policy allowing them to develop individual enterprises may change and therefore held back from trying. 5. They hoped that as in the 1950s and 1960s, the authorities will integrate and blend together support coming from all quarters for the rural areas, and assist peasants to develop the economy and increase their income. In such a context, any action which hurts, cheats, discriminates, oppresses or tries to shallow up the peasants will immediately evoke a reaction such as that of people crying out to kill a rat seen running across the street. 6. Rural education is a major task of concern to several generations of peasants, and education should be the first task in developing the rural areas. Today, the transition in agriculture is difficult for peasants to manage, but many do so in the interest of their next generations. To help the rural economy become prosperous, the peasants hoped the government will do its best in the task of education. 7. To improve public security in society, it is necessary to begin in rural areas; if it is not done well there, and rural areas are insecure, then this will affect the cities. A coordinated approach to improving public security requires that attention be given to both urban and rural areas. 8. In dealing with corruption, major cases must not be allowed to drag on, and issues of administrative corruption must first be dealt with. At present, action to redress unhealthy tendencies in the enterprises has not been adequate, and the peasants hoped that more effort will be made. The best approach would be to focus on the worst model and openly attack it within a broad framework. 9. More efforts should be made to train leadership cadres for rural areas. Selected for training should be persons of ability who think for themselves, who work with their hands and who rely on their labor and talent to produce wealth. III. Issues That Require Effective Implementation Judging by the situation revealed in this large-scale households survey, and considering the coming period of intensified rural reforms and accelerated development of the rural economy, the following issues will require major implementation efforts from a macro standpoint: 1. Strengthen and nurture the basic rural enterprise units by stabilizing the overall situation in rural areas. Survey results demonstrate that in the Autonomous Region, the work in stabilizing and perfecting the household contract responsibility system in the context of a dual-level enterprise system has been effective and should continue. In perfecting both systems, reforms and policies should aim at solving new contradictions that emerge, particularly on the key issue that in rural economic development, rural households be made the basic enterprise units which need to accommodate demands of a developing market-based economy. To raise the level of household enterprises, we need to promote rural market development. At the same time, our policy should create advantageous conditions for building and perfecting socialized services for the rural areas. 2. Vigorously develop high-quality and high-efficiency agriculture and raise the benefit ratio of agriculture. To achieve this type of agriculture, it is necessary to put economic efficiency and market demands first as we change from concentrating on quantitative increase in production to emphasizing raising qualitative benefits. We should aim for major breakthroughs in reforms by vigorously adjusting the rural enterprise structure, establishing conditions favorable to market development of pillar enterprises within the Autonomous Region, accelerating development of enterprises with good benefits ratios, vigorously developing new enterprises, and promoting the unification of production and sales. We should aim to combine breakthroughs in key areas with growth in all areas, to establish agricultural model demonstration areas, and to intensify development of improved product variety, grade and quality. 3. Through breakthrough reform of the households registration system, accelerate unification of rural and urban areas. An important aspect of the deepening rural reforms is to break down the dual economic setup and system. We should first remove restrictions on rural households then encourage the peasants to take jobs in secondary and tertiary industries in cities, townships and market towns and, through the momentum and indirect effects of this trend, promote social development in rural areas and unification of rural and urban areas. 4. To put agriculture and the rural economy within the overall national economic strategy, support further multifaceted development. We should effectively implement the "agricultural law," guarantee that financial input in agriculture will increase by fixed percentages on a yearly basis, widen the scope of credit support for agricultural development and adjust the rural enterprise structure. We should support internal liquidity of agricultural cooperative funds. We should develop new approaches and measures to provide overall social support to agriculture and activities in rural areas, and develop various kinds of alliances and cooperations. 5. Based on demands created by the changing economic system, strengthen the building of a spiritual culture. To do so requires that we strengthen efforts to deal with the basic tasks, change our approach from focussing on form to concentrating on substance, and take into account peasants thinking and rural reality in developing effective activities. In the current period and foreseeable future, we need to administer the rural areas according to regulations and allow democratic management to come to the fore. 6. Earnestly strengthen the leadership for work in rural areas. First, we should quickly establish a consolidated leadership structure for work in rural areas under the direct supervision of the party and government, strengthen organization and coordination of any work with peasants, and carry out effective analysis and supervision of policy measures and macro-level guidance. Second, based on demands of the Central Government, built basic-level organizations in rural areas in stages within a three to five year period. We should concentrate on improving the party organization before any basic-level organizations in rural areas, educating party members before rural cadres, raising the quality of party rank and file before the peasants, and finally developing and shaping teams of party cadres who possess firm and forceful leadership and can take the lead [to energize the masses]. Third, change and improve on methods to evaluate performance of leadership by using peasants real income increase as criterion to judge effectiveness of the cadre teams and of the support given by leadership and government departments at every level for developing the rural economy and increasing peasants income.
