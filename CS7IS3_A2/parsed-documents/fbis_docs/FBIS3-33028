While opposition deputies view the U.S. warning as a wake-up call for the government to adopt a firm stand against the promoters of violence, Arena [Nationalist Republican Alliance] Deputy Gloria Salguero Gross says the violence has its origins in the past. During his speech to the congress, Atwood said that friendly countries are concerned about the escalation of violence reported over the past few days in El Salvador. Nevertheless, Salguero Gross said that incidents reported thus far have been isolated cases that should not be sources of concern. [Begin Salguero recording] I believe the irrational events that have taken place lately are normal following the violence our country has experienced. However, each and every Salvadoran should take an interest in putting at a distance those individuals who still have sick minds and destructive thoughts. [end recording] Meanwhile, the opposition takes a different view. In their opinion, Atwood's warning exposes the government's lack of interest in resolving the violence issue and in severely punishing the perpetrators of violent acts which, in the opinion of many deputies, may block economic aid to El Salvador if it is not resolved in a timely manner. [Begin recording] [First unidentified congressman] The government has shown a lack of interest in resolving the problem. There are such cases as the National Civilian Police and the violence that prevails among political party members. It is obvious that the government has much to do in this area. [Second unidentified congressman] It is up to the government to pay attention to this issue and to attempt to counteract any form of violence, regardless of where the perpetrators may be or the level of influence they may have in the decisionmaking process. [end recording] Over the past few days there have been attacks on members of political parties, which have heightened fears of an escalation of violence that could hamper the political campaigns which, up until early February, remained normal.
