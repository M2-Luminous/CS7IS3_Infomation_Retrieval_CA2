Bidders should refer also to paragraph 14(g) of this Notice for specific survey requirements. See also paragraph 14(i).) (a) ``Archaeological resource'' means any prehistoric or historic district, site, building, structure, or object (including shipwrecks); such term includes artifacts, records, and remains which are related to such a district, site, building, structure, or object (16 U.S.C. 470w(5)). ``Operations'' means any drilling, mining, or construction or placement of any structure for exploration, development, or production of the lease. (b) If the Regional Director (RD) believes an archaeological resource may exist in the lease area, the RD will notify the lessee in writing. The lessee shall then comply with subparagraphs (1) through (3). (1) Prior to commencing any operations, the lessee shall prepare a report, as specified by the RD, to determine the potential existence of any archaeological resource that may be affected by operations. The report, prepared by an archaeologist and a geophysicist, shall be based on an assessment of data from remote-sensing surveys and of other pertinent archaeological and environmental information. The lessee shall submit this report to the RD for review. (2) If the evidence suggests that an archaeological resource may be present, the lessee shall either: (i) Locate the site of any operation so as not to adversely affect the area where the archaeological resource may be, or (ii) Establish to the satisfaction of the RD that an archaeological resource does not exist or will not be adversely affected by operations. This shall be done by further archaeological investigation, conducted by an archaeologist and a geophysicist, using survey equipment and techniques deemed necessary by the RD. A report on the investigation shall be submitted to the RD for review. (3) If the RD determines that an archaeological resource is likely to be present in the lease area and may be adversely affected by operations, the RD will notify the lessee immediately. The lessee shall take no action that may adversely affect the archaeological resource until the RD has told the lessee how to protect it. (c) If the lessee discovers any archaeological resource while conducting operations on the lease area, the lessee shall report the discovery immediately to the RD. The lessee shall make every reasonable effort to preserve the archaeological resource until the RD has told the lessee how to protect it.
