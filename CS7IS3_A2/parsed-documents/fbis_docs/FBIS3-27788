Professor Marut Bunnak, speaker of the House of Representatives and president of the Parliament of the Kingdom of Thailand, has arrived in Vientiane for an official friendship visit to our country. The visit is scheduled to take place from 1 to 3 February. On this glorious occasion, residents of Vientiane as well as the multiethnic Lao people throughout the country, together with leaders and all members of the National Assembly of the LPDR, would like to welcome the parliamentary delegation of the Kingdom of Thailand and extend it their warmest salutations. The Lao people are also elated and highly honored to have an opportunity to welcome the high-level state guests of the parliament of a neighboring country, who have brought with them to the Vientiane residents and all the multiethnic Lao people the spirit of solidarity and neighborliness of the Thai people. The peoples of Laos and Thailand are neighboring peoples who have maintained the traditions of fraternal affection and solidarity since ancient times. The two peoples have adhered to a similar, fine culture and customs. They can also understand each other's language without having to resort to interpreters. With these fine traditions of relations, though there have been certain difficulties and occasional disputes over the border issue in the past, the two sides have successfully settled the difficulties and disputes on the basis of the spirit of fraternity and respect for each other's independence and sovereignty. They have together continued to systematically settle the remaining problems based on the principles of international law and the concrete benefits for the two peoples and countries. Based on the aforesaid spirit, the relations between the two countries have been developed in many respects: for example, in the economic field. Over recent years, especially following the implementation of the policy of building a market-oriented economy and broadening the economic cooperation with foreign countries, relations and cooperation in various fields -- as, for example, in investment for doing business with Thailand -- have been rapidly expanded. At present, most investors making investments in Laos are from Thailand. The exchanges of trade and the visits between the Lao and Thai peoples, in particular the legal economic activities carried out along the border areas of the two countries, have significantly contributed to building and developing the countries and improving the living conditions of the two peoples with each passing day. All these have served as favorable conditions for the peoples of the two countries to achieve mutual understanding, as well as to check and smash schemes and acts of ill-intentioned elements, who have intended to disrupt and sabotage the Lao-Thai relations, in order to create a good atmosphere for the opening of the Mekong bridge -- the first Lao-Thai friendship bridge -- scheduled to be held in April this year. During the visit to the LPDR on this occasion, H.E. Prof. Marut Bunnak and his parliamentary delegation of the Kingdom of Thailand will pay courtesy calls on H.E. Nouhak Phoumsavan, president of state, and H.E. Khamtai Siphandon, prime minister of the LPDR. Noteworthy is that the Thai parliamentary delegation will also hold talks with a LPDR National Assembly delegation to discuss ways of increasingly promoting and expanding the existing bilateral relations and cooperation. H.E. Prof. Marut Bunnak and his delegation are also scheduled to visit various cultural places, including the Phakeo Buddha and the That Louang Pagoda temples, and a number of economic establishments in Vientiane municipality. Our Vientiane residents, as well as all multiethnic Lao people throughout the country, wish the Thai parliamentary delegation glorious success in the official friendship visit to the LPDR on this occasion in order to significantly contribute to strengthening the fraternal solidarity and friendship between the two peoples of Laos and Thailand and enhancing relations and cooperation in the economic field between the two countries as well as in the legislative field between the National Assembly of the LPDR and the Parliament of the Kingdom of Thailand. May the fraternal friendship and cooperation between the National Assembly of the LPDR and the Parliament of the Kingdom of Thailand be increasingly developed and strengthened!
