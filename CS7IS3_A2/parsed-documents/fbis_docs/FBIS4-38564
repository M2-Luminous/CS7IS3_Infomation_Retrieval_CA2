He was conciliatory and optimistic with regard to the current crisis in Crimea. For three days now we have been awaiting the outcome of the Russia-Ukraine negotiations in Moscow to assess whether Crimea has any chance of escaping the same terrible fate already suffered by other "hot" outlying regions of Russia, although it is true that in these other regions Russia was up against states even more vulnerable than Ukraine. On Wednesday 25 May, both sides announced that a further wait would be required while the experts draw up "in 10 to 12 days" a "detailed" agreement on how the Black Sea Fleet is to be split up. This is the fourth time in less than two years that Kiev and Moscow have postponed an agreement on this problem which risks escalating even further. Nevertheless, the same day, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko, who is in Paris to attend the Stability in Europe Conference, presented the main points of a solution which he considered to be almost within reach: As planned, the Russians will keep their major base in Sebastopol, while the Ukrainian Naval Command (controlling 18 percent of the ships) will be installed a little further, in Balaklava. The other bases of the divided fleet will be detailed in "separate, case-by-case agreements based on their location." In short, they would then get down to the serious business of the financial arrangements. For Mr. Zlenko "does not believe" that Crimea risks a conflagration, even if "there are parallels with what happened in Transnistria [as published] and Abkhazia." These two regions of Moldavia and Georgia, respectively, whose population consists mainly of Russians or Russian allies, have experienced civil war in which Moscow took the side of the separatists, even though Russia is now supervising negotiations between these forces and their former administrations. In the Ukrainian minister's view: "These bitter experiences will serve as a lesson, showing us that everyone is a loser when a military solution is attempted; you know, the Abkhazians today are in a most unenviable situation." He continued: "That is why in Crimea we have already chosen preventive diplomacy." He stressed in passing that his country had not waited for Mr. Balladur to come up with a security pact for central and eastern Europe, in which Russia was invited to participate out of decency. Mr. Zlenko again denied that any Ukrainian military reinforcements had been sent to Crimea, as had been reported and vigorously condemned by the Russian media. In Kiev on Wednesday, a delegation from the pro-Russian Crimean Government agreed to temporarily freeze the application of its virtually separatist Constitution in exchange for the creation of joint working groups by the Kiev and Crimean Parliaments -- a first step toward federal-type relations. As for President Kravchuk, he recognized that "we cannot ignore the fact that the Russian majority in Crimea will always tend to look to Moscow." Mr. Zlenko said that Crimea could have a status similar to a "special economic zone," but there was still no question of the Ukraine becoming a federation: "Our opinion polls show that this is not a pressing issue," he said. He described as "stories made up by journalists" the reports of cossack volunteers arriving in Crimea and similar preparations under way in the opposing ultranationalist paramilitary camp in western Ukraine. Although these "stories" are worrying, with two Armed Forces taking up positions in the peninsula, the Crimean crisis is not on the agenda at the Paris Stability Conference. According to the hosts, it "directly" concerns only those countries looking to join the European Union and which are not already "in a crisis situation." Mr. Zlenko and his eight-man delegation object to this: "We are here as full participants in the conference, not as guests or observers. In this way, Ukraine wants to show that we must not continue with the policy of dividing Europe, but should instead unite around shared principles those people who consider that this, today, is their conference and those who are supposed to be on the other side of the fence." Does this "fence" separate Russia and Ukraine? The response given by Mr. Zlenko, well-versed in Soviet diplomacy, shows the road that has been taken since the swaggering declarations made in the initial stages of Ukrainian independence: "I must still tell you the most important thing: Russia cannot be excluded from the security system that has to be created in Europe. That is logical, the world must move on and shed the stereotypes of confrontation..."
