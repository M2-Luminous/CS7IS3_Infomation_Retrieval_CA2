The statement points out that the announcement of the NATO ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs with a threat to bomb their positions aggravates the Yugoslavian crisis still more. According to the authors of this document, the question concerns "an open interference" on the part of the NATO countries and the position of the Russian Foreign Ministry looks "unclear." In order to overcome the conflict the deputies proposed to the Russian president and government to address the UN with an initiative to remove economic sanctions with respect to Yugoslavia and to prevent bombardment of the former Yugoslavia territory by using its right to a veto in the Security Council. In addition, the authors of this statement appealed to Viktor Chernomyrdin's government to render economic and humanitarian aid to Yugoslavia's peoples. The Russian State Duma has been recommended to send a parliamentary delegation to Yugoslavia and to the conflict zone to examine the situation in the region.
