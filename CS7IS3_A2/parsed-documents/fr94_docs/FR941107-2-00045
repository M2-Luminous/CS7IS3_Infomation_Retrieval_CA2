FR941107-2-00045 FR941107-2-00011 On September 8, 1994, in the case of Kemira Fibres Oy v. United States , the Court ruled that the Department was required to revoke the antidumping finding on April 1, 1993. The Court, citing ``the language and character'' of 19 CFR 353.25(d)(4), concluded that ``as no interested party requested an administrative review of the fiber by the last day of the Finding's fifth anniversary month although Commerce solicited requests for administrative review, it was incumbent upon Commerce to conclude that the domestic industry was not interested and to revoke the Order on April 1, 1993. Commerce is now required to: (a) Revoke the Order on the fiber, (b) terminate the administrative review of the fiber for 1993&hyph;94, and (c) end the suspension of liquidation of entries of Kemira's imports.'' Kemira Fibres Oy v. United States , 18 CIT at XXXX , Slip Op. 94&hyph;139 at 16. Scope of the Order Imports covered by the revocation are shipments of viscose rayon staple fiber, except solution dyed, in noncontinuous form, not carded, not combed and not otherwise processed, wholly of filaments (except laminated filaments and plexiform filaments). This product is currently classifiable under Harmonized Tariff Schedules (HTS) item numbers 5504.10.00 and 5504.90.00. The HTS numbers are provided for convenience and Customs purposes. The written description of the scope of the finding remains dispositive. Actions Pursuant to Court's Judgment The Department will instruct the U.S. Customs Service to end the suspension of liquidation of entries of Kemira's imports. The Department will take no further action with respect to any administrative review under section 751(a) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, 19 U.S.C. 1675(a), relating to the fiber from Finland. Finally, the Department hereby revokes the antidumping finding on the fiber from Finland (44 FR 17156, March 21, 1979), revocation being effective April 1, 1993. This revocation applies to all unliquidated entries of the fiber from Finland entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after April 1, 1993. The Department will instruct the U.S. Customs Service to proceed with liquidation of all unliquidated entries of this merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after April 1, 1993, without regard to antidumping duties with respect to those entries. This notice is in accordance with Section 751(c) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, 19 U.S.C. 1675(c), and 19 CFR 353.25(d) (1993). Dated: October 31, 1994. Susan G.
