A. Ryndyuk, Institute of Modeling Problems in Power Engineering, Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, Kiev; UDC 68.103] [Abstract] Systems of differential equations are commonly used to mathematically model objects. Nonlinear systems can be described using the theory of differential Taylor transforms. Models based on these transforms can be solved quickly. The simplicity of representing Taylor models and organization of the computing process is the basis for the synthesis of functional transform structures. Here the mathematical model is converted into a spectral model by replacing functions and actions on functions with T-spectra and operations on functions with operations on differential spectra. The spectral model is a system of recurrent equations. The desired functions are found in the form of segments of Taylor power series. Linear and nonlinear systems of equations can be studied with Taylor notation. The example of finding the T-spectrum of trignometric and hyperbolic functions is presented. The parallel computing structure synthesized here can reproduce T-models of trigonometric functions in real time. The advantages of a parallel specialized computer over a personal computer are shown, specifically, the scheme presented in this article is a factor of 80 faster than a YeS-1840 personal computer.
