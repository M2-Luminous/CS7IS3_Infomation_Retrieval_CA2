What is required from the UN Security Council is neither strange nor abnormal. What is required is only a resolution in harmony with its previous resolutions. What is required is a resolution entrenching the objective for which the Security Council and the international organization were established. What is required is a resolution condemning the massacre, defining international protective measures so that the massacre will not be repeated, and demanding the disarming of the settlers who came to our land to commit massacres. However, days and weeks have passed since the massacre, and no such resolution has been issued. Why? Because the United States is exerting pressure to prevent such a resolution. The United States believes there is no need for resolutions because Israel alone can take such measures, can protect the Palestinians from itself, and can put pressure on its settlers to hold their terrorism at bay. Efforts are being exerted to issue such a resolution by the permanent members of the Security Council, such as Russia, France, Britain, and China, as well as by many European, Arab, Islamic, and African countries. However, the United States, the most powerful country in the world -- which speaks day and night about human rights, international legitimacy, and sponsoring the peace process -- is resisting this desire for justice by the international community and insists on its support for, bias toward, and collusion with Israel; that is, in favor of terrorism, crime, and massacre. If we scrutinize the U.S. stand we will find the United States saying to us: Israel is the enemy and the arbiter; Israel is the killer and the savior. This is strange and abnormal logic that runs counter to justice and history. It is logic that pours salt in the wounds and makes those with faith in peace question their faith. This logic destroys the foundations of the peace process. If this happens, the Palestinians are not the only losers. All parties, including Israel and the protector of its terrorism, the United States, will also lose. Does power and force blind people to this extent? Will Israel continue to commit crimes and seek the protection of the United States?
