Found Themselves Faced With the Market"] [Text] The first week of the new year has literally made every inhabitant of Kazakhstan face up to the market. The policy pursued by the republic's government last year of artificially containing inflation and the attempts to protect the population by means of the usual "socialist distribution methods" ended in failure. Kazakhstan has adopted extraordinary measures to regulate the funds channeled into consumption. Journalists have called the decree of the State Commission for the Introduction of a National Currency, published here during the first days of January, "the first dose of shock therapy" in the republic. According to this decree, wages and all forms of remuneration will now be coordinated strictly with the amount and quality of work done. So Kazakhstan's experiment in "distributive entry into the market" is over. What is essentially the first attempt, founded on market laws, to lay a reliable foundation for increasing the amounts of output, goods, and services produced has begun. The aim set by the Kazakhstan Government is more than obvious, although the local press is in no hurry to comment on the deep-seated reasons for what happened. Moreover, the true dynamics of the inflation which gripped the republic were persistently concealed from the republic's inhabitants for many months. It is vexing that the unprecedentedly large increase in food prices announced 5 January also passed without comment in the press. For example, the cost of one liter of milk increased sixfold! This means that one more good intention of the republic's government -- that "everything will be settled as before" -- has burst. The fixed prices introduced by the republic's government two months ago in connection with the switch to a national currency have failed to withstand the pressure of inflation. All fixed prices, with the exception of bread prices, were abolished as of 5 January. This means that Kazakhstan is the first country in the Central Asian region to abandon regulated food prices and has been forced to let them float freely. "Russia has survived a price shock, and Kazakhstan will also cope with it," local journalists sympathizing with the parliamentary bloc of optimistic marketeers commented on the present situation.
