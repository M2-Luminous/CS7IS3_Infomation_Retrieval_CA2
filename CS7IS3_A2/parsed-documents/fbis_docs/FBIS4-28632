At a meeting with his South Korean counterpart Kim Chol-su, Wu said, "We decided to formally import Korean-made automobiles although we are in a difficult situation." China's trade minister, meanwhile, asked the Korean side to cooperate in importing Chinese products. Wu noted that it would be difficult for China to import Korean-made vehicles on a cash basis, hinting that Beijing wants to import the automobiles on a counterpurchase basis. During the meeting, the Korean side demanded that China allow in 5,000 Korean cars. The Chinese, however, failed to set a specific target, according to a Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy official. "We think the export contract will pave the way for formal exports of Korean-made automobiles to China," the official said. "Daewoo's export contract will not be just a one-time contract and domestic manufacturers could export (their cars) to China continually." Daewoo Motor Co. has signed a contract with a Chinese firm to ship out 5,000 Lemans, Espero and Prince autos to China around August or September, according to sources.
