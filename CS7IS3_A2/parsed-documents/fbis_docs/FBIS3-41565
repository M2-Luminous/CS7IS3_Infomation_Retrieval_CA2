The statement urged that the incumbent authorities of Japan and Russia should promptly stop the criminal acts of dumping nuclear waste into the East Sea of Korea and the Pacific Ocean and, at the same time, remove the already dumped nuclear waste from the sea without delay and punish those responsible for it. ``If Russia and Japan continue with their illegal nuclear waste dumping in disregard of the aspiration of mankind for environmental protection of the earth, they would be held wholly responsible for all the consequences arising therefrom,'' warned the statement. Recalling that Russia and Japan have annually dumped a large amount of nuclear waste into the East Sea of Korea and the Pacific Ocean illegally, it says: ``Such acts of Russia and Japan are a breach of the international conventions on protection and conservation of the sea environment; they are criminal acts of polluting and wrecking the sea environment and jeopardizing the lives of the population in the littoral countries.'' ``To protect and conserve the sea environment is a unanimous demand of the peoples in the littoral areas. And it is already stipulated under international agreement that radioactive waste, even less activated one, can never be dumped into the sea.'' ``Moreover, Russia and Japan, as signatories to the London conventions, are obligated to strive for the prevention of sea pollution.'' ``This notwithstanding, they are not only vyingly dumping nuclear waste but also releasing at random even liquid radioactive pollutants. We cannot but take a serious note of it.'' ``Such acts of Russia and Japan destroying the earth environment now are causing deep apprehensions and protests from the peoples in Asia and the rest of the world and environmental organizations.'' ``It is ridiculous, indeed, of Russia and Japan to vociferously urge us to `comply with the Nuclear Safeguards Agreement', while openly violating the international conventions, an act reminding us of a thief crying `stop thief!''' ``Japan must not try impudently to cover up its wicked acts in quickening its pace toward nuclear armament by taking issue with others, but give up the nuclear armament. And Russia, too, had better control its own nuclear weapons properly, instead of joining force in slinging mud at other countries, only bringing disgrace on itself.'' ``The DPRK State Environmental Committee expresses the hope that the international organisations concerned and the governments of all countries will pay due attention to it and exercise their influence so that nobody ever can destroy the ecological environment of the East Sea of Korea and the Pacific Ocean.''
