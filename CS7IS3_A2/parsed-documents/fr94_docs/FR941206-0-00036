FR941206-0-00036 FR941206-0-00007 The PBGC anticipates, however, that particularly in the first year of its participation in the tax refund offset program, the debts it refers to the IRS will include debts as to which procedures previously provided do not satisfy the requirements of new §2609.33. For example, the PBGC anticipates referring debts relating to premium payments due under section 4007 of ERISA (29 U.S.C. 1307) and part 2610 of the PBGC's regulations. Determinations with respect to premiums, interest, and late payment penalties are covered by part 2606 of the PBGC's regulations (29 CFR part 2606), Rules for Administrative Review of Agency Decisions. Part 2606 currently provides that (subject to limited exceptions) an aggrieved person must request reconsideration of an initial PBGC determination as to premiums, interest, and/or late payment penalties within 30 days of the date of the determination and that the request must reference all pertinent information in the PBGC's possession and include any additional information believed to be relevant (§§2606.33 and 2606.35). Thus, the PBGC has not been providing such debtors with at least 60 days to present evidence that all or part of a debt is not past-due or not legally enforceable, as is required for tax refund offset (§2609.33(b)(2)). Nor has the PBGC notified such debtors of its intention to refer a debt for tax refund offset (§2609.33(b)(1)). Before referring these debts to IRS, the PBGC will provide debtors any additional procedures required by new §2609.33. In order that the PBGC in the future may provide, in a single review, procedures that comply both with this subpart and with part 2606 (where applicable), the PBGC is amending §§2606.33 and 2606.53. The amendment adds language that will require the PBGC, in a case where administrative review includes a procedure in §2609.33, to provide for a 60-day (or longer) period for requesting review (and, hence for presenting evidence that all or part of a debt is not past-due or not legally enforceable). The PBGC currently has no plans to use agents, or persons other than PBGC employees acting on its behalf, to consider evidence under §2609.33. Should it decide to do so in the future, a debtor would be accorded 30 days, or more, from the date of that person's determination within which to request review by the Director of the Financial Operations Department or his or her designee (§2609.33(b)(3)), as required by IRS regulations (§301.6402&hyph;6(d)(2)). Section 2609.33(c) provides for consumer reporting agency disclosure. Agency reporting of delinquent debts to a consumer reporting agency will comply with the Federal Claims Collections Standards (see 4 CFR 102.5) and with the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552a). However, the vast majority of debts to the PBGC are not consumer debts subject to this requirement. The PBGC's Financial Operations Department will have primary responsibility for PBGC participation in the IRS's tax refund offset program (see §2609.1(b)(1)). As indicated in §§2609.33(c) and 2609.34, this includes responsibility for consumer reporting agency disclosure and for referral of debt for tax refund offset (including assuring that referrals contain information, and are corrected, as required by IRS regulations (§301.6402&hyph;6 (e) and (f)). Ascertaining indebtedness and other aspects of agency collection activities will continue to be handled by the PBGC organizational unit with functional responsibility for the type of claim involved (see §2609.1(b)(2)). (Applicable assignments of responsibilities are set forth in the mission and functions statements issued by the Executive Director and included (along with organization charts) in the PBGC Directives Manual as section 30&hyph;1 of Part GA (General Administration.)
