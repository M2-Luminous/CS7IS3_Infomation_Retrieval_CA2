Indonesia also sends its condolences to the families of the 10 others who were killed in clashes with Israeli soldiers. In line with Palestinian Liberation Organization leader `Arafat's request for assistance from the Nonaligned Movement [NAM], Indonesia -- as chairman of the NAM -- will immediately consider the necessary moves to call an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council. This will show our support for the Palestinians.
