The "affair" resulted from the appearance on Croatian Television's "TV Parliament" program "several evenings ago" of Vice Vukojevic, a deputy in the Croatian parliament and, until recently, chief of the security service in the Croatian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who was wearing the uniform of the Croatian Defense Council [HVO], the army of Herceg-Bosna. Moreover, POLITIKA reports, Vukojevic, responding to a question from the program's host, "coolly answered" that he had been "a member of the HVO since 11 April 1992" with the rank of brigade commander, a rank above that of colonel. What is interesting about this affair, POLITIKA observes, is that Vukojevic's appearance in "a foreign uniform" provoked "quite a bit of surprise" among the Croatian public and even astonishment that Vukojevic was a member of the army of another country while holding a high position in the security service of Croatia. Of course, there are very few people naive enough to believe sincerely the official claims of Croatian leaders that the Republic of Croatia is not directly involved in the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, POLITIKA states, adding that even Stipe Mesic, the president of the Croatian Assembly, could not deny this "very unpleasant fact." POLITIKA cites Mesic's statement in the 30 January edition of the Split newspaper FERAL TRIBUNE: "Nothing can be concealed, nothing denied, everything is accessible to everyone, even to foreign officials. Vice Vukojevic is a deputy in the Croatian parliament, and I saw him, just as you did, on television in the uniform of a foreign country. I do not know how he went there and how he received his rank, because I was caught by surprise, just as you were. Regardless of how it happened, this is the first case of a deputy appearing in the military uniform of another country." POLITIKA states that the Croatian public knew that "something serious was happening with regard to this issue" when the Social Democratic Union issued information that in Zagreb alone about 2,000 Croatian citizens born in Bosnia-Herzegovina were mobilized overnight and, following training in the Kroacija [formerly Marshal Tito] Barracks in New Zagreb, sent to the front in Bosnia. Those who refused to go were sent to a military prison, POLITIKA notes, adding that Croatian lawyer Slobodan Budak has lodged appeals about the imposition of army prison sentences on two Croat soldiers who refused to fight in another country, i.e., Bosnia-Herzegovina. One soldier was a member of the 175th Brigade in Zagreb and the other a member of the 101st Brigade in Bosanska Posavina.
