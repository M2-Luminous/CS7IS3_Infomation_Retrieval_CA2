Yu. Osipov; UDC 535.8:535.514:535.317.61] [Abstract] Experimental realization of a laser beam diffraction on micro-transparancies of synthesized interference pattern with a 1.5 mm diameter indicates that in the Frauenhofer diffraction region, the wave field has a pseudo-caustic character exhibiting a characteristic flare and cell structure. This constitutes an experimental proof of the fact, that for the focusing systems with a meridional aberration of the third order coma, the caustic diffraction fields, produced in the focal plane, and complex interference fields, formed in the Twyman- Green interferometer and describing the deviation of the converging wave front from the reference sphere, are qualitatively related by the Fourier transform.
