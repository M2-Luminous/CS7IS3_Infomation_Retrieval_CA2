"We demand the release of those who were not convicted," before the fall of 'Id al-Fitr at the beginning of next week, IAF parliamentary bloc spokesman Hamzah Mansur said Tuesday [8 March]. Nine people were injured in last month's blasts at the Rivoli theatre in Amman and Salwa movie theatre in al-Zarqa'. Informed sources had earlier linked the arrested suspects to what they called "the Afghans," which is a group of Jordanian Islamist fundamentalists who took part in the Afghan Mujahidin war against the former Soviet Union. IAF Deputy Bassam Omoush told the JORDAN TIMES that the IAF lawmakers have sent the government a memorandum in which they requested the release of the Islamist suspects but have received "no response yet." Mr. Mansur said that "massive arrests" were made in connection with the explosions, and those not convicted should be released to ensure justice and freedom. He said he "fully" supported the punishment of individuals who are proven gilty of involvement in "the crime," but added that justice should be carried out towards those innocent of the charges brought against them. A weekly tabloid Tuesday quoted IAF Deputy Muhammad 'Uwaydah as saying that he had witnessed the arrest of the IAF secretariat "despite the fact that the arrest warrant did not have the secretariat's name on it." AL-BILAD weekly also quoted Mr. 'Uwaydah as claiming that political parties were being "harassed by security forces" and that "democracy is being crippled by these random arrests." The tabloid quoted an unnamed senior member of the Muslim Brotherhood Movement as saying that Islamists were targets of "rumours and traps which are the making of our Jewish enemies, their agents and collaborators." According to AL-BILAD, the brotherhood official rejected accusations that the government was trying to "harm the Islamists reputation." "His Majesty King Husayn spent his life calling for Arab and Muslim unity. (The King's) awareness and political wisdom are enough reason for us not to believe" that the government is spreading rumours against the Islamists, the paper quoted the brotherhood leader as saying. IAF deputies are awaiting the return of Prime Minister 'Abd al-Salam al-Majali from his trip to Saudi Arabia to perform 'Umra, to "remind" the government of the issue, said Mr. Mansur.
