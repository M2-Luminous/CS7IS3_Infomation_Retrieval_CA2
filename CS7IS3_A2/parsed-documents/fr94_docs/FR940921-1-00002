FR940921-1-00002 FR940921-1-00001 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;127&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; de Havilland Model DHC&hyph;8&hyph;100 and &hyph;300 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain de Havilland Model DHC&hyph;8&hyph;100 and &hyph;300 series airplanes. This proposal would require an inspection to verify the integrity of the shield grounds for the cable harness of the electronic engine control (EEC), and correction of any discrepancy. This proposal also would require measurement of the electrical resistance of certain shield grounds, and repair, if necessary. This proposal is prompted by a report of an engine flameout after a lightning strike, due to several shields for the cable harness of the EEC not being properly grounded to the airframe. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent engine flameout due to insufficient protection of the EEC. DATES: Comments must be received by October 31, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;127&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. Comments may be inspected at this location between 9:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Comments Invited Interested persons are invited to participate in the making of the proposed rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified above. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments, specified above, will be considered before taking action on the proposed rule. The proposals contained in this notice may be changed in light of the comments received. Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the proposed rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report summarizing each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this proposal will be filed in the Rules Docket. Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;NM&hyph;127&hyph;AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. Availability of NPRMs Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;127&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. Discussion On April 25, 1989, the FAA issued AD 85&hyph;14&hyph;51 R2, amendment 39&hyph;6207 (54 FR 19875, May 9, 1989), which is applicable to certain de Havilland Model DHC&hyph;8&hyph;100 series airplanes. That AD requires revising the Limitations Section of the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) to prohibit takeoff, landing, and climb in the vicinity of lightning or thunderstorms; and to require continuous ignition operation during takeoffs, takeoff climb to 1500 feet above ground level, final approach, and landing within 5 nautical miles of lightning and thunderstorms. That AD also requires the installation of four modifications designed to protect the electronic engine control (EEC) from the effects of lightning strike, which, when accomplished, terminates the requirements of that AD and allows for the removal of the AFM limitations. Since issuance of that AD, Transport Canada Aviation, which is the airworthiness authority for Canada, has advised the FAA of a report of an engine flameout after a lightning strike on a Model DHC&hyph;8 series airplane. Modifications required by AD 85&hyph;14&hyph;51 R2 had been accomplished on that airplane. Investigation revealed that the engine flameout occurred because several shields for the cable harness of the EEC were not properly grounded to the airframe. This condition, if not corrected, could result in insufficient protection of the EEC and may lead to an engine flameout following a lightning strike. Bombardier has issued Service Bulletins S.B. 8&hyph;73&hyph;18 (for Model DHC&hyph;8&hyph;100 series airplanes) and S.B. 8&hyph;73&hyph;19 (for Model DHC&hyph;8&hyph;300 series airplanes), both dated April 29, 1994, which describe procedures for a visual inspection to verify the integrity of the shield grounds for the cable harness of the EEC, and correction of any discrepancy. The service bulletins also describe procedures for measurement of the electrical resistance of certain shield grounds, and repair, if necessary. The repair procedures consist of ensuring that the metal overbraid (which provides lightning protection for the EEC cable harness) is electrically bonded to the connector and the electrical receptacles are electrically bonded to the airframe. Transport Canada Aviation classified these service bulletins as mandatory and issued Canadian Airworthiness Directive CF&hyph;94&hyph;09, dated May 5, 1994, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in Canada. This airplane model is manufactured in Canada and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, Transport Canada Aviation has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of Transport Canada Aviation, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require a visual inspection to verify the integrity of the shield grounds for the cable harness of the EEC, and correction of any discrepancy. This AD also would require measurement of the electrical resistance of certain shield grounds, and repair, if necessary. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletins described previously.
