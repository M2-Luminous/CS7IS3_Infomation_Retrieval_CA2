Thousands of Zulus surged through Johannesburg's streets on Monday and eight marchers were shot dead outside the ANC's head office. The ANC claimed at a press conference the police had been told armed marchers planned to advance on the ANC's offices. A statement issued at the conference said Police Commissioner Gen Johan van der Merwe had been told on March 27 "of the dangers, and he undertook to ensure adequate measures were taken to protect life and property". The ANC said agreement had also been reached with Gen Koos Calitz who had agreed to erect roadblocks to prevent armed marchers from entering the central business district. ANC PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] Chairman Tokyo Sexwale said the failure to erect these roadblocks had allowed armed people to enter the city, which ultimately led to violence and loss of life. The ANC said police were deployed outside Shell House before the shootings but had "disappeared" by the time firing started. The organisation denied claims its members shot at marchers from high-rise buildings in the central business district. Journalists, peace monitors and witnesses claimed throughout the day that marchers frequently came under sniper fire from tall buildings. The ANC said its regional offices in Jeppe Street had come under fire early on Monday and security personnel had returned fire. It claimed its Shell House head office came under fire several times from Zulu marchers. ANC officials said their security personnel initially fired warning shots and then shot at a group of armed marchers when it became evident they planned to attack the building. The ANC's security personnel said they saw other Zulu marchers remove the weapons of the slain men in full view of the police. The ANC defended its security personnel's actions and said although it regretted the shootings "our security personnel behaved with impeccable forebearance and patience in the face of extreme provocation". The organisation claimed Monday's incident was part of a "general campaign to destabilise the PWV region and to revive the climate of terror and violence that plagued this region over the past four years". It claimed the "purpose of its perpetrators are crystal clear -- to make it impossible to hold free and fair elections which will clearly demonstrate whom the people of South Africa want as their government". The ANC also questioned the "timing of this fresh campaign of violence" which it said followed closely on the heels of the exposure of the so-called "third force". It also suggested the role played by the IFP's regional leadership in the day's events could not be seen as "accidental".
