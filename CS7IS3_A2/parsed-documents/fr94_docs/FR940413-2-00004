EFFECTIVE DATE: April 13, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Erik Warga or Mark Wells, Office of Antidumping Investigations, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230; telephone: (202) 482&hyph;0922 and (202) 482&hyph;3003, respectively. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On April 9, 1993 (58 FR 18374), the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the Federal Register notices of ``Opportunity to Request Administrative Review.'' In response to the request made by Petitioners, Chemetals Inc. and Kerr-McGee Chemical Corporation, the Department initiated the administrative review on May 27, 1993 (58 FR 30767) of the antidumping duty order on Electrolytic Manganese Dioxide (EMD) from Japan on April 17, 1989 (54 FR 15244). The review covers one manufacturer/exporter of the subject merchandise to the United States, Tosoh Corporation (TOSOH) during the period, April 1, 1992, through March 31, 1993. The Department is conducting this review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). As a result of this review, the Department has preliminarily determined to assess antidumping duties of 77.43 percent ad valorem based on best information available (BIA) for the period of review. Interested parties are invited to comment on these preliminary results. Scope of Review Imports covered by the review are shipments of electrolytic manganese dioxide. EMD is manganese dioxide (MnO 2 ) that has been refined in an electrolysis process. During the review period, such merchandise was classifiable under subheading 2820.10.000 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). The HTSUS subheading is provided for convenience and customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive. On January 6, 1992, the Department published a final scope ruling, Electrolytic Manganese Dioxide from Japan; Final Scope Ruling (57 FR 395; January 6, 1992), in which it affirmed that high-grade chemical manganese dioxide (CMD&hyph;U) is a ``later-developed product'' and is included within the scope of the order on EMD from Japan. For a detailed discussion of that ruling, see Electrolytic Manganese Dioxide from Japan; Preliminary Scope Ruling (56 FR 56977; November 7, 1991).
