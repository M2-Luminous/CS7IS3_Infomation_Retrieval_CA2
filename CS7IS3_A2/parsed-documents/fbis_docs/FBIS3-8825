Following talks here with Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic, Ogata said the situation in the northern Moslem enclave, which has been under siege from Bosnian Serb forces for nine months, was "of great concern to us." Bosnian Serb troops continued Tuesday to defy a United Nations Security Council demand issued a day earlier to lift the siege immediately to allow access for humanitarian convoys. Aid has been unable to reach Maglaj by road since October. The besieged communities have since then been forced to rely on air drops. Ogata said Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, whom she asked Tuesday to "exert his influence" over the besieging forces, had promised to look into ways of resolving the impasse. "I'm doing my very best to get access to this pocket. This is a very important urgent measure to take," for the 100,000 civilians deprived of necessary aid inside the enclave, she added. The Bosnian Serbs' continued intransigence was "really against the promise that the three parties, including very much the Serbs, have given me on November 18th." On that date the warring parties pledged to halt fighting in and around the Maglaj pocket to allow aid convoys access. Ogata stressed that the humanitarian situation in other parts of Bosnia had "improved enormously." "I do have to give recognition to all the parties in that sense," she added. "Conditions on the ground in Bosnia-Herzegovina are improving a great deal, and we are able to deliver (aid) much, much more easily all over the country." Ogata is due to travel to Sarajevo Wednesday morning for talks with Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic and Bosnia's UN Protection Force commander, General Sir Michael Rose. Wednesday afternoon she is hoping to visit both Croat and Moslem sectors of the southern Herzegovina city of Mostar. Ogata is due back in Geneva late Thursday after inspecting a sector of northern Croatia placed under UN protection.
