FR940928-2-00032 FR940928-2-00028 [OPP&hyph;180950; FRL&hyph;4909&hyph;4] Emergency Exemptions AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: EPA has granted specific exemptions for the control of various pests to the 12 States as listed below. Three crisis exemptions were initiated by various States. These exemptions, issued during the month of June 1994, except for the one in May 1994, are subject to application and timing restrictions and reporting requirements designed to protect the environment to the maximum extent possible. EPA has denied seven specific exemption requests from various States. Information on these restrictions is available from the contact persons in EPA listed below. DATES: See each specific and crisis exemption for its effective date. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: See each emergency exemption for the name of the contact person. The following information applies to all contact persons: By mail: Registration Division (7505W), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: 6th Floor, CS #1, 2800 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA, (703&hyph;308&hyph;8417). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: EPA has granted specific exemptions to the: 1. Arizona Department of Agriculture for the use of bifenthrin on melons to control the sweet potato, or silverleaf whitefly; June 6, 1994, to July 10, 1994. A request for this use was initially denied on April 15, 1994. The denial was based on the fact that an exemption issued for this pest problem for another chemical, imidacloprid, was expected to reduce whitefly populations to a level controllable with the registered alternatives. However, at the time of issuance of the imidacloprid exemption, some melons were too far along in their development in order to use imidacloprid once, at or near planting, according to use directions. Therefore, EPA issued this exemption for use of bifenthrin only on those melons that could not be treated under the exemption for imidacloprid. (Andrea Beard) 2. California Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Pesticide Regulation, for the use of myclobutanil on tomatoes to control powdery mildew; June 18, 1994, to June 17, 1995. (Susan Stanton) 3. Delaware Department of Agriculture for the use of clomazone on cucumbers to control weeds and grasses; June 24, 1994, to August 20, 1994. (Margarita Collantes) 4. Maryland Department of Agriculture for the use of clomazone on cucumbers to control weeds and grasses; June 24, 1994, to August 20, 1994. (Margarita Collantes) 5. Minnesota Department of Agriculture for the use of triclopyr on aquatic sites to control purple loopestrife; June 1, 1994, to September 30, 1994. (Libby Pemberton) 6. Nebraska Department of Agriculture for the use of bifenthrin on corn to control mites; June 24, 1994, to September 15, 1994. (Andrea Beard) 7. New Mexico Department of Agriculture for the use of bifenthrin on corn to control mites; June 24, 1994, to September 15, 1994. (Andrea Beard) 8. Oregon Department of Agriculture for the use of bifenthrin on strawberries to control weevils; June 16, 1994, to August 31, 1994. (Andrea Beard) 9. Oregon Department of Agriculture for the use of bifenthrin on raspberries to control weevils; June 7, 1994, to August 15, 1994. (Andrea Beard) 10. Texas Department of Agriculture for the use of bifenthrin on corn to control mites; June 24, 1994, to September 15, 1994. (Andrea Beard) 11. Texas Department of Agriculture for the use of esfenvalerate on sorghum to control sorghum midge; June 28, 1994, to September 30, 1994. Texas had initiated a crisis exemption this use. (Libby Pemberton) 12. Texas Department of Agriculture for the use of imidacloprid on broccoli, cauliflower, and cabbage to control the silverleaf whitefly; June 28, 1994, to June 27, 1995. A notice of receipt published in the Federal Register of June 8, 1994 (59 FR 29604); no comments were received. The situation was determined to be urgent and nonroutine. The silverleaf whitefly is a relatively new pest, and adequate control is not being achieved with the registered materials. Significant economic losses were expected. (Andrea Beard) 13. Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services for the use of clomazone on cucumbers to control weeds and grasses; June 24, 1994, to August 20, 1994. (Margarita Collantes) 14. Washington Department of Agriculture for the use of bifenthrin on raspberries to control weevils; June 7, 1994, to August 10, 1994. Washington had initiated a crisis exemption for this use. (Andrea Beard) 15. Washington Department of Agriculture for the use of bifenthrin on strawberries to control weevils; June 16, 1994, to September 30, 1994. (Andrea Beard) 16. Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection for the use of vinclozolin on snap beans to control white mold; June 24, 1994, to September 15, 1994. (Libby Pemberton) 17. Wisconsin Department of Agriculture for the use of metolachlor on spinach to control weeds and grasses; June 1, 1994, to July 1, 1994. (Margarita Collantes) Crisis exemptions were initiated by the: 1. Colorado Department of Agriculture on May 28, 1994, for the use of chlorpyrifos on barley to control the Russian wheat aphid. This program has ended. (Andrea Beard) 2. Texas Department of Agriculture on June 1, 1994, for the use of esfenvalerate on grain sorghum to control sorghum midge. This program is expected to last until September 30, 1994. (Libby Pemberton) 3. Washington Department of Agriculture on June 6, 1994, for the use of bifenthrin on raspberries to control weevils. This program has ended. (Andrea Beard) EPA has denied a specific exemption request from the: 1. Alabama Department of Agriculture and industries for the use of Pirate insecticide on cotton to control beet armyworms. A notice of receipt published in the Federal Register of May 25, 1994 (59 FR 27017). This specific exemption was denied because the proposed use poses an unreasonable risk to nontarget birds and aquatic organisms, including several endangered species. Although some growers may incur significant economic losses, the expected statewide losses do not justify the use of this unregistered pesticide on cotton. (Susan Stanton) 2. California Environmental Protection Agency (CEPA), Department of Pesticide Regulations, for the use of acephate on leaf lettuce to control green peach aphids. This specific exemption was denied because CEPA failed to demonstrate that an emergency condition exists. They claimed that an emergency resulted due to the development of resistance to registered alternatives; however, no data were submitted to document CEPA's claims. (Larry Fried) 3. Colorado Department of Agriculture for the use of permethrin on wheat and barley to control cutworms. This specific exemption was denied because of concerns regarding potential dietary risk from permethrin exposure and inadequate progress toward registration. (Andrea Beard) 4. Georgia Department of Agriculture for the use of permethrin on southern peas to control cowpea curculio. This specific exemption was denied because of concerns regarding potential dietary risk from permethrin exposure and inadequate progress toward registration. (Andrea Beard) 5. Mississippi Department of Agriculture for the use of Pirate insecticide on cotton to control beet armyworms. A notice of receipt published in the Federal Register of May 25, 1994 (59 FR 27018). This specific exemption was denied because the proposed use poses a risk of unreasonable adverse effects on nontarget birds and aquatic organisms, including several endangered species. An emergency condition does not exist in Mississippi. (Susan Stanton) 6. Montana Department of Agriculture for the use of permethrin on small grains to control cutworms. This specific exemption was denied because of concerns regarding potential dietary risk from permethrin exposure and inadequate progress toward registration. (Andrea Beard) 7. New Hampshire Department of Agriculture for the use of clomazone on winter squash to control weeds. This specific exemption was denied because it has been 6 years that the use of clomazone on winter squash has been requested under section 18 of FIFRA, and it was expected that clomazone would be registered for use in New Hampshire by this growing season 1994; however, FMC Corporation has not yet submitted an application to add this use to its commercial label.
