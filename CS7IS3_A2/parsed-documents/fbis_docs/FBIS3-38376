On a possible government coalition with Mino Martinazzoli's Italian Popular Party, Occhetto says: "I think our aim should be two broad groupings, the right and the left. The newly formed Progressive Alliance [the left coalition] must win and have the majority. We cannot make the usual center-left mess, albeit a cleaner one." He adds: "I think in this election campaign, we have very clearly slammed the door in his face [Mino Martinazzoli's]." On the problems of keeping the left's broad coalition together, Occhetto says: "The thing is that the various forces of the left -- each one with its own characteristics -- are trying to unite and confront the risk of a new and an old right. This is something important: getting together to win the great match for the government of this country." On the diverging economic strategies within the coalition of the left, which includes the hardliners of Fausto Bertinotti's Communist Renewal Party, he says: "We set off from different positions, but I must say that, after frank discussions, our opinions are now more alike. This, I think, is what a real dialogue within the left should lead to. As for those points on which there is no agreement, we shall tell the Italians which ones they are before the elections." Asked whether the presence of Fausto Bertinotti, the leader of Communist Renewal Party, in the coalition may be a problem, Occhetto says: "No problem at all." On the scheduled and later postponed meeting with NATO's secretary general, Occhetto says: "Unfortunately he is very ill. We shall meet another time." He adds: "I wanted to tell him that we must all react to the situation in Bosnia. We can no longer go on like this. We must intervene. We must also strengthen all the world's ruling bodies to settle disputes and tackle tragic issues, such as drugs and north-south relations." On his meeting with the U.S. ambassador in Italy, he says: "It was a very pleasant and interesting meeting. He wanted to know our opinions on the economy." He adds: "I think I reassured him very much on one point: that we want to change and renew, but we want to continue the restructuring program started by Ciampi." Answering another question on the different people within the coalition of the left, Occhetto says: "Have you ever seen the American Democratic Party? There are very strange Trotskyites and crazy reformists within it. What about the Labor Party in England? Everywhere in modern Europe the left is very varied." He adds: "The day after tomorrow we shall publish the election program, not the government program, and you will find that on these issues we have worked miracles in seeking a common position." On Berlusconi's accusations that the Democratic Party of the Left will follow a policy of high spending, he says: "I'd like to tell Mr. Berlusconi that we are not the party of taxes. We want to cut taxes for families and businesses. But we want those who have never paid taxes to start doing so." Asked whether Leoluca Orlando, the leader of the Network; Ottaviano Del Turco, leader of the Italian Socialist Party; Ferdinando Adornato, leader of the Democratic Alliance; and Fausto Bertinotti, leader of Communist Refoundation, will really take part in the coalition of the left, he says: "Yes, I can guarantee that." Asked whether the decision taken by Giorgio La Malfa, secretary of the Italian Republican Party, to join the center instead of the coalition of the left is a blow to his plans for the elections, Ochetto says: "Actually it is a blow for him." On Mario Segni, leader of the Pact for Italy, Occhetto says: "He has the reputation of being someone who constantly changes his mind. I must say that his ideas are very clear on one point: he wants to be prime minister." Asked many times whether he is a candidate for the post of prime minister, Occhetto never gives a clear and straight answer. He says: "The only sure thing is that I do have other things on my mind and not just the idea of being prime minister. This unfortunate thing may happen; it would be a task, something I would have to do, a service." On the candidates of the left to the post of prime minister after Ciampi's decision to abandon politics, Occhetto says: "Ciampi has said he is above all parties. As prime minister, he took the right decision. I still think that he is a reserve for democracy in Italy." On the PDS's much talked-about control of the new RAI, Occhetto says: "I would rather be a politician like Berlusconi. He sits comfortably at home, sends a tape around, and he ends up on all national channels, public and private, on the same day." On the number of PDS politicians involved in the Bribesville scandal, he says: "Bribesville means something very precise: public and private billions of lire given to parties in return for some favors. In this respect we have nobody [under investigation]." On Bettino Craxi, former leader of the Italian Socialist Party, and television mogul Silvio Berlusconi, Occhetto says: "Craxi has said that Berlusconi is filling a gap. It is true, he is filling the gap left by Craxi. Berlusconi is nothing more than raw and pure craxism." He adds: "Berlusconi is now saying: I am the new man. No, you are Bettino Craxi." On Berlusconi's power in the media and the election campaign, Occhetto says: "Last night I watched a film [on one of Berlusconi's channels]. During the film I was interrupted five times by a `Forza Italia' [advertisement for Berlusconi's party]. I asked myself: Who is paying for that election campaign? If I wanted to broadcast only one of those advertisements, I would have to stop paying [PDS] employees for one year -- not only those who work at the headquarters, but also those who work in the branches all over Italy." Asked on what he would do in case of victory in the March elections, Occhetto concludes: "If I won the elections, the first thing I would do would be to start a 100-day program to tackle the problem of unemployment with training contracts and support contracts for all those who are now in a difficult situation."
