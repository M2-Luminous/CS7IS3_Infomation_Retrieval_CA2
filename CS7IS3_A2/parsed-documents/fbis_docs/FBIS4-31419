Moravcik on the Arms Trade"] [Text] Slovakia also has the conditions for becoming involved in the arms trade. Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik said this in an interview for Radiozurnal in connection with the recent visit made by a Chilean military delegation to the Czech Republic. In trading in arms, however, Slovakia must proceed correctly and in a manner corresponding to its international obligations, said the Slovak prime minister. "I do not even rule out the possibility of trade with Chile because it is a democratic country, and selling arms to this region would not harm our foreign policy interests," said J. Moravcik. As far as Augusto Pinochet is concerned, Moravcik is aware of the complexity of the issue of all that General Pinochet meant in Chile's history. First and foremost, it is up to the people of this country to come to terms with this issue, added Moravcik.
