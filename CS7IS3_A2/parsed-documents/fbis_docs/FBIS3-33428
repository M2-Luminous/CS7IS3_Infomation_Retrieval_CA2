Notable activities during the visit will be meetings with French President Francois Mitterand and Foreign Affairs Minister Alain Juppe. This is what the Haitian Embassy in Paris said on the evening of 22 February. President Aristide will participate in an international colloquium for the fight [as heard] of Abbot Pierre, the founder the (Emaus) Charity Association organized under UNESCO. Mr. Aristide, who was overthrown by a military coup d'etat in September 1991, rejected last week a plan, presented by Haitian parliamentarians, to unravel the current crisis. This plan, which is implicitly supported by UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali and which enjoys the support of Washington, provides notably for the appointment of a new prime minister, the early retirement of Army Commander in Chief General Raoul Cedras, and the installation of a new government of concord.
