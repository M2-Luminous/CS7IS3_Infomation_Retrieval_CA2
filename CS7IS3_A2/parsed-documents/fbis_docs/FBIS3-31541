He said that he had been forced to take this course of action by the approaching deadline of the NATO ultimatum to Bosnia Serbs. He said that his intention was guided by a wish that several ideas were tabled to the international officials who could make a decision on the issues concerned. According to Baudys, a possible lengthy debate on the initiative in Czech political structures would have devalued the content of the document.
