On the right, France's Alcatel-Alsthom at Fr156 billion. In energy, the railroad industry, and telecommunications, the two groups are waging a relentless war where "an eye for an eye" is the only rule. But politicians want the two to cooperate, to strengthen the Franco-German axis. The meeting hall in this Defense Ministry building in Paris is ice-cold. "It's because of the explosion in the air-conditioning plant; have you heard about it?" the affable Dr. Baumgartl explains. The cool atmosphere hardly disturbs this engineer seconded by Simens to participate in one of the most sympbolic joint ventures ever undertaken by France and Germany: the development of the first European nuclear reactor by the millenium. Owned by Siemens and Framatome under a 50-50 partnership, the joint venture is called Nuclear Power International [preceding three words in English] (NPI), and English will be the working language for those involved, who share the spirit of participating in a technological adventure. "Most of the German engineers who came here in 1989, when the project began, have applied to extend their contracts," says Dr. Baumgartl. The project is a superb example of Franco-German cooperation--but such cooperation itself seems less and less popular. Not that there have been any serious technological hitches so far. Quite the contrary. Launched initially to feed the export market, the project was backed by EDF [French Power Company] and most major German power companies. The nuclear safety authorities of the two countries are expected to give their blessing this June to the start-up of the second phase of the project, "which at this point is very well defined, and which also resembles many French reactors," notes Jean-Claude Leny, Framatome's CEO. The objective for this new phase "is to present, within three years, a detailed proposal setting the stage for industrialization." "Give Back" Framatome The real hang-up is elsewhere. It lies--indirectly--in the proposed privatization of Framatome, whose "ownership" has been in flux in the last 10 years. When he came to the Matignon [office of the prime minister], Edouard Balladur promised to "give back" the enterprise to Alcatel-Alsthom, which currently owns 44 percent of its stock--the rest is owned by EDF, the Atomic Energy Commission (CEA), and the employees--though for a brief period in 1990 it controlled 52 percent. Preparations are under way. CEA has designated the Rothschild Financial Company as its counsel for the evaluation, while Framatome has picked Goldman Sachs. Both sides are waiting now for a green light from the Economics Ministry. But what will become of the future Franco-German reactor, if Alcatel-Alsthom's CEO brings to fruition the idea that so intrigued his predecessors--taking over Framatome to strengthen Alsthom's expertise in conventional turbines, enabling it to offer turnkey solutions to clients around the world? The question is of particularly keen concern to Heinrich von Pierer, president and general manager of Siemens, since he it was--as head of KWU, the German group's energy division--who had negotiated the Framatome-Siemens accord. Why? Because Pierre Suard is the man who has been working ceaselessly since 1986 to block the path of the German giant...and who has openly admitted as much to all and sundry. "Siemens is my enemy," he reportedly said in an interview several years ago. All documentation of that quote has disappeared, but the Germans believe it is quite authentic. Perhaps to justify their remarkable weakness in the French market? At any rate, the pragmatic von Pierer continues to preach greater cooperation between these two countries, "which by the year 2010 will represent less than 2 percent of the world population." But French and German marketing teams on the ground are battling tooth and nail in the railroad industry, energy, and telecommunications. The war extends down to the working level, where for example an Alcatel representative in China refused even to meet with a Siemens counterpart freshly arrived in the country. And all the way up to the level of gigantic projects, such as the South Korean TGV [high-speed train] contract which Alcatel-Alsthom, after many vicissitudes, finally nailed down on 18 April. Siemens, as we know, did everything in its power to recapture the contract. Pierre Suard, in an interview with ECHOS in January, explicitly branded its competitive practices as "unfair." The "friendly" rejoinder from Siemens: "Suard will have his Korean TGV, but he's going to lose his shirt." If so, Siemens will be able to claim a lot of the credit, since it had pared down its own bid several times. In Italy, Alcatel and Siemens both coveted Italtel, the telephone switching exchange builder which the government was trying to privatize. In late March, the balance tipped in favor of the German firm. "It has not escaped our notice that this decision was taken on the eve of the formation of a new government," commented Pierre Suard on 12 April, not without a hint of irony, when presenting his company's the profit-and-loss statement for 1993. "Alcatel-Alsthom and Siemens are like water and fire," quips one high-level French official halffacetiously. "They are the two biggest European firms in their fields," notes Christian Fayard, head of Siemens in France, so "no one should be surprised they are always butting heads." Two colossi whose conflicts are becoming increasingly fierce. "Today the battles are enormous," says Fayard. "Korea was as hard-fought as Trafalgar. The people involved are prisoners of the battles they're waging." Political Blunders The situation is not an easy one to manage for the politicians, who see industrial cooperation as a means of strengthening a Franco-German axis weakened by reunification...and numerous political blunders. This was why Gerard Longuet, France's industry minister, went to Munich for private talks with Heinrich von Pierer at the end of March. Only two close associates accompanied them. On the agenda for discussion: - The railroad industry, where Siemens proposes to bury the hatchet, once the dust settles from the Korean contract, by launching a cooperative export venture for future generations of high-speed trains; - Telecommunications, where Siemens is demanding greater access to the French market; - The computer industry, where Gerard Longuet is looking for new European shareholders for Bull; - Components, where the French hope someday to see Siemens join the Franco-Italian SGS-Thomson; - And of course nuclear energy, the most burning issue at the moment. With concessions on both sides, is it possible to reach some basis for an understanding? The Germans say they are ready. In autumn 1993, Siemens' CEO came to Paris in an effort to convince the industry minister to endorse a token stock participation for his group in Framatome. A gesture which in his eyes would have sealed the Franco-German alliance once and for all...and guaranteed Siemens' future in the nuclear industry at a time when the market in Germany could freeze up, if the Social Democratic opposition, in alliance with the Greens, were to come back to power after the October elections. Out of the question, said Alcatel-Alsthom's head. So the idea was just dropped. "Pierre Suard won't stand for it," was the somewhat rueful reaction at the Industry Ministry, where officials are beginning to raise serious questions about how to balance the interests of French industry against amity with its big German neighbor. Snubbed by Siemens After all, the man who oversaw the privatization of General Electricity Company (CGE) and its transformation into today's Alcatel-Alsthom, may be doing nothing more than taking his just revenge. "Before the ITT-CGE accord, we were more or less snubbed by Siemens," recalls a longtime veteran of the former CGE. "We were not treated as one of the powerful few." The takeover of telecommunications from the American group, which had a very large base in Germany, turned things around. Signed about the time Pierre Suard was made head of the group in 1986, this accord was followed by a long list of acquisitions, some of which are still in progress: Most recently, the takeover of the submarine division of STC was finalized in February. Siemens has not done nearly as well in the aftermath, despite several notable takeovers, including the rather unfortunate buy-out of Nixdorf, the computer manufacturer. As for Alcatel-Alsthom, it has more than doubled in turnover. The French group boasts sales of close to Fr160 billion--admittedly less than Siemens' Fr280 billion--but is able to do so without as much diversification. And in many areas, Alcatel has surged ahead of its rival. In all this time, the German firm has watched helpless as its French competitor advanced by forced marches in most sectors. In its own national market: In addition to the ITT deal, Alcatel bought out Kabelmetall, while Siemens was prohibited by the Office of Cartels from acquiring PKI, a Philips subsidiary that also specialized in cable manufacturing. And its proposed alliance with AEG in the railroad sector was blocked, at the same time that Alsthom succeeded in becoming system coordinator for the domestic industry. And in France: Alcatel took over the telecommunications division of Thomson in 1983. Four years later Siemens failed, for political reasons, to acquire CGCT--an ITT subsidiary--which it had hoped would give entree to the French telecommunications market. At the time, the German firm's top executives were still licking their wounds over the Unidata fiasco in the computer domain and the abortive acquisition of FAE-Arnould in the electric equipment field. Old scars, these...and so deeply etched that only a generational change can efface their memory. "Siemens had a policy of external growth in France, in telecommunications and energy, that it was unable to actualize," Christian Fayard sums up. The figures speak for themselves. Alcatel-Alsthom has annual sales of Fr28 billion in Germany, mostly in telecommunications. Siemens' sales in France, by contrast, are no more than Fr8 billion. Active in automotive electronics, lighting, electronic components, and measuring equipment, Siemens has but token sales in the French telecommunications market. Von Pierer says straightforwardly: "I realize it's a delicate and difficult issue, and I am a patient man. But the current situation is not acceptable indefinitely." What then is Siemens' best hope today for selling telephone equipment in France? It is to become the third largest supplier for the GSM [global system for mobile communications] radiotelephone system--the operator for which will be chosen in the coming weeks. A prospect at best uncertain, until authorities make known their decision: Alcatel has put in its bid against Bouygues and Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez! So a new fracture line has appeared between the French and German firms. Because Pierre Suard's group has set its sights on a new "El Dorado": service, where profit margins are not yet paper-thin. Supplying telephone line is going to become less and less profitable, as has already been demonstrated on the German market. "Since 1990, Deutsche Telekom has begun forcing its suppliers to lower prices, by 23 percent last year," notes Andre Chassagnol, financial analyst at Safe (Paribas group). A move made necessary by plans for privatization of the German operator, which explains why the two groups, with worrisome synchronicity, have both announced projections of profit downturns on the order of 10 to 20 percent for 1994. Grandiose Dreams For all these reasons, Alcatel wants to graduate from manufacturer to operator. In Hungary, it has joined forces with US Telecom East (United States) to operate four regional telecommunications systems. More spectacularly, it has bought a stake in Global Star, a consortium that aspires to create an international satellite-based mobile communications network. And if information superhighways see the light of day--a development which Pierre Suard seems convinced is inevitable--no doubt he will get in on that as a supplier...and an operator. Alcatel is already experimenting, in Great Britain as well as the United States. "Multimedia offers fascinating prospects," the head of Alcatel-Alsthom loves to repeat, almost lyrically. To prepare, it is getting more and more involved in the graphics domain, for example by entering into partnership with a producer to launch a tele-purchasing station. Grandiose dreams, some say. But the Germans realize that if their enterprise was picked to install a telephone system in Vietnam, it was because it promised it too would be able to transmit graphics there. The French strategy of bold integration worries its German rival. Operating both traditional and multimedia telephone networks, Alcatel will be even better positioned to block Siemens' path. Will Siemens be forced to move in the same direction? Unwillingly, to be sure. At heart a manufacturer, a company of engineers if ever there was one, the German group prefers to keep to its role as an equipment supplier. What it gets enthusiastic about is "intrasectoral" diversification, on the Japanese model: Cost what it may, it clings to its electronic components and its data processing. Because these two domains are in the process of converging with telecommunications. And there it will enjoy technological independence. It's more than just commercial competition: In reality, the two firms represent two strategies, two conflicting visions of the world. Is it possible, then, for the two giants to put all that aside and cooperate in one specific domain, nuclear energy? In its deliberations over the Framatome issue, this is the formidable question the government will have to address. Because it was on this ground, implicitly, that Pierre Suard took his stand on 12 April. "Two questions must be negotiated," he said: "the price of the buy-out (of stock held by public-sector shareholders), and the industrial policy that Framatome will pursue." The heart of the issue, he said, "to put it simply, is our cooperation with Siemens." But "there is no question of dismantling the alliance with the Germans," Suard protests. Except that Framatome, after privatization, "will belong to an industrial group into whose strategy it will have to be integrated." A top-level Alcatel-Alsthom executive puts it this way: "The Franco-German accord must be adapted to the new reality." The Germans are turning somewhat of a deaf ear to such talk, while at the same time they deny any intent to interfere in a French internal issue. "We are already halfway there," explains Adolph Huttl, director of KWU and member of the Siemens board of directors. "There is nothing to be changed; either we keep going, or we stop." He would of course prefer to continue with the cooperative venture, "which in any case was never considered a short-term project." In Paris, Jean-Claude Leny is on the same wavelength. He's looking out past the year 2000, because that is when the aging French nuclear generating stations will have to be replaced. "Nuclear energy is much like aviation. No one today would buy a Caravelle." The German market itself, while not converting to all-nuclear, might still offer some interesting prospects. But the real growth potential is in big-ticket exports to countries like China, India, Thailand, or Indonesia. Leny cautions, though, that competition with the Americans and Japanese will get more intense, even within the European Union--where "the rules of the game are going to change," he says. Thus he already dreams of Europeanizing NPI, "that embryonic nuclear Airbus." Great Britain, Belgium, and Spain are reportedly interested. The presumption underlying a consortium like Airbus is that it rests on political will. That is certainly the case in the nuclear energy field. But there's a problem: What happens when one of the partners is about to fall under the control of an owner which, though not opposed to the policy, is determined to impose its own industrial vision and therefore takes into account--reasonably enough, one might add--the dimension of competition vis-a-vis the other partner? "It's up to the authorities to resolve matters in such a way that a joint venture of this scope and duration does not get derailed by secondary considerations," avers Jean-Claude Leny, who is ready to go to the mat to defend "the continuity of nuclear energy with society." At NPI, attitudes oscillate between worry and philosophic fatalism: "We're very curious to see how it will all turn out." [Box, p 50] Von Pierer: Negotiations "We cannot stand idly by as the Americans invade our markets while keeping us out of their own," warns Heinrich von Pierer, who at the same time denies his aim is "fortress Europe." A confirmed liberal, the Siemens CEO is nevertheless understanding of the policy pursued by Paris, which rejects "laissez-faire," and constantly praises the progress French industry has already made. "France and Germany are obligatory partners," he says with conviction. The only thing he says he cannot understand is France's position on the GATT [General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs], its willingness to take such heavy risks "for the benefit of agriculture, which represents so little." At heart a frustrated politician, von Pierer might have made a career for himself in the CSU, the Christian Social Union that rules Bavaria. But in 1976 the party rejected his candidacy for the Bundestag elections. Furious, he made Siemens the target of his ambitions. But he is still a member of the CSU, and kept his seat on the municipal council of his hometown, Erlangen, for 18 years. A jurist by training, he joined Siemens, the town's largest employer, in 1969. As marketing director at Kraftwerk Union (KWU), the energy division, his negotiating talents propelled him to the board of directors, and he was made its president in 1989. At the nuclear waste reprocessing center in Wackersdorf, which the Bavarian government suddenly abandoned, he succeeded in avoiding any labor conflict. So he had a clear path to the top. Named vice president of the group in 1991--to the surprise of almost everyone--he became its CEO a year later, at the age of 51. His dynamism galvanized the "old lady of Munich." He is still moving rapidly, as he did back in the days when this former junior champion from Bavaria divided his time between the tennis courts, editing the local Erlangen sports journal, and university. In 18 months, he has already toured more than a hundred subsidiaries all over the world. When the Malaysian government asked to see the presidents of the two finalists in the competition to build an electric generating station before making a final decision, von Pierer was on the ground in Kuala Lumpur within 24 hours...and got the contract. The conquest of Asian markets is, along with the building of Europe, a constant theme with him. Chancellor Helmut Kohl has gotten the message. Asia is now the major focus of his economic policy speeches. [Box, p 51] Suard: Power He has battled socialism, derided the Maastricht Treaty, criticized the Commission in Brussels for the way it treats alliances among European industrialists, and raised his voice loudly against the recent reform of while-collar retirement provisions. Pierre Suard does not hesitate to make waves. The recession? It's behind us, Edouard Balladur asserted one evening last January on television. Suard, in an interview the following day, maintained the contrary. Coincidence? Brought into the office of the presidency on the coattails of the Chirac-Balladur duo in 1986, Suard today wants to prove he does his own thinking. Just as he demonstrated, eight years ago, that he was not just a transition CEO. Named head of CGE with a mandate to privatize it, he was only the 11th CEO in the 100-year history of the enterprise. Was he picked because of his 15 years of in-house experience as head of subsidiaries like Cables de Lyon, where he had shown his mettle? Or because of his political profile? An RPR [Rally for the Republic party] sympathizer, his ties with Balladur go back to the era when legendary CEO Ambroise Roux offered the current prime minister the presidency of two subsidiaries. Four years later, he pruned, restructured, and put his men in important positions: among others, Pierre Bilger, former CGE treasurer, who was put in charge of Alsthom, and Andre Wettstein, his former top aide at Cables de Lyon. By making CGE systematically absorb its most lucrative subsidiaries, he transformed the doddering CGE into a formidable cash cow. Alcatel-Alsthom was born. And he was its first president. This former associate of Michel Debre in the Finance Ministry, this mountaineer who prefers his house in Haute-Savoie to the ostentation of life in Paris, has become one of the most powerful industrial bosses in France. Does the game excite him? His rise has had little effect on either his lifestyle or his tastes. Admittedly it has its little rewards, such as being able to buy the Gruault-Larose chateau, or create a press group built around L'EXPRESS, which was part of Ambroise Roux's legacy. But he does not spread himself too thin: His top priorities are still to control the electric power network--including nuclear energy--from top to bottom, and to broaden the group's telecommunications base by going into the services side. Two objectives whose attainment, ironically enough, is complicated by his reputation as a friend of the government. Balladur would be open to criticism for showing too much favoritism toward his former colleague.
