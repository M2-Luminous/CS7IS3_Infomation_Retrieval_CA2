This article describes an algorithm to automatically trace contours directly from a differentiated image. This algorithm was developed to obtain information on the dimensions of spheroidal objects from half-tone images. A test image is proposed to study this algorithm. An example of contour tracing of an object on an X-ray image is presented. The differentiation process is described. Contour tracing begins with the operator indicating a contour point or a point in direct proximity to a contour. Subsequent points are found automatically as the algorithm analyzes the vicinity around the point. Backtracking along the contour is eliminated. The radius of examination can be tuned. The least squares method is used to check how closely the algorithm has succeeded in tracing the contour. It is found that the algorithm may be used for relatively simple X-ray images. The lines of tracks and oscillograms can be traced directly from the initial images. Figure 1; table 1; references 2 (Russian).
