Defense Minister Pavel Grachev in an interview with Interfax in Rostov-on-Don on Wednesday said that everything had been done in the past two years to turn the North Caucasian Military District into an army grouping "capable of conducting combat operations" to defuse small or big conflicts. Grachev said the district would also have to solve domestic tasks in line with Russia's defense doctrine which provides for the armed forces and Interior Ministry troops to conduct joint security operations. In this connection, he said that if regional security forces were unable to cope with their duties, Russian troops would take part in cracking down on "terrorist groups" which had mushroomed in the region. The minister is at the start of a regional tour to inspect troops deployed in the Northern Caucasus. He plans to visit army units and meet leaders of the region where Russian troops are deployed. On Thursday Grachev is scheduled to visit Anapa, Novorossiysk and Makhachkala. Nor does he rule out visiting Abkhazia "if any changes occur in the area of the conflict" between Georgia and Abkhazia.
