This was established by a commission of experts that completed a comprehensive analysis of the nuclear power plant with a view to determining "the plant's effects on the surrounding and working environment and on the health of the population." New units will take at least 10-15 years to build, so the experts consider that their construction should start immediately. The experts found that the incidence of lung, breast, and thyroid cancers is less than the national average. The scientists compared their figures with those for the Belene and Yambol districts as well as with the average indices. In the entire series of measurements carried out, they established no difference in the background gamma radiation levels before and after the nuclear power plant was commissioned. Measurements were taken throughout the period that the plant was in operation at 400 separate points in 46 centers of population. The experts found no significant deviations in natural and man-made radioactivity in the regions surrounding the nuclear power plant compared with other localities in Bulgaria. The waters of the Danube were found to contain no increased concentration of radionucleides resulting from fluid discharges from the nuclear power plant. The team of scientists confirmed that during the entire period that the plant had been in operation it had had no effect on environmental radiation. Specialists point out that the pollution from a 1,100-megawatt thermal power is 10 to 40 times higher than that from a 1,440-megawatt nuclear reactor.
