"There are some volunteers from Croatia, definitely, but not regular Croatian forces," Granic told BBC Radio. Owen, in a Channel 4 Television interview to be aired Wednesday night, said, "We all know there is as I speak a very substantial element of the Croatian army in Bosnia-Herzegovina, very substantial. "And I must say that I think it's an issue that the world ought to address more strongly," Owen said. "They addressed it in terms of the Serbs in the spring of 1992 with very considerable strength of purpose, but they have to a great extent ignored it in the last six months as it's built up." Owen said the EC view was "obviously influenced" by Germany and "other friends of Croatia like Austria in the United Nations, Hungary and others, and the United States". "The general feeling," he said, "has been that it is better to make representations to (Croatian) President (Franjo) Tudjman and to criticize and to argue rather than to take action in terms of sanctions against Croatia." Croatia has always denied it has regular troops stationed in Bosnia, although Tudjman on December 30 warned he would intervene on the side of Bosnian Croats who, he said, faced "aggression" by the Moslem-dominated Bosnian army. Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic meanwhile Wednesday denied the existence of a Bosnian offensive against Croat enclaves, telling BBC Radio, "The Bosnian Army is on Bosnian soil, there is no doubt about it. That is not an offensive."
