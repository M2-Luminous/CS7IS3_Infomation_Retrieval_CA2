The funds for the CHSP will be awarded by FmHA through a national competition, in which applicants are selected to receive supportive services grants by FmHA Headquarters. HUD will fund the grants, and administer them with FmHA assistance. The funding process is further described in Section II. of this NOFA. C. Eligibility 1. General Applicants must submit applications for HUD projects to HUD field offices and applications for FmHA projects to FmHA Headquarters and State offices. Applicants may apply for either HUD and/or FmHA dollars. Applications may only be submitted to the HUD field office/FmHA State office which has jurisdiction over the project. Projects submitted by eligible applicants under this NOFA are limited to eligible housing for the elderly, as defined below. 2. Eligible Applicants Eligible applicants are States, Indian Tribes, units of general local government, PHA/IHAs or local non-profit housing sponsors as defined in 7 CFR 1944.252 and 24 CFR 700.105. Local non-profit housing sponsors and PHA/IHAs may only apply on behalf of projects they own. For-profit owners of eligible housing for the elderly may not apply directly for CHSP grants; the request must be submitted under an application by a State, Indian tribe or unit of general local government (but NOT under an application submitted by a local non-profit sponsor or a PHA/IHA). 3. Eligible Housing Projects Eligible projects under this NOFA must be eligible housing for the elderly as defined in 7 CFR 1944.252 and 24 CFR 700.105, and must be 85 percent occupied as of the date of the application deadline for funding under this NOFA. For-profit owners of eligible housing for the elderly may not apply directly for CHSP grants; the request may be submitted under an application by a State, Indian tribe or unit of general local government (but NOT under an application submitted by a local non-profit sponsor or a PHA/IHA). 4. Services Required by the CHSP Each application must provide documentation that it will provide or is already providing the following required services. a. A meals program of at least one hot meal a day, seven days a week in a group setting for some or all of the participants; and, b. A service coordinator to provide case management and other activities as required by section 700.220 and 225 or 1944.257 and 258 of the common rule. 5. Funding Limits There is a limit on the amount of dollars HUD/FmHA will approve for supportive services other than case management/ service coordination and meals. This limit is $1,200 in HUD funds per person per year in FY 1994. (Costs for meals and case management/service coordination are not capped, but follow normal market considerations for that jurisdiction.) The proposed amount for case management/service coordination together with the capped amount for other services and a limited amount make up the 40 percent that HUD will pay as its share of the grant. THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF FUNDS WHICH WILL BE GRANTED TO ANY ONE APPLICANT UNDER THIS NOFA is $2,000,000, subject to Section II.G.(6).
