FR940512-2-00082 FR940512-2-00052 V Procedures Available for Modification of the Proposed Final Judgment The APPA provides a period of at least sixty (60) days preceding the effective date of the proposed Final Judgments within which any person may submit to the United States written comments regarding the proposed Final Judgment. Any person who wishes to comment should do so within sixty (60) days of the date of publication of this Competitive Impact Statement in the Federal Register . The United States will evaluate the comments, determine whether it should withdraw its consent, and respond to the comments. The comments and response(s) of the United States will be filed with the Court and published in the Federal Register . Written comments should be submitted to Richard Liebeskind, Assistant Chief, Communications and Finance Section, Antitrust Division, U.S. Department of Justice, 555 Fourth Street, NW., room 8104, Washington, DC 20001. The proposed Final Judgment provides that the Court retains jurisdiction over this action, and any party may apply to the Court for any order necessary or appropriate for its modification, interpretation or enforcement. VI Alternatives to the Proposed Final Judgment As an alternative to the proposed Final Judgment, the United States considered litigation seeking structural relief, including division of the MAC network. The United States rejected that alternative because the termination of MAC's restrictive practices concerning use of third party processors and membership in multiple regional ATM networks will effectively break the unlawful tie established by EPS between ATM network access and ATM processing. Breaking this tie will encourage the entry of competitors in the affected states in the markets for ATM network services and ATM processing more efficiently than division of the MAC network. In addition, division of the MAC network was likely to involve the Court and the parties in a complex and time-consuming process of reorganizing the network, delaying the desired improvement in competition. The United States also recognized that such litigation would require determination of several disputed issues of law and fact, and that there could be no assurance that the position of the United States would prevail. VII Standard of Review Under the Tunney Act for Proposed Final Judgment The APPA requires that proposed consent judgments in antitrust cases brought by the United States are subject to a sixty-day comment period, after which the court shall determine whether entry of the proposed final judgment ``is in the public interest.'' In making that determination, the court may consider_ (1) The competitive impact of such judgment, including termination of alleged violations, provisions for enforcement and modification, duration or relief sought, anticipated effects of alternative remedies actually considered, and any other considerations bearing upon the adequacy of such judgment; (2) The impact of entry of such judgment upon the public generally and individuals alleging specific injury from the violations set forth in the complaint including consideration of the public benefit, if any, to be derived from a determination of the issues at trial. 15 U.S.C. 16(e) (emphasis added). The courts have recognized that the term ``public interest'' ``take[s] meaning from the purposes of the regulatory legislation.'' NAACP v. Federal Power Comm'n, 425 U.S. 662, 669 (1976). Since the purpose of the antitrust laws is to ``preserv[e] free and unfettered competition as the rule of trade,'' Northern Pacific Railway Co. v. United States , 356 U.S. 1, 4 (1958), the focus of the ``public interest'' inquiry under the Tunney Act is whether the proposed final judgment would serve the public interest in free and unfettered competition. United States v. American Cyanamid Co., 719 F.2d 558, 565 (2d Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1101 (1984); United States v. Waste Management, Inc., 1985&hyph;2 Trade Cas. ¶66,651, at 63,046 (D.D.C. 1985). In conducting this inquiry, ``the Court is nowhere compelled to go to trial or to engage in extended proceedings which might have the effect of vitiating the benefits of prompt and less costly settlement through the consent decree process.'' 12 Rather, 12 119 Cong. Rec. 24598 (1973). See United States v. Gillette Co., 406 F.Supp. 713, 715 (D. Mass. 1975). A ``public interest'' determination can be made properly on the basis of the Competitive Impact Statement and Response to Comments filed pursuant to the APPA. Although the APPA authorizes the use of additional procedures, 15 U.S.C. §16(f), those procedures are discretionary. A court need not invoke any of them unless it believes that the comments have raised significant issues and that further proceedings would aid the court in resolving those issues. See H.R. Rep. 93&hyph;1463, 93rd Cong. 2d Sess. 8&hyph;9, reprinted in (1974) U.S. Code Cong. & Ad. News 6535, 6538. absent a showing of corrupt failure of the government to discharge its duty, the Court, in making the public interest finding, should *␣*␣* carefully consider the explanations of the government in the competitive impact statement and its responses to comments in order to determine whether those explanations are reasonable under the circumstances. United States v. Mid-America Dairymen, Inc., 1977&hyph;1 Trade Cas. ¶61,508, at 71,980 (W.D. Mo. 1977). It is also unnecessary for the district court to ``engage in an unrestricted evaluation of what relief would best serve the public.'' United States v. BNS, Inc., 858 F.2d 456, 462 (9th Cir. 1988) quoting United States v. Bechtel Corp., 648 F.2d 660, 666 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1083 (1981). Precedent requires that the balancing of competing social and political interests affected by a proposed antitrust consent decree must be left, in the first instance, to the discretion of the Attorney General. The court's role in protecting the public interest is one of insuring that the government has not breached its duty to the public in consenting to the decree. The court is required to determine not whether a particular decree is the one that will best serve society, but whether the settlement is `` within the reaches of the public interest. '' More elaborate requirements might undermine the effectiveness of antitrust enforcement by consent decree. 13 13 United States v. Bechtel, 648 F.2d at 666 (citations omitted); see United States v. BNS, Inc., 858 F.2d at 463; United States v. National Broadcasting Co., 449 F. Supp. 1127, 1143 (C.D. Cal. 1978); United States v. Gillette Co., 406 F. Supp. at 716. See also United States v. American Cyanamid Co., 719 F.2d at 565. A proposed consent decree is an agreement between the parties which is reached after exhaustive negotiations and discussions. Parties do not hastily and thoughtlessly stipulate to a decree because, in doing so, they waive their right to litigate the issues involved in the case and thus save themselves the time, expense, and inevitable risk of litigation. Naturally, the agreement reached normally embodies a compromise; in exchange for the saving of cost and the elimination of risk, the parties each give up something they might have won had they proceeded with the litigation. United States v. Armour & Co., 402 U.S. 673, 681 (1971). The proposed consent decree, therefore, should not be reviewed under a standard of whether it is certain to eliminate every anticompetitive effect of a particular practice or whether it mandates certainty of free competition in the future. Court approval of a final judgment requires a standard more flexible and less strict than the standard required for a finding of liability. ``[A] proposed decree must be approved even if it falls short of the remedy the court would impose on its own, as long as it falls within the range of acceptability or is `within the reaches of public interest.' (citations omitted).'' 14 14 United States v. American Tel. and Tel Co., 552 F. Supp. 131, 150 (D.D.C.), aff'd sub nom. Maryland v. United States , 460 U.S. 1001 (1982) quoting United States v. Gillette Co., supra, 406 F. Supp. at 716; United States v. Alcan Aluminum, Ltd., 605 F. Supp. 619, 622 (W.D. Ky 1985).
