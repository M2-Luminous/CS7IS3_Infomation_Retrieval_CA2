In the course of their conversation the parties discussed issues related to regulation of transport communications' functioning in Transcaucasia and, in particular, in Azerbaijan. Aliyev pointed out that aggression being waged by Armenia against the republic seriously affects normal functioning of transport and energy communications in Azerbaijan. The president reported that at present almost the whole section of the border between Azerbaijan and Armenia is a battlefield and it is very difficult to restore normal functioning of the communications in this zone. Meanwhile, Azerbaijan's Cabinet of Ministers told Interfax that Baku had declined a proposal to organize a meeting of Transcaucasian states' vice premiers on the border of three countries to discuss security of the gas-main laid via Georgia's territory to Armenia. In 1993 this gas-main was subjected to numerous explosions on the territory of Georgia's Marneul region which is predominantly inhabited by the Azerbaijanis. The last explosion occurred on December 18. Azerbaijan explained its rejection to participate in this meeting by the fact that it has nothing to do with these subversive acts.
