"We never take exception to non-governmental contacts between Taiwan and countries that have diplomatic relations with China," foreign ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin said. "Recently, however, the relations between some of those countries and Taiwan have gone beyond that limit," he said, condemning what he described as diplomatic trickery by Taiwan in carrying on official contacts with certain countries under the guise of private visits. "This so-called `holiday diplomacy' is but a new trick of Taiwan's elastic diplomacy," Wu said. Lien visited Malaysia and Singapore at the beginning of this month in what was officially defined as a private capacity, although he discussed bilateral economic cooperation with both his Malaysian and Singaporean counterparts, Mahatir Mohamad and Goh Chok Tong. Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui is to embark on a private visit to Jakarta next month during which he will meet President Suharto, newspapers in Taiwan and Indonesia have reported. Lien's visits were seen as a political breakthrough for Taiwan as foreign governments having diplomatic relations with China generally refuse anything that smacks of an official visit from Taiwan for fear of angering Beijing. Beijing and Taipei both claim to be the legitimate government of all China, and Beijing strongly opposes any official contact by any foreign governments with Taiwan, which it views as a renegade province. However, Taiwan has recently been flexing its economic muscle to open doors in Southeast Asia and Lien's recent successes in Malaysia and Singapore indicate that the tactic is bearing fruit. Wu also rejected the suggestion that the attendance at last year's APEC summit of the chairman of Taiwan's Council for Economic Planning and Development, Vincent Siew, contradicted China's Taiwan policy. Chinese President Jiang Zemin also attended the Seattle summit. "China attended the APEC meeting as a soveriegn state while Taiwan was there as a regional economy," Wu pointed out. "You cannot confuse bilateral issues with APEC."
