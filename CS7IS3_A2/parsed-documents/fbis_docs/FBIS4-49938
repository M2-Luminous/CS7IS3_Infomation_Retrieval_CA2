The individual revealed that the central government is encouraging small state-owned enterprises to transfer their property rights and affirmed that there are no ideological obstacles, even to the transfer of large and medium state-owned enterprises' property rights. Because China's economic construction is suffering a serious capital shortage, the income from transferring property rights will be used in urgent and important sectors of the national economy. Therefore, state asset losses will not be a problem as property rights are transferred; on the contrary, the transformation of tangible assets into monetary assets will be quite beneficial to an industrial adjustment. An expert pointed out that the following merits attention in any discussion of property rights transfer: State assets should be scientifically and correctly appraised; payments should be made in a lump and no installments are allowed; asset ownership should be clearly defined; and, after an enterprise transfers its property rights, overall arrangements should be made for its staff members' and workers' employment and labor insurance and the pensions of its retired personnel.
