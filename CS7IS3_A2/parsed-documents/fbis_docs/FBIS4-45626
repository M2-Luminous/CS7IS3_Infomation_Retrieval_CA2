The Council of Ministers made its decision Thursday following a recent environmental study, acting on a recommendation by Prime Minister Maxime Carlot, government spokeswoman Yvette Sam said. Sam said the decision mainly affected four companies logging on the southern island of Erromango with licences issued last year that allowed them to exceed the quotas recommended in the study. The government decided to halve the number of logging companies in Erromango to two within a month and to restrict the volume of wood cut in Vanuatu to an annual 25,000 cubic metres (32,500 cubic yards), as recommended by the Australian-funded study. It would also ban all wood exports from June 15 to encourage processing within Vanuatu. Representatives of European Union countries told Carlot on May 17 of their concern about the scale of logging in Vanuatu, reminding him of EU funding for sustainable logging projects. Carlot had promised to take action, saying excess logging was a "serious problem."
