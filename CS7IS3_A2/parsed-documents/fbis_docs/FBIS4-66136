The bid by the opposition to chair the bicameral commission on the national broadcasting corporation RAI and the anti-Mafia commission, as well as the panels on elections and parliamentary immunity, received a boost here on Thursday [19 May] when House whips postponed any decision on the matter until next week. Speaking to the press after today's meeting, Forza Italia whip Raffaele Della Valle said "We are open to the possibility that some watchdog commissions could go to the opposition and now think it necessary to consult with our representatives in the Senate and then, eventually, even with members of the opposition." "Before defining the make-up of the panels" added Raffaele Valensise, of the National Alliance, "we must see what those in the Senate think and try to hammer out a common platform." People's Party whip Beniamino Andreatta said before today's meeting that the RAI and anti-Mafia should go to the opposition "because this is how it is done in all majority democracies where the opposition is recognized the role of control." The People's Party whip went on to agree that the powers of the majority should be reinforced but that this should correspond with the reinforcement of the opposition powers of control. "The bottom line is this: the RAI and anti-Mafia commissions should go to members of the opposition. There is the problem of credibility.... There are some things which give rise to suspicion and great concern for the future. No majority democratic country exists where the majority crowds the control commissions." Andreatta, however, was of a different mood coming out of the meeting which he told the press has "produced results." The People's Party whip went on to say how discussion did not focus on details but on questions of principal. "We are talking about organizing a majority democracy, the principal of democracy cannot be winner-take-all. There exists" Andreatta added, "a criteria of reason, of separate roles in parliament, in the institutions, the possibility that each performs their task." Similar views were expressed by Luigi Berlinguer, the Progressive whip, who argued "In the absence of precise rules, we ask that there be a global discussion on who should chair the control commissions, which by logic should go to the opposition." Berlinguer went on to add how the government coalition had made no promises, but that "the outcome (postponement) of the meeting was a sign that discussion is open." Meanwhile, in related developments, the government coalition appeared geared to take all the chairs of the regular thirteen House committees, with five going to Northern League, four to Forza Italia, three to the National Alliance and one to the Christian Democratic Center. The National Alliance appeared in line to chair the committees for constitutional affairs, foreign affairs and financial affairs with their candidates Gustavo Selva, Mirko Tremaglia and Paolo Agostinacchio, respectively. Forza Italia was said to be in line to chair the committees for culture, with Vittorio Sgarbi; justice, Tiziana Maiolo; budget, Silvio Liotta; and productive activities, Alessandro Rubino. Indications are that the Northern League committee chairs could go to Riccardo Fragassi or Paolo Bampo for defense; Roberto Castelli for the environment and public works; Uber Anghinoni for agriculture. The League has also proposed either Fiorello Provera or Roberto Calderoli for social affairs and Marco Sartori to chair the labor committee. Despite its opening to the opposition on the chairs, Forza Italia was said to be ready to propose Tina Lagostena and Marco Taradash to chair the equal opportunities and RAI commissions respectively.
