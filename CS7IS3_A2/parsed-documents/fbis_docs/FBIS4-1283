FBIS4-1283 "drafr080_a_94011" FBIS-AFR-94-080 Daily Report 26 Apr 1994 CENTRAL AFRICA Rwanda Lull in Fighting Reported; RPF Gains Territory Lull in Fighting Reported; RPF Gains Territory EA2604110494 (Clandestine) Radio Muhabura in Kinyarwanda to Rwanda 0415 GMT 26 Apr 94 EA2604110494 (Clandestine) Radio Muhabura Kinyarwanda BFN [Text] In its 23 April communique, the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] declared unilaterally that it would stop fighting in all the areas it has liberated, from midnight last night, depending however, on the fulfillment of all its conditions. It is worth recalling that the unilateral cease-fire comes at a time when RPF fighters have been doing well. The new positions taken together with the former neutral zone represent an area twice as big as the area which the RPF previously controlled before the resumption of the war this month. The RPF fighters have hugely increased the territory under their control, having added to it the area from which they had previously withdrawn. There is a current lull in the fighting. The entire Mutara region and the entire Kibungo Prefecture are in RPF hands. Radio Rwanda has confirmed an Army Headquarters report that there is no fighting in these areas, and the Army Headquarters has also confirmed this by saying there is no fighting in Byumba. Indeed, the entire prefecture and town of Byumba were under RPF control by the time of the unilateral cease-fire. The same applies to most parts of Ruhengeri Prefecture. The cease-fire comes at a time when the whole prefecture is under RPF control. The same applies to the town of Kigali. By the time the cease-fire was declared, RPF fighters maintained control of the liberated areas, while remaining vigilant. The government forces had tried in vain to push them out of these areas. That, in brief, was the situation as of yesterday, when the RPF and its fighters declared a unilateral cease-fire while at the same time remaining vigilant. As you have just heard in our war front news, the RPF fighters have gone further than temporarily taking control of communes. They have also added the area from which they had previously withdrawn to their territory. In two weeks and four days -- that is 18 days -- the RPF fighters have gained control of the entire Mutara and Buganza regions. They have moved away from controlling only communes, and now control entire prefectures and their towns. Examples are Byumba Prefecture and its town and Kibungo and its town, which are in RPF hands. Apart from that, the RPF fighters have displayed exceptional courage. The fighting which stopped last night had even moved into the capital where the RPF is in control of strategic military positions. We support the RPF fighters and are encouraged by the selflessness and courage that they continue to exhibit in the liberation of Rwanda, while protecting innocent people, as decided by the RPF.
