The security risks are regarded as being unacceptably high. The cabinet decided this on Friday [20 May] at the behest of Defense Minister Ter Beek. The UN Security Council decided earlier this week to send a unit of 5,500 Blue Helmets to war-torn Rwanda to protect the refugees and the humanitarian aid workers. The Rwandan rebels immediately threatened to regard the UN troops as enemies if they tried to form a buffer between themselves and the government troops. It is becoming increasingly clear that the UN force for Rwanda will have to consist primarily of troops from other African countries. Informally, the Netherlands is being sounded out by the United Nations to send technical support troops. The government considered the possibility of deploying military policemen or logistics and transport troops -- a so-called "movement control unit" -- from the Army. Due to the crackdown on illegal immigrants in the border areas of the Netherlands, however, there were no military policemen available. Several dozen Army troops could be provided, but they would be in too great a danger today. Netherlanders run a particular risk in Rwanda because they closely resemble Belgians, it was admitted in The Hague. In light of the colonial past, Belgians in Rwanda and Burundi are in greater danger than other westerners. The only Netherlander in Kigali was stationed at the UNAMIR [UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda] observer mission headquarters and had to be evacuated with the Belgians. Since UNAMIR was set up in Arusha in August 1993, nine Netherlands observers, officers and noncommissioned officers in the Army, have been stationed in the area along the Ugandan-Rwandan border. On Friday, the government decided to assess the need to increase the number of observers. Furthermore, a study was launched to establish the need for military air transport for troops, foodstuffs, or medicines. The Air Force might be able to make a number of F-27's available. It is virtually out of the question that the sole Hercules C-130 owned by the Air Force will be used for this purpose. The problem is that its Netherlands crews are still undergoing training with the Belgian Air Force.
