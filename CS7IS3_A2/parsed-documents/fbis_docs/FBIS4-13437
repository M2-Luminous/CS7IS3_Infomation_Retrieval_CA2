[passage omitted] He said: Our legitimate Islamic government is the greatest gift and treasure bestowed on us by God Almighty and should therefore be cherished. Saying that a legitimate government can be harmed by a lack of trust from the people, Dr. Larijani stated: Just as the people crowd the polling booths, the people's presence on various occasions is a source of strength for the system. By the same token, if the people lose their trust in a legitimate system, that system is harmed. He added: Currently our enemies are on the wrong path and have mobilized all their resources for propaganda. They are seeking to magnify our shortcomings and to undermine the confidence of the people in the officials and the system. He mentioned that one of the ploys of the enemy was to magnify the country's debts, and added: In the middle of last year, suddenly extensive propaganda was initiated alleging that Iran could not repay its debts and had become insolvent. Some European countries to which a repayment of less than 3 billion marks was due began demanding their money, even though we had purchased goods worth more than 85 billion marks from the same countries immediately after the revolution. He continued: The same European countries have not honored their commitments to Iran worth $1.5 billion. This propaganda regarding Iran's debts is not true. The Islamic Republic of Iran is certainly not bankrupt and is one of the strongest countries in the region today. Dr. Larijani said: The enemy's propaganda is aimed at whipping up an atmosphere of diffidence among the people. Therefore, it is the obligation of the people to eliminate the conditions that foster such an atmosphere. He then referred to the issues of high prices, discrimination, and corrupt practices that inspire mistrust among the people and called on officials to tackle these problems. On the subject of the price spiral, the Tehran Majles deputy stated: The issue of high prices should be viewed in the context of the relation between the general income of the people and the basket [sabad] of expenditure, which is an extremely important matter. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the system, the Majles, the government, and all the institutions to bring it to a reasonable level. He added: The solution to high prices is for the government to create conditions conducive to production. He stressed: The people should be involved in important tasks. It is not correct for the government to produce and to keep prices at a low level artificially. Speaking of the Majles' efforts to reduce prices and inflation, the Tehran Majles deputy said: The deputies of our dear nation made extensive efforts this year to rein in inflation and to present a realistic budget with lower government expenditures, which resulted in considerable economizing. He added: The deputies have prohibited any rise in gasoline prices for 1373 [year beginning 21 March 1994], which was an appropriate measure for this year. However, in general, it should not be the policy of the government to keep prices at a low level artificially. We spend $10 billion from the Treasury every year to keep gasoline prices at the current level. If this sum is used wisely, we can perform some other major task. I do not mean that gasoline prices should be raised tomorrow as we have to be sensitive to the basket of the people's essential expenditures. We should realize the effects of all price changes on the lives of the people. Dr. Larijani emphasized: Regarding our long-term plans, we should, on principle, refrain from dipping into the Treasury merely to maintain prices at an artificially low level. The people will be able to procure their needs with a little effort unless prices are exorbitant. He added: Cash is the lifeblood of a country's economy, and at times it is expedient that this blood should be thinner and at times it should be thicker. [passage omitted] Thus, the remedy is not subsidies from the government. On the contrary, the government should release itself from such irrelevant matters and merely supervise and guide the people. This would encourage better management, which would receive support from the people, and there would be no avenues for exploitation by middlemen and tricksters who are adept in escaping the grip of the law. [passage omitted] Larijani stressed that the use and popularization of indigenous products was important, saying: The use and publicity of foreign goods should be considered contrary to our values, as it is in some of the progressive countries. For example, in South Korea, which is one of the advanced countries of the world, it is very rare to use a foreign automobile and, in fact, there are no repair shops for servicing foreign vehicles. The Tehran Majles deputy said: Our people should note that if we raise our production ourselves and make our country prosper, we will be able to cultivate similar qualities in ourselves. We should believe that we can resolve our problems and we should realize the value of our influence in the world. He elaborated: We have not gained this influence in the world in an easy manner and we should not be negligent on this matter. When the PLO and Israel said that they were to settle their differences, we opposed these talks because they ignored the lawful rights of the oppressed Palestinian people. We were ridiculed and asked who were we to do so. However, the Muslim Palestinian nation also had something to say, which was exactly what we had proclaimed. The whole world had been mobilized to support these disgraceful talks, but the slogan of "God is great" and the nature of the Palestinian nation's actions proves the great influence of our nation and revolution. The fact that to this day the Palestinian nation has been able to resist the PLO-Israel plot is a great victory for us. What country can counteract a political process that is supported by all the belligerents of the world? This is a great strength bestowed on us by the almighty, and perhaps we ourselves are unaware of this greatness. He continued: The strength that the Islamic Republic of Iran enjoys today is greater than the power of the bomb and missiles. The head of the Foreign Policy Committee of the Islamic Majles then referred to relations between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the littoral countries of the Persian Gulf and the hajj issue, saying: The Saudi Government should not deprive itself of the honor of accepting our pilgrims who wish to perform hajj. He said: Iranian pilgrims are jewels in their piety, conduct, and performance of the religious ceremonies. It is a source of shame for the Saudi Government to say that it will not accept a particular number. The Saudi Government should realize that the friendship of the Iranian Government and nation is the best base for it in the region. The friendship of the Persian Gulf countries with the Iranian Government and nation is in the best interests of these countries, as we do not covet their oil or seek to dominate them. The United States, on the other hand, does not have an interest in these governments except for dominating them and plundering their oil wealth. He added: The United States is spreading the propaganda that it is a supporter of the Persian Gulf governments, especially of the Saudi Government. A few months ago, it was revealed that the U.S. ambassador in that country was seeking to plot against that government. To me it is as clear as day that the United States intends to change the Saudi and Kuwaiti Governments in the not so distant future. Dr. Larijani said: We want the greatness of Islam and honorable and prestigious stances by Islamic countries. We want to sever the hands of foreigners from these countries so that the oil income of the Muslims is not pillaged. The sale of weapons to the Persian Gulf countries is a plot to plunder the wealth of the Islamic world, and I do not see any similar pillage in any other part of the world. You, Arab countries, can have no better friend than Iran. He concluded: I hope that the Saudi officials perceive what a great base they have in their vicinity. They should try to elicit the affection of our people and our government, and this will be the best base for them in the world. He expressed the hope that the Iranian pilgrims who wish to perform hajj will be permitted to do so regardless of their number.
