The session directed by National Assembly Vice Chairman Phung Van Tuu. The views expressed by National Assembly deputies focused on accepting workers returning from military service, on the question of female workers, and on several other issues. Deputies Pham Van Tra of Haiphong and Truong Thi Khue of Quang Tri proposed that the labor code specify that all relevant firms accept workers returning from fulfilling military obligations to encourage youths to comply with the military service law. Deputy Chu The Quynh of Hanoi said: Article 126 in Chapter XI, which deals with artistic workers, is not specific enough. We must clearly point out that we do not set the years of service needed for artistic workers to retire, but we will only fix the period of their social security contributions. On behalf of the Vietnam Women's Union Central Committee, Deputy Vo Thi thang of Long An presented the views of the Women's Union on the question of female workers. She earnestly asked the National Assembly to pass the chapter on female workers in the labor code. Deputy H' Nghia of Gia Lai proposed that the labor code have stipulations on providing vocational training for ethnic minority workers. Deputy Dang Khoi of Nam Ha proposed that the labor code clearly stipulate that firms have the responsibility of making contributions to the unemployment allowance fund. This will provide prompt assistance for workers and help the government specify the amount of contributions to be made by each type of firm. Deputy Phung Van Toan of Vinh Phu suggested that the tenth day of the third lunar month -- the death anniversary of our ancestral Hung kings -- be declared an official holiday so workers can get full pay on that day. Deputy Hoang Duc Hy of Tuyen Quang proposed that the following clause be added to Article 174 on labor strikes: If a labor strike is regarded as illegal, both the organizer and the strikers concerned must compensate their relevant employers for losses, and so forth.
