This was emphasized at talks between the Russian and PRC foreign ministers that were held today at the Diaoyutai residence in Beijing for honored guests. The heads of the two countries' foreign policy departments discussed a set of issues connected with preparations for a return visit to the Russian Federation by PRC Chairman Jiang Zemin. He is expected to arrive in Moscow for the second Russian-Chinese summit meeting in the third quarter of this year. The visit will be preceded by a trip to Beijing by Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and a trip to Moscow by PRC Foreign Minister Qian Qichen. The coming Russian-Chinese summit meeting, Andrey Kozyrev said during the talks, is meant to raise relations between our two neighboring states to a new level, a level of constructive partnership. The development of Russian-Chinese links, he emphasized, is of priority importance in Russian foreign policy, which is not subject to any temporary variations. China, the PRC foreign minister noted in turn, attaches great importance to dialogue and contacts between the leaders of the two countries, which promote deepened mutual understanding and trust. The ministers stressed the importance of the set of mutual commitments by the sides not to use force against one another in any form, including not being first to use nuclear weapons. These fundamental accords were reached at the first Russian-Chinese summit meeting in December 1992. After their talks the ministers signed an intergovernmental agreement about border crossing points between the two countries. The document specifies the legal and technical mechanism for the functioning of the crossing points and the procedure for their organization. These urgent matters, incidentally, were discussed at a regional conference of Far Eastern administration chiefs in Blagoveshchensk, in which Andrey Kozyrev took part, and during his meeting with the leadership of China's Heilongjiang province and the town of Heihe before his arrival in Beijing. So far there are 21 crossing points along the Russian-Chinese border. Last year over 2.5 million people crossed the border from both sides. A protocol was also signed on regular consultations between the Russian and Chinese foreign ministries on matters of interest to the sides. [passage omitted] In the evening Andrey Kozyrev took part in the presentation of a Russian art exhibition at the Russian Embassy in Beijing. Works by the well-known artist Tatyana Nazarenko are represented in the display. Examples of traditional national handicraft and Russian costume were presented by Leonora Gorbunova, general director of the Ivanovo history museums. The Russian foreign minister will be received tomorrow by PRC Chairman Jiang Zemin and will have a meeting with PRC Prime Minister Li Peng. In the afternoon he will fly to the Shenzhen special economic zone in southern China.
