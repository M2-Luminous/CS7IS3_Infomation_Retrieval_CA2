Kozyrev, since it "is consonant with Russia's work on a strengthening of stability on the European Continent." In the opinion of Balladur, which is shared by the Russian side, the launch conference in Paris should signify the start of a process of signing bilateral agreements and treaties and the organization of a number of roundtables for negotiations of a bilateral or regional nature on the consideration of regional aspects of good-neighbor relations between different countries. A third party would participate in them also, which would make it possible to impart to them greater objectivity. The EU and its bodies or individual members could act in this capacity. It is contemplated subsequently to summarize the agreements reached in the course of this process in the text of the European Stability Pact. It is perfectly obvious that this initiative is addressed to the nine states of Central and Eastern Europe and the Baltic who are endeavoring to become members of the EU. Before the opening of the Paris conference, Alain Juppe, French minister of foreign affairs, declared that it was designed "to define the rules of bon ton" for these countries without, nonetheless, establishing conditions of admittance for them. The main factors causing concern are the inter-nation and interethnic conflicts and the position of national minorities. They are typical to this extent or the other of practically each of the nine countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the Baltic. It is emphasized that the conference will exclude from its field of vision the crises in Bosnia, Crimea, and the Caucasus. They erupted long since, and the tasks of the European Stability Pact are primarily to exclude new ones arising. Little is said about Russia's role in the conclusion of the European Stability Pact. According to Kozyrev, it "is ready, of course, to make its contribution in the form that we deem expedient." In his speech at the Paris conference, the minister emphasized repeatedly the role and significance of the CSCE in the building of a new Europe, stressing that "matters pertaining to borders, as, equally, national minorities, should be discussed exclusively within the framework established by documents of the CSCE...." One further distinguishing feature of the future pact will be its political, not military, character. Alain Juppe, in particular, pointed to this, and Andrey Kozyrev declared plainly that "the present conference benefits from the fact that questions of stability in Europe are being framed here from the angle of democracy and human rights, not in a military context." Kozyrev simultaneously also supported military-political change finding its place in the channel of broader efforts. He confirmed that Russia would, in affiliating with the Partnership for Peace, sign a corresponding framework document with NATO together with a substantive program of cooperation, which, "of course, will reflect Russia's special role as a nuclear power." "We are for a deepening of the equal partnership of Russia and NATO without mutual vetoes and surprises," Kozyrev emphasized. After his speech, Edouard Balladur had a conversation with Andrey Kozyrev lasting almost an hour. Russia's role in the settlement of European conflicts, which France values highly, was discussed. The Russian side expressed particular concern at the slowdown in the process of Russia's membership of European structures. Balladur assured Kozyrev that all objections on the part of France had now been removed and that he saw no obstacles to Russia's membership in European institutions.
