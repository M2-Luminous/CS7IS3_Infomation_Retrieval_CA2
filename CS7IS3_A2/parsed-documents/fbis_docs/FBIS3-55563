So the fledgling enterprise is alive. When it was still only at the planning stage, people were bewildered by the author and parent of this scheme, Eduard Sagalayev: This popular television journalist had held too high posts in the past for him so easily to launch himself into a fairly risky venture. Nevertheless, in this country it is not the "nocturnal Zephyr" which floods the airwaves but the Ostankino state television tower's central control room. This is why the freedom to express oneself on television is as yet subject to many conditions here. What is there to say about one private television channel taken in isolation, which is beating the state television network's cunning ruses. At first the founder of the Moscow Independent Broadcasting Corporation's channel six really did have literally nothing except a license to broadcast -- good intentions to begin the unitary television system's destatization. He had neither premises nor funds, but nevertheless persistent rumors about each TV 6 staffer having his own Mercedes were doing the rounds even among experienced television personnel. All the more so as, after all, billionaire Ted Turner, who is famous for his whims and a certain weakness for Russia, became TV 6's patron. The emergence of the channel was, oh, so complicated. For a whole year representatives of the Moscow Independent Broadcasting Corporation and Turner Broadcasting Systems,zmopping their fevered brows, busted a gut to put together a contract for the joint enterprise: Lawyers in Russia had never before had to work on such a project. They came to an agreement after long discussions: Russian news stories would come together in a sizzling combination with American films on TV 6. The idea behind Sagalayev's enterprise could not have made better sense: a channel standing outside politics and ideology and enjoying all the advantages of an outsider. "A very opportune idea," a well-known politician, who today would hardly be able to hold his audience's attention, would say about this: The elections proved that the "electorate" no longer excuses poor delivery. As far as TV 6 is concerned, politics exists only in its strictly private manifestation -- in the family setting. Here it is, however, no less controversial and hazardous than intrigues at the highest level. Whereas the other five channels are running discussions on the grave crisis, TV 6 is unabashedly putting out a Fred Astaire tap dancing routine, the breathy tones of Tatyana Doronina, the guilty smile of Leonov, and so on and so forth. Unfortunately, the majority of our cinemas' posters simply cannot compete with TV 6: "Hollywood's Golden Film Library," "Cinema TV 6," "Children's Screening," and starting in the new year "Masterpieces of World Cinema" -- where else will you see such a wide range of films? But channel six had to remember about unity of place and time: The neutral black studio backdrop was no help. The talk show "Eduard Sagalayev Presents..." first of all introduced the viewers to an "apolitical" Federov, then afterwards announced a forthcoming meeting with Sergey Shakhray. It is good that this rendezvous did not take place: Politicians are not protected by the wives they appear alongside on TV 6. The very sad conclusion has inevitably to be drawn: It is impossible to live in our society and be free from.... It is all right to talk about anything else, and he has some highly attractive future proposals. In January the first editions of the television magazine program for men and women will go out: To the CNN international news will be added thematic news broadcasts from this corporation which are unknown to the Russian viewing public: "Show Business News," "Traveler's Guide," "A Look into the Future," and "Style." An unusual gameshow "Your Decision" is in store for the viewers, which is a series of films, in which the viewers themselves determine the outcome of the action. The first sports broadcasts will appear on TV 6 in 1994: TV 6 will be screening footage of the U.S. open figure skating championships in January.
