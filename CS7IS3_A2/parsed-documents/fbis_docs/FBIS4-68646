At the time, the young man seemed to have taken on a hopeless task: in prosperous, bustling Sagaredzhoyskiy Rayon, a little village called Udabno had been built. And Lado was elected the village's first mayor. The village leaders and their subordinates had to do a lot of heavy, day-and-night labor, but they got a lot done. Now a couple of months ago, Sagaredzhoyskiy Rayon elected its new head--Lado Markhvashvili. At such times we journalists usually say, he's a seasoned worker. Often, the particular individual does not deserve it, but in this case Lado really is an excellent choice. His biography tells us that he has served as a Sagaredzhoyskiy Rayon official at various times, and was chairman of the agroindustrial complex. Most important, he is still the same hearty and industrious man he was when he was elected mayor of the newly founded village. Things to do? As the Great Ilia says, there's plenty to do; all it takes is a sharp sickle. "It will take major, unstinting toil to save Georgia. Literally or figuratively, it will take a sharp sickle to save us." These were the words Sagaredzhoyskiy Rayon's head began our talk with. [Kurkhuli] Batono Lado, since you mentioned sickles, just how much of a crop will you have to harvest? [Markhvashvili] In late October we only had 1,200 hectares of fall crops sown. Then we got behind on cropping schedules. But we got busy, and by now we have sown 7,200 hectares. We will be harvesting spring crops on 1,700 hectares. It goes without saying that we have a lot of work to do tending the crops in spring; we'll have to figure out a way to get gasoline and diesel fuel. [Kurkhuli] Recently, the head of Udabno visited you and asked for help getting diesel fuel and other things. You gave it to him readily. Don't you think you're still paying more attention to "your" village and letting the others go? [Markhvashvili] People are probably kidding you. In my own hometown of Patardzeuli I always had an "oppositioner"--my father. He was a machinery operator, and if I failed to give their farm a ballbearing, he would give me such a hard time I was afraid to go home. What do you think happens to me now, when Potardzeuli and the whole rayon is in trouble, and everybody knows me? But I do have to admit that a lot of people, many sons of the land, put a lot of sweat into Udabno. I'm nobody special. But I do truly believe that we did a good thing to build a village in our forefathers' sacred place, and that was Udabno. No matter what happens to us now, that foundation is going to stay, or else what kind of patriots would we be? Probably that's why I pay so much attention to Udabno, but as for the others getting left out, Udabno is having as hard a time as the rest of Georgia. [Kurkhuli] Kakhetia is a land of bread and wine, and Sagaredzhoyskiy Rayon is the gateway to it. How are the vineyards doing? [Markhvashvili] Most of the vineyards have been privatized, but the results have not been beneficial. Do you think most of the Kakhetians don't care about vineyards anymore? God forbid, but we haven't been able to take care of them... we haven't had the fuel, chemicals, and sulfur. These are things we have to take care of starting now. The sulfur has been brought in. People are hungry, we cannot deny it. The situation is truly deplorable and disastrous. An abundance of agricultural products will help us. We must also point out that although we have received agricultural credits, we can't survive with high-interest loans. [Kurkhuli] Sagaredzhoyskiy Rayon always had plenty of sheep and cows. The Giorgitsminda Hog Complex had lots of animals, and Patardzeuli had its poultry plant. Now, nothing seems to be left. [Markhvashvili] That was a time of terrible mistakes and shortsightedness for all of Georgia. Naturally, the trouble spread to Sagaredzhoyskiy Rayon too. The kolkhozes and farms were dismantled, people stole the livestock. There used to be over 5,000 cows in the rayon, now there are only 1,605. The number of sheep and hogs has also gone down. Our aim is to do everything we can to build up our livestock. Useful steps have been taken in the poultry plants. We have to do what we can to straighten things out, we have no other choice. [Kurkhuli] Sagaredzhoyskiy Rayon also has highland districts, the villages of the Gombori and Kochbani. Our editors received a critical letter from some anonymous readers demanding the restoration of the Gombori and Kochbani farms. I know that district, I'm personally acquainted with every person there. In that letter, which I showed you, a lot of workers are being blamed unfairly. I realized that when I went to those villages yesterday and the day before. What interests me, however, is whether the Gombori and Kochbani farms can be restored as the anonymous letter writers want. [Markhvashvili] How can we restore them to what they were? That would be turning back the clock! We would have to take away people's orchards and crop fields. It simply can't be done. Those farms no longer have cattle or other livestock. It would only be possible to create agricultural links to take care of the workers' own farms. Another thing is that a lot of grain was stolen from the Kochbani farm. The Procuracy is looking into it, and it will all be clarified. [Kurkhuli] Sagaredzhoyskiy Rayon used to be the biggest industrial district in all of Kakhetia. In the past 10 or 12 years, not counting three or four disastrous years, the millions generated by industrial goods greatly exceeded the millions generated by the supposedly traditional agricultural sector. [Markhvashvili] Yes, that was true, but what used to be is now no more. We no longer have electrical power, or gas, and the big industrial plants have shut down--the reenforced concrete products plant, the tire repair plant, and the auto repair plant. The rayon has also been hurt bad by the closing of the wine bottling plant. The recent economic agreement between Georgia and Russia has made us hopeful. These industrial facilities will resume operation and our economy will probably get back on its feet. [Kurkhuli] Batono Lado, you said that all this has to be done. There is no other choice. Could you say a bit about what you have managed to do? People are hurting. [Markhvashvili] Not one emergency medical vehicle was working, but we managed to provide one emergency vehicle with gasoline, and we know that we can get help to someone in trouble. The bus that connects the city of Sagaredzho with the railroad station is operating again. We have focused all our effort on providing people with bread. We have an emergency there too. One thing that makes me feel a little better is that in the highland districts, the villages of the Gombori, where things were supposedly the worst, the situation is actually better. We have made up a list of people who are alone or sick and we're doing what we can to help. [Kurkhuli] In conclusion, what wish do you have? [Markhvashvili] I'd like to see Garedzhians smiling again.
