Lu Ping slipped by more than 100 protesters and journalists waiting for him in the lobby of the Kowloon-Canton Railway station at Hunghom. A coalition of about 120 groups charged Mr. Lu with being insincere in his claims of wanting to listen to Hong Kong people's views during his 10-day visit. They vowed to continue their protest in the coming few days until they successfully conveyed their discontent on the sentencing of Hong Kong reporter Xi Yang to Mr. Lu. Following the unsuccessful attempt to meet Mr. Lu, about 10 representatives from the Coalition for the Release of Xi Yang marched to the Bank of China Building in Central, where Mr. Lu is to attend the bank's note issuance ceremony today. They set up tents outside the bank and pledged to stay there all night. Pro-democracy activist Lau Shan-ching said Mr. Lu was acting like a mouse, being too afraid to face his critics. "Didn't he say that he was coming to Hong Kong to meet the people of Hong Kong? What is the point of him escaping from us like that?" he said. Mr. Lu took the 4:13 pm train from Guangzhou yesterday afternoon, accompanied by officials from the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, of which he is director, Chinese members of the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) and about 200 members of China's National People's Congress, Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, local PWC members and some of Beijing's Hong Kong Affairs Advisers. They arrived at Hunghom at 6:50 pm and immediately walked from the Carriage No. 6 to a Mercedes-Benz limousine which had been driven into the cargo area near the platform. He and a band of security men boarded the limousine and left the station without seeing the protest in the arrival hall, one floor above. There was no official greeting from the Hong Kong Government. A short press briefing scheduled after his arrival was cancelled because of the "large crowd" waiting at the station lobby. Mr. Lu's refusal to meet the protesters follows his earlier rejection of talks with Governor Chris Patten, who had sought discussions on a wide range of unsettled matters relating to the handover in 1997. Before his arrival, Mr. Lu shrugged off an invitation from Mr. Patten to discuss the transition of the civil service and measures to curb the escalating property prices. While turning Mr. Patten down, Mr. Lu has included in his tight schedule a meeting with at least five of the most influential civil servants associations next Saturday.
