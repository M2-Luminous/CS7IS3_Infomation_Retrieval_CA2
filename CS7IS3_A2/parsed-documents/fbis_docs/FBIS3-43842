"The ANC [African National Congress] wins hands down, not only nationally but in seven of the nine provinces, and perhaps in all of them." De Klerk's ability to defend minority interests is doubted due to his own party's weak showing in the poll, while a question is also raised over the ANC's adherence to democratic principles. "Deep sceptism abouth the ANC's devotion to democracy is understandable, especially while the ANC horse carries its SACP [South African Communist Party] jockey, but it's the best we have," especially in light of the poll results showing the Pan Africanist Congress, PAC, as blacks second choice. "Those whites who see Mr Mandela as the devil incarnate .... might reflect: it could be worse. This analysis defines rather neatly the task which lies ahead for the minority communities, and especially the white community: it is to help the ANC, after April 27, to make South Africa work," otherwise the country faces the possible "capture of power by a radical black nationalist PAC." What the country needs now is "a new breed of subtle men and women" like Finance Minister Derek Keys, who has shown how "honest consultation and wise diplomacy" can "woo the ANC towards success." SUNDAY STAR ANC Urged To Campaign Honestly -- "Optimism about the future is understandable, particularly among South Africa's millions of unemployed black youth," begins the Johannesburg SUNDAY STAR in English on 16 January in a page 26 editorial. "Now with democracy just months away they believe the new government is going to improve education and provide jobs. And do this overnight. There is every reason to believe the ANC is going to try its damndest to deliver the goods, but it's going to take time, and the going will be tough," therefore, "the ANC must not make promises it cannot keep. The ANC must prepare the understandably impatient youth for the realities it will face when it moves into the Union Buildings in three months' time." "If it promises the earth and can't deliver in the short term, there's going to be more than heartache as a result," concludes the SUNDAY STAR. BEELD Right Wing Alliance Pursuit for Homeland -- "At the end of last year, when the right wing began their hesitant dialogue with the African National Congress, General Constand Viljoen declared that they would [word indistinct] in a page 8 editorial. "Just a few weeks later the very same general and his co-leaders were forced to throw in the towel; the ANC was also not going to give it to them. Now they are looking at `other ways' of achieving their homeland." "The Freedom Alliance, and in particular right-wing Afrikaners, must realize that one door after another is being closed to them because they are failing to use their options and come forward with realistic plans. The government realized a while ago that the right wing rarely used a rational approach. Now Mr. Nelson Mandela is apparently also beginning to discover this. It is necessary for everyone to realize that the losers will not be those on whose behalf Messrs Mandela and De klerk speak. It will be Messrs Buthelezi, Viljoen, Hartzenberg, and Mangope's followers who, because of the shortsighted actions of their leaders, are being defined out of the creation process of the new politics. Even Ciskei's Oupa Gqozo could see that." Black Matriculants' Performance `Pathetic' -- A second editorial on the same page of BEELD says that "the pathetic performance of black matriculants in the end-of-year examinations surprises no one. The tragedy was foretold during the course of last year. Now the bitter fruit of timely warnings, which no one heeded, are being plucked. It is true that black education is not up to standard. Yet at those black schools where discipline was maintained, students did very well. There were even schools where all the matriculants passed their examinations. The political misuse of pupils, vandalism, organized stayaways by pupils, and strikes by teachers, who act only in self-interest, were the offenders who contributed most to the poor results. Fortunately, it seems that those who caused the anarchy are beginning to come to their senses. The Congress of South African Students has called on pupils to return to school and cultivate a culture of learning, and the South African Democratic Teachers' Union has committed itself to a disruption-free school year in 1994."
