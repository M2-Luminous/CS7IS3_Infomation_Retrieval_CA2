FR940317-2-00086 FR940317-2-00058 NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION Proposed Availability of FY 94 Funds for Financial Assistance (Grants) To Support Research at Educational Institutions and the Exchange of Information AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research, announces proposed availability of Fiscal Year (FY) 94 funds to support a limited number of research grants to educational institutions. These funds may also be used to support professional meetings and conferences for the exchange and transfer of research concepts and findings related to the safety of nuclear power production. The FY 94 ceiling for research grants to educational institutions is approximately $1,218,000.00. Of this amount, approximately $817,000.00 will be available for new grants. Because of this limitation, proposed grant budgets should be restricted to about $50,000.00 per year, with total project funding not exceeding $100,000.00 over a two-year period. Proposals for new FY 94 research grants should be submitted between the date of this Notice and May 20, 1994. Proposals received after May 20, 1994 will be considered for FY 94 funding to the extent practicable. ADDRESSES: Nuclear Regulatory Commission, ATTN: Grants Officer, Mail Stop P&hyph;841, Division of Contracts and Property Management, Office of Administration, Washington, DC 20555. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Leslie Mills or Dennis Tarner on (301) 492&hyph;7054. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On November 27, 1993, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) published in the Federal Register a notice that announced the proposed availability of FY 93 funds for the NRC Grant Program. The NRC is revising that notice to provide information on their grant program for FY 94. Scope and Purpose of This Announcement Pursuant to Section 31.a and 141.b. of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, the NRC's Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research proposes to support educational institutions, nonprofit entities, state and local governments, and professional societies through providing funds for expansion, exchange and transfer of knowledge, ideas, and concepts directed toward the NRC safety research program. The program includes, but is not limited to, support of professional meetings and conferences. In addition, the NRC has a limited amount for research grants to educational institutions (see topics below). The FY 94 ceiling for these grants is approximately $1,218,000.00 with approximately $871,000.00 of this amount available for new grants. The purpose of this program is to stimulate research to provide a technological base for the safety assessment of system and subsystem technologies used in nuclear power applications. The results of this program will be to increase public understanding relating to nuclear safety, to pool the funds of theoretical and practical knowledge and technical information, and ultimately to enhance the protection of the public health and safety. In addition, each grant to an educational institution should contain elements which will potentially benefit the graduate research program of the institution, e.g., graduate student training. The NRC encourages educational institutions to submit research grant proposals in the following areas: 1. Experiments and predictive modeling for thermal stratification, thermal stripping and flow-induced vibration in plant fluid systems. 2. Evaluation and modeling of phenomena associated with the addition of cooling water to a degraded core during various stages of a severe accident.
