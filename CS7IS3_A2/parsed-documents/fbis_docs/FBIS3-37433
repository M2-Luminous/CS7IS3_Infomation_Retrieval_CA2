"I think that if we manage to attract investments in the necessary amounts, Kazakhstan may become a major exporter of crude oil, because our domestic demand is only 20 million tonnes and our oil output has already reached 27 million tonnes," Nazarbayev said. "Now we should look for ways of ensuring oil transportation. There is no alternative so far to the laying of an oil pipeline to Novorossiisk across the Russian territory. Its capacity will be from 15 to 17 million tonnes, which will meet our demands for some 80 years to come. However, since we are planning to produce 100 to 120 million tonnes early in the coming century, we shall need alternative routes for oil export. This is a very important question for us," he continued. "The former Soviet Union connected all its republics with Europe through Russia, and now this is the only (possible) way (of transportation). This is why we intend to establish railway communication with China and, through China, with the Pacific coast. We are examining plans of laying pipelines to the south, i.e. to the Persian Gulf, to Turkey and the Mediterranean via Iran and to the Mediterranean via the Caspian Sea and the Caucasus." The Kazakh president said. [punctuation as received] The president described the signing of a major contract with the U.S. Chevron company last April as an important event. The contract deals with the oil field, which, according to Nazarbayev, is equal to the Alaska oil field. He said that, aside from Chevron, a consortium will operate in Kazakhstan, specifically, in the West-Kazakh part of the oil and gas bearing area which, according to estimates, contains 25 billion tonnes of hydrocarbons, suitable for extraction. "Kazakhstan is fully self-sufficient in energy resources and is even exporting them. It is also self-sufficient in food and is exporting it. So, our problem is to gain access to southern seas and find ways to the world market as soon as possible", Nazarbayev stressed.
