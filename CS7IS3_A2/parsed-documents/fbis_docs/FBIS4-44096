At its peak, France even went as far as providing Rwanda's governmental army with some 150 French Government consultants or military advisers on permanent secondment, not to mention the 400 paratroopers sent in 1993 to fight the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), which at the time was backed by Uganda. In addition, it supplied no less than 20 million francs [Fr] in military equipment each year (or Fr40 million, including soldiers' pay). The men sent to Rwanda to train its regular army mostly belonged to the 1st Marine Paratrooper Corps (RPIMa), normally based in Bayonne. The 1st RPIMa is directly under the command of the army chief of staff; it is a unit which performs special missions. It was sometimes relieved by teams from the 13th Corps of Paratrooper Dragoons (RDP) based in Dieuze (Moselle), whose forte is reconnaissance operations deep into hostile terrain. Commandos belonging to the 13th RDP even entered Uganda covertly to assess the nature of the assistance provided by this country to RPF fighters. Equipment provided by France, some of which was supplied for free, to the Rwandan Armed Forces (FAR) was very diverse, including light armored vehicles, Gazelle helicopters, Noratlas or Guerrier aircraft, and pieces of field artillery. When the fighting between the RPF and President Habyarimana's army was at its fiercest, the guns were sometimes operated by French soldiers. Traumatized French Soldiers Similarly, French advisers were provided with light-intensifier binoculars which make it possible to see and shoot at night just as if it is broad daylight, in case they needed to carry out clandestine actions. Binoculars of this type were then left in the hands of the Rwandan Armed Forces. For his travel needs, President Habyarimana was given a Falcon 50 tri-jet aircraft (which was shot down, probably with a ground-to-air missile, while landing on 6 April) to replace a Caravelle III aircraft. Never, however, were French military advisers instructed to supervise or train Hutu militias, whose role in the exactions perpetrated in Rwanda are today acknowledged by all, and which are even now still slaughtering Hutu civilians. These militias, whose weapons are often rather primitive, are complacently left to their own devices by Rwanda's regular army, which relies on them for the "dirty jobs" it wants to have carried out in the field. Among those French soldiers who evacuated foreign nationals in April as part of operation "Amaryllis," after President Habyarimana's plane was downed, some remember being assaulted by Hutu militiamen who had gone berserk. Worse, some of the French soldiers who were sent to Rwanda to escort some 1,420 foreign nationals to Bangui (Central African Republic) had to witness -- without being able to intervene -- crimes committed by Hutu militias in Kigali and the surrounding countryside. Today, these French soldiers admit that they remain "traumatized" by orders forbidding them to react, even while massacres were going on under their eyes.
