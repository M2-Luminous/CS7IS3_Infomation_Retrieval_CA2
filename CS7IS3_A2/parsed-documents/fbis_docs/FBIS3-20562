In sharp contrast, there have been endless fiscal problems in China in the same period, including a mounting budget deficit that came back year after year. A heated debate revolving around the budget deficit is now underway in the theoretical circles and in the functional departments from a variety of perspectives. This article focuses on government budget deficits in the seven years (abbreviated hereafter as the last seven years) between 1986 and 1992 (including those in the Seventh Five-Year Plan). 1. Characteristics of Budget Deficits The Chinese Government ran a budget deficit every year in the 14 years between 1979 and 1992 with the exception of 1985, when it reported a tiny surplus as a result of one-time factors, accumulating a combined deficit of 130 billion yuan, or 10 billion yuan annually on the average. If debt incomes are discounted, China's budget was in the red every year for the past 14 years, with a combined deficit of 400 billion yuan, more than 30 billion yuan each year on the average. See table below for details. By halving the 14-year period, we see that budget deficits of the last seven years had the following characteristics: 1) The deficits increased persistently all round. Regardless of whether the narrow or broad definition is used, China ran a budget deficit in each of the last seven years. (See table below.) Under the narrow definition, the accumulated deficit shot up to 336,559,000,000 yuan, 3.7 times that of the first seven years. Table 1 Revenue and Expenditures of the Chinese Government 1979-1992 (unit: in billions of yuan) Item/Year 1979 1980 1981 1982 1983 1984 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 Gross Revenue 110.33 108.52 108.95 112.4 124.9 150.19 186.64 226.03 236.89 262.80 294.79 331.26 358.28 391.21 Including: 3.53 4.30 8.39 7.94 7.73 8.99 13.83 16.96 27.08 28.3 37.55 45.5 79.41 Debt incomes Tc> 7.31 Gross 127.39 12.17 11.15 115.33 129.25- 154.64 184.48 233.08 244.85 270.66 304.02 345.22 379.39 412.0 Expenditures Difference -17.06 -12.75 -2.55 -2.93 -4.35 -4.45 -2.16(as -7.05 -7.96 -7.86 -9.23 -13.96 -21.11 -20.79 Between pub.)

Source: "China Statistical Yearbook," 1991, JINGJI RIBAO 6 April 1992. 2. Difference between revenue and expenditures = gross revenue - gross expenditures. 3. Net difference between revenue and expenditures = gross revenue -debt incomes - gross expenditures Not only did the government deficits for the last seven years show a sustained increase, but they were present in the entire process. Earlier, the government drew up a balanced budget only to see it dip into the red during the execution and policy-making stages. Later, it started out with an unbalanced budget, so the deficit was there from the beginning and remained there through the execution and policy-making stages. This is clear from the government's 1992 budget, where gross incomes were listed as 391,213,000,000 yuan and gross expenditures, 411,939,000,000 yuan, yielding a deficit of 20,786,000,000 yuan (as published). This kind of persistent, all-round, and process-long deficits portend a deteriorating fiscal state for the nation. 2) Coexistence between printing money and issuing bonds to close the budget deficit Basically there are two well-established ways to close a budget deficit: one, issue treasury bonds at home and overseas to raise funds, and, two, print money. Recurrent expenditures in the last seven years amounted to 1,883,433,000 yuan in all, while expenditures totalled a whopping 2,189,922,000 yuan, resulting in a shortfall of 306,489,000,000 yuan. The issue of bonds at home and abroad raised 217,827,000,000 yuan, still leaving a gap of 88,662,000,000 yuan. This left the government no choice but to print money to balance the budget. As a result, the deficits of the last seven years had a duality to them: both the issue of bonds and money-printing were used to close the budget gap. 3) Coexistence between economic growth and rising government deficits The Chinese economy enjoyed fast and sustained growth in the last seven years, with the GNP expanding at the average annual rate of 10.94 percent each year. See table below for year-by-year GNP data. Table 2. GNP 1986-1992 (unit: in billions of yuan) Item/Year 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 GNP 969.63 113.01 1,401.82 1,591.63 1,768.61 1,892.41 2,005.95 Be that as it may, there was not the slightest improvement in the government's fiscal plight. On the contrary, the deficit rose 16.7 percent annually on the average based on the narrow definition and 25.1 percent using the broad definition. The deficit outpaced economic growth by 7 to 15 percentage points annually on the average. Thus, the last seven years were characterized by the coexistence between fast economic growth and a deficit rising just as fast. In fact, what distinguishes the last seven years is the fact that budget deficits increased at a rate higher than the economy. This is the sign of a worsening fiscal situation. The average annual growth rate of the GNP exceeded 10 percent in the first seven years also, yet the budget deficit fell 15 percent annually. We had the best of both economic worlds then: economic growth and a shrinking budget deficit. 4) Coexistence between a budget deficit at the central level and local budget deficits The nation was in a fiscal bind in the last seven years, running a deficit year in, year out. The fiscal difficulties were common to local governments as well as the central government: Both were in the red in just about every year. Table 3 gives a detailed picture of the coexistence of budget deficits at the two levels, national and local. Table 3: Budget Deficits at Central and Local Levels 1986-1992 (unit: in billions of yuan) Item/Year 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 Combined -7.05 -7.96 -7.86 -9.23 -13.96 -21.11 -23.75 National Deficit Central -4.55 -12.66 -1.49 +0.03 -0.49 -18.07 -20.64 deficit Local -2.50 +4.70 -6.37 -9.26 -13.47 -3.04 -3.11 deficit While the budget deficit of the central government rose 24.1 percent each year on the average, the budget gap at the local level expanded 3.1 percent. In contrast, there was no such coexistence in the first seven years, particularly during the Sixth Five-Year Plan. Although the central treasury was unable to balance its books in those years, local governments ended each year with a surplus. That both national and local governments are now drowning in a sea of red ink testifies to the accelerating deterioration of our fiscal position. 2. Causes of Budget Deficits in Successive Years Budget deficits were caused by a host of factors, some external to public finance, some having to do with public finance itself. 1) A broad decline in profitability Measured by whatever indicator--gross social output value, GNP, or national income, the Chinese economy grew by more than 10 percent annually during the last seven years. In real prices, the gross social output value rose 14.8 percent each year on the average; gross industrial output value, 12.8 percent; and national income, 12.9 percent. But robust economic growth has not been accompanied by an equally brisk increase in government revenue. Take the profit and tax to investment ratio, for instance, which is directly related to how much the government collects in revenue. The profit and tax to investment ratio has been declining in successive years. For enterprises owned by the whole people, the profit and tax to investment ratio dropped from 20.7 percent in 1986 to 12.4 percent in 1990, a decline of 8.3 percentage points. Calculations show that because of the fall in the profit and tax to investment ratio, the treasury collected a total of 125 billion yuan less in taxes and profits in the Seventh Five-Year Plan, a drop of 25 billion yuan each year. By 1992, the ratio had slipped to just 10.11 percent for industry nationwide, a 100 percent decline. This shows that economic growth in China came at a high cost; the growth was fast but low in profit, thus driving down the profit and tax to investment ratio year after year. The plunge in profitability lies at the heart of the string of budget deficits over the years. 2) The decline of government revenue as a share of GNP What the government collects as revenue makes up part of the added value created in all sectors of the national economy that finds its way into the hands of the government through distribution and redistribution. Revenue originates in the third phase of industrialization. Given a particular set of circumstances, changes in the size of government revenue as a share of GNP should be in direct proportion to changes in the magnitude of the revenue; the higher the percentage, the greater the revenue, and vice versa. The size of the revenue relative to the GNP plays a critical role in the formation, changes, and development of the deficit. Government revenue accounted for more than 20 percent of the GNP every year during the first seven years. Since 1987, however, the share has been declining, down to 16 percent in 1988-1991 and a mere 15.5 percent in 1992. In developed Western countries, government revenue typically constitutes over 40 percent of the GNP, and in Asia's four mini-dragons, over 25 percent. China was off by 25 percentage points compared to the former and 10 percentage points compared to the latter. When the percentage is too low, government revenue inevitably shrinks and any increase will be slow in coming. This is a major cause of China's budget deficits. 3) The heavy burden of government subsidies In the last seven years the treasury shelled out 333.8 billion yuan in all to subsidize money-losing enterprises and another 233 billion yuan in price subsidies. Total price tag: 566.8 billion yuan, far in excess of the sum of budget deficits for the same period. While this shows that public finance in China is people-oriented and production construction-driven, it also leaves absolutely no doubt that the onerous burden of government financial subsidies is an extremely important explanation of China's fiscal woes, including the budget deficits it has been piling up many years in a row. 4) Government revenue losses a severe problem The massive amount of revenue that has been lost, particularly as a result of tax evasion, is another major cause of China's fiscal difficulties and budget deficits in the last seven years. Because of flagrant tax evasion, a substantial amount of revenue that should have gone into the national coffers was simply lost for nothing. Reportedly, the tax evasion rate is 10 percent in developed nations and 20 percent or so in developing countries. There are no reliable statistics on China, but a number of existing studies does give us a glimpse of the dimensions of tax evasion and tax underpayment in China. According to a survey by the Xiangtan tax bureau in Hunan, 44.2 percent and 32.3 percent of individual industrial and commercial households practiced tax evasion in 1988 and 1990, respectively. In 1988, only 3 billion yuan or so were collected in revenue from individuals. In 1989, following the nation's first personal tax general inspection, the figure shot up to 13.2 billion yuan. The increase continued in 1990, hitting 14.5 billion yuan. Be that as it may, insiders believe that the government is collecting at most half of what is owed the treasury in taxes. Every inspection, so said a tax official from the Chaoyang district in Beijing, shows that at least 90 percent of the state enterprises and collective enterprises had some tax problems, large or small. Thus tax underpayment and tax evasion have become a chronic problem in tax collection--a big budget buster. 5) Budgetary discipline softening and spending getting out of control Some of the causes of fiscal difficulties can be found at the revenue end, others at the spending end. At the spending end, a striking problem is softening budgetary discipline and the loss of control over spending. This manifests itself not only in the way the scale of capital construction was widened without authorization, including the reckless proliferation of nonproductive projects, buildings, hotels, etc., but also in the multiplication and over-staffing of government organs at all levels. Turning to the number of people on the public payroll, the wages of 15 million people came out of the nation's budgets in 1979. By late 1991, the number had risen to almost 40 million, a 267 percent increase over 1979. In 1980, administrative costs nationwide amounted to 40.4 billion yuan. By 1991, it was 140 billion yuan, up 347 percent compared to 1980. Some localities waste national funds wantonly, causing severe fiscal difficulties. 6) Explosion of off-budget funds There is a finite amount of funds at the disposal of the treasury at any given point in time. Budget funds and off-budget funds are related to each other and money can be shifted from one to the other. Under normal circumstances, off-budget funds should be lower than budget funds in terms of both the absolute increase and the growth rate. Just the opposite happened in the last seven years. Off-budget funds soared. Take the 1986-1989 period, for instance. While budget funds rose a mere 5.86 percent annually on the average, off-budget funds expanded rapidly at the average annual rate of 11.22 percent, double that of budget funds. Absolutely speaking, there were almost as much off-budget funds as there are budget funds. As more treasury funds were shifted outside the budget, the amount that remained inevitably diminished. This is another important reason why the state became strapped for funds and could not balance its budget. 3. The Nature of Budget Deficits For 14 years the Chinese Government ran a deficit in its budget year after year, but the nature of the deficit changed over time. At the beginning the policy was to "balance revenue with expenditures and come up with a little surplus." The government started out by drawing up a balanced budget, not a deficit budget. However, the subjective did not coincide with the objective in the course of implementation, that is, projected revenues did not materialize while expenditures exceeded what was planned. The result: a deficit, an unforeseen deficit that occurred because the projected balance was upset by new factors. During the Sixth Five-Year Plan, there was a gradual erosion of public appreciation for the fiscal policy of "balancing revenue with expenditures and coming up with a little surplus," while the inconsistency between the finite nature of revenue and the infinite nature of spending was over-emphasized. Prompted by a desire for instant gain and dismissing deficits as harmless, we relaxed the spending restraint in executing the budget and increased expenditures as we pleased. Revenue and expenditures thus went out of balance and a deficit ensued, an artificial kind of deficit that resulted from conscious decisions. As the Seventh Five-Year Plan went underway, the policy of "balancing revenue with expenditures and coming up with a small surplus" fell by the wayside, the prevailing idea then being that "it is alright to run a deficit." Under the new policy, the deficit was made part and parcel of the entire budgetary process, from its preparation to its implementation. It was used to close the gap created by the excess of expenditures over revenue, to expand the scale of construction, and to run and develop the economy and all sorts of undertakings. In essence, what we had was a deficit policy; what we practiced was deficit economics. 4. Closing Budget Deficits: Major Strategies To overcome our fiscal difficulties and eliminate the budget deficit, the most basic solution is to raise the level of profitability of the entire national economy substantially during the third phase of industrialization, effectively ending the situation in recent years when the economy was locked in fast but unprofitable growth. Certainly, raising the level of profitability is an extremely arduous piece of systems engineering, absolutely not something that can be tackled by the Ministry of Finance alone. But this does not mean that finance agencies should sit by idly and do nothing. On the contrary, they must play an active part to push the enterprise along. This article focuses on ways of resolving the fiscal difficulties and eliminating the budget deficit primarily from the perspective of finance agencies. These are some of the more important steps that can be taken: 1) Clearly define a guiding philosophy for public finance For years after the PRC was founded, it had always been the philosophy of public finance in China to "do what one is capable of, balance revenue with expenditures, and come up with a small surplus." As reform and the open policy went into full swing and hampered by the decline in profitability, the gap between revenue and expenditures widened by the day. In recent years a heated discussion has been underway revolving around the question of whether deficit budgeting is any way to close the gap. At the heart of the discussion is this: Are deficits good or bad? Pedantic arguments and counter-arguments continue to fly back and forth, with no conclusion in sight. In essence, however, the controversy is really over whether our public finance philosophy needs to be reformed. Take a look around the world today. All countries that follow a deficit economic policy, whether capitalist or socialist, now find themselves in a bind: saddled with debts and a string of budget deficits and caught in economic turmoil and relentless inflation. Rare is the country which manages to break this cycle. Even the United States, the paramount capitalist superpower, has finally seen the light after tasting to the full the bitter fruits of deficit budgeting for years. As soon as he assumed office, President Clinton started pushing for an end to the deficit and has taken a number of practical steps to trim the deficit. As for the developing nations that have adopted deficit budgeting, the vast majority of them are being plagued by inflation and staggering under a mountain of debts that will never be paid off in full, their economies in worse shape than ever. What China has been following in recent years is actually a deficit economic policy. Although the policy has not yet resulted in economic disruptions of disastrous proportions, the skyrocketing inflation of 1989 and the subsequent drive to improve the economic climate and rectify the economic order are clear signals. They also mirror the "time release" effects of deficit budgeting. As the peak period of debt repayment looms on the horizon, China has gotten to the stage where it must take out new loans to pay off old ones. In 1992 debt incomes accounted for 20 percent of gross revenue for that year. In the same year, however, debt expenditures amounted to 54 percent of debt incomes. This is something to be taken note of. In price reform, the two tracks are beginning to merge and full-fledged price decontrol is now under way. The prices of certain capital goods and articles of daily use are rising rapidly. Some signals, such as the depreciation of the renminbi against the dollar, are all raising the inflationary expectations of consumers (and producers too) to various extents. We are now at a turning point where consumers expect change; people are anticipating a new round of inflation. Accordingly, the prolonged and widespread existence of budget deficits, whether covered by borrowing or the issue of more money, is harmful. Only by adhering to the fiscal philosophy of "do what one is capable of, balance revenue with expenditures, and come up with a small surplus" can we ensure that the economy and revenue grow at the same pace. 2) Improve revenue collection management and supervision. Revenue collection is the cornerstone of all public finance operations. Thus far finance departments at all levels have done an enormous amount of constructive work to strengthen collection management and supervision. Their achievements must be acknowledged. However, we also should see that tax underpayment, tax evasion, and tax cheating continue on a large scale so that the treasury cannot get hold of the funds it is entitled to and ends up with reduced revenue. Had collection management been tightened further, the national coffers would have been enriched by 30 billion yuan, or 10 percent. Thus improving collection management and supervision is a major tool to overcome fiscal difficulties and erase the deficit. Since taxes make up over 80 percent of government revenue, we should concentrate on beefing up tax collection and supervision. Besides improving existing methods of proven effectiveness, we should study extensively the effective measures that other countries, particularly developed nations, have adopted to strengthen tax collection management and supervision and combat tax evasion, modifying for application in China those that are scientific and suited to China's conditions in order to further improve and strengthen its tax collection and supervision system. As for measures now in use which are known to be effective, such as the annual tax general inspection, they should be continued steadfastly and improved further. Penalties and punishments should be made more severe to prevent continuous revenue losses and deter new tax underpayment and evasion effectively. These days tax offenders are fined and ordered to pay back what they owe the government in taxes. But then they would turn around and continue their tax evasion until they face yet another round of the same penalties. We must break that vicious cycle. Serious blatant tax evaders must be dealt with in accordance with the law and punished harshly. In addition, these days localities cut or waive taxes and call them preferential policies. The upshot is that tax revenues are fragmented and funds that should have flowed into the national coffers are misused or siphoned off into other channels. We must take pains to stop these trends. 3) Tap new revenue sources ceaselessly. The third step finance departments can take to overcome fiscal difficulties and eliminate the deficits is to pay attention to tap new revenue sources in a timely fashion based on the latest progress on the reform and open policy front. In this respect Guangdong has broken much new ground profitably and achieved a lot of gratifying results. Its experience should be disseminated. In 1992 Guangdong sold off 7,010 hectares of land, earning 9.4 billion yuan (including urban infrastructural matching fees), equivalent to 44.8 percent of the provincial government's total revenue for the year. In many prefectures and municipalities, land-derived incomes are approaching or have exceeded what the local jurisdiction collects in revenue and have been dubbed the "second treasury." It is a foregone conclusion that land, a state property, will enter the market extensively as a special commodity as reform and the open policy are furthered steadily and a socialist market economy gradually takes shape and develops. Logically speaking, incomes derived from the auction of land use rights based on land prices should go to the Ministry of Finance, At present, however, the government is losing such incomes on a substantial scale as they end up in the hands of some collectives, groups, or individuals. Land transactions are highly profitable, which explains why land speculation has become such a major problem today, with a handful of people reaping a windfall at the expense of the state. In conjunction with other interested national agencies, finance departments should immediately work out laws and regulations to lay down clearly the taxes payable by people involved in land transactions as well as their legitimate profits. They should waste no time in conducting a comprehensive and thorough audit and firmly recover all illegal profits to benefit the national coffers. Moreover, finance departments at all levels should be required to devote manpower to study and identify new revenue sources without cessation. The real estate market, stock exchanges, high-tech market, and other markets are all new revenue sources that must not be overlooked. Tapping these new sources will go a long way toward easing our fiscal plight. 4) Strictly limit and gradually reduce miscellaneous government subsidies. Miscellaneous subsidies cost the Ministry of Finance 570 billion yuan in lost revenue and increased expenditures in the last seven years, averaging over 80 billion yuan a year. For this reason, we must take stock of every kind of government subsidies most carefully. The last thing we should do is to impose a single policy across the board. With the exception of subsidies to offset policy-induced losses, which should be retained, we must require all other operating losses to be turned into surpluses within one to two years, after which subsidies would be cut off. Public finance in China, we must insist, should be production-based public finance, not welfare-oriented public finance. No longer should the treasury continue to spend vast sums of money to salvage from the bottom of the sea of the socialist market economy those enterprises that prefer surviving long-term on state hand-outs to struggling on their own to turn business losses into profits. To do so would violate the law of the market--survival of the fittest--and be counter-productive. Turning to price subsidies, price subsidies for agricultural capital goods and protective procurement price subsidies for agricultural products should be retained. As the government moves to decontrol prices gradually, other price subsidies, such as those for articles of daily use, should be abolished. Instead, the treasury should offer subsidies only to those households below a predetermined income level. Under the current system, everybody, from 10,000-yuan households to 100-yuan households, collects subsidies. That practice should be brought to an end. If only government subsidies are cut 10 percent a year, the treasury would be able to trim spending or increase revenue by 8 billion yuan. This is something that must be taken seriously. 5) Strictly rein in all sorts of nonproduction expenditures and tighten budgetary discipline. Besides revenue-enhancing efforts, an extremely vital step to eliminate fiscal difficulties is to strictly rein in all sorts of nonproduction expenditures. In 1991 China spent 34.78 billion yuan in administrative costs, a 610 percent increase over 1978. It has been calculated that by halving the public payroll, the central government can save about 60 billion yuan a year. Purchases by social groups nationwide reached 41.38 billion yuan in the first half of 1991, a gain of 17.9 percent over the corresponding period a year ago. The health care bill footed by the treasury in 1990 exceeded 10 billion yuan. When it comes to these and similar massive nonproduction expenses, we must stiffen budgetary discipline and strictly prohibit over-spending. Finance departments at all levels must stick to the spending level in the budget, firmly refusing to pay any overspent amount. Furthermore, the squandering of state funds on any pretext must be proscribed by formal decree. There is a new, unhealthy trend in the special economic zones, Hong Kong and Macao: using public funds to throw "10,000-yuan banquets" and pay for "1,000-yuan simple meals" just to show off one's wealth. Another fad rapidly gaining popularity is to make study trips abroad at public expense, gobbling up wealth the workers create through hard labor. A one-month study mission to the United States costs the government over 70,000 yuan per person. These days even perennially under-funded elementary and secondary schools have been lining up to send study missions overseas bearing all sorts of names. These trends should be checked without delay. By tightening budgetary discipline, we can avoid over-spending. 6) Make the most of and strengthen auditing and supervision. As reform and the open policy quicken their pace, some units and individuals have resorted to a variety of illegal ploys to participate in economic activities and misappropriate government properties and funds, thus siphoning off public assets into private hands and making a fortune at public expense. This is particularly true of the upstarts who reaped a windfall from the third round of industrialization. Now they lead a life of decadent luxury every day, spending money like water. It is imperative, therefore, that we scrutinize our financial and economic law and discipline and conduct an audit on the assets of every upstart. Illicit incomes should be recovered and the economic climate must be purified. We must create a normal economic order consistent with a socialist market economy, protect state properties, and encourage people to get rich legally. In short, China was plagued by fiscal problems and ran a budget deficit year after year in the seven years between 1986 and 1992, the outcome of a broad decline in profitability and a deficit economic policy. The only way to end this plight and push ahead with the development of a socialist market economy is to look back in earnest and work out practical and feasible strategies.
