SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Working Group on Intellectual Property Rights, chaired by Assistant Secretary of Commerce and Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks Bruce A. Lehman, was established as part of the White House Information Infrastructure Task Force. The Task Force, chaired by Secretary of Commerce Ronald H. Brown, was created to work with Congress and the private sector to develop comprehensive telecommunications and information policies aimed at articulating and implementing the Administration's vision for the National Information Infrastructure (NII). The Working Group on Intellectual Property Rights issued ``Intellectual Property and the National Information Infrastructure: A Preliminary Draft of the Report of the Working Group on Intellectual Property Rights'' in July of 1994. The Preliminary Draft represented the Working Group's examination and analysis to date of the intellectual property implications of the NII, and included the Group's draft findings and recommendations. In the Preliminary Draft, the Working Group expressed concerns about the applicability of the library, educational use, and fair use exemptions of the Copyright Act, as well as the voluntary guidelines, for libraries and schools in the NII environment. The Working Group suggested that at least the guidelines for library and educational use of printed matter and music that were voluntarily adopted by diverse parties and set out in the House and Conference Reports accompanying the Copyright Act require modification or elaboration to deal with digital works and on-line services. The Conference on Fair Use was established to facilitate that process. Dated: October 12, 1994. Bruce A. Lehman, Assistant Secretary of Commerce and Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks.
