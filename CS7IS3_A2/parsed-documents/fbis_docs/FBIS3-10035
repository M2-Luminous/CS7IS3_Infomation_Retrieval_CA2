Savall] [Text] Havana, 25 Feb (PL) -- Leaders of the American Physicians Association (APHA) have endorsed the role of doctors in alternative diplomacy against the U.S. blockade against Cuba. Dr. Helen Rodriguez Trias, president of this association founded 122 years ago, said the blockade enforced by U.S. administrations since the beginning of the 1960's is a dirty and inhumane practice. Rodriguez Trias led an APHA delegation that attended a bilateral workshop on health exchanges with another group of doctors and psychologists who came to Cuba at the invitation of the Center of International Policy. The meeting covered the subjects of public health in both countries in terms of their current situations and outlook, the consequences of the blockade on Cuban medical and sanitary conditions, and the program to reform public health services presented by President William Clinton. After learning in detail the effects of the blockade on the Cuban economy and its negative repercussions on the lives of the people, particularly on the lives of children and the elderly, the APHA delegation voiced a consensus in its determination to increase the campaign against this measure. Rodriguez, of Cuban origin, voiced her pleasure with this visit to the island after so many years of absence. Rodriguez said: It has been a moving experience, and foremost it has reinforced my wishes to continue working to eliminate what the U.S. authorities call an embargo against Cuba. When mentioning that the rest of the delegation has the same commitment, she added that APHA -- which she described as an institution that has always maintained a progressive line in its professional and social work -- will organize other contacts with Cuban colleagues in the future. Meanwhile, the participation of Wayne Smith and Cuban Foreign Ministry officials in the workshop gave a touch of alternative diplomacy to the meeting. Smith was the chief of the U.S. Interests Section in Havana during the Jimmy Carter administration. Dr. Abelardo Ramirez, Cuban vice minister of public health, said we are mutually learning about the social problems of both nations, particularly in the field of health. This field represents a common ground among nations and a means for personal and collective relations inasmuch as the wellbeing of humanity favors the development of all people, he pointed out. Ramirez feels that the presence of these delegations constitutes a stimulus for the professionals and workers in Cuban public health services who are determined to maintain the achievements reached in medical assistance despite the difficult times of the national economy. This is an example for other sectors of U.S. society, he added, and on our part we are committed to improve these meetings which could cover many more topics. To this effect, Smith said other visits by professionals to Cuba will continue to be organized by the Center of International Policy.
