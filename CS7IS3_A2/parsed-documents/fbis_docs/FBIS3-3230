He said to reporter (Lian Jun): [Begin recording] The Hui nationality has a population of 1.6 million in Ningxia, which is China's region where the Hui nationality lives in most compact communities. Due to various historical and geological reasons, the major areas where the Hui nationlity lives in compact communities have two characteristics: First, they are comparatively backward in general education and economically underdeveloped. At present, many people still live in poverty. Second, religions exert a comparatively great influence here. Contradictions between different religious sects and within a religious sect itself have occurred from time to time. Therefore, we have attached great importance to the nationalities and religious issues for a long time; we have conscientiously implemented the party's policies on nationalities and religion, as well as the law on autonomy in regions inhabited by minority nationalities; we have vigorously selected and promoted various trained personnel of minority nationalities; and we have enabled them to play an important role at their respective posts. Practice has made us realize that unity among nationalities and among different religions in areas inhabited by minority nationalities is very important. It has a direct bearing on social stability and on economic development. We must always pay attention to properly handling the relationships among unity, stability, and devleopment. [end recording] [Second Announcer] (Wan Ling), it seems that facing the facts, admitting the gap, strengthening unity, and deepening reform to turn the strong points in natural resources to economic strong points have become a consensus on reform reached by all the deputies from the regions inhabited by minority nationalities. [First Announcer] You are right. We believe China's vast expanse of regions inhabited by minority nationalities will have a brighter future and will surely usher in an era of economic achievements through the joint efforts by the people of all nationalities in the regions inhabited by minority nationalities.
