In a communique, the UDPS criticized the "cynical" support by French leaders, from both left and right, to former President Habyarimana's "criminal policies," and stressed that it is advisable "to point out the highly negative role played by Mobutu, the accomplice of French imperialism, in the name of a badly understood and poorly assimilated so-called francophone movement." The statement continued: "The UDPS stigmatizes the hypocrisy of both France and Mobutu, who are indecently trying to cover up their crimes by organizing a meeting in Nairobi on 6 June (...)." Finally, the UDPS "condemns in the strongest terms the presence of Mr. Mobutu and France at this ill-timed meeting in Nairobi, and called on its fighters in Kenya and on all justice, democracy, and peace-loving persons to prevent, by all means, the holding of this parody, which is a disgrace to Africa." Newspapers close to the radical opposition also took up these attacks against France, criticizing France's African policy in general and accusing it of continuing to "support dictators."
