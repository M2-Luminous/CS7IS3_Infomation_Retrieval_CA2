The Antonov KB, as is well known, is the leading scientific-production base in Ukraine engaged in projects in the sphere of aircraft construction. The AN-124 Ruslan and An-225 Mriya aircraft are well known around the world today. But economic difficulties have not bypassed the "Antonovites" either. There are not enough funds, and the disruption of economic ties is having a negative effect. The task for the future, however, remains the same for the Antonov KB: Work for the benefit of Ukraine, and for the benefit of its armed forces. The discussion concerned just that, among other things, during a meeting of Minister of Defense General of the Army of Ukraine Vitaliy Radetskyy with Antonov KB General Director Petro Balabuyev. An account will appear in an upcoming issue.
