FR940504-2-00030 FR940504-2-00028 [Docket No. TM90&hyph;3&hyph;42&hyph;008] Transwestern Pipeline Co.; Proposed Changes in FERC Gas Tariff April 28, 1994. Take notice that on April 25, 1994, Transwestern Pipeline Company (Transwestern) tendered for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, Second Revised Volume No. 1, the following tariff sheet, with a proposed effective date of April 25, 1994: 3rd Revised Sheet No. 5M On August 6, 1994, the Commission issued its Order on Rehearing and Terminating Technical Conference, in the above-referenced proceedings, directing Transwestern within thirty days to file revised tariff sheets to reflect the removal of: (1) $4,200,000 of producer pricing settlement amounts, (2) $2,219,314 of prior period adjustments, and (3) $510,146 from Transwestern's direct bill to its former sales customers, and to refund with interest all the costs excluded from its Account No. 191 direct bill filings (August 6 order). In the August 6 order, the Commission specifically provided that Transwestern would be permitted to propose ``a prospective charge to recover these costs from its current open access transportation customers.'' Transwestern requested rehearing of the August 6 order and, in addition, filed motions requesting additional time with which to comply with the requirements of the August 6 order, which extensions were granted by the Commission. On March 25, 1994, the Commission issued its ``Order Denying Rehearing,'' directing Transwestern to comply with the requirements of the August 6 order and reiterated that Transwestern could file to recover the disallowed costs through a mechanism that does not constitute a surcharge to its ``former sales customers based upon their past sales contract demand'' (``March 25 order''). Accordingly and without waiving its rights to file an alternate rate mechanism to recover the disallowed costs, Transwestern is filing a revised tariff sheet in compliance with the August 6 and March 25 orders. The only changes Transwestern is proposing in Sheet No. 5M are to adjust the direct bill amounts in accordance with such orders and to explain in footnote one that section 24, ``Gas Supply Inventory Charge'', has been canceled. Transwestern requested any waiver of any Commission Regulation and its tariff provisions as may be required to allow the tariff sheet referenced above to become effective on April 25, 1994. Transwestern states that copies of the filing were served on its gas utility customers, interested state commissions, and all parties to this proceeding. Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rule 211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure. All such protests should be filed on or before May 5, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
