Momcilo Krajisnik, with reference to the latest one-month ceasefire signed in Geneva, has stated that the Muslims will not agree to any peace irrespective of its limited length. Krajisnik said this in an interview to be published in Monday's DNEVNIK daily of Novi Sad. He added that perhaps it was better that a short-range truce was signed in Geneva. "Had they accepted the Serb proposal on a year-long cessation of hostilities," said he, "they would have presented themselves to the world as the fighters for peace, but, essentially, they do not give up their offensive actions against Serb territories." Geneva talks on the overall cessation of hostilities in Bosnia ended on June 7 in signinig a statement on a one-month cessation of combat activities, based on the Muslim-Croat proposal. In commenting on a territorial division map drawn by the "contact group" in Geneva, Krajisnik said that this had concerned the fulfilment of the megalomaniac demands by Croats and Muslims to be given nearly the entire western Bosnia and good parts of northern and eastern Bosnia. "Of course, it is out of the question that we shall agree to give the places where genocide of Serb people was committed in the past two wars," said Krajisnik.
