Raidi, chairman of the Tibetan People's Congress, the parliament of the Chinese-governed Tibetan Autonomous Region, warned that militant Tibetan separatists would be defeated and dismissed reports that scores of political prisoners were behind bars. According to human rights groups, several anti-Chinese demonstrations erupted last year in Lhasa, the Tibetan capital, and were brutally repressed by the Chinese authorities, who carried out hundreds of arrests. Raidi, who is also vice secretary of the region's communist party, told a press conference here that "recently some separatists have been engaged in a lot of activities sabotaging the unity of the motherland." "Any attempt to undermine the national unity is doomed to fail," he said. The press conference was called by members of the Tibetan region's delegation to the annual session of the National People's Congress (NPC), China's rubber-stamp parliament. Raidi also said that most of the 106 Tibetans, jailed for religious or political beliefs, who featured on a list submitted to China by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, had already been freed. "I am not sure of the exact number, but there are no more than eight or 10 still in jail," Raidi said. The Tibetan authorities had "already received several similar lists", adding that "certain people" on them "did not even exist", he said. "I do not know how they (western and international organizations) compiled these lists." As in the past, Raidi reiterated an offer for Tibet's exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, to return home, but "as long as he renounces Tibetan independence." "The Dalai Lama is engaged in activities aimed at splitting China," he said. The Dalai Lama, who heads a government-in-exile in India that has not been recognised by any country, accuses China of killing more than one million Tibetans, arresting and torturing thousands of his compatriots and threatening Tibetan identity by settling Chinese in the region, overrun by Chinese troops in 1949. The delegation brushed aside the suggestion that China had embarked on "massive migration" to Tibet. Lhasa Mayor Luo Sang Dun Zhu said the capital had a population of 400,000, of whom 87.21 percent were Tibetan and 11.95 percent ethnic Chinese, although there was a "floating population" of officials and traders that could reach 200,000. Tibet's economy is showing annual improvement, the delegation said, adding that a growth target had been set of eight percent per annum over the next few years. The officials added that Beijing was trying to scale back its military presence in Tibet, thanks to improving relations with its "neighbours," a reference to India. They they offered no details. A hundred members of parliament from some 30 countries are set to gather in New Delhi on Friday for a three-day conference to debate China's human rights record in Tibet and its militarisation of the region. Dalai Lama recently warned in a statement, issued on the 35th anniversary of a failed Tibetan uprising against Chinese rule, that Tibetans were disappointed with his failure to demand complete freedom for his homeland. International interest in Tibet has risen in recent years, and respect for human rights there has been named by the United States as a factor in whether to renew China's most-favoured-nation (MFN) status.
