The three-year loan program is to be implemented from fiscal 1996 starting in April 1996. Under a Chinese plan, a Japanese Shinkansen-type high-speed railway will be built by the year 2000 between Beijing and Shanghai at a cost of 1 trillion yen, the sources said. Trains running at maximum speed of 250 kilometers per hour on the 1,200-kilometer railway are expected to cut traveling time between the two cities to six hours, one-third the present time. The Japanese Government is expected to select Chinese projects for application of the loans before Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa visits China, probably in mid-March, the sources said. Under its third package of yen loans to China between fiscal 1990 and 1995, Japan is providing 810 billion yen to finance 42 projects.
