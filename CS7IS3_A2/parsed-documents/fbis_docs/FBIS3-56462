He believes, however, that "one private move does not determine everything." Besides Gaydar and Ella Pamfilova, the government must be quit by vice premiers Anatoly Chubays and Boris Fedorov, because "they are responsible for the country's ruin." Zhebrovsky is convinced that resignation under such a far- fetched pretext as disagreement with the decision to allocate $500 Mn to the construction of a parliamentary center and to unite the Russian and Belarusian monetary systems" attests to the bankruptcy of the current policy. He thinks that for the Russian economy $500 Mn is not the sum that determines success or failure of a government program.
