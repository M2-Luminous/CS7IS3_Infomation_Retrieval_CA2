It examined the situation in the Republic of Crimea and adopted an appeal to the Supreme Council and president of the Crimean Republic, as well as the board's appeal to the interior bodies' personnel. It says, in particular, that a dangerous precedent was set for ignoring the laws of the Ukrainian state, which is having a negative effect on the functioning of interior bodies in Crimea and, first of all, the state of law and order. An explosive situation is being provoked and mounted, suspicion and mistrust for the Ukrainian authorities is being planted. The board of Ukraine's Internal Affairs Ministry is placing all responsibility for the current developments in Crimea and the possible unforseen consequences on Mr. Valeriy Kuznetsov, appointed to the abolished post of the Crimean internal affairs minister, and the forces that had created conditions for this. Appealing to the Supreme Council and president of the Republic of Crimea, the board of Ukraine's Internal Affairs Ministry is counting on them to exercise foresight, wisdom, and consideration in their decisions concerning issues that relate to the functioning of such an important armed formation as interior bodies. The appeal also contains an expression of confidence that the Crimean leadership will revise their earlier decisions.
