Willem van Eekelen, the former Netherlands defense minister and general secretary of the WEU [Western European Union], which in Maastricht found the fertile ground allowing it to liberate itself from an uncertain political and military arrangement to grow into the "armed wing" of Europe, is exultant about the outcome of a summit that, for the most part, had already been predicted. [Malsano] Why a success? [van Eekelen] Great progress was made in three areas: the adoption by NATO of greater flexibility in its internal structures; giving the WEU permission to use the structure of the Atlantic alliance; and the Partnership for Peace aimed at benefiting the countries of Central and East Europe. The first and second points are interrelated and have a precise significance: The summit will open the road to the creation of multinational interarmy groups. This means putting at our disposal (the Western European Union comprises the Twelve except for Ireland and Denmark, whereas Greece has to finalize its parliamentary ratification in order to gain full membership -- IL GIORNALE editor's note) the NATO headquarters for these operations which are the responsibility of Europe alone. [Malsano] So this is the theory of the "two caps," which says that the NATO structures could, from time to time, be put at the WEU's service. [van Eekelen] Exactly. This is the hypothesis on which I have worked for years, and which will put NATO in charge of collective defense and us in charge of undertaking our missions. However, the aspect that must be emphasized is the political rather than military. This summit will lead to a full and unconditional "yes" by the Americans regarding the existence of the WEU, a "yes" that had never been clearly stated in the past. In the second place, the United States acknowledges that there could be scenarios in which ground forces would not participate, as is the case in Bosnia now. This facilitates cooperation, and makes everyone more flexible -- including NATO, which in the event of noninvolvement by the United States in military operations, could offer its bases to the WEU, which, in turn, would not have to worry about creating new logistical structures but could use already existing ones. Lastly, it lets everyone save some money. It is truly a fundamental step in the transformation of the Atlantic alliance. [Malsano] Does it not seem to you to be the gradual withdrawal of the U.S. commitment from the European stage? [van Eekelen] There is a mutation under way in the geopolitical scene. The United States is primarily interested in Russia and there is nothing wrong with that. We Europeans, of course, cannot deal with Moscow alone; we need NATO for that. [Malsano] Does the go-ahead which the summit will give to the creation of multinational interarmy groups put an end to the plan to develop Eurocorps (French, German, Spanish, and Belgian troops which are already organized in a common structure -- IL GIORNALE editor's note)? [van Eekelen] Eurocorps is at NATO's disposal for collective defense and at WEU's disposal for our missions. It is not the seed of the future European Army, but just one of the elements in the WEU, as are the multinational interarmy groups. In this connection, it must be said that the summit will only give the general consensus, the political approval. Subsequently, we must define the technical aspects, and the methods that will enable the WEU to have access to the alliance's logistical structures. [Malsano] One of the reasons that you predicted for the summit's success was the Partnership for Peace -- the cooperation and collaboration agreement that will bring the countries of Central and East Europe closer to NATO. In reality, the expectations of the Poles, Hungarians, Czechs, and Slovaks were disregarded to a great extent. Do you too think that it was not possible to concede more? [van Eekelen] Of course, the countries of Central and East Europe will be disappointed, but the leaders of the alliance adopted a realistic approach. The Western world cannot say, as has happened for quite some time, that Russia is no longer a threat and therefore give guarantees to the other countries vis-a-vis Moscow. I believe that this is a fair decision: It does not create new borders in Europe and it develops the military cooperation that will be extremely useful in view of future membership. The West made a mistake in letting too many expectations arise. Moreover, the most important problem in Central and East Europe is economic, not military. These countries must be allowed to grow progressively closer to the European Union, to become members of it, and then to be able to join the WEU and perhaps NATO too. In today's global context, one cannot think solely in terms of defense and security, there must also be political convergence in accordance with the logic of European integration. In this kind of scenario, Russia would perhaps no longer have any reason to object. On the contrary, the mere fact of any former members of the Warsaw Pact joining NATO, which was and still is an instrument of the Cold War in people's minds, would be viewed by Moscow as a hostile act. [Malsano] What you are presenting is an indefinite slide. Can the countries of Central and East Europe afford to wait for a long time? [van Eekelen] They will need six, maybe eight years, but these countries must be given the prospect of European integration. This is a multistage path that leads to a gradual rapprochement and builds the foundation for a future that is somewhat more solid than what could be offered by mere guarantees of security.
