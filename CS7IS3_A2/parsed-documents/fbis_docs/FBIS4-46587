It Is Up to the Duma To Decide"] [Text] At a closed session on 2 June the Federation Council adopted, as a basis by an overwhelming majority of votes, the Decree: "On the Course of Forming the 1994 Federal Budget." It was recommended to the State Duma that defense expenditures be increased up to R55 trillion, of which R12 trillion is for arms procurement, up to R5.5 trillion for RDT&E, and up to R8 trillion for capital construction. It was recommended that expenditures for upkeep of the Armed Forces be reduced from R28 to 25.8 trillion. Thus, the Federation Council proposed to the State Duma that the defense budget be increased by R18 trillion. Commenting on this decision at the request of a KRASNAYA ZVEZDA correspondent, Petr Shirshov, chairman of the Federation Council Security and Defense Committee, directed attention to the fact that 55 trillion is that subsistence minimum which permits keeping the Army and military-industrial complex from collapse. As a comparison, 55 trillion do not make up even a third of the defense item of the 1994 U.S. budget. Against the background of these calculations, some politicians' assertions about excessive appetites of the Army and military-industrial complex sound unconvincing. Meanwhile, even with 55 trillion there will be no fat, as is customarily said in such cases. The decree is viewed rather critically by certain heads of administrations. In a talk with journalists about expenditures for military capital construction, Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast Governor Boris Nemtsov came out in favor of creating personal accounts that are closed for consumption expenditures, with funds for individual construction transferred to them. According to his estimates, 400,000 officers would be able to build themselves "decent houses" for R8 trillion. Common sense must win out in the argument about R18 trillion, and I will give the reminder that it was proposed to reduce initial appropriations for defense by that much. The Federation Council is recommending that the State Duma not increase, but restore the amount of the "subsistence minimum" for the Army that was proposed in drawing up the budget message. Of course, there can be divergences of views, but a place also must be found for compromises. Judging from the familiar statements of its chairman, Vladimir Shumeyko, and the reaction of deputies to the decision to cut off the defense item of the federal budget, the Federation Council will stand its ground firmly. It is important in itself that the Federation Council position is clear to the State Duma on the eve of the second reading of the 1994 draft federal budget. In a situation where President Boris Yeltsin, Government Chairman Viktor Chernomyrdin and the Federation Council unequivocally came out in favor of a defense budget of R55 trillion, the State Duma also finally has to settle on its choice. Probably now Duma deputies should take into account that they assume a special responsibility for possible consequences of their decision. In the final account it is not a question of the Army's interests, but of the interests of the state, of Russia.
