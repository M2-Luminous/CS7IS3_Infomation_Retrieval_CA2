We have heard the latest reports that fierce battles are waging about 20 kilometers from Aden and that the northerners have confirmed that they have taken control of al-Waht, so that Aden is now within range of their artillery. What information do you have? [Jazulit] First of all, as you might have heard, there is a batch of tanks leaving their base in the direction of the al-'Anad area. As for the information you have, I cannot confirm it either way. All we know is that fierce battles are continuing on all the fronts, with the exception of the Abyan axis. If it is true that this area has fallen, we will visit it tomorrow to confirm it. ['Awn] Some Yemeni officials have been touring the Gulf states. The most recent has been by Mr. Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas to Qatar. Is Aden expecting recognition from the Gulf? [Jazulit] First of all, I wish to tell you that Engineer Haydar al-'Attas arrived at Aden airport this evening at around 2130 Aden time. He was accompanied by 'Abd-al-Qawi al-Makkawi, who is considered a member of the Presidential Council in the new state here in Aden. He was received by the vice president and a group of Yemeni Socialist Party members. Upon his arrival, I spoke to him. He confirmed two facts: First, that the Arab Gulf states understand very well the crisis Yemen is going through. He also affirmed that he is expecting recognition of their new state soon by the Arabian Gulf states. ['Awn] As you know Tawfiq, the members of the Security Council are holding consultations tonight to stop the fighting in Yemen and find a formula for a solution. What does Aden expect the international community to do for it? [Jazulit] I think that Aden believes international interests, and Western ones in particular, will soon be in danger since the war has now developed into a war of attrition. Proceeding from this perspective, I know that Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dali, who was accompanying the southern Yemeni prime minister during his tour of the Arabian Gulf states, did not return to Aden but left directly from Qatar for New York to participate in developments in the United Nations' corridors. The new prime minister here in Aden told me that they are very optimistic that a resolution will be issued stipulating the need to stop all fighting in Yemen. ['Awn] Tawfiq, thank you. We will stay in touch with for further details. [Jazulit] Thank you.
