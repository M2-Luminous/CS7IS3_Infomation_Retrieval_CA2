FR941110-2-00065 FR941110-2-00029 September 22, 1994. Assistant Secretary, Conservation & Renewable Energy, U.S. Department of Energy, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585 Subject: Petition for Waiver and Application for Interim Waiver. Gentlemen: This is a Petition for Waiver and Application for Interim Waiver submitted pursuant to Title 10 CFR 430.27, as amended 14 November 1986. Waiver is requested from the test procedures for measuring the Energy Consumption of Furnaces found in Appendix N of Subpart B to Part 430, specifically the section requiring a 1.5 minute delay between burner ignition and start-up of the circulating air blower. York International requests a waiver from the specified 1.5 minute delay, and seeks authorization in its furnace efficiency test procedures and calculations to utilize a fixed timing control that will energize the circulating air blower 30 seconds after the gas valve opens. A control of this type with a fixed 30 second blower on-time will be utilized in our P2LN and PBNL lines of condensing furnaces. The current test procedure does not credit York for additional energy savings that occur when a shorter blower on-time is utilized. Test data for these furnaces with a 30 second delay indicate that the overall furnace AFUE will increase approximately 1.5 percentage points compared to the same furnace when tested with the 1.5 minute delay. Copies of the confidential test data conforming these energy savings will be forwarded to you upon request. York International is confident that this waiver will be granted, as similar waivers have been granted in the past to Coleman Company, Magic Chef Company, Rheem Manufacturing, the Trane Company, Carrier Corporation, Lennox Industries, Amana Refrigeration, Goodman Manufacturing Company and others. Manufacturers that domestically market similar products are being sent a copy of this Petition for Waiver and Application for Interim Waiver. ␣␣Sincerely, Michael B. Eberlein, P.E., Engineering Manager_Furnace Products, Unitary Products Group, York ® Central Environmental Systems, York International. Mr. Michael B. Eberlein, P.E., Engineering Manager_Furnace Products, Unitary Products Group, York International, P.O. Box 4022, Elyria, OH 44036 Dear Mr. Eberlein: This is in response to your September 22, 1994, Application for Interim Waiver and Petition for Waiver from the Department of Energy (DOE) test procedure regarding blower time delay for York International (York) P2LN, and PBNL lines of condensing furnaces. Previous waivers for this type of timed blower delay control have been granted by DOE to Coleman Company, 50 FR 2710, January 18, 1985; Magic Chef Company, 50 FR 41553, October 11, 1985; Rheem Manufacturing Company, 53 FR 48574, December 1, 1988, 56 FR 2920, January 25, 1991, 57 FR 10166, March 24, 1992, 57 FR 34560, August 5, 1992, and 59 FR 30577, June 14, 1994; Trane Company, 54 FR 19226, May 4, 1989, 56 FR 6021, February 14, 1991, 57 FR 10167, March 24, 1992, 57 FR 22222, May 27, 1992, and 58 FR 68138, December 23, 1993; Lennox Industries, 55 FR 50224, December 5, 1990, 57 FR 49700, November 3, 1992, 58 FR 68136, December 23, 1993, and 58 FR 68137, December 23, 1993; Inter-City Products Corporation, 55 FR 51487, December 14, 1990, and 56 FR 63945, December 6, 1991; DMO Industries, 56 FR 4622, February 5, 1991, and 59 FR 30579, June 14, 1994; Heil-Quaker Corporation, 56 FR 6019, February 14, 1991; Carrier Corporation, 56 FR 6018, February 14, 1991, 57 FR 38830, August 27, 1992, 58 FR 68131, December 23, 1993, 58 FR 68133, December 23, 1993 and 59 FR 14394, March 28, 1994; Amana Refrigeration Inc., 56 FR 27958, June 18, 1991, 56 FR 63940, December 6, 1991, 57 FR 23392, June 3, 1992, and 58 FR 68130, December 23, 1993; Snyder General Corporation, 56 FR 54960, September 9, 1991; Goodman Manufacturing Corporation, 56 FR 51713, October 15, 1991, 57 FR 27970, June 23, 1992 and 59 FR 12586, March 17, 1994; The Ducane Company Inc., 56 FR 63943, December 6, 1991, 57 FR 10163, March 24, 1992, and 58 FR 68134, December 23, 1993; Armstrong Air Conditioning, Inc., 57 FR 899, January 9, 1992, 57 FR 10160, March 24, 1992, 57 FR 10161, March 24, 1992, 57 FR 39193, August 28, 1992, 57 FR 54230, November 17, 1992, and 59 FR 30575, June 14, 1994; Thermo Products, Inc., 57 FR 903, January 9, 1992; Consolidated Industries Corporation, 57 FR 22220, May 27, 1992; Evcon Industries, Inc., 57 FR 47847, October 20, 1992, and 59 FR 46968, September 13, 1994; Bard Manufacturing Company, 57 FR 53733, November 12, 1992, and 59 FR 30578, June 14, 1994; and York International Corporation, 59 FR 46969, September 13, 1994. Thus, it appears likely that the Petition for Waiver will be granted for blower time delay. York's Application for Interim Waiver does not provide sufficient information to evaluate what, if any, economic impact or competitive disadvantage York will likely experience absent a favorable determination on its application. However, in those instances where the likely success of the Petition for Waiver has been demonstrated, based upon DOE having granted a waiver for a similar product design, it is in the public interest to have similar products tested and rated for energy consumption on a comparable basis. Therefore, York's Application for an Interim Waiver from the DOE test procedure for its P2LN, and PBNL lines of condensing furnaces regarding blower time delay is granted. York shall be permitted to test its P2LN, and PBNL lines of condensing furnaces on the basis of the test procedures specified in 10 CFR Part 430, Subpart B, Appendix N, with the modification set forth below: (i) Section 3.0 in Appendix N is deleted and replaced with the following paragraph: 3.0 Test Procedure. Testing and measurements shall be as specified in Section 9 in ANSI/ASHRAE 103&hyph;82 with the exception of Sections 9.2.2, 9.3.1, and 9.3.2, and the inclusion of the following additional procedures: (ii) Add a new paragraph 3.10 in Appendix N as follows: 3.10 Gas- and Oil-Fueled Central Furnaces. After equilibrium conditions are achieved following the cool-down test and the required measurements performed, turn on the furnace and measure the flue gas temperature, using the thermocouple grid described above, at 0.5 and 2.5 minutes after the main burner(s) comes on. After the burner start-up, delay the blower start-up by 1.5 minutes (t^) unless: (1) the furnace employs a single motor to drive the power burner and the indoor air circulation blower, in which case the burner and blower shall be started together; or (2) the furnace is designed to operate using an unvarying delay time that is other than 1.5 minutes, in which case the fan control shall be permitted to start the blower; or (3) the delay time results in the activation of a temperature safety device which shuts off the burner, in which case the fan control shall be permitted to start the blower. In the latter case, if the fan control is adjustable, set it to start the blower at the highest temperature. If the fan control is permitted to start the blower, measure time delay (t^) using a stop watch. Record the measured temperatures. During the heat-up test for oil-fueled furnaces, maintain the draft in the flue pipe within # 0.01 inch of water column of the manufacturer's recommended on-period draft. This Interim Waiver is based upon the presumed validity of statements and all allegations submitted by the company. This Interim Waiver may be removed or modified at any time upon a determination that the factual basis underlying the application is incorrect. The Interim Waiver shall remain in effect for a period of 180 days or until DOE acts on the Petition for Waiver, whichever is sooner, and may be extended for an additional 180-day period, if necessary. ␣␣Sincerely, Christine A. Ervin, Assistant Secretary, Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;27782; Filed 11&hyph;9&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6450&hyph;01&hyph;P
