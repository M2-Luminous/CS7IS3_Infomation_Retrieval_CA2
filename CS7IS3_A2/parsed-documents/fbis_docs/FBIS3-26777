Li Peng will inspect the Daya Bay Development Zone inside Huizhou City and inquire about the suspended project of Xiongmao [Panda] Car City. The sources yesterday said that during his stay in Shenzhen, Li Peng inspected many places including the Guangzhou-Shenzhen Express Highway which has been opened to traffic and the Huanggang Border Pass. Yesterday morning, Huizhou Mayor Li Jinwei and other local officials particularly went to Shenzhen to meet Li Peng and his entourage. Li Peng continued his inspection tour in the company of Xie Fei, secretary of the Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee, Zhu Senlin, governor of the province, and Huizhou Mayor Li Jinwei. The sources said that during his visit to Huizhou, Li Peng will listen to local leaders' work reports and will once again inspect the Daya Bay Development Zone which is under construction. The Daya Bay Development Zone is one of the major construction projects to which the central authorities attach importance. It includes the the infrastructural project of Huizhou Harbor, a large deepwater harbor, and two major industrial projects--Nanhai Petrochemical and Xiongmao Motors. The former is a large-scale joint venture launched by Nanhai Petroleum Corporation with China Merchant's Steamboat Navigation Company and the Shell Oil Company; and the latter is an investment project launched by South Korea's Tongyi [4827 0001] Group. The plants were built but the project was suspended because of a dispute over the proportion of cars to be exported. Some plants were rented to China's No 2 Motors as assembly workshops. Huizhou City and the Daya Bay Development Zone are both key areas for development in Guangdong. Guangdong once announced that: "Development in the 1980's was focused on Shenzhen and development in the 1990's will be focused on Huizhou." Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Yang Shangkun, Wan Li, and Zou Jiahua in turn have previously inspected Huizhou. According to the sources, during his inspection of Huizhou, it is likely that Li Peng will make a final decision on the future of Xiongmao Motors. On the other hand, China's official XINHUA News Agency yesterday, for the first time, revealed Li Peng's recent inspection of Zhuhai by issuing a special feature about Li Peng's visit to Juren [Giant] Enterprise Group, a high-tech enterprise run by unofficial institutions.
