The vice premier fully affirmed the achievements made in the Haicang Investment Zone's development and in the economic work of Xiamen.

The central authorities have urged grasping opportunity, deepening reform, opening wider, promoting development, and maintaining stability [zhuazhu jiyu, shenhua gaige, kuoda kaifang, cujin fazhan, baochi wending 2119 0145 2623 6657, 3234 0553 2395 7245, 2368 1129 7030 2397, 0191 6651 4099 1455, 0202 2170 4489 1353]. This constitutes the overall situation, and leaders at all levels must take it into account and safeguard it. Among those who accompanied Vice Premier Zu Rongji in inspecting Xiamen were He Chunlin, deputy secretary general of the State Council; Chen Jinhua, minister of the State Planning Commission; Wang Zhongyu, minister of the State Commission for Restructuring Economy; Gu Xiulian, minister of chemical industry; Yu Zhen, chairman of the China Light Industry Federation; Dai Xianglong, vice president of the People's Bank of China; Li Yanling, vice minister of finance; and Li Yizhong, vice president of the China National Petrochemical Corporation. Leaders of Fujian Province and relevant departments -- such as Jia Qinglin, secretary of the provincial party committee and concurrently governor, and Wang Jianshuang, member of the standing committee of the provincial party committee and vice governor -- accompanied the vice premier on his inspection tour. During his stay in Xiamen, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji and his party went to Haicang to inspect the investment zone there in a selective way. The vice premier visited Haicang in March and July of 1992. During the current visit, he selectively inspected the projects under construction in the Haicang Investment Zone, such as the Gaoyu power station, the Xianglu polyester fiber textile project, the Xinyang industrial park, Haicang's new urban districts, the Haicang management committee, and the construction of infrastructure in Haicang. He listened to reports submitted by leaders of the management committee. Fully affirming the construction and development of the Haicang Investment Zone, the vice premier said: Compared with 1992, Haicang has undergone very great changes and has roughly met the need for infrastructure, including water and electricity supplies, roads, and telecommunications. Haicang already has had the conditions for large-scale construction and development. Vice Premier Zhu Rongji and his party also listened to the report submitted by Xiamen Mayor Hong Yongshi on his city's economic development last year, and had a discussion with leaders of relevant provincial and city departments on the question of tax reform. Fully affirming Xiamen's economic work, the vice premier said: I am very pleased that Xiamen's economy has developed rapidly and that the city has achieved very good results in its work. Vice Premier Zhu Rongji pointed out: In 1994, we will continue to implement Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, as well as the spirit of the 14th CPC Congress and the Third Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. Located along the coast, Fujian Province and Xiamen have the conditions for somewhat more rapid development. However, the rapid development we are discussing here means rapid development with efficiency. We must seek rapid development in line with the spirit of General Secretary Jiang Zemin's speeches. The vice premier also stressed: In considering problems, we must emancipate our minds and seek truth from facts. With encouragement, he said: The Xiamen Special Economic Zone has enormous strong points and a foundation for construction. Moreover, it is "small, but effective, and so has boundless prospects." According to an analysis, in the days to come, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji will show more substantial concern for Haicang's further development and construction.
