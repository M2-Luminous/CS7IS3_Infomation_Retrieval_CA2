Who is that mysterious vagrant, a carrier of the virus? Have they found the sources of the infection? We were able to get in touch with Ludmilla Alekseyeva, one of the chief specialists at Moscow's Sanitary-Epidemiological Station. ``The vagrant came here by chance,'' said Ludmilla Alekseyeva. ``He has been in Moscow since 1989 and has no documents. Where he lived is unknown. He spent 12 years in prison, and all his clothes were pinned together. A Moscow chauffeur hired him to guard his car while it was being repaired. The vagrant was ill for a week without going to the hospital. But when he became much worse and began vomiting, the chauffeur called the ambulance.'' At the infectious disease hospital, cholera was suspected immediately. An experienced professor was consulted. The examination confirmed the initial diagnosis. The patient is now in a special department and is recovering. The unfortunate chauffeur is also in the hospital but is, thank God, healthy.
