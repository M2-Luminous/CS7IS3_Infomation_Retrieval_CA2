(Yin Xin,) an editor of this station, wrote a news commentary about the talks: "We Hope the Tang-Chiao Talks Will Yield Positive Results." The following is the commentary, read by Wen Liang: The Tang Shubei-Chiao Jen-ho talks will be held in Beijing 1-4 February. The current talks are the fourth ones between ARATS and SEF following the successful Wang-Ku talks in Singapore in April last year. The current talks are being held to discuss the full implementation of the agreements signed at the Wang-Ku talks. At the previous three rounds of ARATS-SEF talks -- the first was held at the end of August last year in Beijing, the second in early October last year in Xiamen, and the third in mid-December in Taibei -- the two sides discussed issues concerning the repatriation of plane hijackers, civil disputes, repatriation of personnel, and the procedures for the exchange of visits by ARATS and SEF personnel. At these rounds of talks, the two sides also exchanged views on Taiwan investors' rights and interests on the mainland and related problems, as well as on the exchange of visits by businessmen on the two sides of the strait. Some common understanding was reached between the two sides on these issues, laying a foundation for work consultations between the two sides. According to an agreement reached at the Wang-Ku talks, in principle, the executive vice president of ARATS and the vice chairman of SEF, or the secretaries general of the two organizations, will hold talks every six months on the two organizations' work, alternately on one side of the strait or in a third place agreed on by the two sides. On 20 November last year, ARATS invited Chiao Jen-ho, who just took office as vice chairman and secretary general of SEF, to visit Beijing to discuss the two organizations' work. At that meeting, the two sides also decided that the third work meeting between ARATS and SEF would be held in Taibei. The SEF also twice invited Tang Shubei to visit Taiwan. Regrettably, Chiao Jen-ho's invitation for Tang Shubei to visit Taiwan was not carried out reportedly because an agreement was not reached at the Taibei talks. Later, ARATS and SEF formally decided that Tang Shubei and Chiao Jen-ho would meet in Beijing at the end of January this year. However, Taiwan again deliberately created obstacles to the meeting, going so far as to say that China and France signing a joint communique in which France guarantees that it will not sell arms to Taiwan and China's restoring diplomatic relations with Lesotho were unfriendly acts of the mainland toward Taiwan, and declared that it would reassess the Tang-Chiao talks. There was a public outcry in Taiwan over the matter, saying Taiwan's such emotional display put people at a loss and perplexed the public. Under the pressure of Taiwan's public opinion, Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Committee finally decided that the Tang-Chiao talks would be held in Beijing as scheduled. The open contacts and regular meetings to discuss matters of interest between the only novgovernment organs authorized by the governments of the two sides of the strait are a historically important step in the development of cross-strait relations over the past 40 years and more. The great significance and far-reaching effects of the development have made it a major event that people on the two sides of the strait as well as the international community have been concerned about. We should treasure this hard-won result. To create a cooperative atmosphere between the two sides, they should do everything they can to reduce all kinds of disturbances in the process of communicating with each other. Now that Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Committee has agreed to let Chiao Jen-ho go to Beijing to meet Tang Shubei as scheduled, it should endeavor to enable the talks to yield positive results, with the aim to bring about a virtuous cycle of development of the cross-strait relations. There is no need for reticence. Currently some political differences still exist between the two sides of the strait, and these differences canot be ironed out for the time being. But, as long as the two sides work to increase exchanges and contacts and as long as high-level responsible persons of the two sides maintain regular contacts and communications, dismiss their misunderstandings, deepen their mutual understanding, and continue to increase their common understanding, we believe that Chinese people's own affairs will be settled sooner or later.
