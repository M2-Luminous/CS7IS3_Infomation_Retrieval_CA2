The paper, quoting what it said were highly reliable sources, said the warheads were loaded on a special train that was to arrive Wednesday in a city in the Caucasus where the weapons will be transferred to the factory where they were assembled. A spokesman for the ministry of defense here denied the report saying "that no nuclear warheads have left the Ukraine for the moment." SEGODNYA said that the weapons' transfer comes at a time when Russia and the U.S. need to improve relations following tension between the two stemming from a spy scandal involving a former top CIA official who has been charged with spying for Moscow.
