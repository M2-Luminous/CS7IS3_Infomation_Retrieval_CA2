Today not one of the many hundreds of our strategic nuclear missiles located in silos, on mobile systems, and on board submarines is any longer aimed at any target on U.S. or British territory. Nor do the United States and Britain now target their strategic missiles on targets in Russia or on any other former Soviet territory. The abandonment of reciprocal missile targeting confirms that, for all the complexity and ambiguity of the international situation and despite all the conflicts, including armed conflicts, which are poisoning the atmosphere in the world, the threat of nuclear war is receding. It is doing so slowly, getting held up time and again on the intervening borders, but nonetheless increasingly noticeably even to the naked eye. At the same time fear of the possibility of such a threat is also receding. More and more evidence of this is coming to light. KRASNAYA ZVEZDA said not so long ago that the United States had adopted the decision to abandon the "Doomsday" program, which provided for the creation of underground shelters for the purpose of ensuring the continuity of the country's political and military leadership in the event of a nuclear conflict. This program, which, so THE NEW YORK TIMES writes, had recently appeared merely "a pale shadow of the concept approved by President Reagan in 1983," has now been deemed to have lost its urgency. The FRG Government intends to follow suit and take a similar measure. A shelter designed to accommodate top government establishments in the event of a nuclear war had been constructed back in the sixties near Bonn -- between the towns of Ahrweiler and Dernau. It was reckoned that this would enable 3,000 people to survive such a war. Galleries many kilometers long, with working and living premises, storehouses for food and other supplies, and even a cemetery-crematorium, were tunneled at a depth of over 300 meters beneath the slopes of a mountain covered with vineyards. The question of ending further funding (more than 10 million marks annually) to maintain the government shelter and its defenses in working order is now at the decision stage. At the same time supporters of such a measure recall that nuclear shelters are already being sold off in Britain, and approximately 800 of them have already acquired new owners, who use them as wine cellars or mushroom farms. Russia, incidentally, is also starting to take the same path. The majority of Yaroslavl's 200 shelters, constructed in the past to save its residents in the event of war, are now being fitted out as offices, stores, sports halls, production shops, warehouses, and even auditoriums. At the same time the lessees are obliged to maintain the shelters' equipment in working order and to vacate them if an emergency should arise. There is also, of course, far weightier confirmation of the fact that the nuclear threat and also, at the same time, the fear of it are increasingly receding into the past. It is possible to recall that Britain has also recently begun to take measures to reduce nuclear armaments by approximately 25 percent. In particular, the British Ministry of Defence has abandoned plans to fit nuclear warheads to the 50 Tomahawk cruise missiles being purchased from the United States and earmarked for installation on Trafalgar-class attack submarines. As for France, whereas only quite recently it was planned to build six nuclear-powered submarines with nuclear ballistic missiles, Paris has now decided to stop at four. These are just a few examples which show, in fact, that the fear of the possibility of a nuclear missile war being unleashed, which hung over mankind for long years like the Sword of Damocles, is gradually beginning to recede. But it is still too soon to bang the drums -- suffice it to recall the grave misgivings aroused by the situation taking shape on the Korean Peninsula in the nuclear sphere. The threat of the uncontrolled proliferation of nuclear weapons still seems real. No way can this be disregarded.
