The plane dropped between four and six bombs shortly before 9:00 am (0430 GMT), hitting civilian homes, the witnesses said. "I was sitting down playing cards when suddenly there was a huge flash and an explosion," Mohammad Karim told AFP. Karim, an ex-military serviceman, who still had blood on his hands from digging out the dismembered corpse of one victim, said he thought most of the bombs dropped were in the 250-kilogram (550 pounds) range, but possibly there was one 500-kilogram (1,100 pound) monster. In one house locals dug with shovels to rescue a man buried alive, then turned their attention to another house where two children were said to be under the rubble. Hysterical women from the bombed houses cried in the street as neighbours were packed belongings in taxis to flee the scene. [sentence as received] The final casualty toll will not be known until all the wreckage has been cleared from the bombed area. The bombing may have been in retaliation for the loss of two strategic posts in eastern Kabul at the weekend when forces loyal to Afghan President Borhanoddin Rabbani captured Bala Hesar and Maranjan Hill from the coalition alliance of Dostam and Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar. Meanwhile the rival factions in the east of the city continued to trade heavy artillery fire all morning.
