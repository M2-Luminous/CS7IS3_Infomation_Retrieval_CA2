Scharping received more praise, however, for displaying solid diplomatic skills and projecting a statesmanlike personal image during the visit. Press Split on Mission's Success While some commentators thought Scharping made progress in convincing U.S. officials that an SPD-led government would be a reliable ally, others saw any such success as largely cosmetic and detected lingering U.S. concerns. Viola Herms Drath, reporting from Washington for the 15-16 April HANDELSBLATT, was among the more favorable reviewers. Scharping, she maintained, succeeded during his "Washington debut" in "nipping in the bud some prejudices against the Social Democrats as unreliable partners" and reducing his perceived "foreign policy disadvantage" vis-a-vis Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Drath attributed this to the SPD leader's assurances of "continuity" with the main thrust of Kohl's foreign policy and emphasis on parallels between the SPD's domestic program and that of the Clinton Administration. "In Clinton's Washington," Drath concluded, these themes "sound familiar and are well received." Commentator Leo Wieland, writing in the 15 April edition of the FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE, agreed that Scharping apparently won his "campaign for trust" with his U.S. interlocutors, but implied that the sincerity of his promise of continuity remained in doubt at home. If Scharping's intent was "to leave the impression" that a change in government would not noticeably alter Germany's basic foreign policy, Wieland wrote, then "all appearances are that he succeeded -- in America." Other commentators remained unconvinced that Scharping had put U.S. concerns to rest, especially on the issue of German participation in UN-sponsored military operations. Ulrich Deupmann, who reviewed the Scharping visit in the 14 April issue of the SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG, conceded that the U.S. desire for Germany to take a greater part in such operations may have played "only a subliminal role" in Scharping's meetings with U.S. officials, but maintained that "little doubt remains about Washington's fundamental expectations." According to Deupmann, Scharping apparently left the meetings with the "contradictory" impression that increasing Germany's role in UN military missions was relatively low on Washington's list of priorities, in part because "no one openly expressed such desires to him." Kurt Kister, whose commentary appeared in the same newspaper on 15 April, also highlighted the gap between the U.S. position on this issue and Scharping's interpretations of it, ascribing the contrast to both U.S. reluctance to mention the issue and conscious political calculation by Scharping. The administration's decision not to raise the matter with Scharping was understandable, Kister noted, since there was no urgent need to do so, and "no one discusses the fire department as long as nothing is burning." At the same time, the requirements of the German election campaign meant that it was "in Scharping's interest" to avoid any charges of U.S. arm-twisting. Kister pointed out, however, that "even if no one told Scharping in so many words," the United States was growing impatient with Germany's reluctance to increase its involvement in UN military actions, and this friction was imposing a burden on the two countries' relations. Greater Praise for Style By contrast, media opinion was more consistently positive on Scharping's diplomatic abilities and the personal image he projected during the visit. Reviewers lauded the SPD chairman's English-language skills, with descriptions ranging from "fluent, if still capable of improvement" (Carlos Widmann in the 18 April DER SPIEGEL) to "excellent" (Drath in the 15-16 April HANDELSBLATT). Several commentators also pointed out the care that Scharping had taken in laying the groundwork for his trip. Both Martin Winter, writing in the 16 April issue of the FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU, and Dieter Buhl, writing in the 15 April edition of DIE ZEIT, called Scharping's preparatory cultivation of U.S. contacts "systematic" and Drath, in her HANDELSBLATT article, praised the "contacts and knowledge of the American mentality" he had developed during his previous U.S. visits. Scharping's personal style in representing his party and country, however, was the most widely praised aspect of his visit. Drath called him "conspicuous for his level-headedness" and attributed his success in putting U.S. fears to rest to his being a "realistic politician." Buhl, in a more sarcastic vein, noted that Scharping's U.S. hosts were "relieved to find that he was not, in fact, a pacifist, or even anti-American." Even critical commentators, who sometimes suggested that Scharping's moderate style was artificial, conceded that it served its alleged purpose. In his 15 April SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG commentary, for example, Kister conceded that Scharping's "restraint, self-confidence, and sometimes strained friendliness left behind the image of a serious, responsible politician." Similarly, Wieland, in his 15 April FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE review, described Scharping's conduct as "balanced, statesmanlike, nonpartisan" and "consensual," even while asserting that creating this impression "was precisely [his] intention." If there was one repeated criticism of Scharping's conduct, it was, in fact, the notion that it was too often tailored for political purposes. Some commentators remarked, for example, that he too deliberately emphasized parallels between his own political ideas and those of Mr. Clinton, as when Carola Kaps noted in the 14 April FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE that a Scharping speech had "omitted hardly a single catchword" used by the U.S. President. Widmann, in his DER SPIEGEL article, even implied that Scharping's reflective mood after visiting the Holocaust Museum may have been a calculated gesture. Far more typical, however, is Wieland's commentary, in which, after searching for a single adjective to describe Scharping's performance, he finally settled on the word "dignified."
