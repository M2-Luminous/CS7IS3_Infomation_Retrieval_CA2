Arsenis outlined his proposal during an address at an international seminar titled "Armament Limitation and Security in the Middle East," which was held in Athens by the International Relations Institute of Pandion University of Athens and the University of California's Institute of International Conflict and Cooperation. Arsenis said that this arms-control system could be based on the principle of territorial integrity, inviolate borders, the peaceful settlement of disputes, and not using force. Greece, he added, is particularly worried about the issue of nuclear weapons in Central Asia and the Middle East and Turkey's interest in these weapons, given that, since the breakup of the Soviet Union, the possibilities for nuclear proliferation have increased, as have the possibilities for the spread of nuclear technology and know-how to unstable regions.
