The report added that in this trip to Hanoi, puppet Chea Sim will seek approval for a draft immigration law from the Vietnamese communists before presenting it to the two-headed government and puppet National Assembly for endorsement into law. It should be recalled that during his visit to Phnom Penh from 16 to 18 February, Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam instructed the two-headed government and his puppets to draft an immigration law to legalize the presence of nearly four million Vietnamese settlers in Cambodia. The issue of Vietnamese settlers in Cambodia is a national problem linked to the survival of the entire Cambodian nation and people and of every Cambodian and family. Since 1979, Vietnamese settlers kept flowing into Cambodia at will with the permission of the Vietnamese puppet administration to serve as a prop for the hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese aggressor troops. After the signing of the Paris agreement in October 1991, Vietnamese settlers came to Cambodia through UNTAC [UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia] and all the Vietnamese puppet administrative networks maintained by UNTAC. After the UNTAC-organized elections, more Vietnamese settlers continued to flow into Cambodia through the two-headed government of which ninty-nine percent of the Phnom Penh-based power and 100-percent power in the provinces, districts, communes, and villages are in the hands of the Vietnamese communists' puppet administration. The issue of Vietnamese settlers must be resolved in accordance with international law, which clearly states the status of foreign settlers entering other countries during a war of aggression, and according to the rules and regulations applied and being applied in various countries, such as Hong Kong and some other countries in this region. That is, all Vietnamese settlers must be gathered in concentration camps and then repatriated in an orderly manner. The two-headed government must be held fully responsible for the Cambodian nation, people, and history in approving the presence of Vietnamese settlers in Cambodia, thus enabling them to turn Cambodia into a second Kampuchea Kraom through legal means.
