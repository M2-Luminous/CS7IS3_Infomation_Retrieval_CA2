FBIS4-875 "drafr077_e_94002" FBIS-AFR-94-077 Daily Report 20 Apr 1994 WEST AFRICA Liberia Taylor Disagrees With Appointments Taylor Disagrees With Appointments AB2104073594 London BBC World Service in English 1705 GMT 20 Apr 94 AB2104073594 London BBC World Service English BFN [From the "Focus on Africa" program] [Text] It looks as if the log jam in Liberia's peace process has been eased. The factions that signed last year's Cotonou accord have been deadlocked over the appointment of ministers in the transitional council. Charles Taylor has been rejecting the selection of four cabinet ministers -- justice, finance, defense, and foreign -- and has been refusing to seat to his NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] nominees who have been appointed. The NPFL has also been refusing to attend nomination hearings. But now, agreement has been reached over who should have three of the four ministries and it looks like quite a breakthrough. From Monrovia, Nii Nartey Allison telexed this report: Liberia's five-member transitional council today announced new heads for the ministries of justice, finance, and defense. A statement from the office of Council Chairman David Kpomakpor said a minister of foreign affairs will be named shortly. The council appointed Laveli Supuwood of the NPFL to head the Justice Ministry. Sande Ware, of the defunct interim government of Amos Sawyer, retains the post of defense minister, and Banker Wilson Tarpeh got the finance portfolio on the ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] ticket. The statement said the parties to the Cotonou accord made the nominations for three of the four disputed portfolios, leaving the State Council with a free hand to appoint a foreign minister. It said the new appointees and cabinet nominees of the National Patriotic Front of Liberia were expected to go to the confirmation hearings today. NPFL cabinet nominees expected for today's confirmation hearings include Joe Mulbah of information, Tom Woewiyu of labor, and Samuel Dhokie, internal affairs. A Nigerian diplomat said this is the best piece of news for ages and an editorial article today in the Monrovia DAILY NEWS declared: At last a dove of peace is apparently flying over this troubled nation of ours. Charles Taylor of the NPFL in Liberia has just called us up to say that the agreement on the appointment of cabinet ministers does not have his blessing. He said if Laveli Supuwood has accepted the appointment as justice minister, he is a defector from the NPFL.
