Following a general staff meeting which has been in session overnight, Arsenis said that Greece would withdraw its only warship from the Adriatic if NATO marines became engaged in NATO actions against Bosnian Serbs. He said that AWACS planes were not flying out of the NATO base in Aktio in northwestern Greece and that they had all been transferred to the NATO base in Aviano, Italy. On April 10-11, NATO warplanes launched air strikes on Bosnian Serb positions near Gorazde, after Serb forces had crushed a Moslem offensive, mounted in early March from the "safe area" of Gorazde, which should have been demilitarized last spring. However, Greek opposition parties found Greece's disassociation with the NATO action against Bosnian Serbs as insufficient and urged the government, despite Greece's NATO membership, to intervene promptly to avert the flaring up of the Bosnian conflict. The United Left, the Communist Party of Greece and the Political Spring party said there was no justification for the NATO attack on Bosnian Serbs and added that it only served to the intrests of the West. A conservative, New Democracy Party leader Miltiadis Evert late on Monday urged that Greece, currently holding the rotating presidency of the European Union (E.U.), should interfere with the European allies to help stop NATO actions in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
