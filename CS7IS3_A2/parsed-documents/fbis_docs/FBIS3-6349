This is a last-ditch effort of the traitor to suppress and stamp out with "government" power the people's struggle for an end to the "civilian" fascist rule and thus prop up his power on thin ice. The traitor Kim Yong-sam is now much embarrassed by the situation that has turned unfavourable to him. The South Korean people are waging a relentless struggle against the treacherous opening of rice market and for the abolition of the fascist "National Security Law." The opposition camp, too, is pointing an accusing finger at the traitor. At a time when the world public circles including the Amnesty International lifted up their voices condemning the fascist repressive rule and human rights abuses in South Korea, even the United States, his master, urged the abrogation of the notorious "National Security Law," driving him into a sorry plight. All this is a mortal blow and an ominous symptom for the traitor. His remarks whipping up fascist suppression are interpreted as a product of consciousness of crisis in the position of a fish out of water.
