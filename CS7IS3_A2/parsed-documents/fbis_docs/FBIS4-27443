FBIS4-27443 "dreas106__a94030" FBIS-EAS-94-106-A Daily Report 1 Jun 1994 ANNEX Japan Hata Urged To Push for Administrative Reform Hata Urged To Push for Administrative Reform OW0206103894 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 1 Jun 94 Evening Edition p 1 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0206103894 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] Kan Kato, chairman of the government Tax Commission (prime minister's advisory panel), and Sakuei Matsumoto, deputy chairman of the commission, paid a call on Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata on the evening of 1 June, and urged him to go all out for administrative reform to give a big push to the tax system reform efforts. The prime minister showed strong ambition of completing plans on administrative reform by the target of the end of June, saying "We would like to come up with objectives and target dates (for administrative reform of central and local governments)." In connection with the public utilities rates, a planned hike of which has recently been frozen by the government, the prime minister said, "We have to review organizations." He is believed to have made this remark in reference to Japan Highway Public Corporation and other special status corporations. It is likely that the question of making a drastic change of the organization of the special status corporations will come on the agenda of the government discussions with respect to the administrative reform. In a news conference following the meeting with Hata, Chairman Kato said he had asked the prime minister, "Could you not formulate administrative reform five-year plans for central and local governments?" To that question, the prime minister replied, "I would like to come up with some kind of policy by the time the commission comes up with its recommendation." In addition, according to Kato, the prime minister said, "There should be no sacred areas (for administrative reform)." Hata thus showed his willingness to study the question of reorganizing the special status corporations and the issue of the number of local government officials. Asked further about the special status corporations, Chairman Kato said, "I would be lying if I said he did not quote specific names." Prime Minister Hata apparently cited some names and talked about the intention of taking actions to reorganize them. Speaking on this issue, the prime minister also was quoted to have said, "When the freeze on the public utility rates is lifted eventually, we must ensure that the scale of a raise is kept to a minimum." He thus indicated that he would take active actions to study the question of reorganizing the special status corporations, which had intended to raise their utility charges. Regarding a tax system reform that will feature the easing of individuals' income taxes and the raising of consumption tax, the government Tax Commission and the ruling parties' Consultative Committee on Tax System Reform are due to complete concrete plans by the end of June. It appears that Prime Minister Hata wants to give a push to the tax reform program by coming up with administrative reform plans by that time as well.
