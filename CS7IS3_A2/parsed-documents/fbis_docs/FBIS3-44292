In an interview with a XINHUA reporter, Li said: The year 1994 will be the third year since the end of the Cold War. Generally speaking, on the one hand, the international situation is tending toward relaxation and the world is accelerating its pace toward multipolarization. On the other hand, however, the world still faces many unstable factors, and the problems related to the two major concerns -- peace and development -- have yet to be solved. He pointed out that Asia, especially the East Asian region, has remained relatively stable and has been enjoying sustained economic growth amid this turbulent world. This is an important special characteristic of the current international situation, and it can be expected that East Asia's position and influence in the world will be further strengthened in the coming year, he stated. By the same token, he said, one can expect the further upgrading of China's international standing and the further expansion of its foreign relations. Speaking specifically, remarkable development can be expected in the overall relations between China and European countries, and as the Sino-U.S. summit has offered an opportunity for improvement in bilateral ties, new progress possibly will be made in Sino-U.S. relations. Facts have shown that there are broad, common interests in the relations between China and Western countries which form the basis of the relations between the two sides. Li Peng expressed his wishes on the issues of Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan. He said: As the year 1994 is coming, the dates for the return of Hong Kong and Macao to the motherland are drawing nearer and nearer. No matter what happens, we are capable of resuming the exercise of China's sovereignty over Hong Kong as scheduled, while upholding the principle of "one country, two systems" and the principles already laid down in the Basic Law, and also is capable of maintaining long-term stability and prosperity in Hong Kong. Now that Hong Kong and Macao are closely linked with the China mainland economically, the two cities will enjoy greater economic prosperity in the wake of the economic development of the mainland. Peaceful reunification of the motherland is a predominant trend and is in line with the popular will, Li added. To be sure, some people are still attempting to fabricate "two China's," "one China and one Taiwan," or "one country, two governments," all of which run counter to the historical trend and are contrary to the common aspiration and fundamental interests of the Chinese people on both shores of the Taiwan Strait. We hope the Taiwan authorities will place national interests first, and will do more practical work to contribute to the reunification and prosperity of the motherland. Li Peng said: I believe that the vast number of Taiwan compatriots, Hong Kong and Macao compatriots, and overseas Chinese -- all of whom are the descendants of the Chinese nation -- share a common aspiration for the prosperity of the Chinese nation, and all of us should continue to work together to achieve this goal in the new year.
