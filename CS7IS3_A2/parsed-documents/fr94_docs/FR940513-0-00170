FR940513-0-00170 FR940513-0-00034 (hh) Flow restricting or controlling spout end device means an aerator used in a faucet. 3. Section 305.3 is amended by revising paragraphs (k) through (n) and by adding paragraphs (o) through (q) to read as follows: ยง305.3 Description of covered products to which this part applies. * * * * * (k) Fluorescent lamp: (1) Means a low pressure mercury electric-discharge source in which a fluorescing coating transforms some of the ultra-violet energy generated by the mercury discharge into light, including only the following: (i) Any straight-shaped lamp (commonly referred to as 4-foot medium bi-pin lamps) with medium bi-pin bases of nominal overall length of 48 inches and rated wattage of 28 or more; (ii) Any U-shaped lamp (commonly referred to as 2-foot U-shaped lamps) with medium bi-pin bases of nominal overall length between 22 and 25 inches and rated wattage of 28 or more; (iii) Any rapid start lamp (commonly referred to as 8-foot high output lamps) with recessed double contact bases of nominal overall length of 96 inches and 0.800 nominal amperes, as defined in ANSI C78.1&hyph;1978 and related supplements; and (iv) Any instant start lamp (commonly referred to as 8-foot slimline lamps) with single pin bases of nominal overall length of 96 inches and rated wattage of 52 or more, as defined in ANSI C78.3&hyph;1978 (R1984) and related supplement ANSI C78.3a&hyph;1985; but (2) Fluorescent lamp does not mean any lamp excluded by the Department of Energy, by rule, as a result of a determination that standards for such lamp would not result in significant energy savings because such lamp is designed for special applications or has special characteristics not available in reasonably substitutable lamp types; and (3) General service fluorescent lamp means a fluorescent lamp which can be used to satisfy the majority of fluorescent applications, but does not mean any lamp designed and marketed for the following nongeneral lighting applications: (i) Fluorescent lamps designed to promote plant growth; (ii) Fluorescent lamps specifically designed for cold temperature installations; (iii) Colored fluorescent lamps; (iv) Impact-resistant fluorescent lamps; (v) Reflectorized or aperture lamps; (vi) Fluorescent lamps designed for use in reprographic equipment; (vii) Lamps primarily designed to produce radiation in the ultra-violet region of the spectrum; and (viii) Lamps with a color rendering index of 82 or greater. (l) Medium base compact fluorescent lamp means an integrally ballasted fluorescent lamp with a medium screw base and a rated input voltage of 115 to 130 volts and which is designed as a direct replacement for a general service incandescent lamp. (m) Incandescent lamp: (1) means a lamp in which light is produced by a filament heated to incandescence by an electric current, including only the following: (i) Any lamp (commonly referred to as lower wattage nonreflector general service lamps, including any tungsten-halogen lamp) that has a rated wattage between 30 and 199 watts, has an E26 medium screw base, has a rated voltage or voltage range that lies at least partially within 115 and 130 volts, and is not a reflector lamp; (ii) Any lamp (commonly referred to as a reflector lamp) which is not colored or designed for rough or vibration service applications, that contains an inner reflective coating on the outer bulb to direct the light, an R, PAR, or similar bulb shapes (excluding ER or BR) with E26 medium screw bases, a rated voltage or voltage range that lies at least partially within 115 and 130 volts, a diameter which exceeds 2.75 inches, and is either_ (A) A low(er) wattage reflector lamp which has a rated wattage between 40 and 205 watts; or (B) A high(er) wattage reflector lamp which has a rated wattage above 205 watts; (iii) Any general service incandescent lamp (commonly referred to as a high- or higher-wattage lamp) that has a rated wattage above 199 watts (above 205 watts for a high wattage reflector lamp); but (2) Incandescent lamp does not mean any lamp excluded by the Secretary, by rule, as a result of a determination that standards for such lamp would not result in significant energy savings because such lamp is designed for special applications or has special characteristics not available in reasonably substitutable lamp types; and (3) General service incandescent lamp means any incandescent lamp (other than a miniature or photographic lamp), including an incandescent reflector lamp, that has an E26 medium screw base, a rated voltage range at least partially within 115 and 130 volts, and which can be used to satisfy the majority of lighting applications, but does not include any lamp specifically designed for: (i) Traffic signal, or street lighting service; (ii) Airway, airport, aircraft, or other aviation service;
