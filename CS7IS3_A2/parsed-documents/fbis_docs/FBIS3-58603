They were said to be part of a 70-strong gang linked to the Mafia in southern Italy and Colombia's Medellin Cartel. Among those arrested was Sicilian Umberto Pitino, 49, who was detained in 1991 when authorities smashed the so-called pizza connection in the United States. He escaped by helicopter from Raleigh jail in North Carolina with the aid of a Colombian drug producer. Police said cocaine totalling 20 kilos (44 pounds) had been smuggled from Colombia aboard a ship hidden in musical instruments or navigational apparatus.
