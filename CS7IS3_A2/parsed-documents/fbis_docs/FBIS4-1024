Quintal] [Text] Johannesburg April 18 SAPA -- The preliminary hearing of the Goldstone Commission into the Zulu march through Johannesburg on March 28 began at the commission's Sandton offices on Monday morning. The march resulted in 53 deaths and more than 200 injured. The South African Police [SAP], the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] and the kwaZulu government will make their submissions to the commission on Monday and Tuesday. The SAP, represented by Mr B. Roux, handed in a bulky document detailing the police version of events. Mr Roux told the commission that, contrary to newspaper reports, the IFP had applied to the Johannesburg City Council for permission to hold an anti-election meeting at Library Gardens, and not a march. Permission for the meeting had been granted. Mr Roux stressed the police had had no idea before the meeting that snipers would gun down Zulus on city streets. Mr Maurice Basslian is representing the kwaZulu government and the IFP, and Mr George Bizos the African National Congress. The hearing is being attended by observers from Jamaica, Germany, Great Britain and the United States.
