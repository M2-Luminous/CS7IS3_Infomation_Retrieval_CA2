FR940812-2-00210 FR940812-2-00075 6. FBS acquired the holding company for Boulevard Bank on March 25, 1994, and thus became the indirect 100% owner of Boulevard Bank. Boulevard Bank was the investment adviser to each series of FAMF until March 28, 1994. Thus, FBS' acquisition of indirect ownership of Boulevard Bank arguably constituted a sale of Boulevard Bank and an assignment of its advisory contract with FAMF within the meaning of section 15(f). On March 25, 1994, the shareholders of FAMF approved the Adviser as successor investment adviser to each series of FAMF and elected a new Board of Trustees of FAMF. The new members of the FAMF Board are identical to the members of the FAIF Board of Directors, except that one director of FAIF does not serve on FAMF's board. This individual was not nominated to serve on FAMF's board in order to ensure that at least 75% of FAMF's trustees would be ``disinterested,'' as required by the ``safe harbor'' provisions of section 15(f)(1)(A). 3 3 The proxy statement provided to shareholders of FAMF in connection with their March 25, 1994 meeting stated that the section 15(f)(1)(A) requirement that at least 75% of FAMF's directors be disinterested may be disregarded in the future if the SEC grants an exemptive order or no-action relief permitting such action. 7. Applicants propose that the Acquired Funds be combined with and into the Acquiring Funds in tax-free reorganizations (the ``Reorganizations''). In the Reorganizations, each Acquiring Fund will acquire all of the assets and liabilities of the respective Acquired Fund in exchange for shares of the Acquiring Fund, which then will be distributed to former shareholders of the Acquired Fund. The number of Limited Term Income Fund shares to be issued in exchange for each Managed Income Fund share of each class will be determined by dividing the net asset value of one Managed Income Fund share of such class as of the effective time of the Reorganization (before giving effect thereto) by the net asset value of one Limited Term Income Fund share of the same class at such time. In the case of the three Acquired Funds which are being acquired by newly created Acquiring Funds, the share exchanges will take place on a share-for-share basis. 8. Each Acquired Fund and each Acquiring Fund offers or will offer Retail Class, CDSC Class, and Institutional Class shares. 4 Each such class of each Acquired Fund is subject to front-end and deferred sales charges and to rule 12b&hyph;1 and shareholder servicing fees that are identical to those of its counterpart Acquiring Fund. In addition, each Acquired Fund is subject to investment advisory fees which are identical to those of its counterpart Acquiring Fund. In the Reorganizations, former Acquired Fund shareholders will receive Acquiring Fund shares of the class which corresponds to that of their Acquired Fund shares and which have an aggregate net asset value equal, at the effective time of the Reorganizations, to that of their Acquired Fund shares. The investment objectives, policies, and restrictions of each Acquired Fund are substantially similar to those of its respective Acquiring Fund. 4 Each series of FAIF and FAMF is authorized to issue multiple classes of shares in reliance on an exemptive order issued to the distributor of their shares. Investment Company Act Released Nos. 19698 (Sept. 9, 1993) (notice) and 19757 (Oct. 4, 1993) (order). 9. The Adviser has agreed to waive advisory fees and reimburse expenses for each class of each Acquiring Fund to the extent that it is currently doing so with respect to the counterpart classes of the respective Acquired Funds, in each case through January 31, 1996. As a result, through such date former Acquired Fund shareholders will retain the benefit of the fee waivers currently applicable to them following the Reorganization. The differential among classes in the total expense cap agreed to by the Adviser is and will be equal to the differential in rule 12b&hyph;1 fees applicable to the respective classes. 10. Former holders of Acquired Fund CDSC Class shares who receive Acquiring Fund CDSC Class shares in the Reorganizations will receive credit for the period they held Acquired Fund CDSC Class shares in applying any contingent deferred sales charge on Acquiring Fund CDSC Class shares and in applying any conversion feature. In addition, in applying any deferred sales charge on purchases of Retail Class shares, credit will be given for the period a former Acquired Fund shareholder who is subject to such a deferred sales charge held his or her shares. 11. A registration statement on Form N&hyph;14 will be filed with respect to the Reorganizations. A special meeting of shareholders of FAMF will be held to consider and act upon the Reorganizations in accordance with the Act and Massachusetts law. If the required shareholder votes are obtained, the closing is expected to take place shortly thereafter. 12. At meetings held June 8, 1994, the Board of Trustees of FAMF and the Board of Directors of FAIF, including the disinterested trustees and directors, found, as required by rule 17a&hyph;8(a), that participation in the Reorganizations is in the best interests of the Acquired Funds and the Acquiring Funds and that the interests of existing shareholders of such funds will not be diluted as a result of the Reorganizations. The Boards also unanimously approved the Reorganizations. In doing so, the Boards considered: The compatibility of the investment objectives, policies, and restrictions of the respective Acquired Funds and Acquiring Funds; the expected advantages to the Acquired Funds and the Acquiring Funds of the Reorganizations; the anticipated tax-free nature of the Reorganizations; the terms and conditions of the Reorganizations; the costs associated with the Reorganizations, and the agreement of the Adviser to bear such costs; the anticipated advisory fees and sales charges before and after the Reorganization, the Adviser's agreement to waive a portion of such fees, and the provision for giving credit to former Acquired Fund shareholders for the period they held their shares in applying deferred sales charges; and the potential benefits to the Adviser of the Reorganizations.
