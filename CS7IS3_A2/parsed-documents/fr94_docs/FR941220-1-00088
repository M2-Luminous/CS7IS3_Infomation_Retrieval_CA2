ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: This proposed rule would make changes in the Department's regulations governing sanctions imposed by the Mortgagee Review Board. The proposed rule would also make conforming changes to the regulations concerning HUD's hearing officers, consistent with the revisions proposed herein and in the proposed revision to 24 CFR part 24 published elsewhere in today's Federal Register . The changes to the Mortgagee Review Board actions are intended to follow more closely the statutory provisions set forth at 12 U.S.C. 1708(c). The Department considers these proposed revisions necessary to comply with the President's directive to streamline agency operations throughout the Executive Branch. The proposed revisions are also an element in the Government reinvention process at the Department. DATES: Comment due date. Comments must be submitted on or before February 21, 1995. ADDRESSES: Interested persons are invited to submit comments regarding this rule to the Rules Docket Clerk, Office of General Counsel, Room 10276, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20410. Communications should refer to the above docket number and title. A copy of each communication submitted will be available for public inspection and copying between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays at the above address. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Emmett N. Roden, Assistant General Counsel for Administrative Proceedings, Office of General Counsel, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 7th Street, S.W., Room 10251, Washington, D.C. 20410, telephone (202) 708&hyph;2350. The telephone number for the hearing impaired (TDD) is (202) 708&hyph;9300. These are not toll-free numbers. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 202 of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1708 (c) and (d)) established the Mortgagee Review Board (``Board''). Section 202(c)(4) directs the Board to ``hold a hearing on the record'' concerning sanctions it has taken against a mortgagee, if the mortgagee so requests within 30 days notice of the Board's action. However, HUD's current regulations delegate the Board's authority to hold hearings to hearing officers (administrative law judges and Board of Contract Appeals judges). These proceedings have proven extremely time-consuming and expensive. Accordingly, this proposed rule will return the hearing function to the Board, thereby streamlining the hearing process.
