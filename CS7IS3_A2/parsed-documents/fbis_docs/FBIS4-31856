In the interview given to Deputy Chief Editor Peter Miklosi, Moravcik first outlined the gestures addressed to the national minorities. He said that one of his government's basic goals is to fulfill the obligations undertaken in connection with gaining membership in the Council of Europe as soon as possible. "It is our intention that the social climate of good relations emerge at last among our country's citizens of various ethnic backgrounds," Moravcik emphasized, pointing out that this includes a full and unhindered application of the name law and the establishment of legal conditions for bilingual place-names. He also said that they wish to establish the conditions for Slovak membership in the European charter of regional local governments and national minority languages. However, he assumes that the implementation of this will be a task for the new government to be formed after the fall elections. He nevertheless stated that signing the above conventions is a natural interest of the whole of Slovakia. Speaking about the temporary halt of the signs law, Moravcik noted that certain people are too worried: If the principle of historical names used by the national minorities prevails in the case of bilingual signs, this phenomenon might also extend to other areas. These worries can be bridged after some time if the sides concerned seek the solution through dialogue rather than through negative actions. Moravcik pointed out that the Hungarians living in Slovakia can express their views in many ways--their representatives are present in the government's advisory bodies and the parliament and at the meetings of the coalition council. "I see no obstacles to the Foreign Ministry creating an ad hoc or even permanent committee from the representatives of Slovakia's national minorities," he added. The interview discusses in detail the situation of Hungarian-Slovak interstate relations. Moravcik does not consider it likely that the basic agreement will be completed before the fall elections; however, consultations can still be held. He also believes that talks on Bos are necessary in such a way that the whole dispute be moved to the level of technical debate while neither side suffers any lasting damage. In reply to whether some easing can come about in bilateral relations by the end of September, Moravcik said: "Every day and week that passes by without results is wasted.... I am convinced that we have to reach what we call historical reconciliation as soon as possible. In the future, it is very important for us to pay attention to the advantages of our mutual relations rather than to our former disagreements. The common past also holds out a common future, and it matters a lot what kind of prospects we have," Moravcik stated.
