Slezevicius met with Minister in the Chancellor's Office Friedrich Bohl, Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, and Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt on 4 May. At a meeting with the Federation of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce, Slezevicius said that German investment was welcome in his country. Today he will hold talks with the "Initiative Circle of the Ruhr Area." Slezevicius said in an interview with this newspaper: "The only alternative for Lithuania is integration into the European Union [EU] economic structures to guarantee prosperity." Slezevicius thanked Germany for its support and voiced the hope that a free trade agreement with the EU that is currently being negotiated can be signed in July and become effective by the end of 1994. He said that, beyond association, the goal remained Lithuania's EU membership. The agreement signed on "Partnership for Peace" should be followed by a further rapprochement to NATO. "We are hoping for a decision on association with the Western European Union [WEU] by the end of 1994, following the signing of the free trade agreement." Slezevicius expressed concern about Russia: "Because of considerable uncertainties, we can hardly predict anything about events in Russia or relations between Vilnius and Moscow." The documents signed in November last year with Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin have not yet been ratified by the Moscow government. Slezevicius said Russia was trying to link the coming into force of these documents with the demand that Lithuania permit the transit of Russian military transports from the Kaliningrad (Koenigsberg) area across the Baltic state uncontrolled: "Lithuania cannot accept that." Lithuania has introduced a visa system for border traffic: "It is a foregone conclusion that Lithuania, not Russia, decides whether we are going to have a visa system." Lithuania is trying to have friendly, good, and sound relations with Russia and its other neighbors: "However, the dialogue must not proceed upon pressure from the great neighbor, but must be conducted constructively." The last Russian troops have been withdrawn from Lithuania, but no transit agreement has come about. Lithuania wants an arrangement "that should be fixed by both sides." Slezevicius said that Russian troops and the respective military equipment from eastern Germany arrive in Lithuania by ship and are transported on to Russia. In each case, Lithuania issues transit permissions. "The Kaliningrad area represents a problem, not only for Russia and Lithuania, but also for Europe." In view of the concentration of Russian troops in the Kaliningrad area, Slezevicius added: "Regional security could be improved by demilitarization." He said Lithuanian negotiators had asked experts from Denmark and Germany to advise them in negotiations with Moscow by making suggestions on the transit problem. Separate negotiations were being held on the less difficult transit of civilian persons. With Western technology and access to the Eastern market and its raw materials, Lithuania could form a "bridge between East and West," said Slezevicius. However, this required more stability in Russia. Slezevicius said he was concerned about nationalist Zhirinovskiy's popularity with the Russia people. It was only "under the European shield" that Lithuania could protect itself against dangers. Fifty "lost years of occupation" had to be made up. That is why Lithuania was making a considerable effort to accelerate its European integration. The only way was the free market economy. Slezevicius spoke about successes. He said that since his government took office on 31 March 1993, the average income in real terms, which had decreased in the first three years of Lithuania's independence, increased more than 12 percent for the first time. Since the middle of 1993, the currency was stabilizing. After a rate of inflation of more than 1,000 percent in 1992, an inflation of less than 50 percent had to be expected in 1994, because in cooperation with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, a strict monetary policy was being operated. That is why there were "good prospects" for investment, without which the economic sector could not be restructured. Political stability was useful for economic stability, said Slezevicius: "Following three years of independence, Lithuania now has the absolute majority of a party in parliament and a new constitution." Privatization would be accelerated, and the banking sector restructured. Slezevicius mentioned a Swedish financial aid of $10 million for developing the banking system in Lithuania and said that it was a signal of foreign confidence. Slezevicius said he was satisfied with the Lithuanian-Polish agreement that was concluded last week. In the agreement Lithuania had dropped its demand that Poland apologize for the occupation of Vilnius in 1920. It was more important now that Lithuania's borders were recognized and remained secure. Poland had expressly called Vilnius the Lithuanian capital. Lithuania had dropped its original demand that Warsaw apologize for Poland's military action after World War II, because "a positive negotiation result is better than none." "It is no good to burden the future with the past." Lithuania was also trying to achieve progress in the negotiations with Russia on the recognition of the borders along the Kaliningrad area and in the Baltic Sea. Slezevicius said that agreement had been reached with Latvia on the border line. There were still problems with Belarus. Following the change of president in Minsk, the negotiations were not progressing. An area of 513 hectares was at issue. Slezevicius said it was a success of his government to have concluded free trade agreements with the other Baltic states, Scandinavia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan, and a most favored nation agreement in trade with Russia. Negotiations were now being held with Brussels, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia. Germany was Lithuania's largest European trading partner and investor: "Our relations are developing in a helpful and dynamic way."
