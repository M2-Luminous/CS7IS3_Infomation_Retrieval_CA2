The fact that U.S. President Bill Clinton's positions regarding the Greek minority in Albania were satisfactory and in accordance with the principles that supposedly govern U.S. foreign policy in regard to human rights is small consolation. Equally irrelevant for the Greek side is whether, in practice, the relations between the White House and State Department are harmonious. What matters is that, according to the Greek Government, State Department bureaucracy is primarily interested in the stability of Enver Hoxha's doctor and current Albanian president, Sali Berisha, and not in the Tirana regime's adherence to the principles of CSCE and Copenhagen regarding respect for human rights. This position, official sources in Athens stressed, has by now led the Greek Government to handle its troublesome relations with Tirana mainly at the bilateral level, regardless of any appeals to international organizations, which it will intensify but without expecting positive results. Confirmation of this came from Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias, who said on Friday [27 May] that, "if the violations of the Greek minority's rights continue, there will a conflict with Albania at the diplomatic and political levels." From the very beginning of its term in office, the current Greek government, and specifically Foreign Minister Papoulias, promoted a policy of restoring relations between Athens and Tirana despite the high domestic cost. In his approach, Papoulias was also supported by the U.S. State Department; but last week it suddenly shook the current balance by adopting Berisha's positions. Well-informed sources stress that following the State Department's shift, its calls for a dialogue cannot be taken seriously in Athens because the U.S. role in relation to Albania is no longer that of "an honest referee," as the Greek side desired. Consequently, if the current situation with regard to Albania continues, the Greek Government's reaction will be "extremely severe," simply because the doctrine "Cyprus is too far away" cannot be applied in the case of the Albanian Greeks. The State Department's second controversial statement--that it is examining reports about the training of Kurds in Greece--is seen in Athens as a naive attempt to reinforce a shaky regime which, despite the fact that for 10 years it has been unable to impose its control in Turkey's eastern provinces with the West's tolerance and silence, is still trying to internationalize a domestic issue by blaming others. There is no practical reason for the Kurds to be trained in Greece or anywhere else, because for 10 years they have trained under actual combat conditions in eastern Turkey. At the same time Athens believes that the claims by the Turkish security authorities--according to which Kurds from Frankfurt arrived in Greece and trained for five months on explosives, then went to Iran from whence they entered Turkey, and ended in Izmir, where they were going to carry out sabotage--cannot even be a part of an investigation by the services of a big power much less be addressed in public by official remarks by the State Department spokesman. Of course the State Department's positions regarding Albania's Greeks and the issue of the Kurds, as mentioned above, reflect a sharp decline in the U.S. Administration's views of the quality of some decisions by the Greek political leadership. During the last couple of years, the behavior of corresponding European Union [EU] state mechanisms was similar. In that case, though, the possibility of frequent contacts at the highest level--that is, once every six months at the EU Summit--gave former Prime Minister Konstandinos Mitsotakis an opportunity to intervene and get some understanding and tolerance from the European political leaders. In the case of relations with the United States though, despite the very good personal relation established between the U.S. President and Papandreou, the frequency of contacts in relation to those existing in the EU framework is limited. As a result, the State Department's role appears to be more important. Consequently, the problem is identified as a lack of direct "political" dialogue between Athens and Washington as it exists within the European Union. Official sources in Athens stressed that, due to the lack of "political" dialogue and given the State Department's negative stance, there are doubts as to whether the Greek political leadership can count on operational contact with Washington for the benefit of stability in the Balkans.
