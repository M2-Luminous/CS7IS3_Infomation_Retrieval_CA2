Thai Red Cross Society AIDS Program director Praphan Phanuphak said the AIDS preventive vaccine developed by United Biomedical Inc of the United States would be tried on volunteers of a low-risk group, after formal approval is received from the National AIDS Committee, chaired by Prime Minister Chuan Likphai, on February 14. He said the Public Health Ministry had finally accepted the need for development of vaccines to prevent HIV infection in Thailand and had therefore given the green light. The vaccine, already tested on people in the United States, Australia, and China, had proved to be satisfactory, he said. Dr. Praphan said the first phase of the trial would require 24 volunteers, to observe the side effects that could be caused, and 100 to 200 volunteers to test the vaccine. The results of the first stage of the trial would be known after eight months, whereas that of the second stage would be known within two years. The vaccine trial would be publicized widdy [as received] because volunteers, non-HlV carriers of the lower risk group, would have to be carefully screened, he said. Dr. Praphan said the volunteers would have to be given full details of the trial because out of the 24 volunteers, some would be given 100 micrograms of vaccine, some 500 micrograms and some would be given placebos, without making them aware of what injection they have received. He said the volunteers would have to be told that the vaccine might be of benefit or might be of no use at all to them. "The drawback of the vaccine trial is that during the initial trial period volunteers will have anti-HlV positive antibody in their blood," Dr. Praphan said. However, after some time this could be separated from the HIV positive infection that caused AIDS. According to Dr. Praphan, the Public Health Ministry is opening up to the vaccine trial because the AIDS problem is rapidly increasing in Thailand. "Even though the news media criticizes Thailand for using its people as guinea pigs, the ministry will ignore it because no time can be wasted on this problem." Other than the vaccine, Dr. Praphan said a new type of medicine, known as "protease inhibitor", was being developed in the United States and it was hoped it would be used by Thais by the end of the year. He said this new medicine would be different from AZT because it would not allow the virus to become active and would allow only the production of a defective virus. Dr. Praphan called on the Public Health Ministry and researchers of the country to encourage vaccine trials -- and not to bother whether the medicine had been licensed -- in order to obtain vaccines at a reasonable cost.
