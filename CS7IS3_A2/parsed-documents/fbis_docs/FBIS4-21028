This was reported by the customs authorities on Monday. The actions took place as early as in November 1993 and last January, but they were reported later for tactical reasons. The customs officers discovered the marijuana in containers from the west African port of Warri (Nigeria) that were supposed to contain ginger and nut oil. Instead, the drug squad found almost 100 barrels with small, pressed marijuana packets. The two containers were originally destined for Riga and Warsaw. The container with the destination Warsaw was not picked up in the port of Hamburg. The other container with the destination Riga was shipped to Latvia, but the actual addressees did not turn up there either. The investigators found out about the cocaine delivery through a tip from abroad. As a result, they checked a container from Ecuador that had arrived on a Chinese ship. It contained 29 barrels with liquid polyester resin and was to be taken to Morocco. With the help of an x-ray vehicle [roentgen fahrzeug], the investigators discovered metal containers with two packets of cocaine each under the lids of the barrels.
