"Dreams of a greater, or even of a `middle-sized' Hungary cannot be fulfilled," Huska said, adding that it was not possible for the government not to have contingency plans in case the state should be threatened. He expressed the conviction that Slovakia would be able to preserve its territorial integrity. Slovak Minister of Culture Dusan Slobodnik said that "there is no government more tolerant than the current Slovak one." Slovak Deputy Premier Sergej Kozlik called on Slovaks to express their dissatisfaction over attempts by the Hungarian minority to achieve autonomy in southern Slovakia. "It is time for parliament to consider passing a law on the protection of the Republic," Slobodnik said, adding that among the Hungarian minority there were still "many decent people who want to live peacefully in Slovakia." The worsening of the situation in Slovakia is tied to a demand made by the Association of Towns and Villages of Zitny Island, which is calling for autonomy for southern Slovakia from Bratislava to the Ukrainian border. An assembly to discuss the demand is to be held on January 8 in Komarno, southern Slovakia.
