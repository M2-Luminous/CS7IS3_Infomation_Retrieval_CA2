Since the end of World War II, the Iraqi opposition has been dominated by three Iraqi party organizations in succession. The Communist Party, which was persecuted by the government during the monarchy period, played a leading opposition role during 'Abd-al-Karim Qasim's tenure. Later, it allied itself with Qasim and began to persecute the opposition, then led by the Ba'th Party. When the Ba'th Party obtained power in 1963, and later in 1968, it became the hangman of the opposition. During the Ba'th's first stint in power, the Communist Party was its victim. When the Ba'th came to power again in 1968, the IDP became its victim. The Communist Party, the Ba'th Party, and the IDP do share some characteristics, despite the great differences between them. - Each has suffered at one time from persecution and has had to adopt covert action to avoid repression and torture. This situation has precluded the practice of democracy within their respective ranks. These parties' leaders have thus engaged in autocratic decisionmaking, arguing the need for such methods because of exceptional circumstances. - Each of these parties claims to possess a comprehensive ideology--be it Marxism, nationalism, or Islam--which confers on its members the characteristic of an elite acting on behalf of the proletariate, Arabism, or religion. - In relating to the people, each of these parties views itself as the guardian of the people, believing that it knows best what is in the people's interests. - Each of their ideologies extends beyond Iraq's borders. In many cases, their ideological and even organizational authority is abroad: in Moscow in the name of the International, in Damascus or Cairo in the name of Arabism, or in Tehran in the name of Islam. - Each of these parties has used force to achieve its objectives, thereby entrenching the principle that the ends justify the means. As soon as they attain power or come to share power, they liquidate others and persecute allies of yesterday. The Communist Party fought the Ba'th, which was its ally in the National Front opposing the monarchy. The Ba'th has begun to persecute clerics to whom it had frequently appealed in its fight against the Communist Party and communism during 'Abd-al-Karim Qasim's tenure. For example, the family of Muhsin al-Hakim, the supreme, Shiite religious authority, who issued a religious ruling prohibiting communism in 'Abd-al-Karim Qasim's tenure, later became the first victim of Ba'thist rule. If political persecution creates its antithesis, the organization's secret is its incubator. The IDP's literature is limited. The lectures and writings of the martyr Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr remain an important reference in this regard. Al-Sadr advocated mutual understanding and dialogue with other forces. The statement of mutual understanding issued by the party in the early eighties, before the Iraqi-Iranian War, is an example of this thinking. It appears in a pamphlet issued by the party in London in March 1992 entitled "Our Program": "This statement of mutual understanding issued in the early eighties makes allowance for the numerous special characteristics of the Iraqi people's social composition and active political forces. It calls on all of these political groups to take up the mission of saving the Iraqi people and preserving Iraq's independence and territorial integrity." This positive, political tendency changed after the Iraqi-Iranian War broke out. The IDP dropped its efforts to achieve an alliance with secular Iraqi forces. Instead, it adopted the Iranian formula, as represented in the Supreme Islamic Revolution Council in Iraq in 1982, in which the IDP was an active member. During the Iranian-Iraqi War (1980-1988), the IDP adopted an organizational and ideological trend--perhaps in keeping with political currents in Iran at the time--of hostility to any un-Islamic Iraqi political party or force. In this regard, it borrowed some notions, quoted below, from a book published in Iran to indoctrinate IDP members entitled Islamic Call Education, Political Section (published by the IDP, first edition 1984). Under the heading of "Theory of Political Action in Islam," the following is stated in said book: "It was natural that the IDP--like other sincere, Islamic movements and groups--would find the political environment contaminated with accusations, vanities, and attempts to mislead public opinion, the most important of which are the following: (...) "6. The propagation of a flood of parties, theories, concepts, terms, and entities based on nationalist or patriotic democratic, capitalist programs, or on theoretical Marxist and socialist principles. Such parties, politicians, educational and cultural academies, and political thinking are all designed to run counter to Islam and to fundamentally destroy and weaken Islam's influence among the people through various techniques and means. "7. Several emaciated entities linked to European and American colonialism, which purport to be Islamic or to promote Islamic government. "8. Political entities and leaders who claim to be sincere, to defend the nation's causes, and to act to liberate and develop the nation. They side with the procession of colonialism and are linked with it ideologically and politically. Examples of this type of ruler and entity are 'Abd-al-Karim Qasim, Gamal Abdel Nasser, and national and crusader movements, e.g., the Ba'th and the like. "It was incumbent upon al-Da'wah to make plans to confront this aggregate and these circumstances and thus bring the people of the nation through the clouds and blocked visibility to clarity, understanding, and sound political awareness." (pp 16-18) Under the heading, "Capitalism's Means for Implementing Its Goals," the following is stated: "[Among these means are] the fabrication of regimes, parties, and international organizations to safeguard colonialist interests. Examples of this include parties throughout the Islamic world and Latin America that have adopted European thought and capitalist culture--including laws, regulations, and morals--as a foundation and modus operandi. Other examples are provided by parties that have adopted change by introducing ideas and slogans consistent with the people's environment and nature, e.g., socialism, nationalism, patriotism, and perhaps false Islamic slogans at times. Examples of international organizations and laws that serve colonialist interests are the United Nations, the Arab League, the Nonaligned Movement, the OAU (...) and international law, the law of the veto...etc." (pp 32-43) Under the heading, "Foundations and Premises of Islamic Political Thought," is the following: "[In taking] a wary, skeptical view of what is issued by movements, entities, and personalities which are non-Islamic, anonymous, or which have a disquieting past, the principle regarding those which are non-Islamic is that they are suspect and untruthful in their action. The principle in dealing with someone of doubtful identity and intentions, who acts, or seeks cooperation, under the heading of Islam, is caution and circumspection in circumstances in which we fear infiltration and political deception, in the absence of evidence that proves his sound intentions and pure identity." (pages 57-58) Under the heading, "Theoretical Goals of Political Action," it is said that "the IDP has identified infiltration after analyzing the types of agents and infiltrators. It concluded that anyone who has not propagandized Islam and promoted its slogan truthfully and sincerely is a linked agent, whether or not he is actually linked, because he must always swim in an international environment created by colonialism, act on the basis of the arrogant powers' policy and interests, and advocate the colonialist imports of democracy, socialism, nationalism, communism, etc. In any case, he is only a part of the political equation dictated by the colonialist policy planners." (p 77) The second Gulf war was a turning point for Iraqi political action in general and Islamic parties in particular. These forces had hoped that the second Gulf war would succeed where the first Gulf war had failed by toppling the dictatorial regime in Iraq. The Islamic forces pinned great hopes on the March 1991 revolt. However, the international and regional calculus precluded the success of that revolt. In its review of the revolt, the IDP states, regarding the position taken by countries in the region: "The regional position was not better than the international position. Some governments in the region took pleasure in the tragedy that occurred in Iraq. Others displayed anxiety over the people's revolt; they feared the next regime, because it would represent the Iraqi people's will." Regarding Iran's position, the IDP states in its review: "Countries which the Iraqi people had hoped would hasten to support it in its trial during the revolt, especially those countries which were a victim of the regime's crimes and hostile policies, did not rise to the occasion by providing what was essential to a people being harmed by hunger brought on by a bloody, savage regime" (the pamphlet, "Our Program," March 1992, p 39). This analysis reflects the IDP's difference with Iran, which apparently goes back to before the second Gulf war, when Iran selected Muhammad Baqir al-Hakim instead of the IDP to head the Supreme Council of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, which was set up as a framework for political action in opposition to the Iraqi regime. The IDP continued to be a member of the council, though only nominally. After the second Gulf war, the IDP opened--under the heading of flexibility--to the neighboring Arab countries, specifically Saudi Arabia. A delegation of IDP leaders visited Saudi Arabia on more than one occasion to meet with senior Saudi officials. In consonance with the orientations of Syria, Saudi Arabia, and several other Iraqi political forces, the party joined the preparatory committee laying the ground for a congress of the Iraqi opposition in Beirut in March 1991. It subsequently became an active member in the joint action committee and cooperated with the group that attended the Vienna congress (in June 1992). However, at the last minute, it announced that it would not participate in the congress for procedural, formal reasons pertaining to the timing of the congress and allocation of [representational] proportions among the political forces in the committees. Nonetheless, the IDP continued to cooperate with the parties that participated in the Vienna congress, which was crowned, at the Salah-al-Din and Shaqlawah meeting on 22-27 September 1992, in a joint agreement to hold an enlarged Iraqi opposition congress with the participation of the Islamic parties, including the IDP. In October 1992, the Iraqi National Congress was held at Salah-al-Din, Irbil, with the participation of the IDP, which joined the congress's executive council under the chairmanship of Dr. Ahmad Chalabi. The IDP Withdraws From the National Congress In late August 1993, the IDP announced that it was withdrawing from the Iraqi National Congress, a move that had been hinted quietly for some time. This announcement, and statements made by party leaders, were general and avoided specifics, which prompts a number of observations: - Because the Iraqi National Congress was known for its alliance with the West, specifically America, before the Irbil congress was convened, some Iraqi political forces and personalities boycotted the congress, but the IDP attended it. - The IDP's reservations regarding several leaders of the Congress can be overcome through the application of internal regulations and the holding of free elections. In this regard, one asks why the IDP did not wait for, or request, the convocation of the congress's national assembly to discuss all of its reservations candidly and clearly, instead of alluding to unaddressed reservations? For the Congress leaders' failure to convene the national assembly, or their refusal to convene it for any reason, would be a mistake that would put the National Congress on the popular, democratic touchstone to which it lays claim. - The IDP's solitary exit from the Congress, without coordinating with the other participating forces, at least the other Islamic forces, weakens the IDP movement, especially in the Islamic milieu. Moreover, it entrenches division within the Islamic house. Here, a question arises: How can one speak of the opposition's unity when a primary group in the Islamic movement fails to at least unify Islamic ranks? - Since the second Gulf war, accessibility and political flexibility--which are necessary at times, provided that the party and its leaders are clear about their objectives--have not been seen in the IDP's course. The party is intransigent in negotiations and in indoctrinating its members, and it rejects others. However, publicly, in the Arab world and internationally, it speaks of unity and a consolidation of forces. At the same time that it rejects colonialism and all arrogant powers, it seeks justifications for cooperating with Western powers and America, and it enters into political alliances with forces that are proteges of the West and America. These contradictions must necessarily be reflected in the party's ranks and bases. It may be that the main reason for the IDP's withdrawal from the Unified Iraqi National Congress is its desire to overcome an internal crisis. - Some IDP leaders justify cooperation with the Congress, despite its Americanness, with the argument that it is the only available auspices for toppling Saddam Husayn through a military coup that ushers in a transitional government that moves Iraq toward popular, Islamic rule. Therefore, the IDP agreed to a role in the National Congress that is not in proportion to its popularity, and it is also speaking moderately in the hope of eliminating the charge of "terrorism" against it, all of this in the hope that the U.S. administration will continue Bush's declared course of calling for Saddam's ouster. However, today, after Bill Clinton's advent, Saddam's ouster no longer tops the U.S. agenda. Consequently, the IDP no longer sees any justification for remaining in the Iraqi National Congress. - The IDP's options have shrunk. Iran recognizes the Supreme Council of the Islamic Revolution and is interested in the survival of the Iraqi National Congress, which, for the first time, has given a Shiite political current a preeminent position in the Arab sphere. Also, the Kurds' approval of the National Congress formula means that they will stick with the Iraqi formula and not realize Iran's fear of Kurdish separatism. On the other hand, by withdrawing from the National Congress, the IDP loses an effective opposition pole represented by the Kurds. Action in the field in Iraq is impossible without these two arenas, unless Syria agrees to undertake active political action, which is not substantiated by events, inasmuch as Syria is now occupied with the Israeli, Palestinian, and Lebanese file, and any uncalculated change in Iraq might result in an alternate [regime] or political situation that does not serve Syria's current interests. In conclusion, re-examination, review, and new formulae for taking action are needed.
