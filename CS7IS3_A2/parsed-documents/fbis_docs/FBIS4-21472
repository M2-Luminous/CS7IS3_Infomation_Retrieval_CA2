After all, the question immediately arose as to what to do with the water from the submarine, polluted with radiation, since the notorious TNT-5 tanker, like others, is full to overflowing with life-threatening waste. This is in the center of the Bolshoy Kamen town, quite near to Vladivostok. [video shows port facilities, vessels, residential buildings nearby] Nor is there any protection against the impending disaster. Local projects to treat the waste are unrealistic and the Japanese assistance is hanging in the air. It is precisely for this reason that the interdepartmental commission working at the Zvezda Works made a sensational decision on the necessity to discharge the liquid radioactive waste into the Sea of Japan, as was done before, because nothing else can be done. Ahead is the dismantling of a further number of nuclear submarines, more than 40.
