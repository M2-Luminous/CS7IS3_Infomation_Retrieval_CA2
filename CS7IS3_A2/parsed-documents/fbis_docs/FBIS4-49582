China's contract laws, written during the years of a planned economy, cannot meet the new demands. Under changed realities, many articles contradict each other. And China has different contract laws for domestic and foreign trades, as well as for different businesses. This no longer complies with the demand of a unified domestic market, which will become an integral part of the world market. Different economic contract laws for domestic and foreign trades are designed by developing countries to protect their weak industries. But as China is now preparing to re-enter the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) and to fully participate in international business activities, the dual-standards are apparently out of date and detrimental to the establishment of the market economy. Overseas investors find these dual-standards increasingly troublesome. When they co-operate with Chinese partners in export and import, they are to abide by a foreign contact law; when they establish joint ventures with Chinese firms, they have to abide by domestic contract law. This creates much inconvenience for foreigners wishing to trade and invest in China. The same is true with the technological contract laws. The overseas technological contract law applies to domestic business people that import overseas technologies and their foreign suppliers, while the domestic technological contract law concerns deals between domestic business people. Due to the inconsistency of the two laws, the role of science and technology in promoting productivity has been limited. Besides even now China does not have a law stipulating the export of technologies. Also the contract laws and regulations in various areas -- such as civil engineering, property insurance, sales of agricultural and industrial products -- have mainly been drafted by different departments who follow significantly different principles. As a result, they can hardly form a coherent system. In another respect, as the laws tend to deal with principles, they are not easy to be implemented. They need to be more detailed. The inconsistency and administrative nature of the country's old contract laws will surely reduce the vitality of enterprises and hinder the competition between them. Contracts play a vital role in the market economy. The allocation of resources, such as commodities services funds human resources and information, are all realized through contacts. Contract laws are fundamental to business dealings. To ensure the role of contracts in resource allocation and the country's smooth re-entry into Gatt, China must work out a new set of contract laws. To draft the new laws, China should follow the principles of the contract laws of Britain and the United States, the Gatt, the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (1980), the Principle for International Commercial Contracts and other international codes on foreign trade. Britain and the United States have accumulated rich experience in this field. Also as a commercial language, English and its legal terms have been very popular in the world business community. If China refers to the contract laws of the two countries, its contract laws will be more detailed and much closer to international standards. Amended contract laws are likely to be convenient for overseas business people and reduce business disputes. China should study the demands of the Gatt and make the new contract laws comply with the Gatt's basic principles of free trade, eliminate trade barriers and improve the protection of intellectual property rights. China's new set of contract laws can be written into a statute book composed of general principles and specialized contract laws. The general principles should be based upon the general rule of the civil law, economic contract law and the overseas economic contract law and the above-mentioned foreign contract laws. The specialized laws should also reflect the spirit of the various foreign laws. For example, the drafting of the new regulations concerning the contract guarantee should refer to the Uniform Rules for Contract Guarantees Publication. If China can adopt the advanced achievements of other countries in formulating the new set of contract laws and forge a strict logical link between the general rules and the specific articles, its competitiveness in the international market could be strengthened and its legislative level will be greatly upgraded.
