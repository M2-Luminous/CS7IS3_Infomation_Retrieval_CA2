These issues, which concern ruling party governors as much as opposition governors, will be analyzed in two meetings in Santa Fe and Buenos Aires on 14 and 16 June respectively. Santa Fe will be the location for a meeting of the so-called "club of friendly governors," which was born last week when Entre Rios Governor Carlos Moine convened a meeting with his counterparts at the Constituent Assembly to discuss the national economic plan and its repercussions on the regional economies. Santa Fe Governor Carlos Reutemann abruptly decided to broaden the club's coverage and invited all governors without exception to continue discussing their problems. One of the governors' proposals will be difficult for Cavallo's team to swallow, as the provincial executive branches want all taxes collected in the nation entered into the revenue coffer and then want an equitable share of it, that is, 50 percent for the central administration and 50 percent for the provinces. Reutemann trusts that all governors, except Eduardo Angeloz of Cordoba, will come to the meeting. Rodolfo Gabrielli (Mendoza), Horacio Massaccesi (Rio Negro), Carlos Maestro (Chubut), Jose Estabillo (Tierra del Fuego), and Juan Carlos Rojas (San Juan) have already confirmed their participation. Besides the above-mentioned revenue sharing percentages, the governors of provinces bordering neighboring countries, such as Mendoza, Entre Rios, and Rio Negro, among others, continue to be concerned about the consequences of imported, subsidized agricultural products to local producers. On 16 June, Cavallo will participate in the third meeting between national government officials and northern provincial governors to try to convince governors of the benefits of transferring their pension funds to the nation. During the first meeting, 15 days ago, there was no agreement despite the efforts of Cavallo, presidential Secretary General Eduardo Bauza, and Social Security Secretary Walter Schulthess. The second meeting, held last week, was purely technical. On that occasion the provincial economy and finance ministers met with Schulthess. The ministers also disagreed with Schulthess, and the negative positions started to become official. The provinces of Entre Rios, Formosa, and Misiones have already notified the nation that they will not transfer their pension funds. According to Schulthess, Cordoba has already refused; the five Patagonian provinces, where pension funds so far maintain surpluses, will also refuse to transfer their pension funds. On 16 June, the central government will use heavy ammunition to try to convince the northern provinces' governors. They will meet once more with Bauza and Cavallo in the Buenos Aires offices of the Federal Investments Council (CFI).
