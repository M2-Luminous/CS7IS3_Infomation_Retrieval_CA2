They have accused the Moldovan president of treachery and duplicity, the president's Press Secretary Vasile Grosavu told INTERFAX. He said that the opposition had also accused the president of making public the conflict in Moldova's eastern regions in the summer of 1992. Meanwhile, it was Snegur who invited CSCE experts to get acquainted with the situation and help settle the conflict between Transdniestria and the central authorities, he noted. Moreover, Snegur favors further quadripartite talks between Moldova, Russia, Ukraine and Tiraspol, said Grosavu. The press secretary also denied media reports laying the blame for the current economic crisis in Moldova on Mircea Snegur. Grosavu said that the president's support for the idea of dissolving the parliament and holding early parliamentary elections was motivated by his plans to lead the country out of the economic crisis as soon as possible. Moldovan Prosecutor General Dumitru Postovan has denied reports that Snegur was involved in the "dirty deals" linked with the notorious Seabeco company.
