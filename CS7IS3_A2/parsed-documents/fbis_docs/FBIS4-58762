FBIS4-58762 "drnes088yy_94009" FBIS-NES-94-088 Daily Report 6 May 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Arab-Israeli Talks Palestinian Police Entrance Process Described Palestinian Police Entrance Process Described TA0505191994 TA0505191994 BFN [Editorial Report] Jerusalem New Channel 2 Television Network in Hebrew at 1700 GMT on 5 May carries a 5-minute video report by military affairs correspondent Roni Daniyel which recounts that "the entrance of the Palestinian policemen to Gaza and Jericho will be delayed and will be carried out in stages." The report states that "the weapons of the Palestinian policemen will arrive in Egyptian Rafah in approximately three days. Later, after proper coordination with the IDF [Israel Defense Forces], the policemen will enter Rafah and assume immediate responsibility over the area. The entrance of the Palestinian policemen to the other parts of the Strip has been delayed to a later date." The report notes that these details were concluded in a working meeting today between heads of the Israel-Palestinian liaison committee. Daniyel explains that the first meeting of this committee was held at an IDF base near the Erez checkpoint today. He adds: "The initial stage of the Palestinian force's entrance started today in the shape of a familiarization tour of the five police installations in the Gaza Strip." Daniyel points out that the Palestinians "did not assume any responsibilities today, rather only reviewed the situation." Describing "the agreed-upon withdrawal method," Daniyel notes: "Unarmed Palestinian forces will enter the area while the IDF withdraws. Only then will the armed Palestinian policemen arrive with their vehicles and assume responsibility. The phased withdrawal from Rafah will start next Wednesday [11 May]." Daniyel points out that the Palestinians will be the ones who decide how the withdrawal process proceeds, "on the basis of their ability to assume responsibility." "They will announce next week what size they can control. As things look now, they will start with the Rafah area." "The IDF is ready to evacuate all the areas over which the Palestinians will be ready to assume control." Daniyel stresses that both sides are striving to prevent a situation of a vacuum on the ground, "in which incidents can occur which both sides are not interested in." "For this reason the two sides are coordinating an overlapping process, wherein the Palestinians enter the area unarmed, study the area, and take over only after they are able to assume responsibility and rule. The IDF will evacuate the area immediately after it receives the appropriate order." The report goes on to quote correspondent Yoram Binur, who says that "in Jericho too it is not known exactly when the Palestinian policemen will arrive. It is assessed they will cross the bridges from Jordan in the middle of next week. Meanwhile a preliminary Palestinian police team is in Jericho, coordinating the process with the IDF."
