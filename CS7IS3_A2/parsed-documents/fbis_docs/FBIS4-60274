'Amira Hess, an HA'ARETZ reporter who was also slated to participate in the symposium, proposed to meet them in Tel Aviv before the event. The problem was that Abu-Zayidah and 'Abd-al-Razzaq, with approximately 30 years in prison between them, do not visit Tel Aviv very often. Where should they meet? "You decide," they said. "No, you two decide," Hess replied. There is one place in Tel Aviv every Gazan knows. That is where they go to collect bodies; where taxi drivers take them to introduce them to foremen of construction sites; where the authorities throw them when they are caught without a permit to stay in Israel. "Let's meet at Abu-Kabir [site of a forensic institute and a lockup facility]," the two men proposed. At the very same time, thousands of Gaza Strip residents were anxiously waiting along the roads leading to the Rafah border checkpoint for the first contingents of the Palestinian police. Abu-Zayidah and 'Abd-al-Razzaq did not have to work hard to convince their Tel Aviv audience of the need for a strong police force. A few minutes after they began taking questions from the audience, five youths who had up to that moment taken cover behind "Peace Now" T-shirts and "There Is A Mandate for Peace" stickers, leapt up and shouted: Sufyan, go back to Gaza, you murderer. A scuffle ensued and the police were summoned to see the rioters out. An Israeli police officer, who looked exhausted, had to stay until the end of the symposium to make sure that the two Palestinian leaders would be permitted to speak without interruption. "I understand you," Abu-Zayidah bitterly told the right-wing rioters. "It is hard for you. A lot of Palestinians also find this peace hard to swallow. Even though there is peace, your soldiers still shoot us every day in Gaza and Dayr al-Balah. So, some people find it hard. But, it will not help them, just as it will not avail you. There will be peace." The Gaza Strip is changing from day to day, sprucing up, erasing the soot, dust, and agony of the occupation. It is still not the ideal place to live, but its quality is improving. People are thinking about tomorrow, not just about today, and this is having an effect. In recent weeks, thick ropes have been stretched on the roads in the streets of Jabalyah. This is the local version of road humps to force drivers to slow down. As is known, it has been a long time since Gaza has observed any traffic rules. There, a child opens his front door and he is already in the middle of the road. There have been cases when a child ran after a friend and found himself run over by a car. So, they are stretching ropes. Construction work can be seen in every corner. Housing projects are being built. Carpet dealer Hamis al-Halawi, not a well-liked man in Gaza -- he owns a four-story clothing and carpet store -- covered the whole building with a huge Palestine flag, just as the Habima Theater in Tel Aviv was once covered with the Israeli flag. 'Abd-al-Qadr al-Husayni Street in the Rimal neighborhood already looks like a government ministry compound: offices of the Engineers Association, the Development Society, the Family Planning Society, the Trade Union Federation. "Did Hayim Ramon win? We will have to meet him. So far we have discussed workers' rights with Haberfeld." New huts for bathers are being built on the seashore. Until the intifadah, Gazans used to go to the beach in Ashqelon. Since the intifadah the seashore is associated with the "Seashore Outpost" and the "Ansar-2 camp," two notorious sites on the waterfront. Swimming was no fun then. Things are different now. Peddlers expose their wares in the middle of the street. Many Gazans feel the goods, with a view to renovating their homes. New graffiti has been sprayed on the wall outside Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi's home: "We Will Build Our State With Our Own Two Hands," and "Palestine Opens Its Arms to the Arriving Policemen." Now the graffiti is aesthetic, pretty, and colorful. They can stand in front of the wall with their spray cans and paint uninterruptedly, not like it used to be. Thousands of people still subsist on flour and water. A demonstration was staged last week in front of the UNRWA [UN Relief and Works Agency] offices demanding an increase in the rations. Local doctors are worried about the growing incidence of malnutrition which weakens the body's immune system, particularly in children. All these are attendant consequences of the prolonged closure. Gaza is awash in cheap Israeli canned food. The reason: its expiry date is long overdue. However, when people are hungry they eat cans of corn that should not be used after November 1993. Most cans are marked "kosher for Pesah." On empty stomachs, children, women, and the elderly stand for three days along the roads awaiting the arrival of the Palestinian police. They want to see with their eyes and touch with their hands the Palestinian weapons. Against this backdrop, clashes erupt between them and the soldiers guarding the roads. These are truly the hardest hours of the end. The soldiers also stand in the blazing sun for hours, they are also thirsty, and they also want to see how all this ends. So, the joy of getting out is accompanied by the music of rubber bullets, the smell of tear gas, and a bitterness which will turn into sweeping elation as soon as the first Blazer van donated by the Americans arrives. The Car Licensing Bureau is crowded. Ten meters away, in the police station, some 20 Israeli policemen are locked behind the fences, waiting for the transfer of powers. But, in the Car Licensing Bureau it is business as usual. Earlier in the week there was a clash with soldiers. To settle the dispute, Palestinian policemen were summoned. Their uniforms are blue, exactly as those of the Israelis, but without a flak jacket; they do not yet bear arms, only a tag with the word "police" in Arabic on their sleeves. In the meantime, this will do as a source of authority. What will happen in the future in the Car Licensing Bureau? "Nothing," says a local driver waiting to renew his driving license. "All the testers are Palestinian, our own men. Therefore, all the hustlers will go on with their business. For 100 shekels they will make your car pass its annual test, even if you don't own a car. Just like in your bureau, in Holon." Until the previous closure, Nabil worked in Israel as "a professional meat griller." He had no permit to enter Israel because of trouble with the income tax authorities. He used to own a sewing workshop in Gaza. The income tax authorities asked him to pay 60,000 shekels, but they failed to reach an agreement. He managed. He registered the property in his mother's name, and the owner of the grilled meat joint snuck him into Israel without a magnetic card. After the closure this became more dangerous. So, he bought himself an old Peugeot and went into partnership with another guy in a taxi company. The current media interest in Gaza earns him a good living, and his business is flourishing. There are local Gazans who would rather hire a taxi than drag all the way to Palestine Square. He dreams that once the Israeli authorities get out perhaps he will finally be allowed to install a radio in his taxi, just like in Israel. So far this has been forbidden for security reasons. Your income tax authorities will tear you to pieces, I say to him. Nabil is not worried. He is confident they will reach an agreement. I am even prepared to pay 5,000 shekels and close the case, he says. Last Tuesday he was worried about what would happen the next day if Israel Electric Corporation made good on its threat to cut off power due to Gaza's outstanding debt. Our neighborhood had no electricity for almost a month. No problem. Now that there is no curfew, we can unplug the refrigerator and buy fresh produce every day. The problem is with the television. We cannot go through the day without the news. He will apparently use the battery in his car. A Bedouin family in Rimal is busy building a fence around their house. They ran away from Beersheba in 1948. Some of their relatives still live in Tel Sheva'. In Rimal they are a clan of several dozen. Now they are worried. Land in Rimal is expensive, and the Palestinian authorities may now demand they evacuate the area because they built on "state land." The best is to hoard weapons and be ready for what lies in store. "We are from Bet Dagan. My grandfather had a large orange orchard there, which still exists. When I was 12, our entire family in Gaza went on a trip to Israel. We also went to my grandfather's orchard in Bet Dagan. To this day, my mother talks about that orchard. When they escaped to Gaza in 1948 they had a lot of money. My mother told my father: Let's buy a plot of land here, let's build a home. But my father told her: What for? We will be back in Bet Dagan in a week. "I worked in a grilled meat joint in Holon. Every summer I would go to the orchard in Bet Dagan, steal a few oranges, take them to my mother in Gaza, and tell her: These are from grandpa's orchard." I ask him: "So what, do you dream of going back to Bet Dagan?" He replies: "My mother does. I no longer do, there is no chance. But we have at home Turkish papers of our deed on the orchard. Now I take very good care of them. In another three years they will start talking about the right of return. Perhaps they will talk with us about compensation." Within a few days -- they have been talking about "a few days" for a long time now -- 'Arafat must present the list of the 24 members of the autonomy council. These will make up the government of Gaza and Jericho, and if it works out, they will also get powers over the rest of the West Bank. Then, according to plans, there will be elections. The elections were scheduled to be held in July, when the talk was that Israel would hand over Gaza in December. December went by, so will July, and nobody believes elections will be held before December '94, and 'Arafat has not yet finished compiling the list. "That's how 'Arafat works," a local political activist says. "You are only now getting to know him. But we know that 'Arafat will issue the list at the 11th hour, and even that will not be the final list. He has one list in his left pocket and another in his right pocket; one in his attache case, another in the drawer, three others in the closet, and 200 men are walking around the territories, each one of them with a list 'Arafat sent him by fax, and all the lists are hot air." Ilyas Frayj from Bethlehem agreed to be included in the list. So did Dr. Zakariya al-Agha from Gaza. 'Arafat wants them in because he is sure of their allegiance. Dr. Furayh Abu-Middayn also acceded. He is more acceptable to the locals. "In the end we will give him the same job like that woman you have, the one with the teased hairdo, Miryam Ben-Porat." "We will take a look at the list and decide accordingly," journalist Tawfiq Abu-Husa, a Fatah leader in the Gaza Strip says. "If it looks good to us, we will work with them. If not, we will tell 'Arafat: With all due respect, you are the president, you compile the lists, but tell us one thing: When will the elections be held?" In the meantime, local leaders resort to tactics. Dr. Hanan 'Ashrawi is out of the picture. Sa'ib 'Urayqat decided now, of all times, to go to London to collect material about a future election. 'Arafat should get the hint. Faysal al-Husayni protests. People in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip are busy building the infrastructure for political parties. Fatah is becoming a party. PFLP [Palestinian Front for the Liberation of Palestine] and DFLP [Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine] activists are launching propaganda campaigns criticizing the agreement. Everything is politics. Fatah men take the newly-arrived generals to visit the refugee camps. "They are completely detached from the reality in the field," one activist says, "and it is very important that they know what the people think so that we do not reach a situation where they, our own police, are perceived as foreign rulers, just as the Israelis. General Ziyad al-Atrash, the former commander of the Palestinian force in Algiers, is already visiting the camps, talking to people, and feeling great among them. There are others who have not yet managed to make contact. They will have a problem." In the midst of all this, some people are making their electoral calculations. Some 7,000 Palestinian policemen, along with their families, will be arriving from the Arab countries. A cautious estimate puts their total number at 50,000. According to another cautious estimate, about half of them are eligible voters. This is significant. People in Nabulus, Ramallah, and Janin are closely watching what is and what will be happening in Gaza. They are the next in line. Apparently, the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] also understands that. The whole way from Petah Tiqva to Nabulus I did not see even one IDF patrol on the road. Author David Grossman's book "The Yellow Wind" has turned into the "yellow line." A yellow line crosses the length of Nabulus so that a settler from Elon More should not, God forbid, make a wrong turn in the road. I did not see even one car with yellow license plates [Israeli-owned] on the road. Driving through Nabulus' main street, people looked at my Israeli vehicle with astonishment. Who is that nut? "What troubles me," a Gush Emunim settler told me, "is that what Rabin said about the IDF being primarily committed to protect the inhabitants within the Green Line is slowly sinking in. The IDF sees to Ethiopians who come from Gundar, and to us it doesn't? Just like everybody else, I am sure that terror attacks here will now increase. So, to cover his ass the chief of staff says he expects this. But what about practical measures? I want the IDF to obligate us to drive in convoys escorted by security guards to ensure our safety." "But then you will say that the IDF restricts your movements," I tell him. "Whoever wants to say that, let him. However, this is what the IDF must do; it must understand that it is also responsible for our security." Jericho is said to have been one of the calmest spots during the intifadah. Anybody driving through Jericho understands why: water, greenery, the climate. Those who own land, deal with the land and not with firebombs. Hardly any incident was registered in 'Ayn al-Bayda', halfway between Tubas and Nabulus, during the intifadah. It is a beautiful spot. Streams flow by the road, there is a lot of greenery, and a developed industry of carpets made of the abundant reeds growing in the area. Plastic chairs can be seen on every roof; a sign that people sit in the terrace in the evenings, breathing fresh air, and relaxing. Usually, in such places there are not many PLO flags. In local joints, 'Arafat's picture hangs next to the popular poster of the crying child. "Allah willing," says Ahmad Tubasi, "soon we will also have autonomy." What do you mean by soon? He replies: Elections, a state, whatever. He has never been and may never be in Gaza. He will soon go visit Jericho, and so probably will other people from Ramallah and Nabulus, "to see what a Palestinian state is. In the meantime, we have our home, our fields. If there is no state, we will also manage; we will go visit the state." The Jericho bypass road is another story. A narrow and bumpy road which prolongs the way to Jerusalem by another 15 minutes. You fantasize about lunch in some garden restaurant in the city, but have to make do with a hot dog and mustard in a roadside diner. All traffic has been diverted to the Jericho bypass for a week now. There is no access to Jerusalem until the Palestinians are done taking over. On Monday, singer Ari'el Zilber will perform at the diner. Perhaps he will cheer up the residents of Ma'ale Efrayim and Patza'el. About 50 reservists were lying on the lawn outside the diner this week. They did not feel like going anywhere. "Come on guys," the officer exhorted them, "get going." "Come off it," the unit's clown answered, "it is a pity we did not leave them the gasoline too." Then I see a long and endless row of dozens of jeeps by the roadside. Carrying only the radio equipment, the soldiers are on their way to their base near Jerusalem. The Jericho exodus. Passage to and from Jericho has been blocked for a week. Locals crowd the square waiting for the arrival of the police. The media and other foreigners wait outside. Assertive border policemen prohibit the entry. Journalists covering the territories threaten to appeal to the High Court of Justice. As far as the IDF is concerned, they can go on threatening. Who is allowed to enter Jericho? Locals, inhabitants of the territories, and tourists. If the tourists have an Israeli driver with the proper papers, they will be allowed in. Israeli Arabs will not. So, why does the car with yellow license plates ahead of me enter? These are Arabs from East Jerusalem, the border policeman tells me, they own houses in Jericho. If people do not see this as a sign of what is yet to come -- the question of Jerusalem, who will vote and who will be elected in the territories -- then they know nothing about signs. The American Colony Hotel is still the base of the foreign media in the territories. There I meet Ziyad Abu-Ziyad, a Palestinian representative to the talks with Israel. Abu-Ziyad does not want an official job, but he pulls strings and walks around with a cellular phone. He can dial 'Arafat whenever he wants, and get an answer. He, just like me, does not believe the interim arrangement in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank will last long. "The Gaza-Jericho agreement should be allowed to work for a short time, but the question of the settlements will come up immediately afterward. The settlements are connected with everything. Do they want us to take over health affairs in the West Bank? The question of the settlements contaminating the environment with their sewage water will immediately come up. Do they want us to take over education? There are places in the territories where the Army forces schools to open at 0700 so that there are no children on the roads when the settlers drive to work. If they want to talk with us about elections, according to the agreement the IDF must withdraw its troops from populated areas. How can it do that when it must also guard the access roads to the settlements? In my opinion, the whole process will be accelerated." "Not everything is up to 'Arafat," a local Gazan activist tells me. "Our goal now is to show that what we are talking about here is a state. You may say whatever you want, but we will do what we understand. 'Arafat may also say whatever he wants, but he should bear in mind that in the last seven years we got used to rebelling. Nobody will force us to do something we do not agree to."
