Their leaders met at the headquarters of the National Independence party. They said the movement was formed to counter "all attempts to introduce a Russian or Commonwealth army contingent in Azerbaijan." The movement is to work to protect democracy and Azerbaijan's sovereignty and insure the return of the Armenian-occupied Azeri territories, the restoration of the republic's territorial integrity and the inviolability of the national frontiers. According to preliminary reports, the national resistance movement is planning to hold a rally on May 21 to protest the possible introduction of Russian or Commonwealth peacekeepers in Azerbaijan. A peacekeeping contingent can be introduced in Azerbaijan under a protocol that was discussed, under Russian mediation, by the Armenian and Azeri Defense Ministers and the commander of the Karabakh defense forces earlier this week. The Azeri minister refused to sign the protocol. The Azeri leaders link its signing to the conclusion of a comprehensive political agreement on Nagorni Karabakh. In their view, the captured territories must be returned to Azerbaijan, the refugees must be repatriated and moves must be made to revive the Karabakh economy.
