FR940303-1-00018 FR940303-1-00003 There are two especially important provisions that should be addressed. First, §9&hyph;13.240 prohibits a government attorney from communicating with a person known to be represented by counsel who the government attorney knows is a target of a federal criminal or civil enforcement investigation. The Manual provides several exceptions to this general prohibition, including the following: When the communication is initiated by the target; when the communication occurs at the time of arrest and the represented person has waived his or her Constitutional rights; when the government attorney believes the contact is necessary to protect against a risk to human life or safety; or when a senior Department official determines that exigent circumstances exist, making the communication necessary for effective law enforcement. In addition, §9&hyph;13.220 provides an exception to the general prohibition if the communication is made in the course of an undercover investigation. ``Target'' is defined as a ``person as to whom the attorney for the government has substantial evidence linking that person to the commission of a crime or to other wrongful conduct and as to whom the attorney for the government anticipates seeking an indictment or naming as a defendant in a civil law enforcement proceeding.'' Because an individual who is a target of a federal investigation is typically in a clearly adversarial relationship with the federal government, the Department believes that the principles underlying DR 7&hyph;104 and Rule 4.2 are implicated and an extension of the prohibition contained in the rule is appropriate. In its enforcement of this provision, the Department intends to give substantial deference to a federal attorney's good faith judgment regarding the likelihood that a particular person will ultimately become a defendant. Even if the attorney for the government believes that an individual will probably be named as a defendant, that individual is not considered a target until the government has actually obtained substantial evidence linking that individual to the commission of a crime or to unlawful conduct. The government attorney's uncorroborated belief that an individual will ultimately be named as a defendant is not enough. Thus, an individual is not considered a target under this rule until both the attorney for the government believes that he or she will probably be named as a defendant and substantial evidence has been obtained. The second provision that should be noted is the approval procedure provided in §9&hyph;13.250. Under that provision, before an attorney for the government communicates with any represented party or target, the government attorney should obtain the approval of the United States Attorney if the attorney is an Assistant United States Attorney, or the approval of another appropriate supervisor. The provision also permits contacts when prior approval is not feasible, and requires post-contact documentation. Additions to the United States Attorneys' Manual The entire text of the planned additions to the Manual follows: The following new section is added to title 9, chapter 13. 9&hyph;13.200␣Communications With Represented Persons 9&hyph;13.210␣Generally 28 CFR part 77 generally governs communications with represented persons in law enforcement investigations and proceedings. This section sets forth several additional departmental policies and procedures with regard to such communications. Department of Justice attorneys should recognize that communications with represented persons at any stage may present the potential for undue interference with attorney-client relationships and should undertake any such communications with great circumspection and care. This Department as a matter of policy will respect bona fide attorney-client relationships whenever possible, consistent with our law enforcement responsibilities and duties. The rules set forth in 28 CFR part 77 are intended, among other things, to clarify the circumstances under which government attorneys may communicate with represented persons. They are not intended to create any presumption that communications are necessary or advisable in the course of any particular investigation or proceeding. Whether such a communication is appropriate in a particular situation is to be determined by the government attorney (and, when appropriate, his or her supervisors) in the exercise of his or her discretion, based on the specific circumstances of the individual case. Furthermore, the application of this section, like the application of 28 CFR part 77, is limited to communications between Department of Justice attorneys and persons known to be represented by counsel during criminal investigations and proceedings or civil law enforcement investigations and proceedings. These provisions do not apply to Department attorneys engaged in civil suits in which the United States is not acting under its police or regulatory powers. Thus, state bar rules and not these provisions will generally apply in civil suits when the government is a defendant or a claimant. Attorneys for the government are strongly encouraged to consult with appropriate officials in the Department of Justice when the application or interpretation of 28 CFR part 77 may be doubtful or uncertain. The primary points of contact at the Department of Justice on questions regarding 28 CFR part 77 and this section are the Assistant Attorneys General of the Criminal and Civil Divisions, or their designees. 9&hyph;13.220␣Communications During Investigative Stage Section 77.7 of title 28, Code of Federal Regulations, generally permits communications with represented persons outside the presence of counsel that are intended to obtain factual information in the course of criminal or civil law enforcement investigations before the person is a defendant or is arrested in a federal criminal case, or is a defendant in a federal civil enforcement proceeding. Such communications must, however, have a valid investigative purpose and comply with the procedures and considerations set forth below.
