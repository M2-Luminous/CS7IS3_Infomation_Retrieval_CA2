However, the thrust of his pronouncements was to explain away what has been widely seen in Pakistan as a `tilt towards India' in Iran's foreign relations. Ever since the Iranians changed their mind at the eleventh hour in Geneva and expressed inability to vote for Pakistan's resolution on human rights abuses in occupied Kashmir, albeit they were said to have brokered a face-saving compromise, opinion leaders in Pakistan have been trying to comprehend the implications of the odd phenomenon. And, notwithstanding Islamabad's endeavour to play down the Iranian dissidence, there have been apprehensions that a strategic shift in Iran's perception of regional alignments may well be on the anvil. The Iranian speaker has been candid enough to acknowledge that relations with India have assumed a special significance for his country. "We cannot ignore the Muslims living in India," he said. Whether or not his alibi for a drift towards closer cooperation with India was convincing, Hojjat ol-Eslam Nuri did not mince words to put across the message that the Iranians did not share Pakistan's perception of India's role in the region, and were willing to take initiatives which may be deemed as pro India by Pakistanis at large. Though he was eager to underscore that Iran's relations with other countries, particularly India, will not affect friendship with Pakistan, the new-born pragmatism in Iran's outlook on friendship and alliances calls for a review of Islamabad's foreign policy agenda. Given the fraternal bonds of religion and culture and the geopolitical compulsions, Iran is not likely to dump Pakistan for the sake of securing a regional arrangement with India, but what needs to be accepted as a fait accompli is the signal that Iran will not necessarily go along with Pakistan on issues of discord in the region. The overriding concern in Tehran appears to be to break its international isolation and play a significant role in regional politics. The offer to mediate on Kashmir is a veritable indication of Tehran's urge to play the honest broker in regional disputes and acquire a measure of leverage in power politics. Thus, Islamabad will have to reckon with Tehran's growing quest for self-assertion and its agenda thereof for seeking new power alignments.
