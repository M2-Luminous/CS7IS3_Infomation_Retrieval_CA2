(MHI) will join with the diversified Candian firm Bombadier (located in Montreal) to develop the "Global Express," a long-distance business jet (see diagram showing the jet from three sides [diagram not included]) that will be able to fly from Tokyo to New York without landing en route. MHI will underwrite an estimated 10 percent of total development expenses, which will apparently be ¥20 to 40 billion, and will undertake the production of the main wing and the mid-section of the plane's fuselage. The Global Express will make its first flight in the latter half of 1996. MHI had worked on the twin-engine business plane "MU300" but was not successful, and transferred production and sales rights to Beech Aircraft of the United States in 1988; thus, the Global Express marks MHI's reentry into business planes after an absense of five years. This is the first time that a Japanese manufacturer has teamed up with a foreign manufacturer to undertake joint international development in the business-plane field. This time, however, "participation in the Bombadier venture" seems close to becoming a reality. The Global Express will have a wingspan of 28 meters and will measure about 30 meters in length. In the cabin are eight seats made to executive specifications. The plane will mount two BR710 jet engines being jointly developed by Rolls Royce of the UK and BMW of Germany. Takeoff weight will be around 40 tons and the plane can transport about 20 people if all seats are installed, so it would seem that the aircraft can be used for such purposes as regular flights to remote areas. The plane is expected to be priced at ¥2-3 billion. The Global Express greatly exceeds the common perception of a business jet: its most outstanding characteristic is its range of 6,500 nautical miles (about 12,000 kilometers) with a crusing speed in the vicinity of Mach 0.85. It can fly without stopping between Chicago and Taipei, Los Angeles and Sydney, and New York and Tokyo -- trans-Pacific routes on which demand for passenger planes have been increasing. The Global Express is expected to be utilized by executives of transnational corporations and VIP's of various foreign governments. U.S. and European manufacturers are prominent in the long-range, high-class business jet field, but only the United States' Gulfstream Corporation currently has specific development plans for such an aircraft. The word is that Bombadier envisions Global Express sales in the three figures and has expressed self-confidence regarding demand prospects for the plane. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries' Nagoya Aerospace Systems Plant will be in charge of the design, manufacture, and support of the Global Express's main wings and central fuselage section. How much will be invested had not been made public. Bombadier has experienced rapid growth beginning with products such as railroad cars, small engines, and snowmobiles; it has a yearly turnover of about ¥400 billion. Beginning in the latter half of the 1980's, Bombadier bought up the U.S. business jet manufacturer Learjet as well as Canada de Haviland, a small passenger jet manufacturer under the aegis of the United States' Boeing. Currently about two-thirds are accounted for by the civil aviation and defense sectors, such as by Canadair. This year Canadair's announcement of the 7,000 kilometer range "604" in addition to the large business jet "Challenger" became topics of discussion at the 1993 Paris Air Show.
