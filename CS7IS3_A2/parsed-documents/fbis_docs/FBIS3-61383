An INFOTAG agency correspondent conducted a brief interview with him. [INFOTAG] Mr. Birshteyn, how do you see the current situation in Moldova? [Birshteyn] In my opinion, as compared to neighboring states the situation in the republic today is healthy. Healthy in the sense that all three branches of power have found a very sensible compromise. This leads me to the conclusion that Moldova is going the right way. [INFOTAG] The opposition would disagree with you. [Birshteyn] The existence of an opposition is a normal phenomenon inherent in any civilized state. Everybody has a right to his own opinion. Some political forces believe that Moldova should unite with Romania; others--with the CIS; and still others see it as an independent state. [INFOTAG] Which one of the three options is more realistic? [Birshteyn] What is realistic is that in the final analysis the people choose their own way. My opinion is this. Since Moldova has gained independence, it should be preserved. I know many examples of countries fighting for their independence. But I cannot remember a single reverse example of a country looking for a way out of independence. [INFOTAG] Why do you think this is happening? [Birshteyn] I think that the roots of this phenomenon are in the current difficult economic situation. But if we look today at Moldova, which is in a deep economic crisis, and compare it with neighboring states, I am optimistic. For instance, the Ukrainian leadership today is facing a much heavier burden of problems than the Moldovan authorities. [INFOTAG] This does not make it easier for the people. [Birshteyn] The population must realize that it is impossible to build a new healthy economy without having lived through the current difficulties. Moldova has an absolutely realistic opportunity to become, shall we say, in about five years a pearl in the center of Europe. The Seabeco Group has an interest in working in Moldova. As a human being, I like this land and the people living here. I think that the company has already demonstrated in practice that we did not come here to grab something--we came here to help. [INFOTAG] What about business interests? [Birshteyn] We are not hiding the fact that in time we count on making money here. I want to point out that I am not in the position of a businessman looking for quick profits. I am in no hurry because I understand that any serious business begins with investing money. [INFOTAG] There is a lot of controversial information in Moldova regarding Birshteyn's "mission" in stopping the bloodshed in Bendery. What really happened? [Birshteyn] My role was quite modest. I simply brought together all those people who were in a position to adopt a sensible decision. [INFOTAG] Tell us your secret: What projects is the Seabeco Group working on in Moldova these days? [Birshteyn] There are several projects in the works that we hope to implement in the republic. All involve agriculture... [INFOTAG] And to be more specific... [Birshteyn] These are projects involving complete-cycle production facilities that will make ready-to-use products instead of selling raw materials. It is profitable both for the state and the producer to sell the finished product. My opinion is that it would be wrong to shift production into nontraditional spheres. Agriculture is a traditional business for Moldova. This is what we need to develop. [INFOTAG] Your company has ceased working in Kyrgyzstan. Why? [Birshteyn] I am flabbergasted over people's lack of integrity when I hear my name "trashed around" in the Kyrgyz parliament. This is all dirty intrigues and dirty politics... [INFOTAG] What about the gold reserves? Is it true that they have been taken out of Kyrgyzstan? [Birshteyn] We have not taken anything out of Kyrgyzstan. On the contrary, we have invested a lot of money and effort. Logic says that people should be grateful to us. Alas. History puts everything in its proper place, however. By such, if I may call them "actions," Kyrgyz politicians are making a reputation for themselves. Instead of creating conditions to attract foreign investment, some current politicians in Bishkek are choosing the option of going around the world begging. This is not a solution. [INFOTAG] By the way, speaking about conditions--how are they in Moldova, in your opinion? [Birshteyn] Moldova is creating precisely these conditions. I do not want to say that there are no difficulties for foreign businessmen here. They do exist, and unfortunately quite a few. But it also is absolutely clear that in the end, when searching for a solution to any problem, no matter how complex, we will find mutual understanding. [INFOTAG] From the point of view of a businessman, which economic sectors in Moldova deserve major financial infusion? [Birshteyn] In my opinion, the potentially promising sectors in the republic would be agriculture, light industry, and tourism. Moldova is a very beautiful corner of the world; provided a certain infrastructure is in place, it could become attractive for many categories of tourists. [INFOTAG] On 29 November the republic introduced its own national currency--the Moldovan leu. Since that time the foreign currency exchange has been registering a small but steady decline in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar in relation to the leu. In your opinion, is this a real or an artificially created phenomenon? [Birshteyn] Unfortunately, I am not familiar with the real situation in this area. But I want to say that introducing a national currency is a competent step, and most importantly, timely. A monetary unit is one of the attributes of statehood. With respect to the decline of the U.S. dollar rate in relation to the leu, my guess is that the National Bank probably has a stabilization fund. I think that we should not get euphoric on the subject of the declining exchange rate of the American currency. Although of course it is necessary to strive for stability of the leu. Even though it will not be easy to maintain the rate. [INFOTAG] In your opinion, should political forces in Moldova learn a lesson from the election results in Russia? [Birshteyn] I think there is not much of a lesson for political parties in Moldova to be learned from the results of the elections to the State Duma of Russia. Why? The situation in Chisinau is completely different. I think there will be no surprises at the elections to the new parliament. I am certain that the winners in the elections will be logic and common sense.
