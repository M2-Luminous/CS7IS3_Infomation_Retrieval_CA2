The government of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata held a tax reform forum Monday to hear views from representatives of business and consumer groups. The representatives asked the government to continue income tax cuts in fiscal 1995 and beyond. They were divided on a possible increase in consumption tax from the present 3 percent, but joined hands in calling on the government to carry out administrative and fiscal reforms over resistance from bureaucrats. Business representatives told the session an increase in consumption tax will be unavoidable to generate funds to make up for revenue shortfalls resulting from income tax cuts and to cope with the aging society. Masae Wada, representative of the Japan Housewives Association, expressed opposition to a consumption tax increase, calling for a correction in the unfair tax system. A labor representative called for a revision of consumption tax to transfer part of the revenue to local governments.
