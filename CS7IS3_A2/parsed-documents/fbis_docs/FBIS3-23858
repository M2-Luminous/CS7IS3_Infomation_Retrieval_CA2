According to the most approximate estimates of specialists, it is several tens of thousands. In proportion to the total number of population of Moscow, this figure is considerably higher than in most other major Russian cities. An important transportation junction and the center of a metropolitan area, the capital has always attracted those for whom the song line "my address is not a house and not a street" has become a harsh reality of life rather than a romantic phrase. One could get an indirect idea of the number of Moscow homeless from information on how many of them are brought annually to the only holding facility in the city, on Novoslobodskaya Street. For almost five years now this number has not dropped below 1,300. This is determined, however, not at all by the number of Moscow homeless but first and foremost by the capacity of the holding facility itself, which is precisely this figure. An ordinary Moscow citizen, however, can draw only one conclusion from his own observations: the number of beggars and homeless on Moscow streets and underground crossings is growing steadily from year to year. It is especially noticeable in the winter. In the summer, free to move away from central heating pipes and unlocked basements, the inhabitants of the capital city's foul places fan out to Russian nooks and crannies, only to return a few months later, in somewhat better shape, to the capital for the winter. In that same Moscow holding facility out-of-towners--a questionable definition as applied to the homeless--account for 72 percent of its clients. The state that once proclaimed the slogan "Everything in the name of the people, everything for the good of the people" has now found itself unable to pay even minimal attention to vagrants. In 1991 Russia repealed the article in the criminal code that stipulated a penalty for vagrancy and begging. A democratic measure at first glance--each person is free to live the lifestyle he desires--in reality it only worsened the situation. Having stopped persecuting those who by all laws of humanity need support rather than punishment, it has not offered anything instead. A system of aid to those who have hit the social bottom was never set up, and thousands of people who found themselves not only below the poverty line but also outside of normal human existence were now completely left to their own devices. Left unattended, the illness progressed rapidly, however, and in the end it became impossible to ignore it any longer. The first to sound the alarm were Moscow health care practitioners. Thousands of homeless that flooded the streets dramatically exacerbated the health and hygiene situation in the capital and became walking carriers of the most dangerous diseases. The first case of cholera in Moscow in many years, in which the disease turned out to be caused by local sources rather than brought in from other regions, was diagnosed last year in a homeless man. Research shows that each Moscow vagrant carries a bouquet of five or six diseases. Almost 100 percent of homeless suffer from pediculosis, or, to put it plainly, infestation with lice. The same goes for tuberculosis. As early as the middle of 1992 a calculation was presented to the collegium of Russia's Ministry of Health Care, according to which an estimated 40,000 homeless with an open form of tuberculosis were roaming the country. The number of homeless in the country certainly has not declined since then, and, in the opinion of physicians, this was the main factor contributing to the fact that the curve of incidence of tuberculosis in the country has headed sharply upward. Finally, the problem that had already become a plague of big cities was noticed at the top. On 2 November 1993, Edict of the President of Russia No. 1815 "On Measures of Prevention of Vagrancy and Begging" was issued; a month later it was duplicated by a Moscow Government decree of the same name. These documents could have come out much earlier, but the fathers of the nation, busy with important state affairs, fly on airplanes and almost never happen to pass through a railway station, and one cannot really see from the window of a government limousine the horror that is taking place today in underground crossings and around subway stations. However, whether even these belated directives will be carried out is unclear. According to the Government of Moscow decree, two branches of the holding facility, each with the capacity to accommodate 80-100 persons, are to be opened in Moscow before 1 March 1994. Despite the fact that the deadline is approaching, however, the addresses of the new institutions that are supposed to open their doors to the Moscow homeless are still not known, and facilities have not been allocated for them. Not everything has been worked out regarding the creation of a system of social support for the current inhabitants of the streets either. The president's decree envisages the function of the militia being limited to identifying, detaining, and bringing those engaged in vagrancy and begging to centers of social rehabilitation. There are no such centers as yet, and it is envisaged setting them up on the basis of the same holding facilities. The latter circumstance causes the greatest doubts among MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] specialists: it is unlikely that social protection service workers, who are predominantly female and will replace militiamen, will be able to handle easily the rather disagreeable population of the holding facility. Especially considering that most current homeless carry the luggage of an extensive criminal past. Among those who passed through the Moscow holding facility in 1993, 66.4 percent had prior convictions, and among men this indicator came close to the 100-percent mark. In addition, a check showed that 108 persons, that is one in 13, were fugitives, with criminal cases against them still open. There is, however, a grain of utility in bringing social services to work with the homeless. Because the problem of people who have found themselves outside regular society is first and foremost a social one, and the militia alone cannot solve it. Holding facility workers who sent their wards for job placement have more than once picked them up time and again in the slums. It is hard for a person who has been a vagrant for many years to start a new life from scratch, and many deliberately choose the street again. But even for those who want to get back to normal life, this is very difficult to accomplish: one can fall out of it almost without noticing, but it is practically impossible to get back. The banal phrase that socioeconomic crisis always is accompanied by impoverishment of the popular masses no longer sounds banal when real human faces fill the background behind the dry figures of declining production and gross national product. And once again, like 100 years ago, today's outcasts are digging into trash heaps, collecting alms in chewed-up caps, drinking moonshine, and sleeping on street cobblestones. Homeless Russia, the Russia of slums and gateways, of trash containers and people dying at rail stations, has already become the mirror of the Russia of limousines, casinos, and gold Rolexes. Both were born in front of our very eyes. But which one should we call the new Russia?
