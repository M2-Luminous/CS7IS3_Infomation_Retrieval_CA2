In a cable in the name of the Senate to the president of the U.S. Senate, Senate President Ahmad al-Lawzi expressed hope that this step will be followed by other steps until the embargo is lifted and this peace-loving nation can acquire the means for legitimate self-defense and the liberation of their national soil, against an all-out war of annihilation in which atrocities are committed under the gaze of the civilized world. Al-Lawzi stressed that if the United States plays its leading role in deterring aggression and preventing it from making any regional gains, it will restore confidence in the world order and international law and the UN Charter. This will spare the world and future generations wars and disasters motivated by racial and religious bias and the oppression of the weak by the strong.
