FR940504-2-00048 FR940504-2-00044 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Meeting The National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), announces the following meeting. Name: Poverty-Associated Mental Retardation (PAMR) Prevention Technical Assistance Workshop for Planning Grant Recipients. Time and Date: 8:30 a.m.&hyph;4:30 p.m., May 10, 1994. Place: Swissotel Atlanta, 3391 Peachtree Road, NE., Atlanta, Georgia 30326. Status: Open to the public; limited only by the space available. Purpose: The primary purpose of this workshop is to provide technical assistance to recipients of CDC grants as they plan programs to prevent PAMR. The workshop is not designed to provide general information on mental retardation or on prevention of PAMR. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The workshop will convent a group of recipients of CDC PAMR Planning Grants. Seven of every 1,000 ten-year old children suffer from mild mental retardation, and three of every 1,000 suffer from more serious mental retardation. Poor children, especially those whose mothers have less than a high school education, are at risk of cognitive delay of as much as one standard deviation of IQ (15 points) at age three. Studies such as the Infant Health and Development Program and the Carolina Abecedarian Project have proven that an intensive early health and development intervention can prevent or reduce as much as two-thirds of PAMR. CDC is actively involved in research and planning to help States develop a community-based program to prevent PAMR. CONTACT PERSON FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: Edward A.
