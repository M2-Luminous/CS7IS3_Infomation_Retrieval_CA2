Schnehage] [Text] Johannesburg March 17 SAPA -- President F. W. de Klerk said he was working on an "Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] initiative" which might signify a breakthrough in the constitutional deadlock and the IFP's non-participation in the April election. Mr de Klerk did not elaborate on what the initiative entailed, but said it raised a "slight hope", adding the negotiation remains the responsible route. The IFP missed the final deadline to submit its candidates list on Wednesday [16 March]. Mr de Klerk made these remarks at a breakfast meeting on the second of election tour through the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region. Mr de Klerk told businessmen attending the breakfast that the IFP's abstenance was a "dark cloud", but there was "a crack of light ahead". He assured his audience that they had nothing to fear under a new dispensation. Mr de Klerk commended the issuing of a pamhlet in kwaZulu, which assured kwaZulu government employees the non-participation of the IFP would not affect their "career or pension security". He said kwaZulu government employees would become part of the integration process, when the civil service of the kwaZulu/Natal province is structured.
