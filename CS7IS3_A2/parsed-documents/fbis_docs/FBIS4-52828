FBIS4-52828 "dreas094__a94001" FBIS-EAS-94-094-A Daily Report 13 May 1994 ANNEX Japan G-7 Reaches `Secret' Accord To Protect Dollar G-7 Reaches `Secret' Accord To Protect Dollar OW1305190894 Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 13 May 94 Morning Edition p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1305190894 Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] An international monetary source on 12 May disclosed that the financial and monetary authorities of Japan, the United States, and European nations are basing their actions in coordinating policies on interest rates and intervention in currency markets on a secret agreement made at a meeting of finance ministers and presidents of central banks of the seven industrialized nations (G-7) on 24 April. The source said that the G-7 nations, with the strong U.S. request in mind, agreed that to prevent confusion in the world monetary and securities markets caused by a possible slump in the dollar, it is necessary to keep the dollar's international value from sliding. It is unprecedented in recent years for the G-7 to take coordinated action on currency markets and interest rates, and in the meeting, the G-7 nations confirmed their intention to tighten their unity to promote the stabilization and growth of the world economy. Concerning currency markets, they agreed to intermittently intervene in currency markets to buy the dollar and sell the yen so that the dollar's exchange rate against the yen will not break 100 yen. On interest rates, the G-7 agreed that European nations--including Germany, which is required to lower interest rates--will cut interest rates; that Japan, whose official discount rate is the lowest it has ever been, will induce financial organs to lower short-term interest rates; and that the United States will allay concerns about possible inflation by inducing lower interest rates and cutting the discount rate and apply the breaks to an upward tendency in long-tern interest rates. In this way, the current monetary policies of Japan, the United States, and European nations reflect the agreement explained above, and there is a growing view that the G-7 states have tided over the dollar crisis for the time being. On 24 April, a chairman's statement was issued, although it was not issued at the past two meetings of G-7 finance ministers. The source said that the release of the statement reflects the G-7's positions. At the G-7 meeting of finance ministers in April, discussions focused on the fact that the exchange rate of the dollar is falling not only against the yen but also against European currencies such as the German mark. The source said that at the meeting, finance ministers and presidents of central banks expressed strong concern about the downward trend of the dollar's exchange rate because there is a possibility that if this trend should develop into a slump in the value of the dollar, this will lead to a worldwide drop in stock prices, thus having a harmful impact on the overall world economy.
