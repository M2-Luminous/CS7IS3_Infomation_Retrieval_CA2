During the first session of the Fourth Ibero-American Summit of heads of state and government, De Leon Carpio said that "there is a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel" and that despite the difficulty of the negotiations the Guatemalan Government is determined to fulfill its moral commitment. "On 29 March we signed a negotiations agreement-schedule, which underscores such points as the cease-fire in September and the demobilization of the guerrillas in December and which confirms that the signing of peace in 1994 is irreversible," De Leon Carpio said. The Guatemalan president told the leaders of 21 countries, including the Dominican vice president, that he hopes to be remembered as the president whose administration established "total respect for the law and the conviction that that is the best attitude." "We have made considerable progress by signing the general agreement on human rights and immediate international verification," the president added. The Guatemalan president pointed out that "with the end of the 30-year-old internal armed confrontation -- the leading source of human rights violations -- we will achieve total respect for life and individual guarantees." After urging Ibero-America to allow the opening of markets and the elimination of protectionist barriers, De Leon Carpio said: "We can set the example by trading among ourselves and later requesting similar conditions from the rest of the international community." According to the Guatemalan president, Central America is attempting to reduce its huge social disparities, improve its peoples' standard of living through democratic consolidation and productive transformations, and increase its participation in worldwide trade.
