Of course, it should combine the best features that every nation has. We will be able to get out of the current crisis provided we observe this condition. Our national policy naturally envisages protection of rights of all the peoples [words indistinct] of Kyrgyzstan. I believe that this is the guarantee for our future, peace, calm, and accord. [Correspondent] We are implementing the policy of market reforms in our country and life has become exceptionally difficult for our people. There are lots of cases when people haven't been paid their salaries, students their scholarships, children's allowances haven't be granted in time as well as pensions. People complain about that. It worries them. What can you say about that? [Akayev] We are implementing market reforms in our country and unfortunately they are not proceeding as they should. Indeed, life is becoming more difficult. We should carry out a socially oriented policy and support our less well off sections of society.If pensions, wages and scholarships have been paid in time this would have partly solved their problems. Therefore, we have set up a state commission under the president of our republic with the aim of supervising the issue of timely payment of them. It should exercise control over a timely payment of salaries, stipends and pensions and it will work for as long as needed. [sentence indistinct] [Correspondent] Can you tell us few words about our foreign policy? [Akayev] We have been recognized and established contacts with many democratic countries of the world [words indistinct]. If we speak about our priorities, our first priority is to have historically friendly relations with such countries as Russia, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan. This is our main priority. Apart from this, with the introduction of economic reforms and democratic transformations, we have established good relations with the United States, Japan, Germany, Turkey, Switzerland, and other countries. We also have good relations with the Muslim countries and China -- we have signed agreements with them on friendship, cooperation and mutual understanding. Kyrgyzstan, as an equal among equals, has its own embassies and consulates in various countries. [passage indistinct] [Correspondent, in Russian] I wanted to ask you a question about socio-economic (?reforms). We have received a letter with this question. It has been sent to us by Sholpon Adilbekova, a student of the foreign language college of Kyrgyzstan. Here is the question: Askar Akayevich! I have familiarized myself with your concept for socio-economic strategy and I fully support it. But are you sure that the government will be able to implement this program. What is you view [words indistinct]? [Akayev, in Russian] First of all, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to Sholpon. I am pleased that even students are following with great interest ways of Kyrgyzstan's development. They will have to build a democratic and legal state one day and the foundation for it is being built by us. It has been enshrined by the Constitution of Kyrgyzstan. Young people will have to build a free market economy which will focus its attention on man and his interests. Therefore, we have set a goal of not only building a market economy but of building a socially oriented market economy which will protect interests of our young people. The one which will provide them with jobs and opportunities to reveal their talents and their potential. With regard to implementation of this program I am sure that, we with a new government, will be able to implement the program of reforms. The new government has been supported by the parliament. I have met people in practically all the regions of the republic and people on the whole support the new government. With regard to the president -- he, according to the new constitution, has the right to exercise control over the government's work. The president has the right to chair the government's sessions during its examination of the most important issues of socio-economic development and to take the decisions. I want our young people to know that we are not going to turn back from our path of reforms. And we will achieve success in their implementation. [passage indistinct]
