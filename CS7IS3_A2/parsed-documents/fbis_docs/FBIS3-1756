Gao Dezhan, secretary of the municipal party committee, gave an important speech. Mayor Zhang Lichang delivered an important report, entitled: "Seize the Opportunity To Accelerate Development and Strive To Raise the Income of Peasants." Municipal leading comrades Li Jianguo, Li Shenglin, Nie Bichu, Liu Jinfeng,Zheng Zhiying, Zhang Yuhuan, Lu Huansheng, and Zhang Guanwen, and veteran comrades, including Wu Zhen and Wang Liji, attended the conference. Vice Mayor Zhu Liankang presided over the conference. Last year the municipal rural situation was excellent. All district and county party committees and governments led the broad masses of cadres to do all they can to overcome serious natural disasters and all kinds of difficulties, succeeded in reaping a bumper agricultural harvest, maintaining a fairly rapid growth trend in township enterprises, and achieving a fairly big progress in rural economic development, and make positive contributions to the whole municipality's economic and social development. Gao Dezhan and Zhang Lichang extended lofty respects and heartfelt thanks to the broad masses of rural cadres and comrades who have cared for and supported the rural work on behalf of the municipal party committee and the government. In his speech, Gao Dezhan stressed: It is necessary to further enhance the sense of urgency and responsibility of seizing the opportunity to accelerate agricultural and rural economic development. Agriculture has occupied an extremely important status in our country's economic and social development. Since reform and opening up, Tianjin has rapidly developed its agriculture and rural economy and made great achievements in this regard. Agriculture and rural economic development have become an important component of the municipality's national economy. Judging from the overall situation, to seize the opportunity to accelerate development, we must strengthen the foundation status of agriculture and accelerate the development of rural economy. We must soberly recognize that our municipality's rural economic development is not good enough and the growth of income from the agricultural sector and of peasants is quite slow. The higher and the lower levels across the municipality should further enhance the sense of urgency and responsibility of accelerating agricultural and rural economic development. During this year, party committees and governments at all levels should conscientiously implement the guidelines of the central rural work conference, realistically attach prime importance to agriculture while formulating economic guidelines and putting them into practice, adopt effective measures, concentrate efforts on accelerating agricultural and rural economic development, try by all possible means to increase the income of peasants, enable the municipal agriculture and rural economy to cope with the overall situation of accelerating development in the whole municipality and to match with the status of Tianjin as a municipality. Gao Dezhan emphatically pointed out: It is necessary to regard accelerating rural economic development and unceasingly increasing the income of peasants as the fundamental starting and resting points of the rural work, exert strenuous efforts to grasp the "nonstaple foods" project on the premise of guaranteeing a steady increase in grain and cotton production, actively develop high- yield, fine-quality, and highly-efficient farming as well as township enterprises, comprehensively expedite the development of rural economy, and further enhance the economic strength of rural areas in the municipality. While attending to agriculture and rural work, we should pay great attention to the issue concerning peasants' income, strive to increase the income of peasants across the municipality by a large margin through deepening rural reform and accelerating the development of agriculture and rural economy, and realistically end the situation of slow increase in the income of peasants throughout the municipality. Increasing the average per-capita income of peasants should be regarded as one of the important targets for evaluating the work of all localities. In order to fulfill the objectives and tasks of accelerating agriculture and rural economic development, we must realistically do well the work in three aspects: First, we should continue to deepen rural reform and actively develop the social productive forces in the rural areas; second, readjust the rural production set-up, optimize the allocation of resources, and develop high-yield, fine- quality, and highly-efficient farming; and third, regard township enterprises as the new economic growing points and further accelerate development. Gao Dezhan pointed out: We should realistically strengthen leadership over agricultural and rural work and create a new situation in this aspect. The municipal party committee and government should take the lead in this work and concentrate more energy on it. Continued efforts should be made to attend to the work of changing government functions and give further play to the role of districts and counties. All departments and units should consciously make contributions to the development of agriculture and rural economy. It is necessary to advance this work in an all-round manner, implement the work target responsibility system, and make strict evaluations. We should exert strenuous efforts to strengthen the building of socialist spiritual civilization in the rural areas. Party committees and governments at all levels in the rural areas should consciously uphold the principle of "taking a two-handed approach and be tough with both," realistically strengthen the building of spiritual civilization, democracy, and the legal system, and do a good job in comprehensively improving public security in the rural areas. It is necessary to realistically strengthen the building of grass-roots party organizations in the rural areas, and give full play to the fighting bastion role of party branches and the vanguard and exemplary role of party members. We should adopt measures to further strengthen the building of township leading bodies, village party organizations, and party organizations of township enterprises, make special efforts to consolidate backward party organizations, and rapidly improve their work. Continued efforts should be made to strengthen the building of village supporting organizations with party branches as the nucleus, strengthen and improve education and management of party members, do a good job in training, and unceasingly raise the quality of party members and party-member cadres. Zhang Lichang pointed out in his report: The rapid development of rural economy and all undertakings have become increasingly important in the whole municipality's reform, opening up, and economic construction, and their role has become more prominent. Currently, the vast countryside is making solid steps to become industrialized and modernized cities and towns. We should comprehensively recognize the rural situation, and enhance the sense of urgency of accelerating development. Compared our municipality's rural economic development to that of the advanced localities throughout the country, our development rate is not quick enough and the overall level is quite low. We must keep a sober mind, have the sense of hardships and a sense of urgency and responsibility of accelerating development, be determined to work with a will to make the municipality strong, continue to work hard, and strive to make brilliant contributions. Zhang Lichang pointed out: The year of 1994 is important for deepening reform, expanding opening up, and accelerating economic development. Rural work should be chiefly focused on increasing peasants' income and effecting a quicker economic development in the rural areas. In the next five to seven years, the GNP of the agricultural departments should increase at an annual rate of 12 percent, higher than the municipal average; through five to seven years of efforts, the average per-capita net income of peasants should increase by 100 percent over 1993; by the year of 1997, all rural areas throughout the municipality should become well-off. To realize this objective, we must have a high starting point in carrying out various rural work and achieve big development in some important aspects: First, the level of agricultural production should be greatly enhanced. This year, while stabilizing the family-based output-related contract responsibility system, we should further deepen reform of the rural land utilization system and the operational form of agricultural production, sum up and popularize the experience in developing the land on a fairly large scale, carry out work in close connection with the development of high-yield, fine-quality, and highly efficient farming, and make new contributions to developing production, invigorating the market, and increasing peasants' income. Second, we should regard enhancement of efficiency as the central task and accelerate the development of township enterprises. Township enterprises must have a flexible mechanism. Currently, the most important is to clarify the property right relations, actively popularize the shareholding cooperative system, and enable township enterprises to raise scale, level, and ability in market competition. Third, we should greatly raise the proportion of export-oriented economy in the rural economic sector. Expanding the use of foreign capital should be regarded as a breakthrough point. We should firmly attend to items on inviting business and capital, change the past method of only confining business to industrial items, and comprehensively carry out primary, secondary, and tertiary industries. Fourth, with urbanization as the objective, we should speed up the building of modern small towns. According to our initial plan, by the end of this century, we will develop seven districts and counties outside the outer ring road where the governments are located and build them into satellite cities with a fair scale and fairly modern facilities. In 12 districts and counties, we will select 30 towns and market towns with convenient means of transportation, good infrastructure facilities, strong radiation functions, and promising development prospects and build them into central cities and towns with initial prosperity. The rural areas inside the outer ring road will be built in line with the unified urban plan. Fifth, we should make more villages become prosperous. By 1997, we will make peasants across the municipality become well-off in living and some advanced localities attain the standard of initial prosperity. Attention should be paid to reducing peasants' burdens, strictly controlling peasants' personal burden at within 5 percent of the average per- capita income of the previous year, and rapidly reducing the irrational burdens of township collective organizations and collective enterprises. Zhang Lichang pointed out in conclusion: We should realistically strengthen leadership and create a good environment for expediting rural economic development. Comrades charged with rural work, specially the leading cadres at all levels, should seize the opportunity, take advantage of the situation to advance, and create new achievements. It is hoped that all trades and professions will care for and support rural economic development and make new contributions to Tianjin's invigoration and prosperity.
