Felipe Gonzalez added that the day after the general strike, the government's policy will remain the same as it is today. The prime minister made these remarks at the end of a news conference he held with Finnish Prime Minister Esko Aho at the Moncloa. Over to Pedro Fernandez Cespedes. [Cespedes] Good afternoon. Hours before the general strike, Felipe Gonzalez has repeated his willingness to hold a dialogue with the representatives of the social parties, with an open mind. He will have the same attitude on the day after the strike. This led Felipe Gonzalez to say that the strike does not make sense. However, he also underlined that he cannot agree to a bilateral negotiation -- that is to say a negotiation [between government and trade unions] which would exclude employers -- nor will he agree to withdraw the reform. [Begin Gonzalez recording] We agree to change the result of an agreement between the social parties. But we are not willing -- and I will say it now and I will state it clearly -- to give in to pressure that will harm the interests of our country, the interests as we understand them to be, and as they are seen by the majority of parliament. [end recording] [Cespedes] According to the prime minister, the government believes it has taken the necessary measures to guarantee both the right to strike and the right to work, freely and without coercion. Felipe Gonzalez hopes that everyone's behavior will make this possible.
