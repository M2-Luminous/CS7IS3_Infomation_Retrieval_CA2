At the same time, the Pemex spokesman denied that the explosion had resulted in several casualties. Martinez denied reports disclosed on Saturday by Radio Red, a Mexico City radio station, on at least 10 persons having died and 20 others having been wounded as result of the explosion and fire at a pipeline located in the municipality of Cunduacan, near Villahermosa, 600 km southeast of Mexico City. "There were no fatalities," the Pemex spokesman emphasized, and indicated that only nine persons were injured as a result of burns, including Pemex workers and residents of the communities of Gregorio Mendez and Ranch Nuevo, both which are near the area. Martinez pointed out that the explosion took place at a gas pipeline connected to the petroleum installation known as Iride. He added that the cause of the explosion is "still being investigated," starting first by cleaning up the area and then examining materials through laboratory analysis. Pemex technicians and specialists from the Attorney General's Office [PGR] are investigating the explosion and fire which resulted in damages to an area measuring approximately 300 meters, mainly to trees and pastures, he specified. A Red Cross spokesperson told AFP on Saturday that the disaster prompted the evacuation of at least 800 persons living in the nearby communities whom, according to Mario Martinez, "have already returned to their homes." He stipulated that Pemex is also investigating damages to nearby properties. Pemex will compensate the owners for any damaged property. The Pemex spokesman acknowledged that the Iride installation lacked "adequate attention to normal maintenance procedures," but attributed this to the fact that peasants in the area "have blocked entry" to the site by staging constant "protests for alleged damages" caused by the petroleum plant. "These installations have been blocked from the first months of 1993 to date by persons unjustly demanding compensation for alleged damages," Pemex indicated. Residents of the region of Cunduacan where Pemex concentrates a vast petroleum drilling and production infrastructure have complained about damage caused by the state-owned company which they accuse of polluting the area in which they live.
