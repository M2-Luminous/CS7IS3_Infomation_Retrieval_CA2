FR941007-1-00181 FR941007-1-00010 II. Summary of Proposed Amendments Set forth below is a section-by-section discussion of the proposed amendments to the regulation. Section 203.4_Compilation of Loan Data Paragraph (e)_Data Reporting Under CRA The proposal would add a new paragraph to implement proposed revisions to the agencies' CRA regulations. Under the joint CRA proposal, banks or savings associations that report data about their home mortgage lending pursuant to HMDA_and that have assets of $250 million or more, or that are subsidiaries of a holding company with total banking and thrift assets of $250 million or more_would collect and report geographic information for all loans and applications, not just for property in MSAs where the institution has a home or branch office. The requirement also would apply to property located outside any MSA. The agencies believe that incorporating these reporting requirements in Regulation C would facilitate compliance for lenders. Appendix A_Form and Instructions for Completion of HMDA Loan/Application Register V. Instructions for Completion of Loan/Application Register Paragraph C The Board proposed to add a new paragraph to reflect the proposed CRA reporting requirements for banks and savings associations with assets of $250 million or more and banks and savings associations that are subsidiaries of a holding company with total banking and thrift assets of $250 million or more.
