In a statement to CyBC [the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation] in New York, the U.S. official said the current opportunity was the first in years to remove the deadlock and noted the need for a new direction. Lamb told the CyBC correspondent that Gustave Feissel has sent his report to UN Headquarters and that the Butrus-Ghali report to the Security Council would be submitted on Monday at the latest. The U.S. official said he expects the bulk of the responsibility for the collapse of the talks to be attributed to Denktas. Asked what will follow the report, Lamb said it was too early to say and added that after the report is submitted there will be consultations among the Security Council members.
