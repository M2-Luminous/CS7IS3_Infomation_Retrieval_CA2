Mamedov, who will remain in Panama two days, will meet today with President Guillermo Endara and will later meet with Foreign Minister Jose Raul Mulino. He will meet with the local and foreign media tomorrow. The Russian deputy foreign minister was met at Tocumen International Airport by Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos Cordero and members of the Russian Consulate. Alexis Ermaro, Russian consul in Panama, said this is the first time a high-ranking Russian Government official has visited Panama since the Soviet Union was dissolved two years ago. Ermaro said the deputy foreign minister will also meet with Panamanian businessmen to study the benefits of trading with Panama. The consul approved of Mamedov's visit because his government is mainly interested in the trade potential, given Panama's good relations with the European markets. Likewise, he said the two countries wish to establish technical, trade, and financial cooperation to strengthen those relations. The diplomat did not give details about the meetings or the topics that the Russian authorities would discuss with the Panamanian authorities during the two-day visit. Trade relations between the two nations have gradually developed after the Soviet Union disappeared.
