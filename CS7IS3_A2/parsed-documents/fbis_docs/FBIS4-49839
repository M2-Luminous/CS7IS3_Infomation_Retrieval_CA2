Hu Jintao, a member of the Standing Committee of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and president of the Central Party School, made these remarks at a seminar which started here today. He told those provincial and ministerial leaders attending the theoretical seminar on study of the Third Volume of The Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping that while they are studying Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, they should make concentrated efforts on two issues -- to master the theoretical systems of Deng and to use the theory to solve existing practical problems. "Only when one has grasped the scientific world outlook and methodology can one judge the situation in a correct way and... brush aside difficulties, and promote the reform and open policy and the socialist modernization cause to a further degree," he said. He noted that while the general situation is good, there are still certain problems and difficulties in China's social and economic lives. Party leaders should have a clear idea about that situation and seek a scientific way out through reform and development. He pointed out that party leaders should take bold steps in probing for solutions to the existing problems under the guidance of scientific theories. "If we want to do all tasks well, and consolidate and enhance the existing good situation, we must upgrade our theoretical level so that we can better take leading responsibility," he stressed. The present basic task for the whole party in further studying Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is to grasp the whole theoretical system and use it to solve existing leading problems through profound study and investigations, he told those leaders attending the opening ceremony. At present, the party should take effective measures to solve problems unfavorable to further reform, development and stability as China's economy will keep growing at a rapid speed and in a healthy way this year through a series of reforms, aiming to build a socialist market mechanism. He called on the leaders to build the Communist Party better in terms of ideology, politics, party organization and style so that the party will be more united, attractive and forceful. Ding Guangen, member of the Politburo of the CPC Central Committee and member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, hosted today's meeting. Ren Jianxin, also member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, attended today's meeting.
