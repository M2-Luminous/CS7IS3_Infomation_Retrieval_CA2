FR940620-2-00126 FR940620-2-00065 I. Purpose and Substantive Description A. Allocation Amounts (1) Total amount available. The Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;139, approved October 28, 1991; at 105 Stat. 744) (1992 Appropriations Act) set aside $25,000,000, of the $2,800,975,000 of budget authority available for modernization of existing public housing developments, for the risk assessment of lead-based paint (LBP). However, amounts actually available from the appropriated amount were reduced because conversions from Section 8 (U.S. Housing Act of 1937)-funded section 202 (Housing Act of 1959) direct loan projects to rental assistance-funded section 202 grant projects did not occur at the rate anticipated by Congress in the Appropriations Act. Reductions were made in the FY 1991 carryover balances to fund FY 1992 programs, as provided in the Appropriations Act. The amount of funds available for LBP risk assessment in FY 1992 was $23,853,455. Where funds awarded totaled less than the amount available, the remaining funds are to be carried over in subsequent NOFAs. Thus, in FY 1992, the Department awarded $9,055,821. In FY 1993, $14,797,634 was available for LBP risk assessment funding and $2,840,711 was awarded based on applications received. Additionally, $16,312 was awarded in FY 1994 to correct calculation errors made on applications submitted and eligible for funding in FY 1993. The total amount of funding that remains available under this FY 1994 NOFA is $11,940,611. (2) Selection of applications for funding. In order to be considered for funding, an application must be complete and must meet the threshold criteria set forth in Section II.B. of this NOFA. As such, it is required that the proposed risk assessment be for pre-1980 family developments. Additionally, the Department has determined that a development(s) targeted within an application, will not be eligible for funding where a development has been: •Tested and abated; OR •Tested and the results were negative; OR •Tested, results were positive and an adequate in-place management plan has been developed; OR •The subject of a risk assessment previously. In these instances, the Department recognizes that hazards have been addressed or identified; thus, there is no need to conduct a risk assessment. (3) Cost. Where a development is eligible to be the subject of a complete risk assessment, in accordance with the threshold criteria set forth in Section II.B. of this NOFA, the HA shall base its funding request on a per-unit-to-be-sampled-per-development cost. The per-unit cost must include costs for collection of dust and soil samples, collection of paint chip samples (where necessary), administration, laboratory analysis of collected paint, dust and soil samples, interpretation of laboratory results on samples collected, review of maintenance and management practices, and the development (not the implementation) of recommendations for in-place management. It is noted that while the risk assessment includes soil testing for lead contamination, a level of hazard for lead in soil has not been set. That issue is currently being examined by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Once the results of the soil tests have been completed and forwarded to the Department (copies of the results must be sent to the appropriate Field Office upon completion) they will be gathered by the Department and provided to EPA. The Department will defer to EPA for the establishment of a hazard level determination and for guidance to housing authorities for action where such levels are exceeded. However, where State or local laws have established lead-in-soil standards and require action, HAs shall abide by the State or local requirements. Costs associated with remediating soil are not eligible for funding under this NOFA. Funding of such costs must be secured from other HA sources (i.e., CIAP, CGP, operating subsidy, operating reserves, or State/local contributions). The cost-per-unit-to-be-sampled may not exceed the amount of $495. Prior year funding indicates that a number of HAs were able to complete risk assessments at less than this amount (ranging from $250 to $350 per-unit-to-be-sampled, excluding HA administrative costs). HAs are strongly encouraged to budget prudently for these costs. Where this amount is exceeded, the HA must submit justification of the amount requested, and the Field Office will examine the cost reasonableness of such request. The method to be used to determine the number of units to be sampled is set forth below and in the risk assessment protocol, which, at a minimum, must be used by HAs funded under this NOFA: ␣ 1No. of units in development 1No. of units for inspecting and testing (collecting samples) 1&hyph;4 All 5&hyph;74 5 75&hyph;124 6 125&hyph;174 7 175&hyph;224 10 225&hyph;299 12 300&hyph;399 15 400&hyph;499 18 500+ 20 per 500 units, plus 1 for each additional increment of 50 units. As stated in Section III.A, Application Content, of this NOFA, an application must state each development number and specify the number of units to be sampled, the amount requested for each development, and the total amount the HA is requesting. (4) Assignment of funds. Funds will be assigned to the HUD Area Offices. In assigning funds to the Area Office, Headquarters will designate an amount to be subassigned to each Indian and non-Indian Field Office. These amounts are based on the estimated sample size of pre-1980 family units minus the number of units previously funded in Fiscal Years 1992 and 1993, within each Field Office.
