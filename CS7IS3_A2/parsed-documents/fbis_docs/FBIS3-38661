"The Ukrainian border is only 400 km from Vienna; that is closer than Bregenz [Vorarlberg]," Mock said at a news conference in Vienna on Friday [4 February]. One should pay particular attention to security policy, since it is one of the most important tasks of the Austrian Government to guarantee the security of its citizens, the foreign minister said. By joining the EU, Austria will also be integrated more strongly in combating international crime. Mock pointed to dangers that are threatening from East Europe, such as a wave of migration or major military conflicts in the Balkans and escalation of the conflicts in the former Soviet Union, beginning with Ukraine. "The EU is the only organization that has proved to be a community of security so far," Mock stressed. Concerning the Transit Treaty -- which will be negotiated for the first time at the ministerial level on 8 February -- Mock said that it must remain in existence. As regards Brussels' demand to considerably shorten the duration of the treaty, he said that there are indeed indications that the treaty has had an effect more quickly than planned, but there is no proof of that. Therefore, one cannot change anything about the transit treaty. Concerning the other still open questions, in particular agriculture and second residences, Mock showed a militant attitude. There will probably be still "tougher discussions, even confrontations" between the negotiating teams, since the EU's latest offers are unacceptable. [passage omitted]
