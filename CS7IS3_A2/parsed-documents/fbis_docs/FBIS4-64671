"The evil runs deeper than the Roldan and Rubio affairs. It lies in a specific economic policy which is itself corrupt and also the origin of corruption," Anguita emphasized during the presentation of the IU's European campaign. Yesterday, the leadership of the United Left approved, with two abstentions, a resolution demanding that Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez resign immediately as the best way of ensuring that the people can regain confidence in the institutions. "Gonzalez has repeatedly and sufficiently demonstrated his inability and his lack of willingness to rectify things. He has systematically failed to comply with all of his election promises. He does not have a shred of credibility," the resolution said. It also demanded the resignation of Carlos Solchaga, Jose Luis Corcuera, and Jose Barrionuevo. However, for Anguita, the corruption scandals are only the fifth reason why the prime minister must go. According to the IU, Gonzalez is also responsible for the rise in unemployment, the destruction of industrial textiles, the economic policy, and the rise of the right. As he has done in some of his latest public actions, the general coordinator emphatically called for "serenity, calm, and rationality" at this time, and made it clear that his group would in no case support a motion of censure which might be submitted by the People's Party. Anguita will turn a deaf ear to requests that he support a catharsis. These were made by various social sectors and the media. "We are not going to make it easy for either Gonzalez or Aznar," he added. Anguita was confident that at the election on 12 June the "example of honesty, transparency, and clean hands" being set by the IU will be translated into votes. The IU hopes to gain at least seven seats in the European Parliament at the European elections. It currently has four. To this end, it will spend 125 million pesetas during the campaign, plus another 360 million on campaign mailings, according to the person in charge of the elections, Felix Martinez de la Cruz. The campaign slogan will be "Get a move on," and will be present at more than 1,000 events. The IU's leading candidate, socialist Alonso Puerta, has predicted that the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] will suffer a setback similar to the one suffered by their French counterparts at that country's last elections. He was confident that, "within this framework of anxiety," the citizens will be able to figure out that not all politicians work the same way. Puerta let slip the possibility that, after the elections, the IU would give its MEP's-elect the task of submitting an initiative to improve the ethical standards of European public life.
