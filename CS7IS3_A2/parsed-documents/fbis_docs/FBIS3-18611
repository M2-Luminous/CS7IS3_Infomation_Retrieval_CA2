In His View 12 June Poll Goes Beyond the Specific Issue"] [Text] Geneva, 3 Mar (ATS) -- The 12 June vote on the creation of Swiss blue helmets has an importance which goes "well beyond the specific issue" being put to the people. This is what Federal Council Member Flavio Cotti said in Geneva on Thursday [3 March] evening. The head of the DFAE [Federal Department of Foreign Affairs], who was the guest of the University Institute of Higher International Studies, also said he did not want to be classed among those who "praise" the European Union [EU] "at all costs." The 12 June vote is very important with regard to the open foreign policy which Switzerland intends to pursue, the head of the DFAE said. His speech, entitled "The Integration of West Europe Is an Omnipresent Reality for Switzerland," dealt mainly with the Confederation's place in the community of nations. Switzerland cannot ignore the influence which the Twelve have on its present and future development, Flavio Cotti pointed out. The development of a European structure is not achieved easily, he reaffirmed. The fact remains, the Federal Council member stressed, that the Twelve have so far managed to overcome the obstacles and give the Community a new dimension. The EU has become unavoidable and Switzerland cannot ignore it. The DFAE chief also stressed the importance of Swiss membership of the United Nations. "Switzerland's entry into the United Nations as a full member will show its determination to participate in the building of a system of collective security and the pursuit of an active policy in favor of peace." Thinking mainly of the United Nations and the EU, Mr. Cotti said that "this absence at the highest level can only harm Switzerland's interests in the medium and long term."
