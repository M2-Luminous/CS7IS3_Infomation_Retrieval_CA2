Govender] [Text] Durban April 26 SAPA -- The Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] on Tuesday [26 April] accused the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] of incompetency after ballot papers allegedly arrived at many polling booths around Durban and Pietermaritzburg without the party's sticker attached. IFP spokesman Ed Tillett labelled it a "deep election crisis". "The IEC is in complete disarray. What it boils down to is plain incompetency," charged Mr Tillett. He said areas such as Mpumalanga outside Durban, Umbumbulu south of the city, Warner Beach, parts of Pietermaritzburg and others had experienced this problem. "How can one hope to achieve fair election results? In vast areas (IFP supporters) cannot vote today." In Ulundi there was a shortage of ballot papers, and in many areas people did not have voter cards, said Mr Tillett. He added top-level negotiations with the IEC were in progress. IEC spokesman Glenn Mcdougall said late changes to the ballot paper and logistical problems, especially transport, had caused delays at some polling booths.
