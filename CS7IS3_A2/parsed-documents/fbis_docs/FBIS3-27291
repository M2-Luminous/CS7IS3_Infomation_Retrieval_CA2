The ambassador made the remarks this evening when she was asked by the CNN about her understanding on U.S. Defense Minister William Perry's statement that there would be no air strikes against targets in and around Sarajevo on Monday [21 February]. "My understanding is that Perry said that he was optimistic about the direction in which the compliance was moving but he also made it very clear that the ultimatum stood and the deadline is in fact very clear." She said that they were all encouraged by the pace of withdrawal of heavy weaponry from around Sarajevo, as set by the NATO ultimatum to be completed by midnight today. The measure of success was not whether there were air strikes, she said, it was whether the Serbs had complied. In Washington, a Pentagon official said what Perry had said was he was hopeful that there would be no air strikes on Monday, CNN reported.
