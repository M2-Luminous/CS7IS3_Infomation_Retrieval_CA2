An official reaction will follow as soon as the decree signed by the Russian president on this score is "studied carefully enough." The decree signed by Boris Yeltsin on Monday provides for the imposition of a special regime virtually throughout Malgobek and Sunzhen Regions in Ingushetia. These regions are disputed by Chechnya and Ingushetia, and Groznyy, views them as inherently Chechen territories. As Chechnya's Foreign Ministry told Interfax, Groznyy, will view the deployment of Russian troops in Malgobek Region as an "aggression by a foreign country." Chechnya's Foreign Minister, Shamseddin Yusef, told Interfax that "adequate measures will be taken to rebuff an aggression by Russian troops." In the meantime Interfax learned from military sources in Groznyy that on Wednesday Chechnya's armed forces are beginning military exercises. The exercises are to take place in the "territories bordering on adjoining states." Last week Chechnya's troops went on high alert in connection with the possible imposition of a state of emergency in Malgobek and Sunzhen Regions of Ingushetia by Moscow.
