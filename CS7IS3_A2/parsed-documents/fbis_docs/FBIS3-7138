The news analyst says: We can get along with or without talks with the United States. We are not afraid of any kind of "sanctions." Grave obstacles have cropped up in the process of a peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and the atmosphere of confrontation is getting more acute in this part of the world. This is entirely because the United States reversed the agreed conclusions reached at the DPRK-U.S. contact in New York and is pursuing the purpose of stifling the DPRK. The United States announced later than the agreed date that it would suspend the Team Spirit joint military maneuvers in 1994 and open the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks on March 21. Worse still, when we accepted the inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] for the continuity of safeguards and the working-level contact for the exchange of presidential envoys between the North and the South was resumed, the United States set such unreasonable preconditions as "satisfactory inspection by the IAEA" and "realisation of the exchange of presidential envoys between the North and South" which are not specified in the agreed conclusions. This was obviously a wanton violation of the New York agreement. In raising the unreasonable preconditions, the United States sought to avoid implementing the New York agreement and, further, break up the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks. It intends to isolate and stifle the DPRK with the nuclear issue and the DPRK-U.S. talks as an expedient. After reversing the New York agreement, the United States openly revealed its intention to resume the Team Spirit exercises in 1994 and manipulated the dishonest quarters of the IAEA Secretariat to adopt an unjust "resolution" against the DPRK and demand a reinspection. The United States has taken the "nuclear issue" of the DPRK to the United Nations Security Council in an attempt to intimidate it. On the other hand, it is making a military threat to the DPRK by moving aircraft carriers and naval fleets close to the Korean peninsula and deciding to deploy Patriot missile units in South Korea. The situation on the Korean peninsula is getting more grave hourly due to the United States and the South Korean puppets. We will not allow ourselves to be a victim of the strong-arm policy and pressure of the United States, nor will we tolerate infringement on the dignity and sovereignty of the nation in any circumstance. The United States must clearly know what the DPRK's position to carry into practice the measures proclaimed in the DPRK Government's statement of March 12 last year in face of its strong-arm policy and pressure means and what the consequences will be. We do not like an empty talk, and we mean what we say. We are prepared to cope with any event. Those who attempt to solve the problem through a strong arm and pressure must know that they will not be safe, either.
