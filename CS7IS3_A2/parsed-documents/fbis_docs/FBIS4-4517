"As a whole, the report is harsh on us, but it does not mean it automatically leads to a unilateral action from Washington," Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a news conference. "We do not have to swing from joy to sorrow on each item listed as a trade barrier," the top government spokesman added. On Thursday, the U.S. Government issued an annual report accusing Japan and scores of other countries of maintaining trade barriers against U.S. goods and services. The thrust of this year's report on foreign trade barriers centers on obstacles the U.S. says Japan has erected against foreign goods. The report, which serves as the basis for possible unilateral action by the U.S. Government against its trade partners, lists 43 trade barriers in Japan under seven industry categories. Takemura also reiterated hopes for an early resumption of the deadlocked "framework" trade talks, with Tokyo taking necessary steps to further open its markets to foreign competition as pledged earlier this week. The bilateral trade negotiations collapsed at the summit between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton on February 11 due to a gulf over a U.S. demand for setting numerical targets to gauge the openness of Japan's markets. The United States posted a record 59.3 billion dollar trade deficit with Japan in 1993, according to U.S. Commerce Department figures. Japanese Finance Ministry figures put Japan's 1993 surplus in trade with the U.S. at 50.19 billion dollars. Deputy Foreign Ministry Spokesman Kishichiro Amae criticized the U.S. trade document at a press conference later in the day. Amae said he thinks the U.S. trade document was published before the U.S. studied the outline of Japan's external economic reform measures hammered out earlier this week. "For example, all the items concerning government procurement of telecommunications and medical devices can be added in that list. A sufficient response to the contents of those items has already been described in the outline," he said. He also touched on a reference in the U.S. document which said "it is apparent that Japanese barriers form a heavy burden on the world trade system and that the Japanese economy is more highly controlled and regulated than any other." "Any such approach using `Japan as unique theory' is fundamentally unfounded and is a major problem in terms of the important relations of trust between Japan and the United States," Amae said. He said Japan considers it important to "make steady progress" on what needs to be done by June and seek a breakthrough in the framework talks.
