FR940926-0-00050 FR940926-0-00010 (d) The symbol DOT, constituting a certification by the CNG container manufacturer that the container complies with all requirements of this standard. S8␣ Test conditions: fuel container integrity. S8.1␣Pressure cycling test. The requirements of S7.1 shall be met under the conditions of S8.1.1 through S8.1.4. S8.1.1␣Hydrostatically pressurize the CNG container to the service pressure, then to not more than 10 percent of the service pressure, for 13,000 cycles. S8.1.2␣After being pressurized as specified in S8.1.1, hydrostatically pressurize the CNG container to 125 percent of the service pressure, then to not more than 10 percent of the service pressure, for 5,000 cycles. S8.1.3␣The cycling rate for S8.1.1 and S8.1.2 shall not exceed 10 cycles per minute. S8.1.4␣The cycling is conducted at ambient temperature. S8.2␣ Hydrostatic burst test. The requirements of S7.2 shall be met under the conditions of S8.2.1 through S8.2.2. S8.2.1␣Hydrostatically pressurize the CNG fuel container, as follows: The pressure is increased up to the minimum prescribed burst pressure determined in S7.2.1 or S7.2.2, and held constant at the minimum burst pressure for 10 seconds. S8.2.2␣The pressurization rate throughout the test shall not exceed 1,379 kPa (200 psi) per second. S8.3␣ Bonfire test. The requirements of S7.3 shall be met under the conditions of S8.3.1 through S8.3.10. S8.3.1␣The CNG fuel container is filled with compressed natural gas and tested at (1) 100 percent of service pressure and (2) 25 percent of service pressure. Manufacturers may conduct these tests using the same container or with separate containers. S8.3.2␣The CNG fuel container is positioned so that its longitudinal axis is horizontal. Subject the entire length to flame impingement, except that the flame shall not be allowed to impinge directly on any pressure relief device. Shield the pressure relief device with a metal plate. S8.3.3␣If the test container is 165 cm (65 inches) in length or less, place it in the upright position and subject it to total fire engulfment in the vertical. The flame shall not be allowed to impinge directly on any pressure relief device. For containers equipped with a pressure relief device on one end, the container is positioned with the relief device on top. For containers equipped with pressure relief devices on both ends, the bottom pressure relief device shall be shielded with a metal plate. S8.3.4␣The lowest part of the container is 102 mm (4 inches) above the liquid surface of the diesel fuel at the beginning of the test. S8.3.5␣The CNG fuel container is tested with the valve and pressure relief device or devices in place. S8.3.6␣The fire is generated by No. 2 diesel fuel. S8.3.7␣The fuel specified in S8.3.6 is contained in a pan such that there is sufficient fuel to burn for at least 20 minutes. The pan's dimensions ensure that the sides of the fuel containers are exposed to the flame. The pan's length and width shall exceed the fuel container projection on a horizontal plane by at least 20 cm (8 inches) but not more than 50 cm (20 inches). The pan's sidewalls shall not project more than 2 cm (0.8 inches) above the level of fuel. S8.3.8␣Time-pressure readings are recorded at 30 second intervals, beginning when the fire is lighted and continuing until the container is completely tested. S8.3.9␣The CNG fuel container is exposed to the bonfire for 20 minutes or until its contents are completely vented. S8.3.10␣The average wind velocity at the container is not to exceed 2.24 meters/second (5 mph). Issued on September 16, 1994. Ricardo Martinez, Administrator.
