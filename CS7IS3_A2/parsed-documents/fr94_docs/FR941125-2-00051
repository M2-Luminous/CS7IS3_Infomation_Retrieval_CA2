Take notice that on November 16, 1994, Koch Gateway Pipeline Company (Koch Gateway) tendered for as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, Fifth Revised Volume No. 1, the following tariff sheets, to be effective December 1, 1994: Third Revised Sheet No. 1809 Third Revised Sheet No. 1810 Second Revised Sheet No. 1811 First Revised Sheet No. 1812 Second Revised Sheet No. 1813 First Revised Sheet No. 1814 Original Sheet No. 1815 Koch Gateway states that these tariff sheets are being filed to revise the scheduling procedure utilized for interruptible storage service. Koch Gateway currently schedules Interruptible Storage Service (ISS) based on the highest space charge. Koch Gateway states that its proposal to base the scheduling of ISS service on the total average storage rate better reflects the full value of the service to its customers. Koch Gateway also states that the tariff sheets are being mailed to all customers, State Commissions, and other interested parties. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Sections 385.214 and 385.211 of the Commission's regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before November 28, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceedings. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Linwood A.
