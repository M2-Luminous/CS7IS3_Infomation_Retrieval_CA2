Mendiandua: "Workers Contribute Ideas To Improve Economic Situation"] [Text] Havana, 3 Feb (PL) -- Cuban workers are proposing various measures and multiplying their initiatives in assemblies held in their workplaces to identify their productive reserves and help resolve the country's difficult economic situation. The Cuban Workers Federation (CTC) has convened nearly 80,000 meetings until 15 March so workers can analyze how to reduce expenses, increase revenue, achieve profitability, and in this way contribute to the economic efficiency of their enterprises and the reorganization of the national finances. This process is known in Cuba as the workers' parliament, because the ideas and proposals that emerge will enrich the debate of the People's Government National Assembly (parliament) during a special session called to adopt measures to improve the country's economic situation. According to experts, the principal problems affecting the economy are excess money in circulation, swollen payrolls with more workers than necessary, and a drop in labor productivity. Cuba entered a period of severe shortages after the collapse of the European socialist bloc, which provided the island with almost all the fuel it used and more that 85 percent of its raw materials, fertilizers, pesticides, and animal feed. Deputies, provincial and rank and file delegates are participating in the workplace meetings, offering extensive information on national and regional problems while at the same time receiving the proposals and initiatives, enriching the debate and identifying them with their constituents, according to repeated evaluations by Cuban authorities. Repeated proposals in the assemblies held throughout the country include charges for certain sports and cultural events, price increases for nonessential articles such as rum and cigarettes, and the elimination of subsidies as well as more strict control over state property. Many workers have advocated a gradual application of these measures and are against streamlining payrolls without union participation. The workers debates began in January with approximately 200 assemblies of union leaders as an initial organizational step and resumed 31 January with the massive participation of all workers. In a labor meeting at the Foreign Ministry, it was learned the ministry cut its expenses by $4 million during 1992 to 1993, and several proposals emerged for the ministry to finance itself. The proposals included: setting the price of consular services at the same average level of other Foreign Ministries; charging for services of the documentation center, data base, chronologies, and others as well as streamlining foreign communications. A poll of the sociopolitical studies center based on a sample of 1,300 workers representative of the unions and all the provinces has revealed that 86 percent said the assemblies are worthwhile, and 75 percent believe very useful initiatives will be gathered in the debates.
