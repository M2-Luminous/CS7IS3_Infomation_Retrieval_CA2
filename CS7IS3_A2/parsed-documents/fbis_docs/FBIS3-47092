IAEA spokesman Hans Meyer said that at the meeting, the IAEA produced to North Korea technical requirements related to nuclear inspections. Meyer said the contact was going on between the two sides, and he could not discuss any details. He added, however, he expects additional talks could take place this week on the inspection of the seven declared North Korean nuclear facilities. Another IAEA spokesman, David Kyd, said he doesn't believe there would be any immediate progress over the question of inspecting two undeclared facilities. North Korea was represented at the second contact held at the IAEA headquarters here in Vienna by Yun Ho-chin, a councilor at the North Korean embassy in Vienna, and a couple of other diplomats.
