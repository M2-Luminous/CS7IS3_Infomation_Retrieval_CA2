[NTT] president, which developed into a dispute among political circles because of the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry's [PTM] attempt to promote Shigeo Sawada, NTT vice president and former administrative vice minister, to the position, reached a conclusion after NTT President Hitoshi Kojima chose to remain in his current post. On the surface, the PTM is generally viewed as having yielded to the "criticism of bureaucrats' practice of amakudari" [a practice known as 'descent from heaven' in which former senior bureaucrats receive high-paying jobs in the private sector or in public corporations]. However, the PTM is not that weak-kneed. Strengthening their grip on NTT is an absolutely necessary card for PTM officials to "promote competition in the domestic telecommunications market," which is an important issue. That they will compromise before the public's criticism of bureaucrats is unthinkable. It should be considered that their judgment was calculated in relation to the resumption of Japan-U.S. framework talks. In the "government procurement" sector, which is one of the three priority areas of the talks, Japan and the United States are sharply at odds over whether to include NTT's procurement of materials as a negotiations topic, along with government procurement. The U.S. side demands: "NTT is a semi-government agency whose stocks are held by the government, and the Japanese Government should promise [to open] NTT's procurement of materials [to foreign suppliers]." The fact that NTT's procurement, which amounts to more than 1 trillion yen a year, is far more profitable than government procurement, is too obvious for the United States to overlook. In response, Japan has been refuting the U.S. side saying: "NTT is a company that has already been privatized. If the government guides its procurement, it will be a managed trade." Having said that, if a former PTM official were appointed to the post of NTT president, the Japanese Government might end up adding fuel to U.S. criticism that "the government and NTT are one." That is why the PTM posed as making a concession this time. Of course, the PTM has not given up its "NTT President Sawada" plan. This can be inferred from the fact that the PTM blocked a move toward shelving Sawada to the post of chairman with all its strength. There is strong indication that PTM maneuvering, including personnel appointments, will become active again, once the negotiations between Japan and the United States are concluded.
