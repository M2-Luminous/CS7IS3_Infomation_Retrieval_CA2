FR941206-1-00030 FR941206-1-00004 II. Proposed Amendment By letter dated November 8, 1994, Wyoming submitted a proposed amendment to its program pursuant to SMCRA (Wildlife Monitoring, administrative record No. WY&hyph;28&hyph;01). Wyoming submitted the proposed amendment in response to the required program amendments at 30 CFR 950.16(aa). The provisions of Land Quality Rules that Wyoming proposed to reside were: Appendix B, Wildlife Monitoring Requirements For Surface Coal Mining Operations. Specifically, Wyoming proposes to revise section E, by removing the language ``except migrating and wintering bald eagles or migrating peregrine falcons.'' After numerous meetings with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Wyoming Game and Fish Department, representatives of the mining industry, and Land Quality Division biologist, the introductory sentence of section E is now acceptable to all participants. Section C: Raptor Production, Nest Status and Production Success of Appendix B was modified to satisfy concerns expressed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and Wyoming Game and Fish Department. These agencies recommended that the required dates for conducting raptor surveys be changed to: ``on or before mid February.'' III. Public Comment Procedures In accordance with the provisions of 30 CFR 732.17(h), OSM is seeking comments on whether the proposed amendment satisfies the applicable program approval criteria of 30 CFR 732.15. If the amendment is deemed adequate, it will become part of the Wyoming program. 1. Written Comments Written comments should be specific, pertain only to the issues proposed in this rulemaking, and include explanations in support of the commenter's recommendations. Comments received after the time indicated under DATES or at locations other than the Casper Field Office will not necessarily be considered in the final rulemaking or included in the administrative record. 2.

Persons in the audience who have not been scheduled to testify, and who wish to do so, will be heard following those who have been scheduled. The hearing will end after all persons scheduled to testify and persons present in the audience who wish to testify have been heard. 3.
