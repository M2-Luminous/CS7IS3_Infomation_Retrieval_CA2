This has drawn the attention of various quarters. There are 68 shops on Buxing Street, only a stone's throw away from Gongbei Customs. Built by the Zhuhai City Bureau of Industry and Commerce, the shops have been leased to self-employed traders. As they are situated in a busy street, business is brisk and the self-employed traders make handsome profits. When the lease contracts expired on 31 July last year, the Gongbei Sub-Bureau of Industry and Commerce planned to take back the shop space and fix the rent through public bidding. But some self-employed traders disagreed. To carry out fair, just, and open competition, the Gongbei Sub-Bureau decided to assign shop spaces by drawing lots but this move was also rejected. To show consideration for the interest of self-employed traders and properly renew the shop leases, the Gongbei Sub-Bureau conducted a thoroughgoing and meticulous investigation. They discovered that the monthly rent in nearby places ranged between 300 and 500 yuan per square meter, but it was only 40-50 yuan on Buxing Street. Moreover, a handful of self-employed traders were also found to have rerented or sold their shop spaces to other people at a profit. This move contravened the lease contracts. Consequently, the Sub-Bureau decided in March this year to adjust the shop space rent on Buxing Street according to the following criteria: For the two rows on the front gate, the rent is 300 yuan per square meter a month on the ground floor and 150 yuan in the loft; for the two rows in the middle, the rent is 250 yuan on the ground floor and 125 yuan in the loft. As Buxing Street is located in an excellent place where business is brisk, such terms are quite favorable. At 1100 on 31 March, a shopkeeper and several others decided to go on strike. This move affected business activities around the Gongbei market. On learning this, the Zhuhai City Bureau of Industry and Commerce called for strict management according to relevant rules and regulations. The Gongbei Sub-Bureau is holding talks with directors of the local association of self-employed workers in an effort to gain a better understanding of the situation. The incident is still being dealt with.
