Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren), said he generally appreciates the program, saying it shows the government's determination to take necessary measures to open Japanese markets. Masaru Hayami, head of the Japan Association of Corporate Executives (Keizai Doyukai), urged the government to implement the package in steady steps. Kosaku Inaba, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said the program contains little substance. Hiraiwa and Hayami called for tax cuts over a three-year period and an increase of over 100 trillion yen in outlays for public works projects. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. said it will review a procurement agreement reached between Japan and the United States in 1981 and provide more information concerning its procurement to foreign suppliers. The giant domestic telecommunications firm said it opposes any move to include its procurement plans in a governmental framework. The insurance industry expressed hope that business leaders of both countries will negotiate for the opening of the Japanese insurance market. The automobile industry insisted the question of Japanese auto parts procurement from U.S. suppliers be settled through industry-level talks.
