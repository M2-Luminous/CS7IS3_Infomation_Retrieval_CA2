In a statement, Yeltsin said: "Giving tribute to the competence, courage and the contribution which Yegor Gaydar made to the course of economic reform, I understand the arguments and motives which made him offer to resign." He stressed that although Gaydar has quit, the reform policy would continue and explained that Gaydar would work in the State Duma in the national interest as he had previously. 37-year-old Gaydar, the architect of Russia's economic reform, told reporters on Sunday [16 January] he had decided not to stay in the new cabinet, the full list of which is scheduled to be published on Tuesday. As an explanation he said that the government had recently taken decisions with which he disagreed and without his presence. This is the second time that Gaydar has left the government. In December 1992 Yeltsin had to remove him from the post of acting prime minister after a severe conflict with the former parliament over the course of reform. Gaydar returned to the government as first deputy prime minister last September when Yeltsin dissolved the former parliament. Gaydar, who is Yeltsin's top aide in charge of market-oriented economic reforms, said he had discussed the issue with the president on Thursday who understood his position. He added that he intended to concentrate on his work in the state duma, the lower house of the Parliament, in which his "Russia's Choice" Party has a majority. He said his party would try not to allow representatives of the Liberal Democratic Party, led by the right-wing Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, onto key committees of the lower chamber, such as defense, security and international policy committees.
