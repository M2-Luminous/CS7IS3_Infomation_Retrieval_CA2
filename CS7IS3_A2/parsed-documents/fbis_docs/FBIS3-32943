One of the marines has served for eight a half years in the Navy and as a result of his duties was responsible for a logistics office where hired killers were paid. Everything was uncovered when Col. Rodrigo Quinones gave the order to execute several subordinates in order to conceal what was taking place. In addition, the two marines indicated that the U.S. Government is seeking to establish a military base in the Colombian pacific coast through the region of Bahia Solana in Choco Department. [Begin recording] [Unidentified marine] The Venezuelan case is clear evidence that there is an intention to destabilize the region with the objective of increasing an arms buildup in the region because of its location and because the Americans have always been interested in the bay area. [Ayala] How did the Army intelligence network in the middle Magdalena region operate? [Marine] The only thing the network did was to channel all information and leave everything on Rodrigo Quinones' desk. He in turn would determine who would be eliminated as he did with journalist (Ibal Jaime). Quinones said that Jaime was making too many inquiries and there was need to silence him or get rid of him. (Ibal Jaime) was followed until he was finally killed. The same thing happened to some union members and human rights activists. [Ayala] As an Armed Forces serviceman, were you ever a member of a group that became involved in illegal activities? [Marine] I was part of a special forces group in 1986 and 1987 that operated in the central Magdalena region and was involved in several murders in the Antioquia sierra. [Ayala] At that time, whom did the group attack? [Marine] During that period we executed several union members of the petroleum [words indistinct]. [Ayala] The same group to which you belonged? [Marine] Yes, the special forces group. In addition, the central Magdalena authorities cooperated with us and [words indistinct]. [Ayala] Did the group become involved in anything illegal in Bahia Solano? [Marine] I was ordered to eliminate two persons in Bahia Solana. I was instructed to organize as well as to plan everything and that several persons would be sent to assist me in eliminating someone in Bahia Solano. I refused to do it because it was against my principles. However, when I returned I found out I had earned Mr. Rodrigo Quinones' enmity. [Ayala] Who ordered the execution of those persons? [Marine] We received the order from Mr. Rodrigo Quinones, but through Major Jairo Osorio and Captain Rafael Colon. [Ayala] Whom where you ordered to execute? [Marine] Well, local investors and businessmen. [Ayala] What was the reason for wanting to eliminate them? [Marine] For the simple reason that they were the most visible persons in the community. It is not the same thing to kill a tramp as it is to kill someone who is investing in the region. This would prompt massive protests as well as unrest and would allow military intervention which is what we were seeking. [end recording] At this time the former marines are under the protection of a human rights organization and Attorney General Carlos Gustavo Arrieta is personally conducting the investigation.
