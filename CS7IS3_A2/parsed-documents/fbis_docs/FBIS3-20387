In an economic booklet entitled "Quite Frankly," Ciller has outlined her economic work and said that the Public Economic Enterprises deficit totaled 60 trillion Turkish lira in 1993. According to Ciller, the Social Insurance Organization incurred a deficit of 25 trillion and the Social Security Association for Tradesmen, Artisans, and Independent Workers a deficit of 6 trillion in 1993. While the annual loss incurred by the Agricultural Unions totaled 30 trillion, the Zonguldak Coal Mines Establishment incurred a loss of 22 trillion. Some 8 trillion was lost because of a reduction in operations and 14 trillion due to the payment of wages. Ciller's booklet said the credits that were given to the AU were used for employment, capital spending for operational purposes, and other expenses. But the unions failed to pay their debts. The booklet recalled that the local administrations can allocate only 30 percent of their budgets to personnel and said that several local administrations have been unable to meet their personnel's needs even by using all their budget funds. It said: "That negative condition will be removed through the reforms that will be effected in the local administrations." Ciller recalled that the budget deficit was 33 trillion Turkish lira in 1990 and stressed that the deficit was expected to rise to 192 trillion in 1994. She asserted: "The budget deficit has increased because of the gradually increasing interest payments since 1986, payment of high wages and salaries since 1989, failure to solve the structural problems in the PEE and social insurance organizations, and inefficiency in privatization."
