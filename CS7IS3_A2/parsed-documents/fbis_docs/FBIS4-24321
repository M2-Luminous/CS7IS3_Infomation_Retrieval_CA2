Recently, ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] was reported to have raided the residence of ULIMO's [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] leader, Alhaji Koromah, in Paynesville, Monrovia, claiming to have discovered large quantities of arms and ammunition and arresting several loyal supporters and soldiers of Alhaji Koromah. Similar exercise was also carried out by ECOMOG on the residence of breakaway ULIMO leader Roosevelt Johnson. The leadership of the NPFL is wondering whether ECOMOG, which facilitated ULIMO in Monrovia all along as an armed group, did not know whether Alhaji Koromah had arms and ammunition in Monrovia. The leadership of the NPFL strongly warns that the action of ECOMOG is a bad precedent, which jeopardizes the security of leaders of warring factions under the Cotonou Peace Accord. The leadership of the NPFL stressed that the illegal arms raid on the living headquarters of both Koromah and Johnson by ECOMOG with AFL [Armed Forces of Liberia] assistance is totally unacceptable. The NPFL leader, President Taylor, stressed that Liberia is not under martial law and the (?seizure) exercise in Monrovia by ECOMOG with AFL assistance is unacceptable. [Begin Taylor recording] This exercise is unacceptable and must be stopped now. We wish to state, in no uncertain terms, that this nation is not under a military regime. We have no state of emergency (?imposed here). Therefore, we will not tolerate any such illegal seizure. Do you remember, fellow Liberians, the same old Samuel Doe soldiers who visited [words indistinct] and butchered innocent citizens, leaving behind mutilated bodies? Yes, they claimed then to be carrying out searches at that time. But the results were devastating, as thousands were murdered in cold blood. The memories of these actions are fresh in our minds. Do you want them back in your homes? Today they are coming again. Who knows what their real intents are? [end recording] Former President Taylor cited the legal implications involved in the search and seizure exercise, noting that the action constitutes a violation of the constitutional rights of Liberians.
