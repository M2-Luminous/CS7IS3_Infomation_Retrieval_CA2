ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: Notice is hereby given of a person who has had its export/retransfer privileges reinstated pursuant to section 38(g)(4) of the Arms Export Control Act, (the AECA), (22 U.S.C. 2778(g)(4)) and §127.11(b) (formerly §127.10(b)) of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, (the ITAR), (22 CFR parts 120&hyph;130).

Bryant Jr., Chief, Compliance Enforcement Branch, Compliance Division, Office of Defense Trade Controls, Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, Department of State (703&hyph;875&hyph;6650). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 38(g)(4)(A) of the AECA and §127.11(a) of the ITAR prohibit the issuance of export licenses or other approvals to a person, or any party to the export, who has been convicted of violating certain U.S. criminal statutes enumerated at section 38(g)(1) of the AECA and §120.27 of the ITAR. The term ``person'' means a natural person as well as a corporation, business association, partnership, society, trust, or any other entity, organization, or group, including governmental entities. The term ``party to the export'' means the president, the chief executive officer, and other senior officers of the license applicant; the freight forwarders or designated exporting agent of the license applicant; and any consignee or end user of any item to be exported. The statute permits export/retransfer privileges to be reinstated on a case-by-case basis after consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury and after a thorough review of the circumstances surrounding the conviction or ineligibility to export and finding that appropriate steps have been taken to mitigate any law enforcement concerns. In accordance with these authorities Japan Aviation Electronics Industry, Ltd., Japan, (JAE), effective March 25, 1994, has had export/retransfer privileges reinstated pursuant to section 38(g)(4) of the AECA and §127.11 of the ITAR. The effect of this notice is that JAE may once again participate in the export or retransfer of defense articles or defense services subject to section 38 of the AECA and the ITAR.
