When will the national dialogue that you called for during the opening of the parliamentary session of the People's Assembly and Consultative Council start? The president answered: It is most likely that the dialogue will start in mid-February. Studies continue now and meetings are taking place with many figures since the dialogue includes all national forces. In his special statements, President Mubarak spoke about his hopes for his citizens during 1994 and what he wants from them so that Egypt would always remain cherished, honorable, strong, and stable. I asked the president: What would you like to tell the people with the beginning of the new year? He answered in an optimistic tone laced with warm intonations of love and cordiality: I wish them goodness, the best of things. Egypt is our country. It is our duty to provide it with everything that will elevate it and realize progress for it, especially since its sons are the best, happy to be sheltered under its wings. Undoubtedly, Egypt will never be ungenerous with its own sons. At the same time, I tell our young sons: Do not be misled by calls of perversion. Do not get involved in any terrorist operations the objective of which is Egypt's stability and security, no matter what the material temptations or psychological pressures are, because, in the end, you will pay the price yourselves and you will be harmed by your own actions. The president then added: Those who are trying to exploit you want to destroy the country. But Egypt will never be ruined, thanks to God's help and protection and the cohesion of its sons. I hope all the parties will contribute toward confronting terrorism which does not differentiate among people. Everyone, without exception, will suffer from the negative effects of terrorism. The president said in his exclusive statements: I hope every citizen will work to increase production and plan his family, because a population increase has dangerous repercussions. Our responsibility is to balance revenues and expenditures. We need to understand that this cannot be realized so long as population growth continues at the same rate. Mr. President, what do you want to tell the Arab brothers with the beginning of the new year? President Mubarak answered: I call on the Arab brothers to close past files. We should all start a new age based on solidarity and unity, and away from hegemony and control. All the people of the world cooperate with each other for joint interests. Therefore, how nice it would be for us Arabs to heed the experiences of others, especially since our potentials and resources in various fields are huge and varied. [passage omitted] Concluding his exclusive statements, President Mubarak affirmed that Egypt has exerted and continues to exert huge efforts to push the peace process forward out of its conviction that the people of the region should live in friendship and build their lives on new bases. We are trying as much as possible to overcome difficulties with the objective of bringing viewpoints closer so that we can realize our objectives. Mr. President, are you optimistic that the Gaza-Jericho agreement will soon be implemented? The president answered with optimism and confidence: God willing, the Gaza-Jericho agreement will soon be implemented. These are the first steps of a permanent and peaceful solution and all parties know that very well.
