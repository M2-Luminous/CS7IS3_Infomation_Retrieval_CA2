FBIS4-32892 "drlat104_o_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-104 Daily Report 30 May 1994 Colombia Samper, Pastrana in `Virtual Tie' Samper, Pastrana in `Virtual Tie' PA3005034394 Madrid EFE in Spanish 0204 GMT 30 May 94 PA3005034394 Madrid EFE Spanish BFN [By Elias Garcia] [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 29 May (EFE) -- Colombians will have to go to runoff presidential elections on 19 June, since none of the 18 candidates secured a simple majority today's primary elections. Contrary to poll estimates, both candidates finished in a virtual tie: liberal candidate Ernesto Samper, the favorite, garnered 45.2 percent of the votes, while conservative candidate Andres Pastrana obtained 44.9 percent. Former guerrilla Antonio Navarro Wolff of the "Commitment for Colombia" was third with 3.8 percent of the votes, followed by Regina Betancourt of the Metapolitical Unitary Movement obtained 1.1 percent. Blank votes accounted for 1.1 percent of the votes cast. Once again, abstentionism was one of the predominant notes of the day: less than 6 million people of a total of 17.1 million potential voters went to the polls, representing approximately 70 percent abstentionism. The narrow margin between the two principal contenders was a surprise because the majority of the polls put Samper 5 percent over Pastrana. The elections took place amid calm, as occurred throughout the campaign in which there were no major incidents of violence. Colombians still recall with horror the previous presidential campaign in which three candidates were assassinated. Beginning tomorrow, the candidates will no doubt begin the second stage of their election campaign. Their aim will be to garner the small percentage of votes (approximately 7 percent) that went to the other candidates today. The two candidates who will go to the runoff elections will seek to obtain the support of some of the 15 candidates who were eliminated by verdict of the polls, above all, Antonio Navarro, Regina Betancourt, Miguel Maza, and Enrique Parejo, who altogether obtained almost 6.5 percent of the votes, some 400,000. Of course it remains to be seen whether the votes of these candidates are "transferable" or, if on the contrary, their supporters do not respond to any persuasion. It will be especially important to see what stand Antonio Navarro adopts. Some of his supporters in the Democratic Alliance (former M-19 guerrilla group) abandoned him in the middle of the campaign because they did not agree on going to the elections under another acronym and went over to Ernesto Samper's ranks. More people are not expected to turn out for the runoff elections. Perhaps there will be less because the voters are tired (today's election was the second one this year and there is still another one following the runoff) and because of the negative influence of the World Cup in which Colombia will play against Romania on the eve of the runoff elections.
