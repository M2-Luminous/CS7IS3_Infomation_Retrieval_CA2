FBIS4-43195 "drweu114_p_94006" FBIS-WEU-94-114 Daily Report 7 Jun 1994 GREECE Poll Shows PASOK Still Ahead Poll Shows PASOK Still Ahead NC1106111194 Athens I KATHIMERINI in Greek 7 Jun 94 p 5 NC1106111194 Athens I KATHIMERINI Greek BFN [Report by Ioannis Loulis] [Excerpts] The well-known public opinion poll "Trends" by the MRB organization, in view of the elections for the European Parliament, presents some particularly interesting findings on the current political climate in Greece. The poll, which was conducted from 14 to 24 May, had a sample of 2,000 voters and is carried out every six months. The main findings of the report, which included specific questions from Sky radio and I KATHIMERINI, are the following: First: Regarding voter preferences, the poll does not add anything new since it was carried out before the campaign reached its climax. In comparison with previous polls, there appear to be more undecided voters--up to 17.1 percent--rather than less. According to MRB's findings, PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] will easily maintain its leading position, but New Democracy will close the gap. Political Spring will show a significant increase. The Coalition of the Left and Progress will increase its power, while the KKE [Greek Communist Party] will maintain its power at the current level. [passage omitted] Second: The most substantially positive aspect of the government is that it is considered better than the New Democracy government of 1990-93. The two main answers to a question regarding the government's positive aspects do not relate to its achievements but to the "climate" it cultivates. According to these findings, the current government is considered moderate and open to dialogue by 46.4 percent and 45 percent respectively. The government's main advantage is that it is considered better than the New Democracy one, with 44.3 percent responding, and the prime minister's rating is also favorable, with 42.4 percent responding. The government's main weaknesses are that it can only convince 29.6 percent of the respondents that it can deal with the economic crisis, and that only 25.1 percent of the voters consider it credible (that it can do what it promised). Third: The government's Achilles heel is the lack of confidence regarding the effectiveness of its economic policy. The MRB's "Trends" confirms this at many fronts: a) 31.2 percent of the voters express great confidence in the government's economic policy, whereas 65.5 percent express no confidence; b) 7.4 percent of the voters show a positive judgment of the government's economic policy whereas 17 percent are neutral and 63.7 percent are negative. [passage omitted] Fourth: New Democracy has three weaknesses, two of which relate to its past government of 1990-93 and one to the present. The party's main weakness, which hurts its credibility today, is the economic policy that it implemented between 1990 and 1993 and that was mentioned by 56.1 percent of the voters asked. The other weakness mentioned was "economic scandals," by 52.9 percent of those asked. Regarding the present, "serious internal problems" is mentioned as a weakness. On the contrary, the fact that only 12.2 percent mentioned [New Democracy Chairman] Miltiadhis Evert as a "problem" and only 20.1 percent said that the party does not have capable officials to govern, shows that Evert and his officials are the party's "winning cards." Fifth: The fact that [Prime Minister and PASOK Chairman] Andreas Papandreou and Evert are the "winning cards" of their parties is also indicated by their popularity. Coalition of the Left and Progress Chairman Nikolaos Konstandopoulos has a lot of friends and the difference between his positive and negative ratings is 27.8 percent on the positive side. Evert has a positive differential of 8.4 percent and Papandreou a 4.2 percent positive differential. Regarding [Political Spring Chairman] Andonios Samaras, the negative opinions prevail slightly by 2.9 percent. Whereas KKE Secretary General Aleka Papariga has a negative differential of 35.8 percent. [passage omitted] Sixth: The most positive finding for New Democracy is the feeling that a government with Evert as prime minister would possibly be better than the current government. This view confirms earlier MRB findings in Athens and now is confirmed throughout the country. Specifically, 31.4 percent believe that a government under Evert would be better than the current [under Papandreou], 29.3 percent said it would be worse, and 27.9 percent consider that it would be the "same." At the same time, 37 percent of voters consider the current government better that the previous one under New Democracy, 32.3 percent consider it the "same," and only 28.7 percent consider it worse. [passage omitted] Seventh: Papandreou's succession is the issue that appears to be the source of instability for PASOK. In the first poll after the death of Yeoryios Yennimatas--who was thought to be the most appropriate to succeed Papandreou--four candidates prevailed. Specifically, among PASOK supporters the order is the following: [Former European Union Commissioner and currently deputy] Vaso Papandreou 14.7 percent, [Industry Minister] Konstandinos Simitis 13 percent, [Alternate Foreign Minister on European Union affairs] Theodhoros Pangalos 12.1 percent, and [National Defense Minister] Yerasimos Arsenis 11.2 percent. Dhimitrios Tsovolas and Akis Tzokhatzopoulos follow clearly behind with 8.7 percent and 7 percent respectively. What appears as evidence of instability for PASOK, beyond the fact that no one or two candidates to "succeed" Papandreou prevailed, is that the most probable successor--especially among PASOK voters--is Tzokhatzopoulos, even though he received a low percentage as the most suitable in the successor category. Apparently, PASOK voters consider Tzokhatzopoulos as the most probable successor to Papandreou with 24.5 percent, followed by Arsenis with 11.8 percent. On the contrary, Vaso Papandreou, Simitis and Pangalos, who are considered as the most suitable with high percentages, received only 4.9 percent, 8.6 percent and 7.1 percent respectively.
