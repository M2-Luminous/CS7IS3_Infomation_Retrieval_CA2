Taiwan's trade deficit with Japan topped U.S.$14.2 billion in 1993, mainly because of a 45 percent import growth from Japan in the past three years and a poor performance by made-in-Taiwan products on the Japanese market, the official said. Taiwan's major export to Japan, electric machinery, saw a 2.7 percent decline in its market share over the past three years. Other Taiwan goods, including wood products, knitwear, steel, toys, sporting goods, furniture and plastic products have also lost market share to imports from Mainland China and Southeast Asian nations, he said. Despite the appreciation of the Japanese yen, which benefited Taiwan exporters, the loss of competitiveness of Taiwan products makes the increasing trade deficit hard to control, the official said. Japan imported U.S.$9.7 billion worth of products from Taiwan in 1993, accounting for 4 percent of total imports of U.S.$240.7 billion, he added.
