FBIS3-25124 "drafr026_c_94022" FBIS-AFR-94-026 Document Type:Daily Report 8 Feb 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 8 Feb MB0802130394 MB0802130394 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] THE STAR Do Not Write Off Peacekeeping Force--"It is by no means surprising that in the first two weeks there have been blow-ups" in the National Peacekeeping Force (NPKF), says a page-12 editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 8 February. "Sensible South Africans will beware of writing the force off too easily." The government should give the NPKF based at De Brug "a top-priority rating," and the African National Congress (ANC) "should resist any lurking temptations for a little cheap politicking." "It is also time for openness. There are no secrets in this army; no reasons to lock its men away. Let them be visible, so that future bust-ups and future successes alike can be seen clearly by the public and not left to the exaggeration of whisper." BUSINESS DAY ANC, NP Seek To Retain Police State Powers -- "When ANC and NP [National Party]-aligned delegates to the Transitional Executive Council [TEC] are called on by the DP's [Democratic Party] Colin Eglin to account today for their apparent reluctance to scrap detention without trial, the least they should do is blush," remarks a page-12 editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English 8 February. "Clearly, there are little dictators in both parties who think the constitutional impasse is to be resolved, and a `free and far' election fought, with the backing of a 1980s-style law and order crackdown." BUSINESS DAY finds it "disturbing" that the ANC and the NP "are intent on retaining police state powers through sleight of hand -- it took the eagle-eyed Black Sash to notice and publicise this latest exercise in cynicism. And let us not forget that this is the second time the ANC and NP have acted covertly together to sneak through detention provisions -- the first occurred at Codesa [Convention for a Democratic South Africa] in 1992. Let us see how they squirm out of this one." CAPE TIMES Country `Does Have a Future' -- Gerald Shaw writes in his "Political Survey" column on page 6 of Cape Town CAPE TIMES in English on 4 February that in South Africa "there will by much sound and fury but the intermittent terrorism and sabotage of the fanatics will not stop the election." One estimate of the security situation which Shaw has seen, written by Colin Legum, "doyen of analysts of Southern Africa affairs," suggests that "Northern Ireland is the closest parallel to present-day South Africa, rather than Algeria on the brink of independence, when the army generals revolted against De Gaulle's policy and France itself seemed momentarily at risk. An Ulster-type situation is about as bad as things will get, it seems to me. The bombs will go off but life will go on. The main thing will be to convince the world in the next few months that South Africa does have a future." CITY PRESS ANC-Freedom Alliance Talks on Verge of Collapse -- Johannesburg CITY PRESS in English on 6 February in a page-14 editorial believes the ANC-Freedom Alliance talks "have all but collapsed." "The ANC and the government on the one hand, and the Alliance on the other, seem to be drifting further from each other." CITY PRESS does not understand how the ANC "can expect the Alliance to make commitments to a document they have not yet seen, let alone discussed." Alternately, if the alliance rejects the proposals, or shifts goalposts, "the rest of the country and the world will then know who is not interested in a peaceful resolution of the country's problems." BEELD Problems With New Peacekeeping Force -- "The fact that the minister of defense, Mr. Kobie Coetsee, found it necessary to instruct General Georg Meiring, chief of the army, to investigate alleged problems within the National Peacekeeping Force increases suspicions that all is not well within that force," notes Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 4 February in a page-8 editorial. "The name National Peacekeeping Force becomes a mockery if the rumors of unhygienic conditions, disease and lack of discipline, are true." "Strict disciplinary measures should be taken against those who refuse to cooperate in the creation of a respectable peacekeeping force." Call for Action Against Right-Wing Threat to Peace -- Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans of 7 February in a page-8 editorial says: "Conflict is building up in South Africa which could lead to full-scale civil war. If no definite action is taken now the country will get exactly what Mr. Eugene Terreblanche has been hoping for -- conflict between the Afrikaner Resistance Movement, AWB, and other right-wing organizations against the ANC and its allies. Mr. Terreblanche admitted that the right wing was responsible for the current terrorist attacks, and indicated that more attacks could be expected. His remarks reflect a knowledge of what is happening. He challenges and threatens. Has he even been questioned?" "ANC threats of retaliation are understandable. The endless attacks on ANC property cannot be tolerated." "Urgent action should be taken against those who threaten the peace. The time has come for drastic decisions and actions."
