Yeltsin made a number of statements at a news conference which give grounds for regarding this generally ordinary measure as the most important internal political event not just of last week. For the first time since the 12 December elections and referendum the country's public was able to gain a clear idea of the president's economic and internal political principles and plans. Yeltsin's new political strategy was essentially made public at the news conference. Its essence seems to be that the president of Russia is largely restoring the status which he had at the end of 1991, once again becoming an informal prime minister, placing leadership of the executive under his direct control, reforming the economy, and governing the country with the help of edicts. At the same time the president's staff is becoming, as it were, a second branch of the executive, entrusted with formulating economic strategy. The tackling of current problems has been left to the government. Yeltsin's statements also make it possible to conclude that there have been serious political changes in his position. The period of vacillation -- echoes of which, in particular, were reaching the public in the form of diverse rumors of cardinal reshuffles in the system of the executive -- seems to have ended for the president. Russia's economic situation has made him finally choose one of two options: Either movement toward building an open country with a civilized market economy, or reversion to a closed militarized state. The president, as far as can be judged from his statements, has definitely chosen the first option and thereby restored his image as a reforming democrat. Thus, today it is possible to draw three definite conclusions: Yeltsin has chosen the optimum political and economic course, he has clearly demonstrated that he remains a reforming president, and, for the first time since the new Constitution was adopted, he has broken through the interests of the nomenklatura and shown himself to be a leader capable of making strategic decisions. Right now there are grounds for hope that Russia will succeed in extricating itself from the crisis with the minimal upheaval. Undoubtedly, the economic situation will not yet improve quickly. Possible attempts to destabilize the economic and internal political situation cannot be ruled out. After his news conference the president has gotten two powerful -- both politically and economically -- new opponents: a section of the commercial banks and a section of the Army. He has confronted the former with the prospect of being squeezed in the vise of increased state control and increased competition from foreign colleagues, and the latter with the threat of radical reduction. Thus, a temporary tactical alliance between these forces and the opposition appears perfectly real. Nevertheless, there are grounds for believing that it is perfectly realistic to preserve political stability in Russia. This is primarily borne out by the president's statement that he has no intention of changing the government or the premier. By taking on the formulation of economic strategy, Yeltsin has encroached upon V. Chernomyrdin's competence, since the worsening state of the economy was weakening the president's political positions. But at the same time he extended a hand to him at a difficult time by stating officially that there can be no question of any "surrender" of Chernomyrdin. Of course, something similar was also heard in the past in respect of Ye. Gaydar and Yu. Petrov. But in this case there are weighty reasons to believe that words will not be at variance with actions, at least in the immediate future. This assumption is also confirmed by the blow which the president dealt during the news conference to A. Chubays and V. Kvasov -- Chernomyrdin's opponents in the government. A rather unique situation has been created. While having weakened Chernomyrdin as premier and as an administrator, at the same time Yeltsin has strengthened him as a political figure. And not just by refuting the rumors of a change of government. After his news conference it will probably no longer be possible for Yeltsin to reach agreement with the opposition. But Chernomyrdin will be perfectly able to work with it. It could essentially be a question of creating a political alliance between the president and the premier in which the former holds the political right flank and the center, while the latter holds the center and the slightly left flank. It seems far from coincidental that it was precisely the center and the opposition in the Duma that supported the draft budget submitted by the government, as well as the fact that, to judge from statements by opposition leaders, they are not nurturing plans to remove the premier but advocate only a presidential election. Although the chief credit for the fact that the Duma adopted this, the most optimum version of the budget, should undoubtedly go to M. Zadornov, chairman of the Budget Committee, whose speech at the session placed him, without exaggeration, you might say, at the peak of the Russian political and economic elite, on a par with Gaydar and G. Yavlinskiy. Yeltsin, to judge from his statements, has found his second most important point of support in the leaders of the Russian regions. The most graphic evidence of this is provided by his unequivocal support for Yu. Luzhkov in his conflict with Chubays. There is no doubt that the other regional leaders will also demand for themselves rights analogous with those accorded the mayor of Moscow. At any rate, a similar statement has already been heard from the leaders of "Siberian Agreement." If you consider the fact that an accord has already been reached between Yeltsin and the Russian governors on the transfer of the regional apparatus to their control, then it is possible to believe that these aspirations too will not go unsatisfied. Yeltsin has also managed to substantially improve relations with the republic leaders, as evidenced most vividly by his recent visit to Tatarstan. Finally, the third support necessary for full stability seems to have been found in the leadership of the central bureaucratic apparatus. The president's phrase about the corruptness of precisely the middle echelon of managers may be regarded as a guarantee that top officials will not suffer such persecution. This, in turn, destroys the monolith of the bureaucratic apparatus, weakens its influence, and creates preconditions for establishing control over it. According to information available in the editorial office, during the president's meeting with Gaydar at the beginning of last week Yeltsin complained, in particular, that the apparatuses of the government and of the president's staff have grown incredibly and become unmanageable. Previously the mass media repeatedly voiced opinions that the head of state was increasingly becoming a hostage of the bureaucratic apparatus. But now, as we see, the president is trying to break through this ring. The distribution of forces on the Russian political scene following Yeltsin's news conference appears as follows: In addition to the national-communist opposition, a section of the Army and the military-industrial complex is becoming concentrated in the camp of the president's opponents, with a section of the commercial banks and also a section of the central bureaucratic apparatus as temporary, tactical partners. Mainly the middle link. Among the forces which support the president there are, above all, the government, the majority of the regional leaders, the oil and gas complex, and the West. The president can also count on the support of Russian democratic forces. Evidently, it was for precisely this reason that he did not even send greetings to the founding congress of the "Russia's Democratic Choice" party. Not wishing to tie himself to a single party, Yeltsin proposes, to all appearances, to rely on the whole spectrum of democratic forces, whose congress, as is known, is planned for the fall. Incidentally, such a strategy seems the optimum and probably also the only possible one for Yeltsin if he has already made the decision to run in the next presidential election. If this is so, it means that we are talking of a strategy virtually chosen by the president for the next two years. Such a political balance and also the energy and the capacity for work which the president has been displaying for quite some time provide grounds for forecasting that, despite the economic crisis, the political situation in Russia will remain stable for the time being. No serious upheavals are expected, apart from some cadre reshuffles in the government.
