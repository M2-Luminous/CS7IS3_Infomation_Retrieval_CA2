I am afraid that our honest intentions have been misinterpreted. Therefore, as one of the signatories of the Alternative, I would like to explain our proposal for dealing with the situation. The political situation in the Slovak Republic is rather tense. Its worst feature is the situation in parliament, where the government is struggling with its need for a majority. As a result, parliament faces difficulties and is not able to pass important economic and social laws that are eagerly awaited by the population. On one side, there are diverging views and there is insufficent willingness to reach agreement; on the other, there is a well-coordinated attitude of the opposition. This, together, is paralyzing the work of parliament. A democratic and a constitutional solution to this situation, which is in the interests of Slovakia as a whole, is early parliamentary elections. It is equally in the interests of Slovakia as a whole to make use of the time before early parliamentary elections to make sure that steps toward economic and social transformation are not halted. This requires a sensible agreement between all political forces, asked for by three-quarters of our population. A group of parliamentary deputies and two members of the government put forward a possible solution within the HZDS parliamentary group: to create, before early parliamentary elections, a broad, coalition government that would consist of candidates from the majority of political forces. The role of this government would be to make participating parties concentrate on topical problems and to share political responsibility for solving them. At the election, citizens will have to decide the direction Slovakia is to follow in the future. The right thing to do would be for the top representatives of the political entities to agree on this solution and, under the leadership of the HZDS, to form such a government jointly for a transitional period. This would also make it possible to continue with the tasks planned by the HZDS. Their personal attitudes and mutual relations, however, make this step unlikely. This is why the idea came into being of setting up a government without the personal participation of the chairmen of the parties and to include in this government a number of experts without political affiliation. This is not a negation of the election result. This is simply the acknowledgement of the real distribution of political forces in parliament before early elections. Only the continuation of economic and social measures that will gain sufficient support from the political forces will be able help Slovakia to overcome growing problems in the economy--the growth of unemployment and of social tension, problems in health care and education, and the decline in our citizens' standard of living. It is impossible to continue the politics of confrontation, promoting the one and only correct view. It is necessary to stop seeing things in black and white and to get rid of the slogan "Who is not with us is against us." To reach agreement is in the real interests of Slovakia. This is not political naivete. This is political realism. [end recording]
