(6) Impermissible sources of Matching Funds. Under no circumstances may the following be used as sources of the Matching Funds of the recipient organization: (i) Uncompensated student labor; (ii) SCORE, ACE, or SBI volunteers; (iii) Program income; (iv) Funds or indirect or in-kind contributions from any other Federal program. §130.460 Proposal preparation_Budget justification. (a) General requirements. The proposal must include all items required by the Program Announcement. The AA/SBDCs shall send the Program Announcement to each SBDC immediately after issuance. (b) Submission of budget justification. The budget justification for the upcoming Budget period must be prepared and submitted (as a part of the proposal package) to the SBA Project Officer in the SBA district office by the SBDC Director on behalf of the recipient organization, or by the applicant organization's authorized representative in the case of a first time SBDC application. The budget shall be reviewed annually upon submission of a renewal proposal and shall be considered during the course of negotiation of the renewal Cooperative Agreement. All budgets are subject to appropriation of the necessary funds by Congress. (1) Direct costs. Unless otherwise provided for in applicable OMB circulars, at least eighty percent (80%) of any funding provided by SBA must be allocated to Direct costs of program delivery. In the event that all Indirect costs are waived by the applicant organization in order to meet the Matching Funds requirement, one hundred percent (100%) of the SBA funding provided must be allocated to program delivery. If some, but not all, Indirect costs are waived to meet the Matching Funds requirement, the lesser of the following may be allocated as Indirect costs of the program and charged against SBDC funding provided by SBA: (i) Twenty percent (20%) of SBDC funding provided to the recipient organization by SBA, or (ii) The amount remaining after the waived portion of Indirect costs is subtracted from the total indirect costs. (2) SBDC service provider costs. (i) As a separate attachment to the budget, the applicant organization shall include separate budgets for all sub-contracted SBDC service providers in conformity with OMB financial requirements. Applicable Indirect cost base and rate agreements shall be included for the Lead Center and all SBDC service providers. The rate used shall be equal to or less than the negotiated predetermined rate. If no such rate exists, then one shall be negotiated between the sponsoring SBDC organization or SBDC service provider and its Cognizant Agency. In the event the sponsoring SBDC organization or SBDC service provider does not have a Cognizant Agency, the rate shall be negotiated with the SBA Project Officer. The rate shall be negotiated and agreed upon in accordance with OMB Circular A&hyph;21. (ii) The amount of cash, in-kind contributions and indirect costs for the Lead Center and all sub-contracted SBDC service providers shall be indicated in accordance with OMB financial requirements. (iii) Expenses. (A) Cost principles. Principles for determining allowable costs are contained in OMB Circulars A&hyph;21 (cost principles for grants, contracts, and other agreements with educational institutions), A&hyph;87, (cost principles for programs administered by State and local governments), and A&hyph;122 (cost principles for nonprofit organizations). (B) Costs associated with lobbying. No portion of the Federal dollars received by an SBDC may be used for lobbying activities, either directly by the SBDC or indirectly through outside organizations, except those activities permitted by the provisions of OMB Circular A&hyph;122. Restrictions on and reports of lobbying activities by the SBDC recipient of a Federal grant, loan or cooperative agreement shall be in accordance with OMB Circulars A&hyph;21, A&hyph;87, and A&hyph;122, Section 319 of Public Law No. 101&hyph;121, and the annual Program Announcement. (C) Salaries. ( 1 ) If an SBDC is based in a university or college, the SBDC Director's salary should approximate the average annualized salary of a full professor in the school or department in which the SBDC is located organizationally (e.g., School of Business, School of Engineering). The salary of the subcenter Director should approximate the average annualized salary of an assistant professor in such school or department. ( 2 ) If an SBDC is based in an entity other than a university or college, the annualized salaries of the SBDC Director and the subcenter Director should approximate the average salaries of parallel positions within the recipient organization. Salaries for all other positions within the SBDC shall be established based upon the level of responsibility, and shall be comparable to salaries for similar positions in the area served by the SBDC. ( 3 ) Recruitment and salary increases for SBDC Directors, subcenter Directors and staff members shall conform to the administrative policy of the recipient organization. (D) Travel. Transportation costs shall be at coach class; per diem rates, including lodging, shall not exceed those authorized by the written travel policies of the Host. All travel must be separately identified in the proposed budget as planned in-State, planned out-of-State, unplanned in-State or unplanned out-of-State. In order for any travel to be approved by the SBA, it must be in accordance with the written travel policies of the recipient organization or the sponsoring SBDC organization and directly attributable to specific work of the SBDC or incurred in the normal course of administration of the program. All proposed travel by the SBDC Director and the SBDC staff must be reasonable, justified in writing, and included in the SBDC's proposed annual budget. Such justification must indicate the estimated cost, number of persons traveling, and the benefit to be derived by the small business community from the proposed travel. A specific projected amount, based on past experience where appropriate, must also be included in the budget for any unplanned travel. A justification in greater detail shall be required for unplanned out-of-State travel. Any proposed unplanned out-of-State travel that exceeds the approved budgeted amount for travel must be submitted to the Project Officer for approval on a case-by-case basis. Any such submission must contain a written budget revision and written narrative explaining the need for such travel and the relation of such travel to the efficient operation of the SBDC. Travel outside the United States must have prior approval by the AA/SBDCs on a case-by-case basis. (E) Dues. Costs of membership in business, technical, and professional organizations shall be allowable expenses. The use of Federal dollars in payment of such dues shall be permitted, provided that all such payments are anticipated in the budget proposal, approved by the SBA as reasonable and comply with §130.460(b)(2)(iii)(B). §130.470 Fees. SBDC clients may be charged a reasonable fee to cover program costs in connection with training activities sponsored or cosponsored by the SBDC, or costs associated with approved specialized services. Fees may not be imposed for counseling, as defined in §130.110(h). §130.480 Program income. (a) Treatment of program income for recipient organizations or SBDC service providers based in universities or nonprofit organizations shall be subject to the provisions of Attachment D of OMB Circular A&hyph;110. Treatment of program income for recipient organizations or SBDC service providers based in State or local governments shall be subject to the provisions of §7.e and Attachment E of OMB Circular A&hyph;102 and 13 CFR 143.25. (b) Program income, including any interest earned on program income, must be used to accomplish program objectives. It cannot be used to satisfy the requirements for Matching Funds. Each SBDC must report in detail, on Financial Reporting Form SF 269, receipts and expenditures of program income, including any income received through co-sponsored activities. A narrative description of how program income was used to accomplish program objectives shall be included or attached to the SF Form 269. (c) The phrase ``to accomplish program objectives'' means expanding the quantity or quality of services, resources or outreach provided by the SBDC network. The Project Officer is responsible for monitoring financial expenditures to ensure that program objectives are being met. Any unused program income will be carried over to be utilized to further program objectives in a subsequent Budget period.
