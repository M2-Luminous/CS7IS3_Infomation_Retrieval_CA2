And it is possible that it will escalate at any time. Russia decided on March 3 to reduce its natural gas supply to Ukraine, which, Russia says, owes a large amount of money for previous supplies. And Russia threatened to totally stop the supply of gas if Ukraine fails to pay the debt within five days. That threat still exists, although Russia agreed to extend the time limit to April 10 after urgent negotiations. Russia is Ukraine's biggest supplier of natural gas, essential to Ukrainian industry. And 60 percent of the country's natural gas comes from Russia annually. However, Ukraine cannot pay the debt due to its domestic economic crisis and the soaring price of gas provided by Russia. Under the circumstances, it is buying most of its natural gas on credit. The Russian Government cancelled a state loan to Ukraine because of their strained relations. According to Russian statistics, Ukraine now owes Russia 1.5 trillion rubles. The dispute was triggered by Turkmenistan, another important source of energy for Ukraine, when Turkmenistan decided to discontinue supplying 77.8 million metric meters of natural gas daily, thus worsening Ukraine's energy crisis. The lack of natural gas has forced 40 to 45 of the 110 generating units in Ukraine's thermal power plant to stop operations. And many Ukrainian industries have suffered a heavy blow by the lack of natural gas and electricity. National industrial production decreased by 7.4 percent in 1993. And it dropped 32.7 percent in January against the same period last year. On the surface, Russia has the right to ask Ukraine to repay its debt. But in fact, Russia asking for the money at this time conveys deep economic and political significance. Exports of natural gas to Western Europe have always been an important channel for Russia to earn foreign currency. But 95 percent of its exports must be carried through gas pipes across ukraine, for which Russia must pay a great deal. Therefore, Russia's threat to cut off the gas supply is usually met by Ukraine threatening to cut off the pipelines. And Moscow is worried by the fact that Kiev could intercept their gas exports at any time. In addition, Kiev has many underground storehouses to preserve natural gas for emergency use in case Moscow discontinues the supply. Russia must control the pipelines in order to defeat Ukraine in this dispute. So it was suggested during negotiations held on March 10 that Ukraine pay part of the debt with cash and part with shares of its gas facilities. It has been reported that Russia insisted on obtaining 51 percent of the shares, thus controlling the pipelines. This was refused by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk. But Ukraine has agreed to pay its debt of about 370 million U.S. dollars to Russia this year with cash. Moscow's request for debt payment appears to be politically motivated. It is no coincidence that on March 3, when Russia decided to reduce the gas supply, Kravchuk was visiting the United States, which is trying to improve relations with Ukraine, and giving economic and political support to the former Soviet republic. Worried by the possibility that its influence over Ukraine will lessen as the country approaches Western nations, Russia took action on the gas supply to warn Kiev not to harm Russian interests. Meanwhile, pro-Russia forces in eastern Ukraine and nationalists in western Ukraine are both busy preparing for the upcoming parliamentary elections. The new parliament will play an important role in the development of ties between the two countries. The "KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA" newspaper said Russia raised the issue of gas supplies at this time in order to back the pro-Russia forces and create for itself a favorable political environment in neighboring countries. This dispute not only has strained economic relations between the two countries but also cast a shadow over Ukraine's smooth implementation of the nuclear disarmament treaty. The Ukrainian president, while visiting the U.S., said that the gas supply was not only a question of economics, but also involved many other issues. He added that if Ukrainian industries were closed because of a lack of natural gas, the nuclear disarmament process would be harmed. Kiev also accuses Moscow of owing pipeline transportation fees of about 100 million U.S. dollars, and it does not rule out the possibility of retaliation once Russia cuts off the supply. Under these circumstances, this controversy is likely to be long lasting, regardless of any progress which may be achieved in the next round of talks. And the issue will be used by Russia as a way to control economic and political relations between the two countries, and to gain concessions on other disputes such as the Black Sea Fleet, the division of ex-Soviet Union overseas properties and the Crimea issue.
