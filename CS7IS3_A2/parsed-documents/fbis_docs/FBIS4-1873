Thanks to its booming processing industry, which has enjoyed priority in development, the province has jumped up during the 15-year reform drive to join the richest in the country. But it found that further development was being hindered by poor infrastructures, which had been neglected for a long time. In the past five years, with a strategic shift to capital construction, a great number of infrastructural projects have been completed. Last year, nearly four billion yuan was poured into the field, 2.4 times as much as in the previous year and one-fifth of the province's fixed asset investment. In the sphere of posts and telecommunications, the province has completed eight optic-fiber items and opened 13 new air mail routes. Telephones installed in cities can be connected with both domestic lines and international lines. Portable phones and pagers have even appeared in remote towns. Transportation often has a great effect on investors' decisions on where to invest their funds. With dozens of projects having gone into operation in the province, more than 70 of Zhejiang's airlines [as received] are now carrying passengers to 20-odd cities at home and abroad, such as Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Tokyo. Cargoes pass through the province's 58 ports, which link the province with over 50 countries and regions. Apart from thermal power and hydropower, the province is set to make full use of other energy sources like wind, tides and nuclear power. Qinshan nuclear power station, the first Chinese-designed and Chinese-built nuclear facility, is under construction in the province's Haiyan County. Infrastructural facilities in the province will see a great improvement when a batch of projects on the drawing board are realized. They include a hydropower station invested with two billion yuan, a freeway link-up with Shanghai and a railway from Jinhua city to Wenzhou city within the province. In addition, the local government has joined hands with foreign partners to explore crude oil and natural gas in the east sea off Zhejiang's coast.
