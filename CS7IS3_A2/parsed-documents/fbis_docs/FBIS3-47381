In recent years, the province has seen the commissioning of the Kumgang motor joint venture company, the Wonsan export garment factory, the Anbyon granite factory and many other industrial establishments, the reconstruction of the Munpyong smeltery, the Tongchon export fisheries station and the Anbyon ceramic factory and the expansion of their capacities. The industrial output has been on the yearly increase in the province. Last year's industrial output was 8.6 percent above the previous year. It has consolidated the foundation of agricultural production in reliance upon its own farm machine production base capable of manufacturing tractors and motors. Grain output has risen systematically. The grain harvest last year was 30 percent up on the previous year. A progress has been noticed in the fisheries which hold a big proportion in the economic structure of the province. The Wonsan and other fisheries stations have received more 3,750-ton stern trawlers and other fishing boats and the area of the sea culture has been largely expanded. The cities and rural villages have taken on new looks. The province built dwelling houses for nearly 7,000 families last year. High-rise apartment houses of tower, folding screen and other styles have been built in Tokwon and Kalma districts and other places of Wonsan, the seat of the province, adding beauty to the port city of culture. Multi-storied houses for hundreds of families and parks and recreation grounds have made their appearance in the seats of Kosan, Sepo, Tongchon and other counties. Rural villages have changed beyond recognition as socialist modern villages. Pongsan-ri, Anbyon County, where multi-storied houses supplied with gas are standing in forests of persimmon trees looks like a canvas of picture. The province with many beauty spots directs big efforts to the construction of tourist resorts. Last year, tourist hotels, cultural amusement and welfare facilities were built in scenic Mt. Kumgang, Songdowon seabeach and on the bank of lake Sijung. The Wonsan-Mt. Kumgang express highway and other tourist roads are available in the province.
