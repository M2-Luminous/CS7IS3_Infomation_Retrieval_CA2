This wing comprises two squadrons of fighter bombers and two of transport aircraft, from which will come the eight F-18's and two Hercules resupply aircraft which will take part in the operation. Defense Minister Julian Garcia Vargas yesterday discussed with Defense Chief of Staff Lieutentant General Jose Rodrigo the details of the deployment, which will be approved within the next few days, once the outstanding problems have been resolved. One of them is identifying the base where the aircraft will be stationed. According to military sources, this will quite likely be that of Aviano in northern Italy, since eight U.S. F-18's are deployed there, and this would enable the Spanish fighters of the same model to share logistic support. The Defense Ministry is also seeking to secure assurances that the Spanish unit's presence in the area will not be prolonged indefinitely, but will be on a rotating basis and will be limited to three months in principle. According to the Air Force plans, the contingent will comprise around 200 military personnel -- including pilots, mechanics, and support personnel -- commanded by a lieutenant colonel. The eight F-18's, six of which would operate simultaneously, will go with their crews, relieved each month, and with the commander of the squadron of origin in charge. Repeated Request The aircraft will join the air operation deployed by NATO in Italian bases and aircraft carriers in the Adriatic, comprising 100 aircraft from the United States, the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, and Turkey, under the command of the commander of the Fifth Tactical Air Force, based at Vicenza (Italy). Spain, which had hitherto refused to take part in the operation, reconsidered its refusal after NATO repeated its request a few days ago. Defense Minister Julian Garcia Vargas said yesterday that the decision to send the aircraft will be taken "in the middle of this week, when some logistic problems have been resolved," EFE reports. "There are problems of maintenance and effectiveness which we must discuss" with the United States, he explained. Garcia Vargas stated that the countries taking part in the operation "are at the limit of their means, especially as far as contributing crews is concerned. That is why we are discussing the possibility of our providing this relief for three months." He added that he informed the opposition last weekend, although "not all the groups as yet, because their leaders are engaged in an election campaign." United Left spokesman Antonio Romero, who was informed by the minister yesterday, declared himself opposed: "We do not agree with taking part in NATO actions, and still less with sending F-18 fighters which guarantee not peacekeeping but a military escalation."
