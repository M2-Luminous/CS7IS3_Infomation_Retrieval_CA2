The Federation Council in Figures"] [Text] Like the upper chamber in the parliament of the Russian Empire (the State Council), the Federation Council is characterized by greater conservatism than the State Duma -- naturally so, of course. The typical Russian senator is a man (95.3 percent) and a nonparty person (84.8 percent), aged between 40 and 50. Akhsarbek Galazov, chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of North Ossetia, and Yuriy Chernichenko, writer and leader of the Peasant Party, which is part of the Russia's Choice bloc, (both born in 1929) can lay claim to the title of the oldest members of the Federation Council, while the youngest is Sergey Levitan, president of the "Nostromo" concern (born in 1963). Representation of the electoral associations and other political organizations in the Federation Council is very limited: Just 26 Council members (15.2 percent) indicated membership of them. The undoubted leaders in this respect are the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (10 seats) and the Russia's Choice bloc (eight Federation Council members). The Agrarian Party of Russia, the Party of Russian Unity and Accord, the Russian Movement for Democratic Reforms, the Labor Party, the All-Russia "Renewal" Union, and the Constitutional-Democratic Party (Party of People's Freedom), the Union of Communists of Karelia, and the "Peoples' Cocreativity in the Name of Life" association, which are little known to the voter, each got one deputy into the upper chamber of parliament. It seems that for the majority of "party" senators, as distinct from State Duma members, membership of a particular pressure group is secondary and unimportant. The largest group of members of the Federal Assembly's Federation Council is made up of heads of executive and representative power in the components of the Federation. Presidents, council of ministers chairmen, administration heads, and governors make up 34.5 percent of the Federation Council (59 people). It is noteworthy that in a number of components of the Federation two representatives of the top executive power were elected simultaneously to the Federation Council -- such as, for example, Kabardino-Balkaria, where both the president and the prime minister became members of the upper chamber of parliament (in this case we have placed the prime minister in another category -- that of representatives of the local executive and legislative power). Heads of soviets are represented considerably more modestly -- 19 people, or 11.1 percent. Members of the Russian Government, employees of the federal executive, representatives of the president, and representatives of components of the Federation under the president make up just 5.8 percent of the Federation Council (10 people). This enables us to speak of the Federation Council as an organ representing the executive and local elites. The total number of "senators" in the categories we have enumerated is close to a qualified majority (64.3 percent). The main thing in doubt is the capacity for work of this section of the Federation Council and the possibility, if only purely technical, of blocking State Duma decisions with which a majority of Federation Council members disagree. Precisely 23 entrepreneurs were elected to the Federation Council (13.5 percent). Their composition is substantially different from those elected to the State Duma -- they are, as a rule, leaders of major joint-stock companies and top managers of giant state enterprises like Sergey Korepanov, director of an office of the "Gazprom" Russian Joint-Stock Company. The Federation Council does not have many jurists who were professionally engaged in jurisprudence at the time they were elected; in fact there are five (2.9 percent). There is the same number of higher educational institution principals and lecturers. There are three journalists in the upper chamber of parliament (1.8 percent) -- as distinct from the State Duma, they are not mainly party publicists but editors and creative employees of popular local newspapers. To judge from the initial characteristics of the membership, one of the main tasks of the Russian Federation Federal Assembly's Federation Council will be to coordinate widely understood local interests. I would like to hope that the Federation Council members, Russia's senators, will proceed from Russia's national interests in their approach to assessing the State Duma's draft laws.
