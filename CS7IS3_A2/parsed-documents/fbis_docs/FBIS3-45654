The reform will allow 12 railway bureaus across China to have more say in planning, finance, employment and wages. The decision was based partly on the success of an experiment carried out at the Jinan Railway Bureau in Shandong Province last year. Apart from the railway bureaus, the industrial, construction and material firms in the railway system will take bigger strides in changing their operating styles, Han said. Moreover, bolder corporate reform will be tried in a limited number of railway sub-bureaus, such as the Fuzhou Railway Sub-bureau in Fujian Province--mainly by converting them into solely-owned or limited liability companies. The Guangzhou-Shenzhen Railway Company even plans to turn itself into a shareholding firm and perhaps issue stocks publicly within the year. The minister also offered to open up Chinese railways wider to the outside world now that international capital is eager to enter the Chinese railway construction market. The first step will be issuing railway stocks and bonds in overseas monetary markets to attract foreign investors to railway projects in China. This year the ministry will encourage experts from home and aboard to study opening-up tactics and present specific co-operation projects. "If we want to speed up rail development, we must actively break into the market at both home and abroad," Han told the meeting. It is necessary to do away with old taboos, because joining the market is the only way to ease the bottlenecks in the railway system, which is the State's pillar infrastructure he added. In line with this initiative, railway transport units will earmark the bulk of their freight cars for shipping key materials, such as coal and disaster relief supplies, while the remainder will be used for commercial transport under contracted freight rates. To meet market demand, the ministry is ready to form a batch of specialized firms dealing in container and large-scale cargo transport, insurance, telecommunications and tourism. The ministry will initially raise 29 billion yuan ($3.3 billion) of investment for this year's capital construction, a growth of 6.5 billion yuan ($747 million) over last year. The fresh input is to result in 2,100 kilometres of new lines, the double tracking of 1,335 kilometres of existing lines and electrification of another 194 kilometres. The record-high figures suggested another high tide of railway construction this year. The majority of the planned investment will flow into seven major railway projects.
