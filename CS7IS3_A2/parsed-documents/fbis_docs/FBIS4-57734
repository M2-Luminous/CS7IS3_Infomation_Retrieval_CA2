Cavallo referred to the controversial topic of the so-called super secretariat at the end of a ceremony in which agreements were signed for supplying drinking water to several provincial localities with financing from international organizations. "President Carlos Menem has given a lot of importance to the topic and it is he who will finally decide it," the minister said.
