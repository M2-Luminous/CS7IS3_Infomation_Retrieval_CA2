Based on the overall analysis of testimonies given by defectors from the north, we conclude that various North Korean military and government agencies perceive that Kim Chong-il places his utmost trust in the Party Operations Department as he recently issued his guideline to WPK Operations Department stating, "The soldiers who would defend the Party even to the very end and prevent any rebellion are the combatant troops of the WPK Liaison Offices," and instructed massive reinforcement of treatment and training of the combatant troops. Specically, Kim Chong-il, at every possible opportunity, takes an inspection tour of the Party Operations Department, gives the combatants his highest praise, and expresses his trust in them saying, "The fighting spirit and the training of the Party Operations Department combatants are superior to those of any other units and the operational capability of them, though small in number, exceeds that of a People's Army Corps strength." The reason for Kim Chong-il's trust in the concern for the Party Operations Department combatants is because the unit's mission, which ordinarily is to guide and guard North Korean espionage agents to and from South Korea, would instantly become a special mission to crush any such element in case of an internal coup d'etat within the power structure or an appearance of threat to the regime's life. In other words, Kim Chong-il, fearing plots of coup d'etat within the Ministry of People's Armed Forces and the General Gerard Bureau, is nurturing the Party Operations Department combatants to be his most trustworthy power center to be his personal guards and to check against those other agencies. Facts supporting this analysis are that O Kuk-yol (a general) who was discharged from the position of Chief of the Armed Forces General Staff in February of 1988 became Director of WPK Operations Department and commands the troops of the department and that the emphasis of training for the department combatants has shifted, after Kim Chong-il's instructions on "maintaining the capability of riot control," to maintenance of the system and the capability for execution of conventional warfare, from the past unconventional type training designed for operations against the south. O Kuk-yol is the son of O Chung-hap, a partisan associate of Kim Il-song's, who acted as the top military assistant with Kim Chong-il's total trust having successfully led the effort to eliminate Yi Yong-mu, chief of the Armed Forces General Political Bureau, who resisted Kim Chong-il's being selected as the successor in the mid-70's, but was discharged from the position of chief of the Armed Forces General Staff because of his conflict with O Chin-u, minister of the People's Armed Forces. During the period of semi-state of war declared by North Korea in March to counter the "U.S.-South Korea combined excerise: Team Spirit `93," combatants of the Party Operations Department took, for their conventional warfare skills, a 6000 li (2400 kilometer) round trip march along the provinces of Pyongan, Hwang-hae, and Kangwon, during which they conducted such conventional warfare training exercises as seizure and demolition aimed at military organizations and other agency/installation, snowed cave bivouac, assault, and ambush, that have little bearing on the performance of their originally designated mission. In the meantime, the North Korean Government, in order to comply with Kim Chong-il's directive of total trust and special treatment, made an enormous improvement in salary and rations for the combatants. A combatant senior lieutenant receives a salary of 155 wons per month, exceedingly higher than all other senior lieutenants' 100 wons per month salary, and daily allowances of 800 grams of rice, two eggs, 200 grams of meat, 150 grams of fish, and three or more varieties of fresh vegetables, and a weekly allowance of 200 grams of glutinous rice or flour. This special treatment of combatants of the Party Operations Department makes their allowance of rice three times higher and their other food allowances twice as much as those of other military officers, rank by rank, and they nearly equal the levels accorded to members of the 2nd Security Guard Division of the General Guard Bureau which is in charge of Kim Chong-il's personal protection.
