Working under the sun and at the seashore, challenging and transforming nature, the men here are placing rock upon rock to build the road that will link one piece of land with another. These builders are grouped within the Las Villas Campaign contingent, the goal of which is to complete the rock-fill embankments that will link Caibarien with the northern villages. I met them while participating in the contingent's parliament. Pedro Ross Leal, secretary general of the Cuban Workers' Federation, also attended this parliament. Unlike the other contingents we visited, the workers here did not talk about difficulties, lack of fulfillment, inaction, inefficiencies, or other irregularities. These men of legend, as Ross Leal described them, proudly outlined their achievements: the 41,358 meters of embankment they completed, the 24 bridges they built, the low production-cost rate, and the low accident rate, among others, which are victories of our history. They also told us about their ingeniousness to save and protect the scarce raw material, as in the case of the 18-gauge wire that is used to tie the rods [cabillas]. This wire was replaced by steel belts taken from discarded tires. And the 24 bridges were built with wood models which were used from beginning to end. The Las Villas Campaign contingent has only 7 km left, to complete the rock-fill embankment from the northern part of Villa Clara to Caibarien. Our daily deeds and achievements are recorded all along that white rock-fill strip in the middle of the sea. At the parliaments, those workers from Villa Clara have reaffirmed their willingness to keep building efficiently, with the same quality that has always characterized them. These projects are sponsored by several organizations. Concerning the country's internal finances, the members of the Las Villas Campaign contingent defended the liberalization and increases in alcoholic beverage and cigarette prices, maintenance of the revolutionary achievements such as public health and education, and the payment of some gratuities. [Begin recording of unidentified speaker] In fact, since 1959, through the first article of the Constitution, the Revolution has provided for man's full identity. This was also one of the first things I discussed with Marti [not further identified]. The government has been subsidizing a large number of products for the people, and I think the time has come for us workers to make some sacrifice. Let us begin by admitting that in order to guarantee the continuation of the free education and health programs given to us, the state to a certain extent needs to collect something in order to maintain those services. These services require much money. For instance, I was watching television the past few days, and I think that 99.9 percent of us watch that television series. How many people are watching that series? Imagine how much could be collected if each Cuban had to pay no more than one peso for watching such shows. Or perhaps we could pay in accordance with the quality of the show. If the show is of lesser quality, then we should pay a little less. But why should we be reluctant to pay for something we enjoy watching, something the people enjoy watching? Why should we reject the idea of accruing a given amount of money to be self-sufficient in sports in this country, for instance, because the state has been fully financing this. There are other aspects: water, for instance. All Cubans are now receiving water free of charge. We are not thinking of installing meters at this moment because it would be a rather complex situation. But we could establish a fixed monthly payment for water, and that would also provide some income for the state. Electricity is another aspect that requires more attention. It consumes much fuel, which also has a high cost. We must increase the per-kilowatt cost of electricity because that would also create the habit of conserving electricity among the people. We must make a sacrifice. And whom are we going to ask to make sacrifice but the revolutionary workers. For this reason, we believe that all aspects that are subsidized by the state must be thoroughly analyzed and to the extent possible, increased in price to prevent further subsidies. [end recording]
