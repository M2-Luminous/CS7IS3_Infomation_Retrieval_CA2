And this was reflected in the State of the Union message that he read out Tuesday [25 January] at the joint session of both houses. The President seemed optimistic, confident, and resolutely determined to achieve by the end of the year objective number one for 1994 -- the introduction of a free health care program for all Americans, which would mark a historic turning point similar to the adoption of Roosevelt's first social measures in the 1930's. The bill, submitted by the government and drafted by First Lady Hillary Clinton herself, doubtlessly will undergo modifications during its debate in Congress, but Clinton has already threatened that any version that does not embody the principle of health care for all will be vetoed. At the same time, the President tried to avoid a tone of ideological controversy and to make the White House impartial in its role as guarantor of national interests. On some issues, such as the fight against crime and the reform of the welfare system, he did not hesitate to espouse the Republicans' traditional arguments. Clinton's intention thus was to stress the "centrist" position, the plataform on which he was elected in November 1992 and which many accused him of having relinquished after his first year in government by falling back on the theories of the "liberal" left. In this context the point on which the President focused his entire speech is all the more significant -- that is, the need for a "return to traditional values" (comprising the three elements of family, community, and work) that was another of the themes used by the Republican Party in the past. Its endorsement by Clinton confirms his determination to tackle the United States' problems on a new, realistic and not ideological, basis. This approach has received the approval of a large majority of the country, and the opinion poll held immediately after the speech shows that 84 percent of Americans agree with the President's approach. The task of every State of the Union message is twofold -- to indicate to the country what direction the government intends to pursue in the year ahead and to define the legislative program that it will submit to the houses. Although the plans to step up measures against crime will be approved easily with the support of both parties, the conflict over health care is almost bound to continue throughout the year. The Republicans accept some parts of it, but sharply reject others, and it will be necessary to find a compromise. The part of the speech devoted to foreign policy confirms that this remains the sector in which Clinton moves with the least confidence and the greatest difficulty, lacking a clear vision of the relationship between theory and reality. Apart from the very vigorous reaffirmation of the determination to maintain the United States' international leadership role and the commitment to continue along this path, the trouble with the picture the President presented to America in the present international situation is that it was either too generic or falsely optimistic. The principle on which Clinton wants to base foreign policy -- "the strengthening of the democratic area in the world," that is, a kind of new Wilsonism -- seems like an empty slogan devoid of both a realistic perception of the problems and a consistent strategy. The best example is provided by the sharp deterioration of the crisis in Russia. In this connection the President repeated the old theory about the desire to facilitate the process of reforms in Russia and urged Congress to join this effort. But he did not even mention the increasingly serious threats now presented to Washington by Yeltsin's return to an inflationist economic stance and the resurgence of neoimperialist nostalgia. An example of this former threat came with yesterday's confirmation of the resignation of Economy Minister Boris Fedorov, one of the reformist leaders; while an example of the latter is the new Russian parliament's vote against Western military measures against Serbia. Neither of these alarming developments was mentioned in Clinton's speech, though he spoke at length about aspects that have become entirely marginal, such as nuclear and space agreements with Russia. With regard to the Middle East, the President reaffirmed, resolutely but obviously in general terms (as, for that matter, he did with almost all aspects for foreign policy), support for the current peace process between Israel and the Palestinians, while admitting that we face a "long and difficult road, but one which America intends to pursue with supportive action." The Bosnian question was mentioned almost in passing, and the same went for the Somali crisis and the Haitian problem. Despite the possibility that this will cause difficulties in the future, for the present the outlook looks promising for Clinton. Of course, his prospects of success depend to a large extent on the evolution of the situation that has favored him hitherto. The President did not hesitate to attribute the major economic recovery to his last year's policy, entailing a deficit reduction, a fall in interest rates, and creation of new jobs. In the belief that for the present he has won the "economic battle," Clinton did not put forward any new initiatives in this field, counting on the fact that the expansive trend now set in motion will continue through 1994. For that matter, most experts agree with him, although they note the possibility of a clash between the White House and the Federal Reserve over the issue of interest rates. The Fed, anxious to nip in the bud any return of inflation, wants to raise them, but Clinton opposes it. For the present the future holds two dangers for the President: The first is an exacerbation of the Russian crisis, restoring a climate of instability throughout East Europe; and the second would be the emergence of further disclosures in the Whitewater case. It has not yet affected Clinton's popularity, and the information that has emerged hitherto has been received by the country with a certain degree of irritation. However, it remains to be seen whether during the inquiry that is starting now there will emerge further disclosures capable of changing people's minds about the situation.
