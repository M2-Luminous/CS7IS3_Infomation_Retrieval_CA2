Preliminary investigations prove the assassination was carried out by direct orders from Baghdad and that a large sabotage network, including diplomats, carried out the operation. Perhaps it is not unusual for the Iraqi regime to carry out such practices because it relies on methods of killing and bodily liquidation as official policy, even inside Iraq. The question is: What could the Iraqi regime reap from such murder? The deceased shaykh had lived in Lebanon for a long time. Lebanese circles say he respected the principles governing his presence as a guest and was not a direct threat to the Iraqi regime, although he devoted his life to serving his people's causes. It is indeed very sad for Iraqis to see their regime implementing these murders. But the fact remains that the Iraqi regime continues to live in isolation, outside the contemporary world. It is futile even to imagine that there is any possibility that this regime will behave differently and stop its ugly methods, known to Iraqis, Arabs, and foreigners alike. Iraqis are sad and indignant because of the crimes committed by their regime. This is indisputable. They are not just witnessing what is happening, but are confronting it with the means at their disposal, waiting for the right opportunity. It is unacceptable and unreasonable for conditions in Iraq to continue as they are now and for the regime to continue gambling with the fate of the land and people, after all the disasters it brought to them over the past years -- disasters whose humiliating results are impossible to comprehend. Nevertheless, the Iraqi regime continues to dispatch sabotage, sedition, and killing missions without doing anything positive about Iraq, which is now under trusteeship and whose people are suffering pain and want. Many strings connected with al-Suhayl's murder have been unraveled. The Iraqi charge d'affaires in Beirut himself heard what the detained diplomats said about the murder and the instructions they had received directly from Baghdad. Lebanon has regained its strength and unity. It has said it will not allow sabotage gangs, whether they are Israeli or are linked with the Saddam regime, to carry out acts of killing and terrorism on its territory, that all the vicious acts will be referred to the law so the killers will take the punishment they deserve.
