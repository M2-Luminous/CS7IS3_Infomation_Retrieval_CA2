FBIS4-13473 "drnes077_d_94001" FBIS-NES-94-077 Daily Report 19 Apr 1994 Libya Al-Qadhdhafi Addresses Coastal Workers Al-Qadhdhafi Addresses Coastal Workers LD2004112794 Tripoli Libyan Television Network in Arabic 2058 GMT 19 Apr 94 LD2004112794 Tripoli Libyan Television Network Arabic BFN [Speech by Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi; date and place not given--live or recorded] [Excerpts] It is my pleasure to be here where you are stationed and where you are carrying out pioneering work on the frontline, constructing an advanced trench and confrontation line and an historic fortress on our Mediterranean, the Arab sea, coast. You are fortifying the coast. You are the first battalion of the sons of our people to undertake this kind of voluntary work. You have left your family, your children, and your private work. [passage omitted] We offer this as an example to the rest of the Libyan people that our people are capable of carrying out the necessary work by relying on inner resources. You have paved the way for the Libyan people with this pioneering work and the attendance from all parts of the jamahiriyah. [passage omitted] This presence has given comaraderie its true meaning. This comaraderie is historic and this group is historic. People get to know each other then forget each other, meet and separate, forget each other, and memories fade. All except for this comaraderie. The page of this comaraderie has not been closed. We have decided to leave this page open in order to record in it the work we want done by our will, and open to our children and grandchildren to record further work on the path of this historic comaraderie. [passage omitted] Consequently, this comaraderie has entered the annals of history. For my part, I will make a pledge and in honoring this pledge to those who have known me or who have been my comrades, I will make every effort to prevent any cause for regret that he has known me or has been my comrade. I am committed to this pledge. I am committed to this. I will try not to let anyone, his family, or his children at any time regret knowing this person or being his comrade. On the contrary, I want those who have known me or who been my comrades to praise God for that comaraderie and acquaintance. I want his children, his family, and his grandchildren also to praise God for that acquaintance and comaraderie -- except for those who have been unfair to themselves. This applies equally to comrades from the days of study and those who subsequently joined the death convoy [qafilat al-mawt] at military college or the army -- except for those who have betrayed themselves. Those who betray comaraderie and their comrades or who abandon and turn against comaraderie, their guilt is their own. This is an historic matter. I am being hard on myself in order not to let any comrade suffer regrets about comaraderie. No, those who have not been our comrades may regret it and say: I wish I knew those people, I wish I were a comrade of those people, and I wish I were one of those comrades. As for the comrades themselves, I want them and their children to praise God for having been comrades and becoming one of the comrades. In fact, we are writing something into our history that is regrettably missing; it is now missing in this nation. There is nothing but ingratitude, repudiation, hypocrisy, liquidating comrades, forgetting the past, and obliterating good memories. We have seen these things in Arab revolutions and coups, Arab political systems, and Arab political parties. Everything around the Arab political arena has produced nothing but tragedy, ingratitude, repudiation, liquidation, idolization, and oblivion. Those things will be gone with the wind and those pages will be closed. Furthermore, they will be thrown into the garbage can and into oblivion. With this comaraderie we are giving comaraderie its sacred meaning. I believe that this nation needs...[pauses] is morally bankrupt and this may be the reason for bankruptcy in other areas. [passage omitted] The work you are doing will strengthen the missing morals and the meaning of loyalty and will give history a meaning. This is the comaraderie of men and it is vastly different from all other comaraderies which are bad and will lead to perversity, regret, and sorrow. One would regret having been a comrade of that person. [passage omitted] We feel sorry for those who have been unfair to themselves and who have betrayed comaraderie. However, perehaps some people think that we are reffering to a particular comrade when we talk about those who have betrayed comaraderie. Things like that come from those who joined later and those who joined us at other stages and for other reasons. However, all those people are surprised that those comrades who have remained loyal, revolutionary, and sincere for 30 years. None of us betrayed...[pauses] None of the comrades...[pauses] We have known each other since 1956 and 1959 when we sat down and planned the revolution, staged demonstrations, and mobilized the vital forces for the people's revolution. None othose comrades deviated. The fact is that we should draw a line between this historic comaraderie and the military among whom I formed a movement within the armed forces to stage a revolution in 1969 to lead the Libyan people. This is what happened. [passage omitted] When people in the military go astray and start having fascist aspirations, this is to be expected and should not affect our comaraderie at all. When an officer whose rank is highter than mine, who took part with me in the movement, two months later wanted to turn against the revolution, conspire, or do something against it, this has nothing to do with you in my assessment. The fascist spirit among the military is well known. It is always inclined to tyranny and even conspiracy and so on. [passage omitted] As you have seen, all the attempts of the fascists since the advent of the revolution have failed. Why is that? Because they are facing a people's revolution. They thought that the revolution started when Mu'ammar Al-Qadhdhafi started mobilizing cadets in the military academy and officers in the armed forces. [passage omitted] I found that all those students in the schools were ready, for instance, to demonstrate for a Pan-Arab or national cause, and I commissioned this or that cell and told them to organize for revolution. Now you are spreading this atmosphere among the Libyan people. People are now regaining their consciousness. Many of them are regaining their consciousness. Even those who conspired against the revolution and those whom we pardoned, are now saying: Brothers, how wrong we were! [passage omitted] I really praise God that you are all happy with this comradeship and that you say: Thank God that we were comrades. Your children are happy, your families are happy. Our comradeship is a source of pride for you, your children, and your families, a source of personal and family honor. [passage omitted] You have actually proved that it is not merely a matter of shouting slogans or talking, but one of pioneering work. We believe that your Libyan brothers will follow in your footsteps and affirm that you have opened the way for them. Crowds of Libyans will come forward for voluntary work, to fortify the coast or to build the railroad. This railroad must be built to link the Arab homeland and to serve Arab unity despite the circumstances imposed on us, despite the colonialists and those who challenge us. We must transform this crisis into positive work and transform the disadvantage to an advantage through our will. We must defy them and say to them that in the midst of these circumstances the more you increase your challenges, the more we will pose a challenge; we will do things which we did not do when there was no challenge. We will become more stubborn and we will defy them with work. The Libyan coast should eventually -- and I cannot set a date -- be such that they the enemies will exclude it from their plans for landing. They are looking for the easy land, the paved land, the sandy land which will offer no resistance, and they would like to have the upper hand. They want profit without loss. They want something without loss. We have to show them that the loss will stem from thinking of committing an aggression against Libya and that the Libyan coast will be their graveyard. Here we are actually digging. As I said earlier, we are not only digging trenches and canals in order to use the sea water to drown the coast. We are digging a graveyard for the enemy if he comes to this land. In fact, my inspection of this region today has revealed to me things about which I was talking with Muftah and the others. The inspection revealed that there is a fertile land, rain falls every year in the region, and there are water springs and water wells, like this well here, which are the extension of Ayn Tawurgha'. We thought that these lagoons we constructed using sea water could become fish farms, and at the same time become fortifications for the coast. All this land could become farms. We thought that one day modern houses could be built -- I mean a house in every area, and the owner of the house would have either a fish farm, a vineyard, palm trees, or grazing land. This is a region of rich grazing land and we could plant vineyards, fig plantations, and so on. We could introduce fish farms. Eventually, this place will not only be profit-making. Whoever agrees to settle here will be a frontline settler. Those who settle in this region will be frontline settlers. They will have a permanent and historic bond to settle in this region, defend it, exploit it and benefit from it. Anyway, I am happy -- very happy -- to be among my comrades. Please convey my greetings to your families. May our comradeship continue for ever.
