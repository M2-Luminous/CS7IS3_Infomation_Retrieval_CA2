Members of the public who need additional assistance to participate should contact Ms. Dulin as soon as possible to make arrangements. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The United States Navy has explored ways to comply with restrictions on the discharge into the ocean of solid waste generated aboard its ships. The basis for the restrictions, the Navy's efforts to comply and its strategy for achieving future compliance are set out below. Restrictions on Discharge of Solid Waste at Sea The United States is a party to the International Convention on Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, S. Treaty Doc. No. 3, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. (1987). The 1973 Convention was amended by the MARPOL Protocol in 1978, 17 I.L.M. 546 (1978), and the combination is frequently referred to as MARPOL 73/78. MARPOL 73/78 protects the ocean environment by prohibiting some discharges altogether, restricting other discharges to particular distances from land, and establishing ``special areas'' within which additional discharge limitations apply. MARPOL 73/78 deals with particular types of discharges in five annexes. Annex V addresses discharge of garbage from ships. MARPOL 73/78 was implemented for the United States in the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS), 33 U.S.C. 1901 et seq. Annex V has been implemented for the U.S. by the Marine Plastic Pollution Research and Control Act (MPPRCA), Pub. L. No. 100&hyph;220, 101 Stat. 1460 (1987), codified at 33 U.S.C. 1901 et seq. , and section 1003 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994, Pub. L. No. 103&hyph;160, 107 Stat. 1745 (DAA&hyph;94). MARPOL 73/78 provides enhanced protection to particular bodies of water, designated ``special areas,'' because their oceanographic characteristics and ecological significance requires protective measures more strict than other areas of the ocean. The stricter requirements become applicable once the International Maritime Organization declares that the special areas are ``in effect'' after determining that the littoral countries have sufficient capacity to handle wastes from ships.
