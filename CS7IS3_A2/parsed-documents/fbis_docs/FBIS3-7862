What aim does this visit have? [Karadzic] This is an invitation, an official invitation to our delegation to come to have talks mostly about the peace process and the first visit will certainly pass mostly in further examining the possibilities of reaching peace; both peace in general and the one around Sarajevo, possibly around Tuzla regarding the opening of the airport, and so on. In a word, Russia is now much more present both in a diplomatic and a military sense and we are very pleased to be going to Russia. [Avramovic] Whom are you going to meet in Moscow? [Karadzic] Our hosts are Churkin and Kozyrev. We are certainly going to meet them and we shall see about the rest. So far, we do not know the plan.
