Well-informed sources in Cairo have told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the Israeli plan includes a three-phase Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights; the first phase includes a withdrawal from three out of five villages on the Heights. [passage omitted] The sources pointed out that Israel does not want to implement an integrated peace process at once on all Arab-Israeli tracks. It is seeking to conduct partial and phased implementation on each track individually, with a transitional phase after the implementation of each peace plan. Well-informed Syrian sources have told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that Washington held meetings the evening of the day before yesterday with Syria, Lebanon, and Israel in preparation, the sources believe, for a discussion of the issue of Christopher's return to the region to continue his efforts regarding the peace process. [passage omitted] In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT a Syrian official held Israel responsible for increasing tension in the region and pushing the peace process toward collapse. The official said that "Israel continues to deliberately escalate the situation and work to create a climate and conditions for continuing the war and exposing the Lebanese people's lives to danger and annihilation -- which threatens to destroy the peace process." The Syrian official stressed "the resoluteness of the Lebanese and Syrian position in the negotiation process, and no one can separate the two tracks." The official added that "Israel's aggressive practices against Lebanon have exceeded all limits. No one can remain silent about them, they must be confronted. Israeli aggression must be confronted." The official urged the international community to put an end to the policy of murder and destruction which has become an integral part of Israel's strategy for the occupation of southern Lebanon. The official described Israel's practices in southern Lebanon as terrorist actions, pointing out that this puts the region as a whole in a troubled and serious atmosphere and brings to mind the atmosphere of the war Israel is once again seeking. The official said: "Thus a prompt move is needed to stop Israeli practices, provocations, and the positions adopted by Yitzhaq Rabin's government," adding that Israel would be very mistaken if it believes that it can continue to have a free hand to strike as it wishes. It must realize well that Lebanese resistance is stronger than Israeli aggression, because it is a legitimate right and supported by international legitimacy." [passage omitted]
