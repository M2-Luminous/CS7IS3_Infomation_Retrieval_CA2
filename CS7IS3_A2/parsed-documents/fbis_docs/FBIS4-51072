This is the largest fair of this type that the mainland has held in Hong Kong in recent years. Four ministries and state commissions and 24 provinces and municipalities have sent their delegations to the fair, where 760 projects were arranged for inviting investment. Zheng Silin, vice minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, and other responsible officials from the ministries and state commissions concerned attended the opening ceremony of the fair and yesterday's symposium on China's foreign trade and economic cooperation. When attending these activities yesterday in Hong Kong, Zheng Silin said that China opposed the practice of linking human rights and other non-trade issues with most-favored-nation status. If the United States revokes China's MFN status, both sides will incur losses and China will not be the only side harmed. As for whether China will terminate the current favorable policies in order to meet the GATT regulations on the treatment of nationals, Zheng Silin said that China will not terminate the current favorable policies for the five special economic zones and other open cities, but will gradually bring the policies toward state-owned enterprises and other areas into line with the policies for the foreign-funded enterprises, the special economic zones, and the open cities. He said that China is comprehensively considering how to bring its foreign trade policy better into line with the relevant GATT regulations and other international practices, such as in the aspects of the tax policy and the equal competition mechanism. The foreign-funded enterprises will enjoy treatment equal to that enjoyed by Chinese nationals, and the investment environment will be further improved so that foreign investors' interests in China will enjoy double guarantees from both domestic and international law. When mentioning the prospects for China's import and export trade, Zheng Silin said that China's basic policy for foreign trade is to seek a general balance between imports and exports under the premise of maintaining the necessary foreign exchange reserves. Increasing exports in order to ensure a sustained increase in imports is the positive method China has used to seek a balance in trade. It is expected that the volume of China's imports will reach $1,000 billion over the next seven years. Ma Xiuhong, deputy director of the Foreign Investment Management Department of China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, also indicated on the same occasion that, as the amount of foreign investment is increasing, the Chinese Government will attach greater importance to investment made by transnational corporations which possess advanced technology and management expertise. In particular, it will encourage transnational corporations to invest in capital-intensive and technology-intensive projects. China has selectively approved the establishment of foreign investment companies which are allowed to invest in many industries, many fields, and many geographic areas and which are allowed to manage and provide comprehensive services for their investment projects in China. China is considering the relevant policies for the establishment of transnational corporations' Asia-Pacific headquarters, Asian headquarters, China headquarters, and regional management organs in China. Ma Xiuhong said: Between 1979 and 1993, China approved a total of 174,000 foreign investment projects in China. The agreements for these projects involved more than $220 billion in foreign funds, and foreign investors actually injected over $60 billion in funding. Funds from Hong Kong and Macao ranked first in terms of the amounts of investment from outside the mainland. By the end of 1993, Hong Kong and Macao businessmen set up over 110,000 investment enterprises, and the investment in the relevant agreements exceeded $150 billion, with over $39 billion being actually used.
