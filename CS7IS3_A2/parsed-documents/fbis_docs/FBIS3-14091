Palestinian sources reported that dozens of people were wounded. At several locations, including Hebron, the clashes took place when the Army removed the curfew for several hours in order to permit local residents to buy provisions and youths began hurling rocks at the soldiers. A pregnant woman was apparently killed by IDF [Israel Defense Forces] gunfire in Hebron. The IDF is investigating the circumstances of the incident. A girl from the Jabalyah refugee camp in the Gaza Strip died from her wounds this morning after being wounded in a shooting incident with soldiers several days ago.
