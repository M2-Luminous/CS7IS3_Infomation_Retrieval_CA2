FR940610-0-00003 FR940610-0-00002 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 94&hyph;ANM&hyph;2] Modification of Class D Airspace; Pasco, WA AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This action modifies the Pasco, Washington, Tri-cities Airport, Class D airspace by excluding additional airspace overlying the Vista Field Airport, Kennewick, Washington. This action will allow operations to and from the Vista Field Airport without radio communication with the Pasco Airport Traffic Control Tower. EFFECTIVE DATE: 0901 u.t.c., August 18, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: James Riley, ANM&hyph;537, Federal Aviation Administration, Docket No. 94&hyph;ANM&hyph;2, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington, 98055&hyph;4056; telephone number: (206) 227&hyph;2537. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: History On April 4, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) by modifying the Class D airspace for Tri-Cities Airport, Pasco, Washington (59 FR 15668). Airspace within a .9-mile radius of Vista Field Airport is presently excluded from the Pasco Class D airspace. Recent construction at the Vista Field airport has resulted in closure of the east-west runway, requiring aircraft operating to runway 02/20 to fly over the Columbia River outside the present airspace exclusion. Interested parties were invited to participate in the rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal. No comments were received. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D airspace is published in Paragraph 5000 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class D airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. The Rule This amendment to part 71 of Federal Aviation Regulations amends Class D airspace at Pasco, Washington by excluding additional airspace overlying the Vista Field Airport Kennewick, Washington. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 71 Airspace, Incorporation by reference, Navigation (air). Adoption of the Amendment In consideration of the foregoing, the FAA amends 14 CFR part 71 as follows: PART 71_[AMENDED] 1.
