FBIS4-58194 "drnes085dd_94004" FBIS-NES-94-085 Daily Report 2 May 1994 Palestinian Affairs Executive Committee Views `Oppression' in Jerusalem Executive Committee Views `Oppression' in Jerusalem LD0205210394 Algiers Voice of Palestine in Arabic 1702 GMT 2 May 94 LD0205210394 Algiers Voice of Palestine Arabic BFN [Text] During its meeting held on 1 May, the PLO Executive Committee discussed the dangerous situation in Jerusalem. This holy city is being exposed to the most serious isolation by the occupation authorities with a view to cutting it off from the rest of the Palestinian territories and dividing the Palestinian land itself. The occupation authorities have taken unprecedented measures by depriving the Palestinian nationals of their natural right to enter the city of Jerusalem, including the right to visit holy Islamic and Christian sites to perform their rites. These authorities have gone so far as to violate the most basic rights and human values, including the right to life. They are preventing doctors, teachers, and employees from working in the city in their hospitals, schools, and other jobs. They are also preventing students living outside the city from going to school. They are preventing women, families, and couples, some of whom live in the city and others outside it, from being together. Discrimination, oppression, and violation of human rights are taking place while the Israeli Government is claiming that it intends to start a new page in its relationship with the Palestinian people. However, these measures and this harassment have become more vicious over the past few days under the guise of steps aimed at preparing for the signing of the first practical Palestinian- Israeli peace accord. The PLO regards the encirclement, isolation, repressive measures, and continuing settlement in Jerusalem and its suburbs as incompatible with the essence, the foundations, and the texts of the peace accord, including Israel's commitment through the exchange of letters not to touch Jerusalem and its civilian and religious institutions and the rights of Palestinian nationals in general. The PLO stresses that these Israeli measures will eventually undermine the peace moves because Jerusalem's future is a basic element in the peace process. The PLO also calls on the Arab and Islamic states to adopt a firm position toward the danger that is threatening the future of holy Jerusalem and its steadfast population, especially when Israel is calling for, under the guise of the peace process, moves toward the normalization of relations and the lifting of the economic boycott. It is doing this while it is continuing its dangerous measures to determine the future of holy Jerusalem by imposing a fait accompli. The PLO holds the cosponsors and the states contributing to the peace process, particularly Russia, the United States, and the European Community, responsible for this dangerous situation and its effect on the future of the entire peace process. The PLO will take a series of measures to protect the future of the holy city and the population living there and the inalienable rights of our people in the city. These rights have been stressed by all of the resolutions of international legitimacy.
