Form Nos.: FCC Forms 175, 175&hyph;S Expiration Date: 05/31/97 Estimated Annual Burden: 100,925 total hours; .25&hyph;20 hours per response; 13,400 respondents. Description: In the Second Memorandum Opinion and Order in PP Docket No. 93&hyph;253, the Commission modified and supplemented several of its generic rules governing the auctioning of all licenses subject to competitive bidding. For example, the Commission will permit applicants to participate in auctions where the applicant certifies that a request for a waiver or declaratory ruling concerning the requirements of Section 310 is pending. The Commission modified its collusion rules to permit bidders who have not filed Form 175 applications for any of the same licenses to engage in discussions and enter into bidding consortia or joint bidding arrangements during the course of the auction. The Commission established detailed standard affiliation rules for determining all size-based eligibility requirements. The affiliation requirements are intended to prevent entities that do not meet the size standards from receiving benefits targeted to smaller entities. To ensure that only legitimate designated entities are the beneficiaries of special provisions, the Commission imposed stricter eligibility requirements on these entities. The Commission requires that designated entities to substantiate their eligibility by describing how they satisfy the requirements for eligibility. Federal Communications Commission. William F. Caton, Acting Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;25541 Filed 10&hyph;14&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6712&hyph;01&hyph;F
