President Ramiro de Leon Carpio attended the ceremony. During his speech, the president referred to the importance of the event: [Begin de Leon recording] This meeting clearly exemplifies the existence of a general, spontaneous movement to achieve a united criteria, links in the chain of progress toward a better Guatemala in all aspects. Upon seeing all of you gathered here, I am moved to finally see the initial fruits of an action favoring the signing of peace. I invite you to do everything within your reach to make this first meeting for peace and reconciliation precisely that: the first of a series of similar meetings in which a group of brothers will seek the best for their fellow human beings and for themselves. I ask you not to be deterred by fear in the face of a situation to which we are not accustomed, because we have been immersed for so long in a fratricidal war. I also ask you not to listen to those who do not believe in, disqualify, and label as a betrayal the act of participating in this peace process in Guatemala. In these meetings, I ask you to face the new Guatemalan reality with enthusiasm and dedication. Peace depends on the political resolve of the parties that are directly involved. That resolve exists with total certainty on the part of the government, over which I am honored to preside. That political resolve, allow me to say, has been totally confirmed and proven in the past months, in the past hours, and in the past minutes in Oslo. This has been confirmed not only on the part of the friendly countries of the process but, in general, by the entire international community. That is why I dare say the government is more concerned that that peace, which for us is and should be irreversible, should be a lasting peace. That is why we must all prepare for it, to fight the causes that might generate new outbreaks of groups that are discontent not for ideological reasons but, rather, for economic or social reasons. We must attempt to achieve the total and absolute respect of Guatemalans' human rights, not just individual rights because we are on that path, but also, and especially, economic, social, and cultural rights.
