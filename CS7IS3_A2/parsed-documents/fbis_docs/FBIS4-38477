On 23 May, Anatoliy Zlenko received U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine William Miller at his request. The American diplomat handed the minister a personal message from U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher which, in particular, noted that the United States recognizes and highly praises Ukraine's responsible and peaceful position regarding events in the Crimea. The United States, the message stressed, supports the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine in its present borders. The United States seeks to expand and deepen relations with Ukraine, and would like to move forward rapidly in assisting Ukraine through economic encouragement programs that could be beneficial for the entire country, including the Crimea. The Ukrainian Embassy in Germany said that the German Foreign Ministry circulated a declaration by the country's Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel that stated the following: "The Federal Government has been anxiously watching the recent events in the Crimea. Ukraine's territorial integrity and independence, necessary for stability and peaceful relations in Europe, must not be questioned. The Federal Government hopes that all interested political forces are aware of the meaning of fundamental obligations within the framework of the CSCE and the unconditional need to comply with those obligations." A declaration by Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas noted that Lithuania would welcome the earliest possible settlement of the situation that has taken shape in the Crimea based on the principles of international law. He expressed his hope that the Crimean peninsula will not become a source of danger and instability, putting in jeopardy the security of the region and the entire continent. Iwo Byczewski, Polish deputy foreign minister, expressed his understanding of the Ukrainian position and noted that the situation in the Crimea should be solved only by peaceful means. Martinsh Virsis, a parliamentary secretary at the Latvian Foreign Ministry, said he understands Ukraine's anxiety over the source of destabilization in the Crimea, and assured that Latvia supports Kiev's position based on generally accepted principles of international law. Concern is heard in messages received from Slovakia and Moldova. Moldova, which knows particularly well what separatism is all about, understands Ukrainian efforts to create a coherent state and will support those efforts, the Moldovan deputy foreign minister stated. Moldova also offered to create some kind of declaration on preventing separatism along with Ukraine and Georgia. Practically all states responded to the letter from official Kiev. The Crimean issue has recently attracted much attention from the foreign media. Many publications understand the current situation and express their concerns. Some draw parallels with the beginning of the Yugoslav conflict, others of Karabakh, Sukhumi, the Dniester region (the command of the Black Sea Fleet and the 14th Army), and so on. Some Russian media claim that the Crimean situation is instigated by Kiev which wants to use it as a tool to cancel presidential elections in Ukraine. On the other hand, Polish media point to some of their Russian colleagues, particularly from the Ostankino channel, whose coverage of Crimean events provokes instability on the peninsula.
