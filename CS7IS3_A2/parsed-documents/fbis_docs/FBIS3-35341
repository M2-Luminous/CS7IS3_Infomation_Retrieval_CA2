The sources told Qatar News Agency that the two leaders also pledged not to sign a unilateral peace accord with Israel, and that progress should be achieved on all tracks. The two leaders denounced Israeli attempts to reach separate peace accords with Arab states involved in the peace process and expressed strong support for the comprehensive peace formula based on UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, the sources said. The sources noted that Syria emphasized that it was politically committed to working for the implementation of Security Council Resolution 425 calling on Israel to withdraw from southern Lebanon. The sources said Syria has already turned down an Israeli offer to separate the question of the Israeli occupation of the Syrian Golan Heights from the Israeli occupation of south Lebanon, and at the same time, Syria reaffirmed that a balanced solution should be achieved on all tracks. Syria has succeeded in convincing the United States, via recent contacts between Damascus and Washington, about the importance of implementing Security Council Resolution 425, the sources said.
