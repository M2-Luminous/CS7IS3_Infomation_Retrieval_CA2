In January, the combined effects of more imports and a new decline in petroleum revenues generated a 26.9 percent increase in the trade deficit over the January 1993 figure, according to preliminary reports from the Bank of Mexico. In January, the Mexican foreign deficit trade balance -- without including figures from assembly plants -- was $1.831 billion, that is, 29.9 percent higher than January 1993. The Bank of Mexico also indicated that imports for January totalled $5.551 billion, that is, 20.3 percent higher than same period in 1993. (Mexico City LA JORNADA 21 March 94 p 39) The Mexican Employers Confederation has said Mexico is currently experiencing its "highest unemployment in history and that no immediate solution to this problem seems near." Meanwhile, the Private Sector's Center for Economic Studies has assured that the drop in employment was practically across the board in all activities in 1993, when over 200,000 jobs were lost. (Mexico City UNOMASUNO in Spanish 22 March 94 pp 1, 10) Mexican Petroleum (PEMEX) has begun renegotiating credit with banks in Japan, Europe, and the United States for a total of $1.1 billion that will be used to help pay a debt contracted in 1979. This debt totalled $1.5 billion at the end of 1993. For PEMEX, the payment of this debt is of great importance as it equals 90 percent of the financial obligations contracted before the so-called "debt crisis." (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 22 March 94 p 8) The Bank of Mexico's international monetary reserves increased to $27 billion in January, that is, $4 billion more than in December 1993. The Banorte Financial Group indicated that the current turbulence in financial markets is locally generated by political and not economic factors and from abroad, due to the hike in interest rates in the United States and the trade conflict in Japan. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 22 March 94 p 5) On 9 March, outstanding government securities held by foreign investors totalled 80.3 billion new pesos, a 11.5 billion increase over the end of 1993. These figures, according to the Bank of Mexico, indicate that foreign participation in the purchase of government securities continues to rise, adding that the turbulence in the exchange and stock markets is short term. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 23 March 94 p 7) Mexico and Costa Rica have agreed to eliminate export subsidies for agricultural products as of 1999. At that time, both countries will renounce both the rights established under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) that grant the use of export subsidies and any rights that could result from multilateral negotiations within GATT. But as of 1 January 1999, neither of the two nations will be allowed to continue or introduce subsidies for the export of its reciprocal trade. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 23 March 94 p 20) PEMEX's 1993 taxes rose to 55.409 billion new pesos, a figure that includes both direct and indirect taxes. This represents 3.7 billion pesos more than in 1992 "under the adoption of a tax regime that acknowledges the new organizational structure of this institution and its subsidiaries." At the end of 1993, PEMEX paid the Treasury a total of 32.945 billion new pesos for hydrocarbon extraction rights and in other direct taxes. (Mexico City LA JORNADA in Spanish 23 March 94 p 49) Today, the National Bank of Mexico (Banamex) signed a new line of credit for $75 million with the Export Development Corporation to finance capital goods, equipment, and services imported from Canada. Banamex explained that this credit will support the reconversion and modernization of the industrial sector and the struggle against environmental contamination. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 0307 GMT 25 March 94) This year Procampo (Program for Direct Support to the Countryside) has earmarked 244 million new pesos for Chiapas that will benefit 90,000 families, Carlos Hank Gonzalez, secretary of agriculture and hydraulic resources (SARH) has reported. During a working tour, the secretary handed out 44,220 new pesos to 107 producers of basic crops who are registered in development district number 02 in San Cristobal de las Casas. The SARH secretary indicated that the executive has issued instructions that special support be extended to Chiapas producers. (Mexico City LA JORNADA in Spanish 24 March 94 p 9) This year, PEMEX's Exploration and Production Division, with an investment of 7 billion new pesos, will undertake a number of strategic projects for the incorporation of reserves, development of petroleum potential, and the development of new production fields. The goal is to maintain existing production of hydrocarbons and to add to the nation's proven reserves, given that in the past decade these reserves have declined. (Mexico City LA JORNADA in Spanish 24 March 94 p 10) Thanks to strict budget discipline, increased internal sales and savings in some sectors, and lower operating and investment costs, PEMEX generated a primary surplus of 4.149 billion pesos in 1993. That figure is 3.2 percent higher than the 1992 amount. PEMEX financed its investments with revenues generated internally as part of the framework of the payment of direct and indirect taxes. This allowed PEMEX to preserve its solid financial structure and maintain a satisfactory operational cash flow. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 28 March 94 p 31) The National Foreign Trade Bank reports that the opening of trade has favored the United States in the last five years to the tune of $15 billion with regard to Mexico. Currently over 80 percent of Mexican exports go to that country, while 71 percent of imported merchandise is from the United States. Changes in foreign trade patterns promoted by this government appear to have increased dependency on one market: the United States. Only 3 percent of Mexico's exports go to Canada, while 1.6 percent of Mexico's imports come from that nation. (Mexico City LA JORNADA in Spanish 28 March 94 p 21) According to the British ambassador to Mexico, the UK plans in the short term to increase its investments in Mexico -- currently at $2.6 billion -- in the petrochemical, automobile, and tourism industries, despite the period "of confusion and destabilization that the country is now enduring." The ambassador said the murder of Institutional Revolutionary Party candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio will in no way discourage foreign investors or cause capital flight. Meanwhile, the Panamanian ambassador said that the current unstable situation will in no way affect the signing of new trade agreements. (Mexico City LA JORNADA in Spanish 28 March 94 p 2)
