However, recently, semiconductor manufacturers have been using batch-type ashing machines and/or single-wafer ashing machines, depending on the process involved, as a means of maximizing efficiency. This is the result of the problems encountered in trying to rely solely on batch-type ashing machines to remove the photoresist used in masks for high energy ion implantations during the diffusion process now that wafers are getting larger in diameter and manufacturers are switching from specific CFC agents to halogen-type gases in the etching process as a means of eliminating CFCs from that process altogether. The manufacturers of ashing machines are carrying out development work aimed at responding to these new requirements, and in practically every case, they are focusing on single-wafer ashing machines capable of accurately controlling process conditions. Although single-wafer ashing machines offer the best processing and status control for individual wafers, they suffer from low throughput when processing wafers that are not capable of being processed at high temperatures. In this report, we study techniques for high-speed ashing with the goal in mind of enhancing the throughput of single-wafer ashing machines. High-speed Ashing The ashing rate is largely dependent on the temperature of the substrate during processing. Heating the stage that the substrate is loaded on to 200xC or higher enables an ashing throughput rate of between 2-3fm/minute. However, since there are those substrates that cannot be subjected to such high temperatures, the definition of high-speed ashing will differ for different types of substrates. That is, as long as the substrate undergoing the single-wafer ashing process does not contain metal, such as aluminum conductors, conventional processing can be readily applied since the substrate can be processed at high temperatures, and throughput will be higher than that for batch-type ashing machines. However, when the substrate contains aluminum or other metal conductors, the task is to see how far reaction efficiency can be raised while maintaining the actual temperature of the substrate at under 200xC. And in the case of the resist used in ion implantation masks, the task is to strip the resist from the surface without bursting the hardened surface layer, and to see how much processing time can be shortened in the process. Whatever the situation, the key is to facilitate the control of the actual temperature of the substrate while seeing how efficiently the reaction can be advanced. And it must be a process for which charge-up and irradiation damage, and contamination are minimal. The following is a list of the capabilities that must be developed to realize each of these requirements. Those capabilities related to the plasma source are as follows: [1] The ability to supply stably and with high efficiency active species (primarily neutral particles) to the substrate to achieve a high rate of processing and process repeatability; [2] The ability to confine to a certain extent charged particles to the plasma generation region without the use of grid electrodes or magnetic fields so as to achieve a high rate of processing with low damage; [3] A heating system that readily controls the actual temperature of the substrate and a means of eliminating thermal factors other than the heat of reaction. Those capabilities that will have to be developed for processing substrates containing aluminum conductors and other metals are as follows: [1] The ability to achieve a practical ashing rate (goal is more than 2.0fm/min for 8-inch wafers) at the mass production level while maintaining the actual temperature of the substrate at under 200xC during the separate oxygen plasma processes; [2] The ability to clear each of the target values in the various damage evaluations (non-volatile memory evaluation, and BT and other contamination evaluations). And the capabilities needed to remove the resist used on high-concentration ion implantation masks are as follows: [1] The ability to strip at high speeds the resist from the hardened surface layer with minimal ion collision (ion dose); [2] The ability to process at high speed and with little damage the internal unaltered layer after stripping the resist from the surface layer; [3] The ability to achieve homogeneity (in-plane) of less than q5%. Development items related to other processes are as foillows: [1] The ability to remove polymers following various etching processes utilizing halogen gas; [2] The development of conveyance mechanisms that will make it possible to get the most out of process performance. Although the thinking at the various ashing machine manufacturers differs as to how to accomplish it, they are all studying ways to create processes and hardware capable of satisfying the above-described requirements for single-wafer ashing machines. Current State of High-speed Ashing Figure 1 shows a diagram of a basic ashing machine chamber. The process data put forth below gives characteristic data obtained from Tokyo Oka Kogyo's new single-wafer ashing machine ``TCA-3822'' as reference values. Figure 1. Diagram of TCA-3822 Plasma Chamber It was initially assumed that a high ashing rate (2.0fm/min.) with low damage could be achieved using an oxygen plasma alone while maintaining actual substrate temperature at under 200xC if we established a reaction system comprised primarily of neutral particles (radicals and oxygen atoms in a normal state) and carried out process control using the hardware. However, we found that a high ashing rate could not be achieved with a reaction system comprised solely of pure neutral paticles, and that minute amounts of oxygen ions would also be required. We also realized that to keep damage to the minimum, it would also be necessary to distribute this minute amount of oxygen ions (and electrons) uniformly on the surface of the substrate. Based on these discoveries, we (Tokyo Oka Kogyo) took the measures discussed below, and by so doing, reached the conclusion that a practical ashing rate of around 2.0fm/min. can be achieved even when substrate temperature is held to below 200xC. First of all, in addition to efficiently supplying active species (mostly neutral particles), we also adopted a large capacity (3.0slm) high-speed evacuation structure capable of evacuating the reaction-producing gases in a short period of time. Next, we developed a plasma source capable of stable discharge under a wide range of pressures. We are designing an electrode structure that will enable the direction of the high frequency field of the new plasma source we developed to remain constantly fixed, and by comparing ashing operations using this new electrode with those using our own conventional electrodes, we are steadily improving discharge stability. Improved discharge stability suppresses the effects of the process parameters, and makes it possible to achieve wide process margins. Furthermore, emission spectrum comparisons of the reaction region showed that even if high output is applied, the oxygen ion dose is roughly 1/5-1/8 or less of the conventional dosage. We have also been able to confirm the outstanding effects of stable discharge on the confinability of charged particles in the plasma generation region1). Figure 2 shows the results of comparisons of emission spectrum data obtained using the company's conventional electrode and the new electrode we recently developed. Figure 2. Comparison of Emission Spectrum Data Thirdly, we controlled process conditions in the downstream region (transport process) so that the traces of oxygen ions and electrons that reached the substrate without completely vanishing cannot cause a large potential distribution. By taking the above-described measures, we were able to achieve an ashing rate of better than 1.8fm/min on 8-inch wafers, which was close to our goal of 2.0fm/min., and in-plane homogeneity of less than q5%. The actual temperature of the silicon substrate during this ashing process was less than 200xC. Figure 3 shows related measurement data. This data was obtained by applying resist to a special temperature measurement substrate with a thermocouple embedded directly into it, and measuring the substrate temperature during the ashing process. The temperature of the substrate rose during the ashing process as a result of the heat of reaction, but dropped again as soon as the ashing process was complete. Figure 3. Temperature of Si Substrate (Under 200xC) Figure 4 shows measurement data on a substrate whose temperature was held to less than 250xC during ashing. This process achieved an ashing rate of less than 4.0fm/min. and in-plane homogeneity of under q8%, indicating that it would be beneficial for ashing processes where processing temperatures are not restricted very much. Figure 4. Temperature of Si Substrate (Under 250xC) Next, Figure 5 provides data on plasma damage measured using the SCA method. This method measured as Qox values the amount of surface charge increase resulting from plasma processing. Figure 5. Plasma Damage Measured Using the SCA Method This data indicated that the new high-speed single-wafer ashing machine exhibited smaller damage values than the coaxial batch ashing machine so widely used in mass production operations at present (the high-speed single-wafer ashing machine also achieved very favorable results when subjected to evaluation methods using non-volatile memory.). Next, a physical reaction accompanied by ion collision is essential to the high-speed stripping of resist used in high-concentration ion implantation masks. And damage should be slight if the process can control, uniformly and to the lowest limits, the ion energy irradiated on the wafer separate from the plasma generation mechanism. There have been a lot of papers written in recent years on the removal of dopant that accumulates on substrates in the form of oxides following the removal of ion implantation resist2). In tests carried out by Tokyo Oka Kogyo, we were able to confirm that after-treatment or post-processing using plasma directly following the ashing process was effective against inorganic residue (See Figure 6). Figure 6. Plasma Post-processing Directly Following Ashing In addition, from the standpoint of improving total throughput, to include derating wet-stripping processes, we will talk briefly about sidewall removal following dry etching. The residue left following metal etching in particular, because it contains metals among its constituents, is difficult to remove completely using dry-stripping processes involving oxygen alone, giving rise to studies aimed at adding a gas process (right now, this residue is being removed by the combined use of an alkaline solvent in the wet-stripping process.)3). The development task is to determine how much the ``roughness'' and ``cracking'' in the bed caused by an additional gas process can be held in check, and how well processing can be achieved with ordinary cleaning without using alkaline solvents. The target is a completely dry-stripping process. Conclusions Future ashing machines will be required to achieve faster total processing times, which means it will be necessary to develop high-speed processing capabilities that include the development of processes that meet all requirements and improving the hardware aspects of these processes, such as shortening conveyance and stand-by times. Ashing machine manufacturers will have to be persistent in their development operations, and the development of rational machines will be an absolute condition for accurately meeting users' needs. Here at Tokyo Oka Kogyo, we intend to strengthen our development and commercialization efforts even further to enable the provision of more advanced machines that meet our customers' expectations.
