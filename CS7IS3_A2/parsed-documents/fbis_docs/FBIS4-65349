[Murmann] With one that further reduces public spending, cuts the taxation and debt burden, and tackles structural reforms in the social security system. [Bier] What does industry think of Scharping as a chancellor...? [Murmann] Securing Germany as a business location is also one of Mr. Scharping's aims. But I fear that the actual policy of the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] would fall back into its old models and thinking patterns, for instance regarding taxation and monetary policy. [Bier] ...And what about a red-green coalition? [Murmann] I prefer a Kohl government. The economy and a red-green coalition are not at all a favorable perspective for Germany as a business location. I do not think much of putting together certain and uncertain risks. [Bier] What do you think of the SPD's plans to change the solidarity surcharge to a tax on higher incomes? [Murmann] I have already spoken of patterns laden with ideology. I would like to warn against attacking top performers. If the SPD sticks with exchanging the solidarity surcharge for a supplementary charge after the election campaign, it will also have to increase taxes. [Bier] What do you think of a super ministry combining economic and financial affairs? [Murmann] Although I am very much in favor of reducing the number of ministries, and although the work of the economics ministry urgently needs to be reconsidered, I favor keeping them separate. [Bier] Do government employment promotion programs help industry? [Murmann] Government employment programs burden the existing jobs through additional taxes. But we need cheaper jobs to get the unemployed back to work. This cannot be done overnight, but it is the only sensible solution.
