Despite Moscow's indifference to the elections and referendum in Ingushetia and the fact that it provided no money from the budget to pay for them, the required billion rubles, according to Batyr Taldiyev, chairman of the republican district electoral commission, had been found in the republic's coffers. Seventy-five polling stations opened at 0800 that Sunday morning where 105,000 voters (without taking into account the Ingush people who came from North Ossetia during the Ossetia-Ingushetia armed conflict) came to express their will. The Ingushetia presidency was contested by current President Ruslan Aushev and Bamatgirey Mankiyev, a former state farm director. According to preliminary data, Ruslan Aushev won by a landslide. This had not been doubted in principle if one thinks about the small artillery preparation for the presidential elections two weeks ago in which Ruslan Aushev declined to run for the presidency, saying that his motive was his unwillingness "to bear responsibility for a repeat escalation of tensions owing to the ineptness of some politicians," because, in his view, "the current policy would lead to a new flare-up of the Ossetia-Ingushetia conflict this April or May." The Ingush president has lately been sharply critical of the Russian Federation temporary administration in the Ossetia-Ingushetia conflict zone because, he thinks, it puts the brakes on the implementation of Boris Yeltsin's edict on a phased return of Ingush refugees to four population centers of North Ossetia's Prigorodnyy Rayon. In the wake of the president's dramatic statement, the majority of eligible Ingush voters unanimously decided, as a snap poll showed, that Ruslan Aushev "cannot be excused from the president's post, and he cannot go against the will of the people." He collected 70,000 votes in his support. Ruslan Aushev voted yesterday for the republic's draft constitution and for 27 deputies for parliament. Mr. Aushev did not vote for president and vice president, thinking that "voting for himself is unethical." The new president is to meet soon with the head of North Ossetia. The question of a possible meeting had already been taken up at the experts level. True, negotiations about the return of Ingush refugees to North Ossetia's Prigorodnyy Rayon would hardly be a simple matter because North Ossetia President Akhsarbek Galazov, who had the idea for the meeting, stated that the problem of normalization of relations between the republics is being forced into a blind alley in which one of the sides (implying the North Ossetia side) is being pressured.
