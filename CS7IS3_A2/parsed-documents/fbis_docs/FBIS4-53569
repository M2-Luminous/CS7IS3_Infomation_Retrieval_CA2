The Tokyo District Court is expected to hand down a ruling by the end of the year after Fujinami, 61, and his lawyers deliver their final submissions July 14, court officials said. He is the first suspect from within the political circle to face a ruling in the series of Recruit scandals that jolted Japanese politics in the late 1980s. Fujinami was charged with receiving 10,000 unlisted shares and 20 million yen in checks from Recruit in exchange for political favors.
