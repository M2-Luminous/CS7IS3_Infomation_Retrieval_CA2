I hope that the good wishes and salutations from the president of the Russian Federation will set the tone for the State Duma's work, bring us all together in a businesslike and constructive mood, and usher in a work pattern of harmony and cooperation. I should like to add a few words from myself, on behalf of the Russian Government. The first day of work of a fundamentally new parliament elected by the citizens of a sovereign state provides good grounds for reflecting on the lessons of the recent past. We have traversed a long and difficult road together -- the road from declarative sovereignty and the formal attributes of the independence of Russia to a state that draws up its own borders and its own armaments and forces and occupies a worthy place among the world powers. This is the road of new economic realities which, although encumbered by a multitude of problems, are already delivering our fatherland from a topsy-turvy economic world. This is the road of awareness of the impermissibility of hostility and confrontation -- the road to the new political realities of this new year, which are emerging as a result of the people's approval of the new Constitution and of the elections to the Federal Assembly. The results of the referendum and elections are unambiguous on the main point: the citizens of our country opted a new Russia, for a strong power, for political stability, for reforms and democracy. The state has acquired a firm legal foundation, and it is now our common duty to finish building the edifice of our new Russian Federation statehood. The government is ready, and will work jointly with the corps of deputies in all areas of legislative activity -- and together we have plenty to do here. That's putting it mildly. To date, there are about a hundred bills that have been prepared by the government alone that are ready to be submitted for examination by the State Duma. They include a civic code for the Russian Federation, laws on delegated management of property, on mortgages, on making amendments and additions to taxation legislation, laws on banks and banking activity, the foundations of land, labor and housing legislation, and many others. Esteemed deputies: there are in our native language two related words which I, as chairman of the government, would like to exclude from the political style of the executive branch of power. They are intolerance and impatience. Renouncing the first means primarily an ability and readiness to hear and listen -- to hold constructive dialogue with a political opponent. For this reason, taking account of everything that is useful and promising in the economic resources of the factions and other deputies' associations represented in the Federal Assembly becomes an everyday obligation of the government. Second -- what it is that the government should renounce --- impatience, which in striving for quick results has frequently led us, and still leads us today, to mere outward effects, but far from always equally effective decisions. The prohibition on impatience envisages primarily scrupulous work on bringing order to all the resources of state economic policy. I am convinced that order in the state economy begins with establishing order in the work of the government. A presidential decree actually aimed at this has been signed. The results of the elections bear out that the limits to society's patience have to a considerable degree been exhausted. But it has to be soberly acknowledged that slackening efforts and attempts to soften the burdens of the crisis by populist measures will not bring alleviation, but will only drag out this stage of the development of the crisis and the associated deprivations. Analysis of the first results of the work that has been done on the state of the economy and existing problems enable us to draw an important conclusion. The prerequisites have arisen for moving on to a new stage of reforms -- the stage of stabilizing the economy -- when the center of gravity of all the government's activity shifts to creating favorable conditions for the work of Russian manufacturers. In order to implement this task, I shall make every effort to consolidate the activities of the government, the parliament, and the Russian Central Bank. In social policy we are bound to turn the reforms face to face with the people. Social policy for us means not only targeted support for the poor, but also granting all citizens the possibility of having worthy living conditions. We intend to proceed without sudden and unjustified shifts in policy and ill-considered shock decisions. We are pondering a certain adjustment in our program of practical actions. Most of what we want to do is compatible with the basic principles contained in the pre-election policy documents of many parties and electoral blocs. In my view, this provides a real basis for joint work by the government and parliament. The government expresses confidence that this work will succeed. We are geared precisely for this. I hope that this is how it will work out. I wish you success in your work. Thank you. [applause]
