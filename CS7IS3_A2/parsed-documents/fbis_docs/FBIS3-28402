In a meeting with Secretary of State Christopher, Foreign Minister Han is expected to earnestly discuss the conclusion of an extradition treaty between the ROK and the United States. The ROK and the United States have set the date of 21 February, when the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] Board of Governors' meeting is scheduled, as the deadline for the settlement of the nuclear issue. Depending on North Korea's attitude toward the nuclear issue, therefore, the 18 February meeting between Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and U.S. leadership may be the last meeting to discuss follow-up steps for after 21 February. Concerning North Korea's attitude toward the settlement of the nuclear issue, a relevant government high-level official said on 5 February that "as of today, the IAEA and the United States have not received any official notification from North Korea regarding its position to cancel its decision to delay the withdrawal of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty," and that "there is therefore no change in the ROK and U.S. Governments' positions of resolving the nuclear issue through dialogue." He said that "it will indeed be difficult to resolve the nuclear issue through dialogue once international sanctions have been imposed on North Korea," and added: "It is sensible to continue efforts for dialogue with the North Korean side, since there is no way of knowing what results will be gained once sanctions are imposed on North Korea." He said that "reports by foreign papers that North Korea would refuse to accept nuclear inspection by the IAEA are not true."
