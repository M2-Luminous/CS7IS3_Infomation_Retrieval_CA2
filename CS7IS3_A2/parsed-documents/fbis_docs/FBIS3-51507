The documents, which AFP received tonight in advance, are addressed to Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho and Samuel Ruiz, bishop of this city. They note that the guerrillas have not received "any written communication" regarding the proposed amnesty announced last week by the government, which would cover rebel actions staged between 1 and 16 January. In this regard, the rebels note that the "mentioned amnesty law" is "premature in the current dialogue process, because the political and social causes that gave rise to our movement still prevail."
