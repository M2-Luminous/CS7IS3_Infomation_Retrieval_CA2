[Begin Czerwinski recording] This does not mean that 51 enterprises have been closed down. It means that military production has been moved from those enterprises, or will be moved from them. Why do we have to do this? Well, there was a time when our armaments industry was geared to production not just for our army but also for the army of the Warsaw Pact. The needs of that army, the needs of a global conflict and the provisions for such a scenario were very, very much higher than they are in the present defense doctrine, which only envisages the defense of the country. We do not intend to privatize this sector. We want to retain proprietry control over these enterprises. Of these 31 enterprises 10 to 12 are in very good financial shape, a further 10 are improving. [end recording] The minister imparted the information that the Ministry of National Defense [MON] had, and has no intention of buying the Czech Albatros training and combat aircraft instead of the Polish Iryda aircraft. Let me remind you that two days ago the MON refused to buy the 36 commissioned Irydas produced by WSK-Mielec. The refusal was explained by, among other things, the fact that these aircraft were not the training and combat versions the ministry ordered and that their price was not competitive enough. The Mielec Solidarity spokesman announced that there will be a protest regarding this matter. [Begin unidentified Solidarity spokesman recording] I know that Minister Kolodziejczyk is not opposed to the Iryda plane. All that was said was that a training plane was not, at the moment, needed by the army. I knowing the Iryda plane, and I know that it is a training and combat plane. Following my meeting with deputy minister Kuriata, Minister Pol intends to meet Minister Kolodziejczyk. The problem, of course, is: Where to find the means to purchase the plane? [end recording]
