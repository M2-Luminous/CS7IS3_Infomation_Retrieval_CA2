Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Kim Yang-pae told the press Thursday the government had revised its farm market opening schedule submitted to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) on March 11 through bilateral negotiations with the United States, the European Union and Australia, which pressed for revisions. The revised schedule is to be sent to the GATT Secretariat on Friday, he said. Under the revised schedule, rice imports will be 51,307 tons a year, the level first set by the government. The U.S. Government retracted its demand for 56,000 tons. The new schedule calls for exclusion of 26 items, including pork, chicken and raw silk, from the 118 items subject to import fees under the March 11 schedule. Tariff rates on 385 items, 29.3 percent of the 1,312 items for import liberalization under the schedule, will be lowered and an ad valorem duty, charged as a percentage of the value of an item, will be applied on 1,249 items. The number of items upon which an ad valorem duty or a specific duty can be selectively applied decreased from 97 under the March 11 schedule to 63 under the revised one. In addition, tariff rates on 354 items will be lowered to the levels set under the first schedule submitted in April 1992 at the request of the United States and other countries. Potato powder imports will be increased from 10 tons to 60 tons a year, while the duty on ice cream powder will be lowered from 60 percent to 40 percent.
