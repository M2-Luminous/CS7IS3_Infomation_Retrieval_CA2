FR940523-0-00009 FR940523-0-00004 Two commenters recommended that the divorced spouse of the principal entrepreneur be entitled to have his or her conditional resident status removed. One of those commenters also suggested that children who reach the age of 21 or marry during the conditional residence period should be able to have their conditional resident status removed. Section 216.6(a)(1) of the proposed regulation clearly states that children who marry or reach the age of 21 during the conditional residence period can be included in the principal alien entrepreneur's petition to remove the conditions. The Service has carefully considered the commenters' suggestion that divorced spouses of alien entrepreneurs should also be allowed to remove their conditional residence status. The Service agrees with the commenters that divorced spouses of alien entrepreneurs should be able to remove their conditional resident status as long as the divorce occurred during the conditional residence period. Accordingly, section 216.6(a)(1) of the final regulation will allow divorced spouses of alien entrepreneurs to remove their conditional resident status. The children and the present or former spouse of the alien entrepreneur may be included in the entrepreneur's petition to remove the conditions or they may file a separate petition to remove conditions. They are eligible to have their conditional resident status removed only if the Service removes the alien entrepreneur's conditional resident status. Two commenters urged the Service to state in the regulations that the legality of the source of the alien entrepreneur's funds should be determined by U.S., rather than foreign standards. The commenters are concerned that aliens would be precluded from applying lawfully acquired funds which were taken out of a country in violation of its export currency laws and placed in a new commercial enterprise in the United States as qualifying capital. The only provision in the proposed regulations concerning source of capital is 8 CFR 216.3(a), which states that the Service shall terminate the alien entrepreneur's status if it becomes known to the government that the alien obtained his or her capital through other legal means (such as through the sale of illegal drugs). When the alien files Form I&hyph;526, Immigrant Petition by Alien Entrepreneur, he or she must show that the capital invested was obtained through lawful means. See 8 CFR 204.6(j)(3). The commenters' suggestion is more appropriately addressed to 8 CFR 204.6(j)(2)(ii), which addresses this issue in more detail. The Service notes, however, that without more specific information about the particular country's currency restriction laws, it is difficult to determine whether capital, in a given case, was obtained through other than lawful means. Each petition must be adjudicated on a case-by-case basis. Accordingly, the Service does not feel that it is appropriate to amend this regulation. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this regulation and by approving it certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule is intended to allow alien entrepreneurs to continue their commercial enterprises thereby providing jobs in the United States. This rule merely sets forth the procedures for terminating the conditional resident status of alien entrepreneurs already present in the country and for removing the conditional basis of permanent resident status for such persons. This rule, therefore, will have, at most, an indirect and attenuated effect on such business entities. Executive Order 12866 This rule is not considered by the Department of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Service, to be a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866, section 3(f), Regulatory Planning and Review, and the Office of Management and Budget has waived its review process under section 6(a)(3)(A). Executive Order 12612 The regulation will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a federalism assessment. Executive Order 12606 The Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service certifies that she has addressed this rule in light of the criteria in Executive Order 12606 and has determined that it will have no effect on family well-being. This rule contains information collection requirements which have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act. The OMB control numbers for these collections are contained in 8 CFR 299.5. The OMB control number for the Form I&hyph;829 is 1115&hyph;0190.
