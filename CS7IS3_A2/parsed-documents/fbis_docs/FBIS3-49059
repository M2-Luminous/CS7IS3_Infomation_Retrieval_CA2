The Committee for Selection and Appointment supported the bill relieving Stjepan Herceg of the duties of state attorney and proposed appointing Krunislav Olujic to this position. They also supported relieving Dragoslav Gecl of his position as deputy governor of the National Bank of Croatia, which was requested by Gecl himself. The Committee for Foreign Policy heard the report of Foreign Minister Mate Granic, who pointed out that the international community supports the integrity of Croatia, while the radicalism supported by some in Croatia is of no help. Granic claimed that the international community is not homogenous, as well as the European Union, but there are various interests at stake in their activities, in which the events following the elections in Russia play an important role. The main aims of Croatian foreign policy are to consolidate the position of Croatia, protect the Croatian national interests, and find common grounds with the international community, said Granic. Speaking about the French-German proposal, Granic stated that it clearly followed from the proposal that the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina cannot be solved politically without the solution for the UNPA's [United Nations Protected Areas] in Croatia. For the sanctions against Serbia to be suspended, the modus vivendi for Croatia should first be established, which implies a cease-fire, the opening of communications, and the reintegration of the Croatian areas under UN control. Regarding the negotiations on Bosnia-Herzegovina, the foreign minister stated that there was a consensus that the Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina should be given 33.3 percent of the territory, but that there were different opinions on where this territory should spread. Granic remarked that there were strong pressures on the Croats to concede territories, but it was accepted that the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina must have 17.5 percent of the territory. Assessing the Muslim positions, Granic established that their orientation is to create a strong republic based on the assessment that they can conquer central Bosnia. The Croatian orientation is to stop this conflict through negotiations and to resolve it through political agreements. Croatia is still offering the Muslims access to the sea, the use of the port of Celjevo on the Neretva River, the construction of the Stolac-Neum highway, and the tourist community of Klek, which would be under joint ownership, said Granic, adding that what the Muslims are demanding is not an access to the sea but rather an exit. Granic mentioned one of the possible variants: giving Prevlaka to the Muslims but getting the hinterland of Dubrovnik in return and keeping Neum under Croatian control, because, as Granic said, we will persist in demanding that there be no cutting of the Croatian territory at Neum. The foreign minister remarked that strict observance of international humanitarian and war law will help in seeking a common ground with the European Union, reminding that the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina released 5,600 people from prisons, and in the last 32 days they provided passage for 284 humanitarian convoys. Granic said that this orientation will be persisted upon in the future, remarking that despite the Muslim offensive at the Croatian areas in central Bosnia, Croatia keeps insisting on negotiations. He announced that he was going to meet with [Bosnia-Herzegovina Foreign Minister] Haris Silajdzic sometime during the day. The Committee for Legislation and the Committee for Work, Family, Youth, and Social Policy supported the bills regulating provisions for retirement and health funds and for children's allowance. The above-mentioned bills will become effective on 1 January 1994, and the provision rates will remain at the same level as in 1993.
