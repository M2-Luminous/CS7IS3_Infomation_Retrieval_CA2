SUMMARY: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to transfer to EPA contractors and subcontractors, technical and financial confidential business information (CBI) collected from several metals forming, finishing, and fabricating industries including the metal products and machinery manufacturing, maintenance and rebuilding industry. Transfer of the information will allow the contractors and subcontractors to assist EPA in developing effluent limitations guidelines and standards under the Clean Water Act (CWA) for the metal products and machinery industry. The information being transferred was collected under the authority of section 308 of the Clean Water Act. Interested persons may submit comments on this intended transfer of information to the address noted below. DATES: Comments on the transfer of data are due October 11, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments may be sent to Janet Goodwin, Engineering and Analysis Division (4303), Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, D.C. 20460. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Janet Goodwin at the above address or at (202) 260&hyph;7152. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: EPA has previously transferred to its contractor Radian Corporation of Herndon, Virginia (and subcontractors) information, including confidential business information (CBI), concerning the metal products and machinery industry collected under the authority of the Clean Water Act section 308. The information transferred included: Questionnaire data collected during a two phase survey of the metal products industry; the first phase consisted of the screener questionnaire or the ``mini-data collection portfolio (mdcp) which was conducted in 1990 (OMB No. 2040&hyph;0148); the second phase was a more detailed questionnaire or data collection portfolio (dcp) that was sent in 1991 to a randomly selected sample identified through the responses to the mdcp (OMB No. 2040&hyph;0148). EPA also transferred site visit and field sampling data collected during 1990 through 1993. In addition, Radian has received similar records and data developed in support of the following effluent guidelines regulations: •Porcelain Enameling (data collection 1977 through 1979), •Coil Coating (data collection 1977 through 1979), •Aluminum Forming (data collection 1978 through 1981), •Battery Manufacturing (data collection 1978 through 1983), •Copper Forming (data collection 1978 through 1979), •Electroplating (data collection 1974 through 1979), •Metal Finishing (data collection 1974 through 1979), •Metal Molding and Casting (data collection 1977 through 1983), •Nonferrous Metals Forming and Metal Powders (data collection 1983 through 1985), •Nonferrous Metals Manufacturing, Phases I and II (data collection 1978 through 1985), •Plastics Molding and Forming (data collection 1980 through 1987), and •Hot Dip Coating Subcategory of the Iron and Steel regulation (data collection 1986). Radian has also received files gathered during studies of the beryllium copper forming industry (data collection during 1986), the platemaking industry (data collection during 1984), and the printing and publishing industry (data collection 1977 through 1979). EPA determined that this transfer was necessary to enable the contractor and subcontractors to perform their work under EPA Contract No. 68&hyph;C0&hyph;0005 and related subcontracts by assisting EPA in developing effluent limitations guidelines and standards for the metal products and machinery industry. Notice to this effect was provided to the affected companies at the time the data was collected or through Federal Register notice.

The effective date of the new contract is October 1, 1994. Radian Corp. will provide technical support such as completion of the public docket for the proposed rulemaking and completion of the work on the draft proposed technical development document. The contractor shall also provide support on post proposal efforts, including assisting with public meetings, responding to comments, filling data gaps that arise through comments on the proposed rule, and assisting with the assembly of the rulemaking record for the final rule. The subcontractors will assist the prime by providing specific expertise. Westat, Inc. will assist with any surveys that may be required in future work, data management and statistical analysis. Amendola Engineering, Inc. will provide assistance in pollution prevention and water pollution control. CAI Engineering provides metal products industrial wastewater and hazardous waste engineering expertise, surface treatment process design and pollution prevention expertise and wastewater treatment system design expertise. Information Systems Solutions International, Inc. offers information and data management services and Marasco Newton Group, Inc. provides information management services. In accordance with 40 CFR part 2, subpart B, the previously collected information described above (including confidential business information) will be transferred to Radian Corp.
