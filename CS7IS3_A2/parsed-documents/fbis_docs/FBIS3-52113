He says he is in favor of a strong state, and one which at the same time is closer to the concerns of Algerians. Redha Malek : [Begin recording] [Malek] Our intention and, I would even say, our wish and our determination, is to build a solid state on firm foundations, a state which is also credible, one which is in touch with the people and not cut off from the people, one which is with the people, which forms one body with the Algerian people. [Correspondent Christian Mallard] So, it is a matter of putting behind you certain errors which may have been made in the past -- I am thinking in particular of the time of President Chedli Bendjedid? [Malek] Yes, absolutely. We are in favor of making a break with it. If we have ended up in the current situation it is because the state did not play its role, because the consensus which had existed was eroded away, because there were deviations of all kinds, which meant that the state lost the trust of the people. The past is over, we are making a break with it, and we are moving on toward the future, and we are going toward the 21st century with our heads high. [end recording]
