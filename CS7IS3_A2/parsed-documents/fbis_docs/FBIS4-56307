Later, as an adult, this feeling was nourished by the teachings of my tutor, Arnulfo Arias Madrid. Also, there is no situation that intensifies patriotism more than being exiled, finding oneself forced to be far from one's homeland. I have experienced this situation twice, the first when I was seven years old. I have always been convinced as an attorney of the irreplaceable value of the existence of the state of law as a foundation for stability and social development. I have defended throughout my life as a politician the moral principle that sovereignty resides with the people; consequently, it is only the people's will, which is a manifestation of divine will, from which the authorities' origin and reason for being stem. As constitutional president of the Republic, I have always wanted the best for my fellow countrymen. Despite the limitations, we have achieved an impressive material and institutional growth over a short period, while it was estimated in 1989 we would need at least a 10-year period to achieve what we have. Above all, as president I have considered as my primary duty ensuring that all citizens have the right to vote freely. These considerations on the whole serve to explain the significance of this act. This is not a mere symbolic event. For the first time in our republican history the president of the Republic, by virtue of his powers, cedes to the Electoral Tribunal the command of the Public Force, thus complying with the guidelines established for the electoral process. This healthy measure was proposed by the executive branch and adopted by the Legislative Assembly, and it has been incorporated into the current Electoral Code. It is for the purpose of guaranteeing Panamanian voters pure elections, free from any shadow of undue influence. Gentlemen, directors, officers, and Public Force members, as supreme chief of the Panamanian Public Force and abiding by existing laws, I hereby notify you that as of this moment and until the proclamation of the president-elect of the Republic, you are under the command of the Electoral Tribunal for all purposes that will guarantee the freedom, honesty, and integrity of the 8 May elections. Honorable magistrates of the Electoral Tribunal, please receive command of the Panamanian Public Force for the above mentioned purposes, and with it you receive the guarantee you have full authority and full responsibility. In addition, receive the assurances the men and women under your command as of today will know how to fully comply with the historic tasks you are assuming. I want to give one final message to my fellow countrymen. I said five years ago the world is watching us. I quoted that from the Communal Action anthem. Today, that is as true as before. Our fatherland needs for the culmination of the electoral campaign on election day and the subsequent vote count to develop in an atmosphere of peace, order, and harmony. The people's inherent enthusiasm can take place within a framework of civic spirit and respect for each other and the authorities. Nothing could contribute more to improve Panama's image before the international community than the massive and orderly turnout of citizens to a democratic, clean, and peaceful process. May God enlighten us in the upcoming days with the brilliant light of His eternal wisdom so that everything will be for the fatherland's well-being and progress. Thank you. [applause]
