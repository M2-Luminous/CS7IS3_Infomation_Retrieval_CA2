Siphiwo Mogoda asked ANC President Nelson Mandela how he felt about voting for the first time in his life. [Begin recording] [Mandela] It is difficult for me to imagine exactly how I would feel, except that to all of us it would be a historic and very exciting moment, because our forebears have fought for more than centuries for the day of liberation. To make that cross would be the fulfilment of a long-cherished dream which would enable us to close a chapter and to start laying the foundation stone so that all our people, without exception, can have a better life. [Mogoda] Would you say things are more difficult outside prison than they were when you were still inside? [Mandela] These are things which are incomparable because in prison, although one had time to sit down and to reflect on his work and the mistakes that have been committed in the past, and how to plan one's program, nevertheless it was not the type of life one would like to imagine for himself. Outside one has the opportunity to realize his life's ambition, to work with other comrades, to meet people, to exchange views, and to be able to make a contribution to the struggle for the liberation of our people. There have been some positive things which we achieved in jail, but in spite of that prison is something that we do not wish anybody to go through. Whatever difficulties one faces outside, you are facing challenges which are intended to get your people to enjoy a better life. [Mogoda] You are described as a former prisoner who came out of jail not bitter at all. Have you forgotten how to be bitter? [Mandela] No. One has got feelings, and one is human. There are certain things which you feel ought not to have been done to you, but when you have got a program to carry out, it is not possible to concentrate on the negative aspects of your experiences, and in this regard I am not unique. All my colleagues who have been in prison, and those who have been in exile, those who have been harassed inside, they haven't got this feeling of bitterness, and they're concerned with promoting the welfare of the people of South Africa and solving problems, and therefore there is no time for bitterness, even if they wanted to be. [Mogoda] What sort of dream did you have while in prison about South Africa and its people? [Mandela] Well, I really wouldn't say that I had any specific dreams, except the important point of contributing to the liberation of our people. I tried in my situation to follow the campaigns launched by my colleagues, my comrades outside the country under the leadership of Comrade Oliver Tambo, and I was tremendously impressed by what they were doing. My only dream was to make a contribution to the immortal work which they were doing, highly impressive, competent leadership. My ambition, my dream, was to do everything in my power and in my situation to make their task as easy as possible. [Mogoda] As a man who keeps fit, how much ls left of your strength at this stage and how long will you continue to lead the ANC? [Mandela] Well, for my age, which now is 75, I feel comparatively fit and I'm enjoying life, I'm enjoying the challenges which face me. As far as serving as leader of the African National Congress, this is not a position I have chosen for myself. It's a position given to me by my comrades. I will serve as long as they want me to serve. I am prepared to serve for another 5 years but of course, as I have said before, I am not getting young. At the end of that period of 5 years it will be necessary for me to give way to a younger man. [Mogoda] Would we say that there's someone that you are grooming for this position? [Mandela] No. It is for the comrades, at the right time, to select a leader. All that I can say is that we have highly competent comrades who can take the position of leadership, who deserve that position, and therefore I do not think in our situation it is necessary to groom any particular individual.
