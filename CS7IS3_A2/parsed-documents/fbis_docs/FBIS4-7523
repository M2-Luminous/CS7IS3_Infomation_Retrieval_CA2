Bozic: "Fear of Confederation With Belgrade"] [Excerpt] Virovitica -- The Croatian Social Liberal Alliance [HSLS] is against the creation of a large number of municipalities, increased bureaucracy, and illogical centralization of power. It is necessary to question those who supported such an organization, claiming that it will not be expensive, Bozo Kovacevic, the chief secretary of the HSLS said on the podium in Virovitica on the occasion of founding the HSLS zupanija [parish] assembly for the Virovitica-Podravska Zupanija. The assembly was opened by the Virovitica HSLS branch president, Dr. Mirko Selak, who pointed out that, five years after the party has been founded, the last zupanija assembly is being formed here in Virovitica. Ivan Knezevic, the president of the Orahovica branch and the initiator for founding the party in this zupanija, addressed the assembly, pointing out social problems and poverty on one hand and the unscrupulous enrichment of some individuals on the other. "The state must be sensitive to social issues. The state must make it possible for capable individuals to compete and must protect the livelihood of those who are less capable. The HSLS is a liberal party with a clear social emphasis," HSLS president Drazen Budisa said in the introductory speech of the assembly, stressing that the HSLS is a political party of the center, which means that it will not lapse into totalitarism of the right or left. "The state, as the HSLS conceives it, should be as sensitive as possible toward its citizens and as strong as possible toward the outside world. We oppose the view that the party should be regarded as identical with the state or with patriotism, and we support free markets, trade, and learning, Drazen Budisa emphasized, pointing out that political opposition parties should not just have a decorative function but should also have a corrective role in the area of political power. [no closing quotation mark as published] According to Budisa, the HSLS supports the Croatian-Muslim federation agreement because it had a similar proposal drafted in its program as early as 1992. "The HSLA will ask the question of political responsibility for Croatian victims in the Croat-Muslim war. We are viewing the possible confederation with caution, so that it does not result indirectly in a confederation with Belgrade. We are for cultural, economic, and other links with the states that came into existence in the territory of the former Yugoslavia, but we are not for political associations, especially not with Serbia,'' Drazen Budisa said, emphasizing that a peaceful reintegration of the occupied territories of Croatia is expected under the pressure of Washington and Moscow.
