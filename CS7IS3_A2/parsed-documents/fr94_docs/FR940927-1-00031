ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The EPA proposes to approve the State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of New Jersey related to development of reasonably available control technologies for all source categories of volatile organic compounds for which EPA has issued a control techniques guideline document. In the final rules section of this Federal Register , EPA is approving the State's SIP revision as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial revision and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to that direct final rule no further activity is contemplated in relation to this proposed rule. If EPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this proposed rule. Any parties interested in commenting on this proposed rule should do so at this time. DATES: Comments must be received on or before October 27, 1994. ADDRESSES: All comments should be addressed to: William J.
