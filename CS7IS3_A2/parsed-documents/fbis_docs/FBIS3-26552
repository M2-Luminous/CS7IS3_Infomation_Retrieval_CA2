Instead of asking the state for money to carry out capital construction, Zhuhai has relied on its own efforts to develop a lot of basic facilities. This move is correct and it has offered a good example to the whole country. Premier Li Peng made an inspection tour of Zhuhai from 29 January to 4 February. During these seven days, Premier Li Peng went to construction sites, enterprises, and the grass-roots levels to conduct investigation and study; inspected the construction of the Qiao Bridge, the Zhuhai Bridge, the first of its kind in southern Guangdong, which was open to traffic by the end of last year, the Juren Holdings Company, and Zhuhai's urban construction and management; and listened to accounts given by the city party secretary and mayor Liang Guangda and other leaders. Premier Li Peng was pleased at the results of his on-the-spot inspection and the accounts given to him. He fully affirmed the work of the city leading body and spoke highly of and expressed satisfaction at Zhuhai's economic construction, urban building and management, environmental protection, hygiene, land management, afforestation, population control, social security, and overall administration. Zhuhai is indeed a beautiful city. The climate is pleasant and warm as in spring. I came here last year. During the current trip, I have witnessed the tremendous changes. With its rapid economic development and beautiful urban planning, Zhuhai is indeed a match for the cities of the developed nations. Through the in-depth inspection of Zhuhai, Premier Li Peng said that Zhuhai's reform, opening up, and economic construction are successful. He spoke highly of the unremitting efforts made by Zhuhai to overcome difficulties and implement the central policy of reform and opening up, and the spirit of continuously forging ahead and advancing amid storms. He specially presented Zhuhai with the poem "Ode to the Bamboo" by Qing poet Zheng Qiao: "Taking root in the steep rocks of the mountain, it remains firm and strong despite being buffeted by winds from all sides." Premier Li Peng encouraged Zhuhai party and government leaders and party members to earnestly study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, make bold explorations and practice, and constantly attain new achievements in establishing a socialist market economy and building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Premier Li Peng left Zhuhai for an inspection of Shenzhen on the morning of 4 February.
