The latest such "miracle" was the "Free Economic Zone." Everyone knows what became of that. Recently, belief in a new "miracle" has emerged, this time the financial-industrial groups (FPG [finansovo-promyshlennyye gruppy]), based on a regional financial-industrial group called the Kuznetsk Company. Supposedly we can pull ourselves out of this crisis by our own bootstraps, right here at home. In a recent address to his fellow citizens M. Kislyuk, governor of the Kuzbass and also administration chief of mining towns and head of a number of coal-producing enterprises in the oblast, stated that "information received from Moscow indicates an unwillingness and inability to establish order, not in basic industries such as the coal industry, much less in the entire country." That statement preceded a rather curious conclusion: since B. I. Yeltsin and V. S. Chernomyrdin are not capable of establishing proper order in the country, we are going to help see to it that they are replaced and wait for "our own people" from Russia's Choice to take office. Is that really the issue? Is it up to the drowning to save themselves? Can we break this crisis right here where we live and create an economic oasis? Laudable! But is it possible at this point in the game? Can the planned Kuznetsk Company actually function effectively? I assert that it cannot. Why am I so certain? Because such a decision is not economically justified or well reasoned. It is proposed that this faulty concept be used to create a new hybrid, something like Sovrynkhoz -- a market-oriented sovkhoz. Judge for yourself. The Kuznetsk Company FPG is supposed to combine in a single entity 278 major industrial enterprises in the coal, metals and energy industries and rail transportation. Or, to put it another way, 30.7 percent of all large enterprises in our oblast. But that is not all. There are plans to lock up R18 billion [rubles] in fixed capital in the Kuznetsk Company FPG at 1984 prices, which is equivalent to 73 percent of all fixed production capital in the oblast economy. Would that not constitute a supermonopoly? If such a decision were actually approved even for a short period of time, then we would definitively lump all of our problems together and witness a repetition of the failed company that was supposed to create a free economic zone. Once again the mountain would produce a mouse. Addressing an expanded session of the Russian Federation government, B. Yeltsin said that the creation of an FPG "is a means of concentrating resources in growth areas and supporting investment activity and competitiveness. The government must find the proper course in order not to slow down or hamper this process, but rather to monitor it and head off adverse effects." To what was the President referring when he mentioned "adverse effects"? Possible the very "ideas" that are leading to establishment of a "Sovrynkhoz" and others like them. It seems to me that the Kuzbass administration, in order to avoid falling into another quagmire, should carefully study both our own Russian experience with the establishment of corporations (FPGs), i.e., KamAZ, ZIL, NGMK, Lukoyl, etc., as well as the tremendous amount of time-tested experience accumulated in the United States, England, Germany and Japan. A question naturally presents itself: on what financial basis are they attempting to establish the Kuznetsk Company FPG? According to a statement by A. Lavrov, chairman of the oblast Committee for State Property Management, it will include not only gigantic regional complexes in specific industries -- coal, metals, energy and rail transportation -- but also the committee itself, the Kuzbassinvestugol Corporation, etc. As for the committee, it is obvious that this is an effort to save it from collapsing altogether. But why at the expense of coal and steel producers? That is not just a financial question, it is a moral one. An artificial hybrid will not produce positive results. On the one hand, it sharply restricts organizational and scientific-technical maneuvering room, and on the other it restricts and thoroughly obstructs the field available for economic maneuvering. As a poet once said, a horse and a skittish deer cannot be harnessed to the same cart. Our preliminary analysis indicates that for the sake of the oblast economy it would be appropriate to establish in the Kuzbass, first of all, three major corporations (FPGs): Ugol Kuzbassa [Kuzbass Coal], Metall Kuzbassa and Sibkhimiya [Siberian Chemical]. As for rail transportation and electric power production, they, as key elements in the federal manufacturing infrastructure, should be independent components of the economic process. Now a few comments regarding the actual composition of the proposed FPGs. This should be dictated solely by economic expediency. For example, the Ugol Kuzbassa FPG should be comprised of coal mining and processing enterprises, specialized machine building plants which manufacture mining equipment, internal production-related infrastructure, a mine rescue unit, research and design organizations, investment companies along the lines of Kuzbassinvestugol, and so on. Even by world standards this would be a very large corporation. Judge for yourself: it would have fixed capital of R12 billion in 1984 prices. Currently more than 241,000 people are employed in coal mining alone, with more than 400,000 working in the coal industry as a whole. In my opinion, what we need here is not an artificial patchwork of an FPG, but instead an integrated economic fabric and an integral connection between everyone that becomes part of the corporation. Particular emphasis should be placed on creating systems of specialized trading companies in coal sale centers. In our opinion, all the enterprises and organizations that comprise an FPG should be financially independent. They would be required to operate within the framework of a single economic, scientific-technical and investment policy and strategy, but that would be the extent of it. The coal industry is, I repeat, subsidized. One should not expect any substantial foreign or private investment in the near future. Consequently, we will have to carry out this restructuring using federal budget funds only. Therefore I feel that it would be very appropriate to develop a special program for coal industry restructuring in the 1995-2010 period, with a breakdown of investment by year. The planned Metall Kuzbassa corporation would include, in addition to anything else, 35 of the largest enterprises in the ferrous and non-ferrous metals industries, with R5.8 billion in fixed capital at 1984 prices. This would be a huge system, and it should be set up according to the same principle as the Ugol Kuzbassa FPG. However, if possible it should also consider broader cooperation within Siberia and Russia and be oriented toward multinational corporations. Corporations are, on the one hand, the most highly developed form of enterprise and production organization, and there are things that can be learned from them. On the other hand, being part of one makes it possible to attract needed investment funds, technology and access to the world metals market so that we can sell our products at normal world prices, not at discounted or unprofitable prices. Under the right conditions such a corporation could within five to seven years develop successfully on the basis of self-financing, loans and private investment. Particular attention should be paid to the formation of a corporation (FPG) to unite enterprises in the chemical industry. Creating one within the Kuzbass exclusively would be to create nothing. The problem is that the Azot AO [Joint-Stock Company], the Khimvolokno AO and other enterprises in the Kuzbass chemical industry are economically and technologically very closely linked to oil producing and refining enterprises in Western Siberia and with tire plants in the Altay region and Eastern Siberia. Therefore this corporation should be created first on an interregional and then on a multinational basis, because the chemical industry, like the oil industry, is economically efficient and could under certain conditions compete in world markets. There is not a single reasonable person who doubts or would dispute that it is essential to create corporations in the economy of Russia in general and that of the Kuzbass in particular. To a certain extent we have already attempted to take that route, as the establishment of production associations in the USSR was an attempt to utilize a form of incorporation, but without its principal aspect, i.e. a market orientation. In order to make up for lost time we must, as A. Sakharov said, "travel their path," i.e., follow a trail that has already been blazed abroad. Since we now lag behind, we must catch up. And we may yet surpass them.
