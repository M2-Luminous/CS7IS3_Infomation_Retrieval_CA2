During his stay in Beijing, the prime minister and the Chinese Premier Li Peng are to attend and witness the signing of the Suzhou software transfer agreement. The agreement will be signed by Singapore Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew, who arrived in Beijing on Friday [25 February], and Chinese Vice Premier Li Lanqing. The Suzhou project is believed to be the largest cooperation project so far between the two governments. According to the agreement between the two countries, Singapore will invest a total of 20 billion U.S. dollars in the next 10-15 years to develop an industrial town covering 70 square kilometers in Suzhou, and transfer Singapore's economic development and management experiences to Suzhou, a medium-sized city near Shanghai. Lee Kuan Yew said here on Tuesday to XINHUA that the reason why Singapore chose Suzhou to be the venue of the joint government project is because Suzhou is located in the Chang Jiang delta and close to Shanghai, the dragon's head of the Chang Jiang valley, one of the fastest developing areas in China. Lee said the prospects of the Suzhou project are "good," adding that though a well planned township in Suzhou would proceed at a slower pace than Shenzhen, "the long-term results will be better." According to a press statement from the Prime Minister's Office, Goh Chok Tong and Lee Kuan Yew will meet Chinese leaders during their stay in Beijing. During the prime minister's absence, Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsieng Loong will be the acting prime minister, the statement said.
