Purpose Section 750 of the PHS Act authorizes the award of grants to accredited schools of medicine or osteopathic medicine and other public or nonprofit private entities to assist in meeting the cost of planning, developing and operating or maintaining programs for the training of physician assistants as defined under section 799(3) of the Public Health Service Act. Statutory General Funding Preference As provided in section 791(a) of the PHS Act, preference will be given to any qualified applicant that_ (A) Has a high rate for placing graduates in practice settings having the principal focus of serving residents of medically underserved communities; or (B) During the 2-year period preceding the fiscal year for which an award is sought, has achieved a significant increase in the rate of placing graduates in such settings. This preference will only be applied to applications that rank above the 20th percentile that have been recommended for approval by the peer review group. Final Minimum Percentages for ``High Rate'' and ``Significant Increase in the Rate'', Funding Preference and Priority A proposed notice was published in the Federal Register on February 17, 1994, at 59 FR 8007, for public comment. No comments were received during the 30-day comment period. Therefore, the minimum percentages for ``high rate'' and ``significant increase in the rate,'' funding preference and priority will be retained as follows; ``High rate'' means that 20 percent of the physician assistant program graduates in academic year 1991-92 or academic year 1992&hyph;93, whichever is greater, are spending at least 50 percent of their work time in these settings. ``Significant increase in the rate'' means that, between academic years 1991&hyph;92 and 1992&hyph;93, the rate of physician assistant program graduates in these settings has increased by at least 50 percent and that not less than 15 percent of the academic year 1992&hyph;93 graduates are working in these settings. Final Funding Preference In addition, a funding preference will be given to established physician assistant training programs which can demonstrate that: (a) More than 50 percent of their graduates in 1993 entered a generalist specialty (family medicine, general internal medicine, general pediatrics); or (b) an average of 40 percent of graduates over the last 3 years (1991, 1992, and 1993) entered a generalist specialty. Final Funding Priority A funding priority will be given to approved applications that can demonstrate either substantial progress over the last 3 years or a significant experience of 10 or more years in enrolling and graduating trainees from those minority or low-income populations identified as at risk of poor health outcomes.
