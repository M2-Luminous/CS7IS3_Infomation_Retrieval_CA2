The circular pointed out: The "Military Service Law" is the basic law of our military system. Since its promulgation, the current "Military Service Law" has played an important role in perfecting our socialist legal system and our military service system, promoting the modernization of our armed forces, and strengthening the reserve force. In the new situation in which we are deepening reform and establishing a socialist market economic structure, to further seriously implement the "Military Service Law" is of great immediate significance to stepping up national defense construction, promoting the all-people national defense concept, raising citizens' awareness of their military service duties, and spreading patriotism and revolutionary heroism. On the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the promulgation of the "Military Service Law," all localities and all units should do solid and effective work in publicizing it in light of their realities. With these propaganda activities, we should strive to encourage all people to show concern for national defense construction and support national defense construction; we should make all officers and men dedicate themselves to the cause of national defense; and we should lay an ideological foundation for promoting the implementation of the law and for promoting the building of the military district units and the province's reserve force.
