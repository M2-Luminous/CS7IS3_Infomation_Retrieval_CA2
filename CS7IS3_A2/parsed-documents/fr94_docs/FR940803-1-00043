FR940803-1-00043 FR940803-1-00010 Under the proposed §§192.805(c) and 195.505(c), supervisory persons may become qualified administratively in certain covered functions by meeting all the proposed training and testing requirements, except those involving the demonstration of competent manual skills. Accordingly, supervisory persons directly overseeing personnel such as qualified welders would be permitted an exemption from ``hands-on'' welding. However, such supervisory persons would be required to demonstrate an appropriate knowledge of the pipeline safety regulations for welding_subpart E of part 192 or subpart D of part 195 as required under the proposed §§192.811(d)(1) and 195.511(d)(1). RSPA encourages the practice of some pipeline operators to require that persons directly supervising welders be, themselves, fully qualified welders. Under §§192.807 and 195.507, all evaluating, training, and testing of personnel would be performed by an instructor with demonstrable proficiency in the functions to be taught and tested. Demonstrable proficiency is proposed to be defined as evidence of competence acceptable to other persons with specialized training or certification in the performance of similar functions. However, the instructor's proficiency need only be commensurate with the level of knowledge and skills required for competent performance of the function on the operator's unique pipeline. This provision recognizes that the degree or extent of knowledge and skills required to competently perform some functions on a particular pipeline may be less than that required for similar functions on more complex pipelines. Operators (who own or operate pipelines) are permitted to serve as instructors or to select operator personnel or other entities to serve as instructors, providing that the operator or persons selected as instructors have the required level of proficiency. An operator who would not qualify as an instructor but would need to be evaluated for purposes of qualification would have to obtain the evaluation from an instructor, who could be another operator, employee of that other operator or an entity qualified as an instructor. Under §§192.809(a) and 195.509(a), instructors would be required to evaluate the work experience and training of persons requiring qualification in order to determine what, if any, prior work experience and training were suitable and applicable to that required for competent performance of the persons' current functions. Work experience and training that are evaluated as equivalent to any of the general or specific training elements of §§192.811 and 195.511 would not require retraining, but would require testing under §§192.813 and 195.513 to confirm the evaluation. After completion of the evaluation of the prior experience and training of persons performing covered functions, the operator would be required by §§192.809(b) and 195.509(b) to prepare a written or computerized qualification training and testing schedule containing details such as names and titles of affected persons, dates and locations for training and testing, elements of general and specific training to be taught or tested, and names of instructors. Under §§192.809(c) and 195.509(c), the operator would be required to prepare a written or computerized refresher training schedule showing similar details, except that testing is not required, under this proposal, for refresher training. The proposed elements of qualification training under §§192.811 and 195.511 are based on the training program hazardous liquid operators are now required to conduct under §195.403(a). However, the proposed requirements are more comprehensive. Under the proposal, all affected personnel (except persons with prior equivalent work experience or training that have been confirmed by testing) would have to satisfactorily complete general training elements of §§192.811 and 195.511 appropriate to the operator's unique pipeline and specific training elements relevant to a person's covered functions on that unique pipeline. Operators would have to demonstrate that their personnel have received training relevant to the operator's unique pipeline system in the applicable elements of §§192.811 and 195.511 through any, or a combination of the following methods: prior formal education, prior company-sponsored training, work experience, apprenticeship, or newly provided on-the-job or classroom training. All would qualify as legitimate training methods. The necessary depth and length of training would be established by the operator so that they are sufficient to assure personnel competency as demonstrated by subsequent testing under §§192.813 and 195.513. Under this approach, pipeline instructors would determine for each individual what work experience and prior education or training are relevant to that individual's covered functions and what additional training is needed to meet the proposed elements of training. Consequently, wholesale training should be unnecessary for most experienced personnel of pipeline operators with currently adequate training programs. Although this approach is intended to give operators latitude in developing a qualification program, each operator's program would be required to result in personnel of the operator and the contractor being proficient in all the training elements proposed under §§192.811 and 195.511. Because the training appropriate for one individual function, or a particular pipeline, may not be appropriate for another individual function, or another pipeline, an operator's qualification program would be developed and implemented to accommodate such distinctions.
