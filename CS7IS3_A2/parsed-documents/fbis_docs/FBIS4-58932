It described the agreement as "capitulationist, null and void, and not binding on the Palestinian people." In a statement, of which AL-HAYAH has received a copy, Hamas urged the Palestinian authority and its police to serve the people. It warned of "the consequences of factionalism, a one-party system, submitting to the Zionist enemy, and preventing our people's mujahidin from carrying out resistance operations against the occupation army and settlers." Hamas welcomed "dialogue and meeting with all Palestinian national forces and influential figures on the basis of continuing the resistance, defeating the occupation, and sparing our people the calamities of sedition and infighting." It condemned "the use of arms to resolve political and family disputes." Hamas vowed to continue mass struggle "against the occupation and its symbols." [passage omitted]
