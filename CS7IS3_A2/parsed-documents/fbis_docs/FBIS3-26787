The debate took place in an urgent meeting, which was called at the request of the Russian Federation, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Pakistan. Participants in the debate are ambassadors of the 15 council members and representatives of 38 UN member states, including Belgium, Hungary, Colombia and Senegal, which are interested in the discussion. Jean-Bernard Merimee, French ambassador to the UN, said that "the conflict (in Bosnia) has now reached a turning point, which we should all be aware of." The first priority, he said, was to lift the siege of Sarajevo, begin its demilitarization and progress toward placing that city under temporary UN administration. However, he stressed, this must not interfere with the recent NATO decision demanding the Bosnian Serbs to withdraw their heavy weapons from Sarajevo before February 20 or face air strikes. Bosnia's UN Ambassador Muhamed Secirbegovic said the precedent set by the NATO threat was only a first step and he called for the lifting of the siege around five other Muslim cities designated as UN "safe areas." He said relevant Security Council resolutions did not require any further action by the council, and "the withdrawal of the Serbian forces and their weapons should be executed fully in a timely manner." Chen Jian, China's UN ambassador, said at the debate that the Chinese Government is opposed to the use or threat of force. On NATO's threat of force, Chen said that NATO should "act very prudently and refrain from taking any hasty action." With regard to the use of air power in Bosnia, Chen said that it should be limited to self-defense by the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in that country. The eventual settlement of the Bosnian crisis, Chen said, should continue to be sought in accordance with the principles set forth by the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia and relevant Security Council resolutions. "The parties concerned in Bosnia and Hercegovina have recently held several rounds of talks," the Chinese ambassador said. "We hope all the endeavors of the international community will genuinely help promote the peace process toward a political settlement." Russia's Ambassador, Yuliy Vorontsov, also spoke of a political settlement, saying that "it is essential to time and again spell out our support for the negotiating procedure in order to reach a settlement to the Bosnian conflict as a whole." In view of the fact that previous ceasefire agreements and other agreements between the parties had frequently broken down, Vorontsov said, "it is obviously extremely important for the Security Council to back up its demands by a proper decision for a ceasefire and a withdrawal of heavy weapons in and around Sarajevo." Madeleine Albright, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, said during the debate that diplomacy alone was not enough and it must be backed by a willingness to use force. "It is only force plus diplomacy that can stop the slaughter in Sarajevo and break the stalemate in Geneva," she added. However, the U.S. ambassador said, her government believed the Bosnian conflict should be resolved at the negotiating table, not on the battlefield. "Neither NATO, nor this council," she said, "can or should impose a settlement upon the parties, for an imposed settlement will not be a lasting settlement."
