On Thursday [2 June] League Spokesman Michael Schwilk justified the cancellation by pointing to the "massive threat" by "chaotic leftists." One does not want "deliberately to get involved in new riots," Schwilk said. Brunner and Haider had been attacked in Hamburg with paint bags and eggs. Only in Bavaria can one "still feel relatively safe." Haider and Brunner's election rally in Munich, which is planned for next Sunday, is to go ahead as planned.
