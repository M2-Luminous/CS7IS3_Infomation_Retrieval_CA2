A deputies' proposal for calling early elections in November which reflects the stand of the opposition will be voted on tomorrow. The Slovak opposition did not have enough strength today to push through a proposal to call early elections in November. However, further voting on the date for early elections is expected tomorrow. The opposition proposal was not supported by deputies from the Hungarian minority parties which make their support conditional on providing to them guarantees that Hungarian ethnic minority demands will be met. Peter Weiss, chairman of the Democratic Left Party (SDL), the strongest opposition party in Slovakia, told journalists after voting that the date for parliamentary elections should be decided and an amended privatization law should be passed prior to speculation about a new government which would act until elections. Parliament will continue its work tomorrow with a debate on an amended law on large privatization.
