Lovrenovic on statements of Herceg-Bosna officials in Mostar; date not given: "Federation Simultaneous With Confederacy"] [Text] Kresimir Zubak, president of the presidential council, said about the Washington agreement that "all the positions contained in the Washington documents were supported by the presidential council and the party leadership, and during the talks in Vienna we will try to include what was emphasized at the session in Mostar. My personal opinion is that the preliminary agreement on the future Bosnia-Herzegovina federation anticipates a much looser union than the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. However, details and the final assessment will only be available after the final proposal for the constitutional documents is put together in Vienna." Ivan Bender, president of the chamber of representatives of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, said that "the Croat people consider these documents and everything they imply to be one of the possible solutions in the many possible events we may encounter in the upcoming period. Our negotiating team must get expert reinforcement, especially now that all the details of the future union are the issue, to make all the solutions as close to our positions as possible. This agreement on federation can only be concluded if the confederacy between the Republic of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina is established simultaneously." "After the document drafts are coordinated, the chamber of representatives will discuss them and give its opinion before the possible referendum. Our declaration, made at the session in Livno, is a valid document, and our negotiators bear that in mind. The preliminary agreement contains certain differences in relation to the documents passed at the chamber of representatives, but we will discuss everything after the work with the negotiations is completed," added Bender. Pero Markovic, president of the Executive Committee of the Croatian Democratic Community [HDZ] for Bosnia-Herzegovina, believes that "not all the Croats of Bosnia-Herzegovina are in the same position with regard to where they come from. In that respect, they supported various solutions, which had to be put into a single solution. This is why we support our negotiating team and the expert groups in everything they have done so far. At this meeting, Croat unity was expressed, and there were no separate positions regarding the agreement and general politics. The HDZ has not changed its policies. The HDZ of Bosnia-Herzegovina has not given up on the ethnic principle that it incorporated in the Cutilheiro, Vance-Owen, Owen-Stoltenberg, and all other plans," said Markovic.
