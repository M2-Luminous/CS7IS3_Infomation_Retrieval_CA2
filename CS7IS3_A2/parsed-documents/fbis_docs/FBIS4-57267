Massaccesi said during an appearance on the lunchtime television talk show "Almorzando con Mirtha Legrand" that his goal was "to make a contribution to society and the party." The governor also told Rio Negro leaders gathered in the Federal Capital that he planned to open a round of talks with party officials beginning on Wednesday in Catamarca and Jujuy. Massaccesi followed closely in the footsteps of De la Rua, who announced on Thursday night that he would seek to replace President Carlos Menem in 1995. "This is one of the (Radical Party's) most critical moments in its long history of service to the country," the senator told members of his Participation Movemement. "I am willing to assume the responsibility of being a candidate." Meanwhile, Cordoba Governor Eduardo Angeloz, who has already expressed interest in running next year as he did in 1989, said he was sympathetic to the ruling Justicialist determination to retain the Constituent Assembly's presidency and first vice-presidency. Angeloz said that the Justicialists would not want to leave a Radical delegate in charge of the assembly if the head of state were to leave the country and his brother, Senate Provisional President Eduardo Menem, had taken over the national presidency as provisional Senate chief.
