Serbian Government is making large investments for this, but colonization is committed even without investments at all: so the Albanian houses and land are confiscated and handed over to the Serbs. According to the recent information of Serbian press, the campaign of recolonization of Kosova is under its way. 220 houses will be erected in Istog commune, while a flat with 20 apartments for Serbs settlers from Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia is being built. Istog commune has actually 500 Serb settlers. It is planned the permanent establishment them in three ares and each family initially will posses a house and 20 ares of land. The first site will be located in the property of "Dubrava" Plant and initially will have 120 families, but later more because it will be extended into a surface of 30 hectares. The second site will be in Gjurakovc and the third in Muzhevine village, in each of them private houses for 50 families will be erected. A large number of Serb's family settlers is already established in Belice, Osojan, Zhace, and Gjurakovc villages, all these in Istog commune. Serb settlers in Kline commune have on possession an area of 150 hectares, while in Decan commune some 180 houses are under construction for Serbs and Montenegrins settlers. In the same commune is planned the construction of houses for 400 families. According to the Serbian press, these families will receive 10 acres for gardening and 3 to 4 hectares arable land. Besides 35 buildings, some 219 sites are assigned to the settlers, in Gjilan commune, while only in Dragodan quarter of Prishtina, 200 sites be handed over to Serbs and Montenegrins for construction. Plans and undertakings of this kind that serves to the colonization exist in other parts of Kosova. To this purpose is serving the expulsion forcefully of Albanians from their houses and putting in Serbs and Montenegrins families. According to a recent report of the Council for the Protection of Human Rights in Prishtina, some 42 Albanian families were expelled from their houses, only during the first three months of the year. 600 people from families of sacked workers are expelled during these last three years. Dismissing from the job of 130 thousands Albanians and putting Serbs and Montenegrins in their places is the largest ethnic cleansing carried out in mines, plants and institutions. These days in Podujeve has come 25 Serb families with 78 members and 33 of them are employed immediately. Currently 400 Serb work in Podujeve, many of them have come from Prokuple and Kurshumli communes near Serbia-Kosova border. The consequences of the war in the former Yugoslavia are reflected in Kosova in the massive settlement of displaced people from those areas in Kosova. Such a thing is considered as a great chance by the Serbs for a new recolonization of Kosova, besides the ethnic cleansing, violence, terror and discrimination carried out by the Serbs. The Serbs have placed and are placing in Kosova refugees from Slovenia, Croatia, and Bosnia-Hercegovina, at a time when thousands of Albanians are expelled. Serbs plan to bring in 500 thousand Montenegrins and Serb settlers and to deport Albanians beside "Bjeshkeve te Namuna" in the territory of Albanian Republic. Political and state subjects of Kosova have demanded from the UN High Commission for Refugees, that the settlers should have only the status of refugees and should not become permanent settlers. If the colonization is carried out under the veil "of the refugees issue solution," this would imply international recognition of Kosova colonization and it would be tragic.
