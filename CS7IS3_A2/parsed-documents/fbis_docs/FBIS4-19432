Berlusconi said: I would be happy if a political force we have always looked to, and with a program very close to our own, accepted to sit down at a table with us to find out what we could do together in parliament. Berlusconi added: I do not even rule out a possible government pact. Rocco Buttiglione lost no time in replying. He said that he appreciated Berlusconi's opening out toward them, but added: I cannot understand why the invitation to talks should concern only the matter of the Senate speaker and not the speaker of the Chamber of Deputies as well. [National Alliance leader] Gianfranco Fini has said no to any talks. The National Alliance leader commented: I cannot imagine a government involving the PPI and Forza Italia.
