The shelling that began at dawn today, after a few hours break last evening, are being intensely felt throughout the city, following the ultimatum that Savimbi gave his men to take Kuito in the coming hours. Thus, many troops, including Jonas Savimbi's personal guard, were concentrated on the outskirts of the city of Kuito and Kunge over the past few hours. This was revealed by a source from the government forces operational command. The source said the coming hours will be characterized by gunpowder, bloodshed, grief, and mourning, since apart from the shellings, intense clashes are already being waged in different parts of Kuito and Kunge between the government forces and the Black Cockerel's men. The shells fired by UNITA over the past 24 hours killed 83 people and wounded 127 others, including journalist Fernando Daniel Luis, who is in a serious condition.
