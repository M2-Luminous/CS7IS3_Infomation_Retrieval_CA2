Resolution of the political and professional matters that have arisen in the process of establishing a system for protection of the state border was the subject of an initial visit by a delegation of senior members of the General Staff (the agency which, together with the PRC Ministry of Public Security, deals with border protection matters) to Moscow, where talks are underway with the Russian Federal Border Guard Service. At a joint press conference held at the conclusion of the first stage of the Russo-Chinese talks, Col. Gen. Andrey Nikolayev, commander-in-chief of border guards and head of the Russian Federation Federal Border Guard Service, and Maj. Gen. Kui Fulin, assistant chief of the General Staff, Chinese People's Liberation Army, were unanimous in the opinion that "the borders between the great countries of Russia and China must become a region of peace and cooperation." In order to make that wish a reality it will be necessary to sign bilateral agreements at the level of border guard agencies and governmental structures in both states (primarily at issue is protection of the eastern sector of the Russian border and the Kirghiz and Tajik sectors of the CIS border). The Russian side, according to Col. Gen. Nikolayev, is prepared to present its packet of proposals during a visit to China by Russian head of government Chernomyrdin. The Chinese delegation, elaborately noting the "great amount of time required for documents to move through official agencies in China" is not at all inclined to link its efforts with that high-level guest's visit to China. The main focus of concern for border guard administrations in both states should be the establishment of a "civilized" border guard regime along the so-called first and second lines, i.e. at the border crossing level, with the number of crossing points commensurate to the region's economic needs. Consideration should also be given to professional contacts between Russian and Chinese border guard structures in the Russian Federation's Pacific, Far Eastern and Transbaikal border guard districts and China's corresponding border guard provinces with regard to interdiction of violations of the state border, for the purpose of combatting organized crime in both countries. In the opinion of Andrey Nikolayev the negotiations on reduction of arms and armed forces and on confidence-building measures and demarcation work along the Chinese-Russian border that are being conducted between diplomatic ministries in the Russian Federation and the PRC attest to the normal relations between our countries, and Russia's border guards are prepared to reinforce and expand those diplomatic successes. It did not seem that their Chinese colleagues had any objection to doing so, either.
