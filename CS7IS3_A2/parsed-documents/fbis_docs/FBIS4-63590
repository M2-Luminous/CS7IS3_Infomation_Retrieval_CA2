At the same time, he expresses the hope that "the problem there will not develop into a serious, major conflict." The Russian defense minister said this to correspondents today when he arrived in Wuensdorf, the headquarters of the Western Group of Forces [WGF], which is being withdrawn from Germany. He will have a meeting here with the WGF command, and in Berlin he will hold talks with Deutsche Bank representatives about financing the withdrawal of the Russian forces. Pavel Grachev described his upcoming meeting with the Deutsche Bank management as "very important," since this credit finance institution has been cooperating very successfully with Russia over the question of finance for the troop withdrawal. He said that no problems have arisen in this respect. Furthermore, he will also discuss the final stage of the withdrawal with the German bankers, and map out prospects for cooperation, including the training of specialists from Russia, who will work on banking matters within the armed forces.
