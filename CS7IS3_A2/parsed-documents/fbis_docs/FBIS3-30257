First of all it reveals the prevalent way of thinking in this leading U.S. institution regarding the solution to the Bosnia-Herzegovina conflict. The U.S. Senate obviously believes that a political solution is impossible, and so the military solution imposes itself. Additionally, this resolution confirms that -- out of narrow internal interests -- the United States wants to radicalize its behavior in order to appease its allies in the Islamic and Arab world. Both these facts, however, show that there is a large rift in interests and intentions between Europe and the United States when it comes to solving the crisis on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. While the European Union, divided over the national interests of France, Great Britain, and Germany -- and in the shadow of Russian diplomatic moves -- is trying in vain to find a common denominator for its policy, the United States is trying to move things with loud threats of air strikes and now of lifting the arms embargo against Alija Izetbegovic's army. However, it is hard to believe that the real way will be found with such diversified interests. The European West and the United States still resemble lost sheep far more than a respectable political force. Although one should not, in principle, draw parallels with the past for day to day political events, one should nevertheless say that the U.S. Senate did not pass such a resolution, or indeed any resolution, binding or otherwise, when Croatia was the victim of the Serbian aggression. Besides, the arms that Alija Izetbegovic would get with the lifting of the embargo would, at least initially, be used exclusively against the Croats in central Bosnia and the Neretva River valley. That is why Croatia cannot remain calm and unconcerned in the face of the latest resolution of the U.S. Senate.
