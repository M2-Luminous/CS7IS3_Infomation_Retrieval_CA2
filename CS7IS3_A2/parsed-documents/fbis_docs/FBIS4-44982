FBIS4-44982 "jpnea030___94038" JPRS-NEA-94-030 JPRS Near East & South Asia 7 May 1994 SOUTH ASIA INDIA DMK Dissidents Form New Party, Details Given DMK Dissidents Form New Party, Details Given General Council Meets 94AS0288A Madras THE HINDU in English 7 May 94 p 4 94AS0288A Madras THE HINDU English CSO [All quotation marks as published] [Text] Madras, May 6. The break away DMK [Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (Dravidian Progressive Foundation)] led by Mr. V. Gopalsami today adopted the name `Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam'. For its flag too, the party has retained the twin colours of black and red but in a way different from that of the DMK. The flag will have three stripes, red at the top and the bottom and black in the middle. The party General Council which met here today endorsed the new name and flag and within minutes of its disclosure by the party's general secretary, Mr. Gopalsami, the flag sprung up in multitudes in and around the venue. The party Executive which practically sat through the whole of last night besides choosing the name and flag deliberated on many other current issues. Ever since Mr. Gopalsami and his group broke away from the DMK in October last, they had been claiming that theirs was the real DMK and they would not part with the DMK's flag. They had to change their stand following the decision of the Election Commission which recently gave its seal of approval to the group led by Mr. M. Karunanidhi and Mr. K. Anbazhagan as the DMK with the authority to use the `Rising Sun' symbol. Mr. Gopalsami who announced the party's decisions at a news conference and displayed the new flag said his party had not yet decided on its election symbol. As the candidates of his party in the May 26 bye-elections were `Independents' in the reckoning of the Election Commission, they had to remain content for the present with one of the free symbols allotted to them by the Commission, he said. The word `Marumalarchi' (Renaissance) had been appended to the name DMK, Mr. Gopalsami explained, because his party would like to take up in earnest the work left behind by the late C.N. Annadurai, the founder of DMK and who ceaselessly crusaded to bring about a renaissance in the social, cultural and literary fields of Tamil Nadu. In the political arena too, his party would like to usher in a renaissance by stamping out corruption and putting an end to the practice of grooming family heirs for political leadership, he said. Mr. Gopalsami said that his group's earlier claim on the name and flag of the DMK party was a sequel to the strong sentiments of those who walked out of the DMK with him and their intention had never been to introduce `confrontationist politics' in the State. In fact they were the victims of violence at several places. With the Election Commission's pronouncement, a new name and a new flag had been necessitated but `we are confident that people will decide who represents the real DMK', he said and added `we will prove in course of time that we are the real DMK'. The General Council of the party decided that the office-bearers elected at its earlier meeting held at Tiruchi in December last would be retained ones for the Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (MDMK) also and the rules and regulations adopted at that meeting would govern it. `Our first task in politics is to fight and throw away the corrupt AIADMK [All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam] Government', said Mr. Gopalsami responding to questions. Asked whether he would not be further splitting the anti-AIADMK votes by his stand, Mr. Gopalsami said, that practically all sections of the people had been disillusioned with the performance of the AIADMK Government. The people wanted a change of Government and his party firmly believed that it could provide the alternative. At the national level, he said, his party would team up with anti-Congress(I) forces for bringing about a powerful alternative to the Congress(I). He, however, excluded the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] from the list as it was communal. The Left parties and the Janata Dal could emerge as a strong force against the Congress(I), he felt. He had reservations about Bahujan Samai Party led by Mr. Kanshi Ram, Mr. Gopalsami said. Their views on Gandhiji were not acceptable to his party. On his attitude towards the Sri Lankan militants, he said he was not supporting any of these groups. His aim was that there should not be any violence in Tamil Nadu and if there were any violent acts, the law should take its course. Answering a question on the revival of the sentence on the News Editor of Dinakaran newspaper by the Assembly, he said there was no magnanimity on the part of the State Government. His party would launch an agitation whenever press freedom was threatened, he said. The General Council passed a number of resolutions, including one urging the State Government to revoke the sentence on the News Editor of Dinakaran, expedite police investigation and apprehend the culprits involved in the murder of Elumalai, party activist, and an appeal to the electorate of Mylapore and Perundurai to support the party's candidates in the bye-election.
