Opposition New Democracy [ND] leader Miltiadhis Evert was notified first about the impending appointment of Papandoniou as minister of national economy, a move that augurs well for the government treating the opposition with respect, according to Nikos Nikolaou, writing in the 8 May Athens weekly TO VIMA TIS KIRIAKIS. Evert was told even before Bank of Greece governor Ioannis Boutos, who had been angling for the position. Explanations vary as to why Boutos lost out, Nikolaou reported. According to one version, certain Panhellenic Socialist Movement [PASOK] officials took advantage of the poor reception the Bank of Greece's annual financial report was given in the mass media to represent him to Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou as a "monetarist," a "rightist radical," and a minister who would adopt harsh economic measures liable to cause public resentment against the government. According to Nikolaou, Papandreou decided against Boutos because he needed Boutos at the Bank of Greece, which has had an increasing role in financial and foreign exchange policy, particularly as the 1 July deadline approaches for the freeing of capital movement. Greece's European Union [EU] partners also appreciate the fact that the nonpartisan Boutos is at the helm of the country's principal financial institution. Still another reason, Nikolaou observed, is that the appointment of Boutos, who enjoys the confidence of Brussels but is considered an "outsider" in PASOK because of his ND past, was viewed with distrust by PASOK trade union leaders fearful of his economic policies. In contrast, Papandoniou, whose views and economic remedies are similar to Boutos', is a longtime PASOK official and central committee member who can implement the necessary economic measures without angering PASOK trade unionists, Nikolaou contended. Papandoniou is "young, handsome, well-educated, and liked by both the business establishment and trade union leaders," Nikolaou continued. While these attributes are "indispensable," they are not enough, he claimed, for he also needs the kind of leadership style possessed by former Ministers of National Economy Yerasimos Arsenis and Kostas Simitis. Nikolaou, who holds that the Ministry of National Economy should play an essentially coordinating role, questioned whether Papandoniou would be able to exert control over, and coordinate, such diverse officials as PASOK secretary general Akis Tsokhatzopoulos, Minister of Environment Kostas Laliotis, Minister of Labor Evangelos Yiannopoulos, and Minister of Industry Kostas Simitis. Only the ability to do so will ensure the success of his ministry, Nikolaou concluded. According to a brief article in the 8 May Athens daily I KATHIMERINI citing "informed sources," Boutos was not "unhappy" about losing out to Papandoniou. Despite the fact that until a few days before Papandoniou's appointment Boutos was still the "favorite" in the race, the governor of the Bank of Greece was not prepared to follow, as national economy minister, a course at variance with the policies he advocates in his present position, the paper said.
