ACTION: Notice of Proposed Rulemaking; Change of hearing location, extension of hearing dates, and clarification of hearing issues. SUMMARY: OSHA is changing the location of the hearing (the starting date of the hearing remains unchanged) and extending the length of the hearing to accommodate the large number of parties who wish to participate. In order to help hearing participants focus their testimony on relevant issues, OSHA is also clarifying certain aspects of its proposal. DATES: The hearing will take place from September 20, 1994 through October 14, 1994 as scheduled, but will also reconvene for additional sessions from October 24 through November 22, 1994 and November 29 through December 5, 1994. The starting time is 10:00 a.m. on the first day and 9:30 a.m. on the subsequent days. ADDRESSES: The first two days of the hearing, Tuesday, September 20 and Wednesday September 21, will be at the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium, between 12th and 13th Streets on Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. The third and fourth days of the hearing, Thursday, September 22 and Friday, September 23, will be at the Department of Interior Auditorium, 1849 ``C'' Street, N.W., Washington, D.C.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Tom Hall, Office of Information and Consumer Affairs, OSHA, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC 20210; telephone: (202) 219&hyph;8618. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On April 5, 1994, OSHA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking addressing indoor air quality issues, including environmental tobacco smoke in the workplace. 59 FR 15968. On June 14, 1994 OSHA issued a supplemental notice giving parties until August 13, 1994 to submit comments; until August 5, 1994 to file notices of intention to appear; and until August 13, 1994 to submit testimony and evidence. The hearing was scheduled to start September 20, 1994. 59 FR 30560. These dates have not been changed. A large number of persons have asked to testify at this hearing. Consequently, OSHA has extended the length of the hearing as specified above. OSHA has also scheduled the first four days of the hearing at a larger auditorium as specified above. The location of subsequent days will be announced. Persons who filed notices of intention to appear have already been notified of the initial change by mail. Clarifications Some of the persons who filed notices of intention to appear and have been scheduled to testify have indicated uncertainty about OSHA's intentions with respect to parts of the proposal. In order to permit hearing participants to focus their testimony on the relevant issues, OSHA is clarifying certain aspects of the proposed rule and directing participants to the relevant preamble discussion on other points. OSHA wishes to clarify that it is not proposing to regulate smoking or indoor air quality in private homes, and does not intend to do so. The scope provisions in the proposal cover only `` work environments'' and ``indoor or enclosed workplaces .'' However, some of the comments indicate uncertainty on this matter. OSHA intends to develop even clearer language on this point for use in a final regulation. OSHA's intention on this issue is consistent with its longstanding practice. For example, a statement of policy set forth at 29 CFR 1975.6 provides that domestic service employment in a private home is not subject to the requirements of the OSH Act.
