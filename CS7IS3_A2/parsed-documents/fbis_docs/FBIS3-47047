A specific growth rate for defense spending for fiscal 1994 will be set in the course of compiling the budget. With the prime minister expressing his intention not to cut defense spending, there is a high possibility that defense spending will grow by 1.95 percent, the same percentage point as the growth rate of the 1994 budget. Asked by a reporter if he intends to cut defense spending for fiscal 1994 after a Japan Security Council session on 6 January, the prime minister said: "I will not cut defense spending." The prime minister also reiterated his plan to review the "Guideline for Japan's Defense Buildup," a basic policy for the buildup of Japan's defense capabilities and to reflect the review's results in the 1995 fiscal budget. The Japan Security Council session was called to discuss a draft preliminary budget request for the 1994 defense budget. At the session, Foreign Minister Hata and Defense Agency Director General Kazuo Aichi sought an understanding by other cabinet members about the need to increase the defense budget, saying: "Although the U.S.-Soviet confrontation has ended, the unstable situation still continues in Asia and disarmament has yet to be carried out in the region." In response, some cabinet members attending the session said: "Japan should define its defense budget in light of the global disarmament trend." During the session, cabinet members from the ruling Social Democratic Party of Japan did not oppose the government's plans to purchase two Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) aircraft and modified Patriot antiair missiles. The preliminary budget request for the 1994 defense budget amounts to 4,731.1 billion yen [Y], an increase of approximately Y96 billion from a year earlier. The increase is comprised of approximately Y60 billion to meet increased wages for members of the Self-Defense Forces and approximately Y36 billion to meet the cost of maintaining U.S. Forces in Japan, while 42 percent of the defense budget is allocated for personnel expenses and food and 37 percent of it is set to be spent for military hardware payments for 1993 purchases. For this reason, the Defense Agency [DA] has made a "minimum request to avoid facing any further cuts" (says a top DA official). The Finance Ministry, however, has openly said that it will cut the defense budget without regard to its sanctuary. While some believe that the prime minister indicated his intention not to cut defense spending because of his full understanding of the present state of Japan's defense, others believe that with Japan-U.S. summit talks set to be held in January, the prime minister expressed his intention not to cut defense spending after concluding that it was not good policy to cut the sympathetic budget for U.S. Forces in Japan and the budget for the AWACS aircraft purchase for which the United States has asked Japan as part of the efforts to cut its trade surplus with the United States.
