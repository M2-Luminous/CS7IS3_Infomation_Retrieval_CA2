FR940513-0-00132 FR940513-0-00034 b. Supplemental disclosures. The Commission proposed requiring, for all lamps to be covered by the labeling rules, that package labels and catalogs from which the lamps may be ordered also make a supplemental disclosure. The Commission proposed two alternatives for primary consideration: (1) A lumens-per-watt disclosure; or, (2) a disclosure of the estimated energy cost of the lamp based on a specified unit energy cost and use period. The NPR explained that a lumens-per-watt disclosure ( i.e., the ``Energy Index'' that had been suggested by NEMA) has the advantage of simplicity. But, as ACEEE noted, such a disclosure could lead to lumen over-purchasing because higher wattage bulbs often produce disproportionately more lumens and thus often have a better energy index although they use more energy. The Commission stated that this drawback possibly could be avoided if the Commission required a disclosure such as: ``Select the light output you require before comparing the energy index of different bulbs.'' Alternatively, the Commission stated that it might require a disclosure of the estimated monetary cost of the energy used by the lamp, based on use for a specified usage period, such as a normal average life in hours of a lamp or a length of time based on average usage patterns. The advantage of an operating cost disclosure is that it would reduce to monetary terms the energy cost of a lamp product. At the same time, the Commission stated that it would consider carefully whether such disclosures effectively communicate the extent to which a higher initial bulb cost can be compensated for by lower operating costs over the bulb's life. 34 34 See notes 106, 108, below. The Commission indicated that, although average or estimated usage patterns ( e.g. , one year) could be used in a monetary cost of operation disclosure, there are no established usage patterns and estimated use will vary depending upon the location of the lamp. In addition, the Commission noted that it would have to determine what unit cost for electricity to use. The Commission explained that, to prevent possible confusion, it might be appropriate to require disclosure of how the estimated energy cost was determined. 35 The Commission recognized, however, that additional information could unduly complicate the label and not be useful. 35 Id. Because some purchasers may be interested in computing lamp costs comprehensively, including consideration of the initial purchase price and replacement cost, the Commission also proposed requiring that information be provided to purchasers to enable them to determine the ``estimated total operating cost'' of the lamp for a standard time period. But, recognizing that purchasers desiring such information would need to make calculations for each bulb they were considering, the Commission stated that it would consider carefully the extent to which consumers actually would use the proposed disclosures in making a purchase decision. The Commission noted that, as a practical matter, consumers may disregard, or consider too complex, any disclosure requiring computations of this sort, and that any such required disclosures, therefore, may not be useful to consumers in their efforts to choose an energy efficient bulb. 2. Where Disclosures Should Be Made In the NPR, the Commission explained that residential purchasers normally buy lamp products through retail outlets, such as hardware, home center, and grocery stores. Residential purchasers, therefore, normally have the opportunity to examine lamp product packaging prior to purchase. The disclosures proposed for packaged product labels would provide residential purchasers with the information they need to select the most energy efficient lamps that meet their requirements. According to industry representatives, however, some products, such as general service fluorescent lamps, frequently are shipped without individual lamp sleeves or packaging other than the bulk shipping case, whether the shipment is to a commercial purchaser (who purchases through a catalog) or to a local retail store for resale of unpackaged individual lamps to residential purchasers. For these products, the Commission suggested two options. Option One would require the basic and supplemental disclosures (except for the number of items in each package) on an adhesive, hang tag, or similar type of label, attached to each unpackaged product. Option Two would require the manufacturer to include, with each bulk shipping case, statements disclosing all the required information for the enclosed products (except for the number of items in each package). Option Two also would require the retailer to post those statements conspicuously at the point of sale in immediate proximity to the sales floor display of the lamp product. Some sellers also sell lamp products to residential purchasers and commercial purchasers through catalogs. These purchasers will not see the disclosures on the product's packaging until the product is delivered, and may rely primarily (or solely) on information in the catalogs from which the lamps are ordered. For these purchasers, the catalog serves the same informational function as a package does for a retail purchaser. The Commission, therefore, proposed that the basic as well as the supplemental disclosures be made both on package labels and in catalogs each time each different lamp product is listed for sale. 3. Format of Disclosures The Commission explained in the NPR that it could specify that required disclosures be made through use of a flexible standard that requires ``clear and conspicuous'' disclosures. Under this ``performance'' standard, complying firms would be free to design disclosures as they wish in response to market considerations, as long as the disclosures were clear and conspicuous. The Commission stated that, alternatively, it could require that the disclosures comply with a design format specified by the Commission.
