The ten-year project aims to wipe out illiteracy and improve the overall talents of rural people in this comparatively backward region of the country. Previously, illiterate people aged between 14 and 40 made up 22 percent of the 4.8 million rural population of the autonomous region. During the past three years, local government has earmarked six million yuan to set up 2,158 cultural and scientific schools, 2,800 popular science associations and 200-plus specialized technique societies for local farmers. Some 318,000 rural people have participated in literacy classes and 180,000 of them can now read and write. Two million farmers have learned some farming techniques that can help them make more money, thanks to the fruitful work of training programs offered by the project. All over the region, more than 20,000 local teachers and technicians have enthusiastically taken part in the project and work with much patience and devotion. The Asia-Pacific Committee of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization has also provided assistance to the widely-praised project.
