Otherwise, Tokyo theatens to block the deal, which is being effected with Japanese mediation. ITAR-TASS was informed about this action by a representative of the "Toen Shioji" firm, which had organised the contract to deliver decommissioned Russian submarines to North Korea. He confirmed that, in accordance with the Japanese legislation, the government had the right to licence deals connected with potential armaments and that local firms were prohibited effect such transactions abroad. According to available information, the Russian side has still not replied to the demand to send a special representative to North Korea. A senior official of the Japanese Ministry for Foreign Trade and Industry refused to comment on this information. However, he said that the Russian side had informed Tokyo through the Japanese Embassy in Moscow that the decommissioned submarines were being sold to North Korea as scrap metal and could not be regarded as military hardware. A representative of the "Toen Shioji" firm said that only one decommissioned and disarmed submarine was so far delivered to North Korea where it was already scrapped. Under the above-mentioned contract, twelve Russian submarines, which are now being kept in half-sunken condition and are heavily rust-eaten, are to be delivered to North Korea. However, at present the "Toen Shioji" will have to get a separate permission from Japanese authorities to deliver each of them to North Korea. The hullabaloo around this deal was raised in January, when the American press reported that Moscow, with Japanese mediation, had allegedly sold to North Korea a whole fleet of 40 decommissioned diesel submarines, capable of carrying 20 torpedoes each and laying sea mines. U.S. special services, the newspaper "ASAHI" wrote, had expressed apprehensions to Tokyo that those submarines could be used for military purposes.
