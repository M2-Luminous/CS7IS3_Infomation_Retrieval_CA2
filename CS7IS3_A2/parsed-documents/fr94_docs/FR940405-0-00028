(a) During the period beginning April 1 and ending November 23, no handler shall ship: (1) Any lot or package or container of any variety of peaches unless such peaches meet the requirements of U.S. No. 1 grade: Provided , That an additional 25 percent tolerance shall be permitted for fruit with open sutures which are damaged, but not seriously damaged. The Federal or Federal-State Inspection Service shall make final determinations on maturity through the use of color chips or other tests as determined appropriate by the inspection agency. (i) The Federal or Federal-State Inspection Service will use the maturity guides listed in Table 1 in making maturity determinations for the specified varieties when inspecting to the ``well matured'' level of maturity. For these varieties, not less than 90 percent of any lot shall meet the color guide established for the variety, and an aggregate area of not less than 90 percent of the fruit surface shall meet the color guide established for the variety. For varieties not listed, the Federal or Federal-State Inspection Service will use such tests as it deems proper. A variance for any variety from the application of the maturity guides specified in Table 1 may be granted during the season to reflect changes in crop, weather, or other conditions that would make the specified guides an inappropriate measure of ``well matured.'' (ii) If a grower or handler believes his/her fruit is meeting the appropriate maturity level but the fruit has not been so graded by the inspector, he/she may appeal the inspection by calling the officer-in-charge of the local Federal-State Inspection Service office to arrange for an on-site examination of the fruit.
