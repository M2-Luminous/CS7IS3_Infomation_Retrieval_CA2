CONTENTS: 1. Lawyers Announce General Strike 2 Detainee Explains Prison Conditions 3. Sudan's al-Turabi Interviewed 4. Brotherhood Leader Denounces Campaign 5. Writer Explains Anti-Brotherhood Campaign LAWYERS ANNOUNCE GENERAL STRIKE Qutb al-'Arabi and Khalid Yunis write on pages 1 and 7 an approximately 1,200-word report on the Egyptian lawyers' protests at what they see as the government's harassment of lawyers. The report notes that on 20 June the Lawyers Association's Council met and decided to declare a general strike on 28 and 29 June in protest of the continued detention of lawyers and the arrest of five new lawyers on 14 June. 'Abd-al-'Aziz Muhammad, head of the Cairo Lawyers Association, has announced that he will continue his hunger strike until all detained lawyers are released and the public prosecutor announces the results of the investigations into the death of 'Abd-al-Harith Madani, the lawyer who died while in police custody. Muhammad, who is a diabetic, said that should he die as a result of his hunger strike, the president of the Republic and the government would be liable before the law. DETAINEE EXPLAINS PRISON CONDITIONS On page 2 under the headline "A Bloody Letter From Inside the Abu-Za'bal Prison," the paper publishes a letter received from engineer 'Abd-al-Rahim 'Abd-al-Salam from Samalut, al-Minya Governorate. In introducing the approximately 2,000-word letter, the paper notes that it receives dozens of letters, phone calls, and complaints every day from relatives of people detained at the Abu- Za'bal Prison in which they describe the tragic conditions experienced by more than 2,500 detainees inside the prison, which the paper describes as similar to what existed in the Middle Ages. 'Abd-al-Salam gives his account of his four-month stay at the Abu-Za'bal prison and describes in detail the inhuman conditions and the torture that inmates suffer inside the prison. 'Abd-al-Salam does not specify the charges for which he was locked up. A drawing published above the message shows a prisoner hanging upside down by a rope and being lashed by a policeman with a whip. Addressing the prisoner, the policeman says: "If you don't repent, we will make you repent." SUDAN'S AL-TURABI INTERVIEWED On page 4 the paper publishes an approximately 2,500-word dispatch by European affairs correspondent Ayman 'Ali that includes an interview Sudanese National Front leader Hasan al-Turabi gave to Britain's Channel 4 on 5 June. In the interview, al-Turabi refutes the Western charges against Islam and the Islamic movement and explains Sudan's Islamic experiment. BROTHERHOOD LEADER DENOUNCES CAMPAIGN In an approximately 1,500-word article on page 5, Muslim Brotherhood Deputy Guide Mustafa Mashhur notes that Prophet Muhammad's hegira, or migration, from Mecca to Medina in the year 622 offers some lessons to Muslims today. He explains that the first lesson to be learned from the Prophet's experience is his patience and endurance in the face of "harassment and torture" by infidels. This shows that the faithful must never give up their belief regardless of the "pressure" they may come under, he adds. Mashhur adds: "Every Muslim must feel that it is his duty to propagate this religion among humanity and that he must follow the model of the Prophet, may God's peace be upon him, and his companions in patience, perseverance, and endurance." He notes that "victory" will be the reward for this patience and endurance. Another lesson, he writes, is the attention that the Prophet has paid to the mosque in its capacity as an "Islamic institution" in which Muslims practice their rites and discuss their affairs. He adds: "It is unfortunate to see the scheming against this establishment nowadays." The mosques and the appointment of the mosque imams, he adds, have become the prerogatives of the Ministry of Awqaf and no activity is practiced inside the mosques, which are shut off immediately after prayers. Turning to the current campaign against the Muslim Brotherhood, Mashhur writes: "The current campaign against the Brotherhood is part of the campaign against Islam and the principles of Islam that is conducted and planned by active enemies and that is performed by local followers. They mix terrorism and extremism with Islam, the religion of peace and security. We even find some people who criticize the women's veil and reject God's orders in this respect. While the media organs prevent veiled broadcasters from appearing on the screen, they allow cheap obscenity involving women in advertisements and low-quality movies." He notes that the Muslim brothers are falsely accused of adopting violence and seeking to overthrow the regime, charges that are published in the national press which is subsidized by the people's money. He adds: "We tell all these people and those who collaborate with acts of injustice that nobody will come to your aid when God calls you to account for every word said or act done to support the oppressor." He consoles the oppressed people by telling them that the Prophet's life gives a vivid example of how the faithful, who were few in number, have triumphed over all their enemies. He urges them to be patient, to persevere, and to pray to God for victory. WRITER EXPLAINS ANTI-BROTHERHOOD CAMPAIGN Labor Party official Naji al-Shihabi writes an approximately 1,000-word article entitled "The Campaign Against the Brotherhood and a New Era" on page 11. He notes that security documents published in the magazine AL-MUSAWWAR accuse the Muslim Brotherhood of seeking to establish a political party, as if it is an unforgiven crime. The Brotherhood, he adds, has been operating since 1928 and accordingly it has a right to establish a party to reach power through the ballot box; that is, by the public will. He explains that describing the Muslim Brotherhood as an illegitimate group is absurd, since legitimacy comes from the people whom this group serves. The people, he adds, voted for this group when it joined the Labor Party in the 1987 elections for the People's Assembly. Explaining the reasons for the government's campaign against the Brotherhood, al-Shihabi adds: "We believe that the recent campaign against the Muslim Brotherhood group is due to its rise as a political group possessing enough elements of strength that have enabled it to virtually control the Professional Associations, with all the human and financial resources available to these associations." He adds that observers and analysts believe that such a performance could enable the Brotherhood to reach power through a "peaceful popular will," something that has frightened the regime.
