Today, the pickets at the building of the State Duma expressed their liking for the deputies. [Begin recording] [Correspondent Aleksandr Lutskoy] About 100 supporters of the idea of communism and the restoration of the Soviet Union, under red banners and singing revolutionary songs to the accompaniment of accordions, gathered this morning near the building of the State Duma. The pickets chanted antigovernment and antipresidential slogans and expressed fervent approval of the communist deputies. The latter, in turn, expressed gratitude for the support. [Lutskoy, addressing Communist Deputy R. Gostev] You represent the Communists. [Gostev] Yes. [Lutskoy] What is your attitude toward the government? The present one? [Gostev] It is a critical one. [Lutskoy] Do you think we need a consolidation of all powers at present, both of the executive and the legislative powers? [Gostev] Yes, certainly. [Lutskoy] But if your attitude is a critical one what do you think should be done in respect of the present government? [Gostev] We have a lot of questions for the government, and it is possible that finally a question on the resignation of the government will be raised. [Lutskoy] Your attitude toward the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia]? [Gostev] I think that one should regard the LDPR as a party that exists. But I think that to say that this is a party of fascists, etc, I believe that is wrong. LDPR reflects..., with the stand that Zhirinovskiy has put forward he has managed to strike a chord with people. [Lutskoy] The communist deputies, having talked to the gathering, went off to work in the Duma, while the pickets continued rallying.
