FR941110-1-00055 FR941110-1-00010 The Act provides that a marketing order can only apply to a defined commodity grown in a specified production area. No authority exists for regulating the handling of that commodity grown outside that production area. In accordance with proposed §956.85, the order should provide that the Secretary conduct a periodic referendum every six years with the initial referendum conducted within six years of the effective date of the marketing order. The Secretary of Agriculture has determined that continuance referenda are an effective means for ascertaining whether producers favor continuance of marketing order programs. The Act provides that the Secretary shall terminate a marketing order whenever, through the conduct of a referendum, it is indicated that a majority of all producers favor termination and such majority produced more than 50 percent of the commodity for market during a representative period. Since less than 50 percent of all producers usually participate in a referendum, it is difficult to determine overall producer support or opposition to termination of an order. Thus, to provide a basis for determining whether producers favor continuance of the order, a provision for continuance referenda should be included. Continuance should be based upon the affirmative vote of either two-thirds of the producers voting or an affirmative vote of the producers of two-thirds of the volume of Walla Walla Sweet Onions represented in the referendum. The Act requires that in the promulgation or amendment of a marketing order, at least two-thirds of the producers voting, by number or volume represented in the referendum, must favor the issuance or amendment of a marketing order. Continuance referenda should be based on the same standard of industry support. This requirement is considered adequate to measure producers' support to continue the marketing order. The Secretary would consider termination of the order if less than two-thirds of the producers voting in the referendum and producers of less than two-thirds of the volume of Walla Walla Sweet Onions represented in the referendum favor continuance. In evaluating the merits of continuance versus termination, the Secretary should not only consider the results of the referendum but also should consider all other relevant information concerning the operation of the order and the relative benefits and disadvantages to producers, handlers and consumers in order to determine whether continued operation of the order would tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. In any event, section 608(C)(16)(B) of the Act requires the Secretary to terminate the order whenever the Secretary finds that the majority of all producers favor termination, and that such majority produced more than 50 percent of the commodity for market. The Secretary's ``Guidelines for Fruit, Vegetable, and Specialty Crop Marketing Orders'' provide for periodic referenda to allow producers the opportunity to indicate their support for or rejection of a marketing order. It is the position of the Department that periodic referenda ensure that marketing order programs continue to be accountable to producers, obligate producers to evaluate their programs periodically, and involve them more closely in their operation. The record evidence supports these goals. The provisions of proposed §§956.87 through 956.99 of the order as contained in the Notice of Hearing and hereinafter set forth, are common to marketing agreements and orders now operating. All such provisions are incidental to and not inconsistent with the Act and are necessary to effectuate the other provisions of the marketing order and marketing agreement and to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. The record evidence supports inclusion of each such provision as proposed in the Notice of Hearing. These provisions, which are applicable to both the marketing agreement and the marketing order, are identified by section number and heading as follows: §956.87 Proceedings after termination; §956.88 Effect of termination or amendment; §956.90 Right of the Secretary; §956.91 Duration of immunities; §956.92 Agents; §956.93 Derogation; §956.94 Personal liability; §956.95 Separability; and §956.96 Amendments. Those provisions applicable to the marketing agreement only are: §956.97 Counterparts; §956.98 Additional parties; and §956.99 Order with marketing agreement. Miscellaneous changes have been made from the provisions as proposed in the notice of hearing for the purpose of clarity.
