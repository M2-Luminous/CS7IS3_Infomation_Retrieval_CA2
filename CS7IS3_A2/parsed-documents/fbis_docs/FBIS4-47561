Izzatullayev, Zoology and Parasitology Institute at the Tajikistani Academy of Sciences, Dushanbe; UDC [594:574.63](28)(575)] [Abstract] The lack of published studies where mollusks--as pollution indicators--are treated without regard to other aquatic life forms, and their unique ability to filter off organic contaminants as well as the stringent requirements the mollusks impose on the water quality prompted the use of the mollusk presence in aquatic biocenoses as the principal indicator of water purity. In a toxic medium, mollusks do not feed and close up, while when they pass all water through themselves, mollusks, especially such bivalves as the 9-11 cm long Colletopterum piscinale and 25-27 cm long C. cyreum sogdianum, are capable of filtering up to 60-70 and 180-200 l per day, respectively, and stopping all suspended particles. The incidence of 63 species of Gastropoda and Bivalvia indicator mollusks in various types of Central Asian reservoirs and streams is summarized. The mollusk distribution by the water body type as a pollution indicator in Central Asia is a first of its kind in scientific literature. In all, 56 out of the 63 species are recommended for the first time as bioindicators. The findings show that out of the total of 63 species, 15 inhabit only catarobic and oligosaprobic bodies of water and are excellent water purity indicators, 15 are good indicators only of oligosaprobic slightly contaminated water, 16 are indicators of only beta-mesosaprobic mildly contaminated water, and two species inhabit only alpha-mesosaprobic moderately contaminated water.
