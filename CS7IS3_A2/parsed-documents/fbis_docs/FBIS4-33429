Robaina said this can be verified by how the Cuban delegation's suggestions were taken into consideration in the drafting of the final document, which will be submitted tomorrow, the last working day of the meeting of the foreign ministers of the NAM, which is being held in Cairo, the Egyptian capital. The minister described the meeting as positive "not only because of its results but also because of the high number of foreign ministers present and their almost unanimous commitment to strengthen the movement." He also noted the consensus in guaranteeing the continuity of the NAM and in drafting a document that can reinforce the progress attained in Jakarta, Indonesia, in 1993, as well as making progress in the reinforcement of the role that should be played by this group of 109 countries in these complex political times. "These have been the priorities we have all had during these intense working days, and we are still working at this moment in the economic and political commissions, in which Cuba is playing an important role," he said. The foreign minister noted that the amendments presented by his delegation were incorporated into the final document, in which there is also recognition of the role played by Indonesia while leading the movement. Commenting on the possible designation of Colombia as the next host of the NAM in 1995, he insisted that in the face of an increasingly unipolar world the most important thing is the collective commitment of those of us who represent two thirds of humanity in having a voice and sufficient well-earned authority. "I believe that that is what has motivated us in this forum. There is an understanding of these things, and we have made progress in drafting the documents in the meeting and in holding a unilateral meeting with all the delegations present here," he said. He noted, however, that this opportunity is also part of the strategy that the NAM had been pursuing in a systematic manner, having the Presidency rotated throughout the regions of the world. "It is a big commitment, and we do not have the slightest doubt that Colombia can play an important role in the development of the NAM. I believe it is a big commitment for Latin America at a difficult time for the movement, and it will be especially up to Colombia to guarantee the movement's reorganization, strengthening, and increasingly important presence at the international forums," Robaina said. Asked about the acceptance of the Cuban proposal to democratize the United Nations, Robaina said it was widely supported by the majority of the participants. "We have the authority to say that if democracy is demanded of the peoples and countries, it must also be demanded of the United Nations. We can no longer be fooled with the false concept of a democratization process; we have to achieve a transparency in that international forum," he pointed out. He also said that the Cuban delegation wanted not only to denounce this situation but also to present proposals. Speaking about the upcoming Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, he said these meetings continue to be "an opportunity to hold discussions without receiving orders from the United States. "It is particularly threatened by the hemispheric summit convened by the U.S. Government in Miami with the clear purpose of discrediting it (the Ibero-American summit), and, in view of this intention, it is necessary for Cartagena to come out stronger," he said. As for the meeting in Colombia, he pointed out that with independence in carrying out their actions, the Latin American peoples are increasingly more independent and will continue to find their own roads. "I have trust in the way the Colombians will prepare the summit and in the peoples' response. I believe that in Cartagena we are going to have an important forum and an opportunity for debate without prewritten speeches. "I prefer a summit of actions and not of intentions," said the Cuban foreign minister, who met in Cairo with most of his counterparts attending the ministerial conference of the NAM.
