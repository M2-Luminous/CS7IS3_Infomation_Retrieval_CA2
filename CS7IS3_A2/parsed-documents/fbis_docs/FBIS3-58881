This does not mean that terrorism will be completely eliminated, he said, but its arms, wings, legs, and spine will be broken. Adressing a meeting organized by the Great Anatolia Group in Ankara today, Golhan said that the leaders of terrorist groups are usually not of Turkish origin. He explained that the separatist organization is being supported from inside and outside Turkey. The government is determined to fight terrorism and every support is being extended to the security forces regarding this issue, he said. The minister pointed out that the efforts being made abroad to fight terrorism have also been successful. However, he said, certain neighboring countries are welcoming the terrorist organization kicked out by the West, but this will not benefit anyone. On the postponement of discharges from the Army, the national defense minister said: [Begin Golhan recording] Turkey is not in the position it was six months ago. Nor is it in the position it was one year ago; far from it. There is fire around Turkey. Turkey is surrounded by fire. Certain elections were held in some of the countries surrounding Turkey. New leaders were elected. You read their statements in the press. Today, Turkey is faced with danger, with a risk potential, more than it was yesterday. Turkey has decided to get rid of the curse of the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan]. What were we expected to do? Nothing? [end recording] Golhan stressed that like all countries in the world, Turkey will overcome terrorism. He urged terrorists to surrender while there is still time.
