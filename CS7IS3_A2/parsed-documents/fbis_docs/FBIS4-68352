G. B.: "Primakov's Stripes"] [Text] Academician Ye.M. Primakov is the director of the Foreign Intelligence Service [FIS] of the Russian Federation. Yevgeniy Maksimovich is the only one of the notorious Gorbachev's closest and prominent confederates who also stayed on Yeltsin's team. As is known, this happened because Primakov, a very farsighted politician, got his correct bearings in time and from the beginning of 1991 began to secretly supply the needed information to the former RSFSR president's inner circle. The academician's talent for secrecy served him well later, when he bargained for himself the job of FIS head (he was also aiming at that of minister of foreign affairs). ...The academician-director's prominent trait is lordly generosity and love for his "loyal crowd." For instance, Primakov's permanent aide (of many years now) Robert Vartanovich Markaryan, who has never been in any way related to intelligence, was recently promoted to the rank of general! General Markaryan (who lovingly and tenderly carried Primakov's suitcases during his numerous voyages) is planning to become head of the FIS information-analytical department. My, what a gift for the CIA! Some time in the past Primakov gave his buddy Kantorov the job of legal department chief, which has only a few employees. And behold!--Kantorov also becomes an intelligence general. A man Primakov needs very much is Yuriy Antonovich Zubakov (a friendly nickname within the FIS--Dubakov). Deputy director for personnel, Zubakov has already become a rear admiral. Having donned a glittering admiral's uniform, Yuriy Antonovich likes to admire himself in the mirror when he is alone. By the way, the personnel director-admiral Zubakov-Dubakov intends to become head of one of Russia's stations in a far abroad foreign country. One imperialistic tabloid has already published a write-up of this dream. Academician-director Primakov is not only a "hospitable" host, but also a "wise" arbiter in the squabbles among his entourage. For instance, Mr. Mertsalov, chief of the FIS transportation and utilization department, and his "war" deputy Mr. Panov recently came to blows. To such an extent that the shock waves generated by this "clash of the titans" reverberated throughout the entire service. Professional intelligence officers, who still remember the special responsibilities of their profession, came to the conclusion that both Mertsalov and Panov were on their way to being dismissed in disgrace from the FIS. Naive people, they forgot about the academician's love for his retinue. Mr. Panov ceremonially departed for a foreign assignment, while Mr. Mertsalov still grandly occupies his old position of responsibility. ...Do you want to become a general under Primakov? Become a "useful" person for the academician-director.
