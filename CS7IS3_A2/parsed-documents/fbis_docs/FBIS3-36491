Zhirinovskiy Was the First To Visit Yugoslavia After the December Elections, Now They Wait for Zyuganov"] [Text] The Yugoslav problem, or rather approaches to its solution, is becoming not only a weapon of political struggle in high echelons of power in Russia, but also an apple of discord between our country and its allies in the West. But if formerly the Serb card was played only by a part of the former Supreme Soviet in the struggle against the president, now Yeltsin's and Kozyrev's stand on the Balkans is opposed by a mighty State Duma bloc, where the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR], the communists, and nonaligned conservatives may become the main sources of trouble. Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's current visit to Yugoslavia is a case in point. Now they are waiting in Belgrade for Gennadiy Zyuganov, who was invited by the New Communist Movement, a party that garnered 18,000 votes in the latest elections. The fantastic promises and statements Zhirinovskiy lavishly made in Vukovar and Podgorice, in Bosnia and Slovenia, might be dismissed as hysteria and paranoia. No other representative of the Russian leadership, however, has thought it necessary to come here and explain to ordinary folks by word and deed, just like that, face to face, raising a glass and breaking bread, the essence of Russia's Balkan policy. At present, the initiative is obviously held by the nationalistic patriots and communists. The democratic reformers still keep the Yugoslav problem on the back burner and keep losing -- points, so far; tomorrow, maybe, their heads. The personalities of Zhirinovskiy and Zyuganov elicit mixed feelings both in Moscow and in Belgrade. The fact remains, however, that Zhirinovskiy is the first Russian deputy and prominent figure in Russia to have come to this country after the December elections. If we recall that before the October events in Moscow it was also deputies -- Achalov, Pavlov, Isakov, Konstantinov and their ilk -- who visited Belgrade, the picture will be complete. Those who invited Zhirinovskiy expected that his visit would raise the spirits of the Serbs and the Montenegrins. Both -- those who are weary of living in trenches for the third year running, and ordinary citizens, whose patience in not limitless in the conditions of sanctions and blockade. The expectations of the tour's organizers were fulfilled. At a time when the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina is bracing for a new spiral -- either a scenario involving force; or the partition of the scorched country between the Croats and the Serbs; or lifting the ban on arms sales to the Muslims; or yet more unexpected options -- Zhirinovskiy told Serbs that they are no longer alone. That there is a party that will change Russia's foreign policy, send an army to their rescue, and give them new secret weapons. Maybe that is precisely what earned the LDPR leader the first order in his career. It happened at a little-publicized dinner in Belgrade, which was organized in the Russian guest's honor by Arkan, a man wanted by police of a number of European countries and by Interpol. A former criminal turned leader of the Serb Unity Party, who has made millions of dollars out of the war, decorated Zhirinovskiy with an order that had formerly been given only to Arkan's own hitmen. The consequences of the visit are easy to predict. As early as this Saturday Zhirinovskiy promised to hold a rally in Moscow. At the Duma he will do his utmost to crush the already fragile positions of his political opponents under the slogan of saving Orthodox brothers. The international community, threatened with a reemerging idea of carving up the world into blocs and unleashing a new war, which would not necessarily be cold, will change its strategy and tactics with regard to Russia. The phenomenon of Zhirinovskiy and Zyuganov, the alliance of the nationalistic patriots and communists, is a qualitatively new development in the former Eastern bloc countries. It is neither pure fascism nor communism. As Adam Michnik fittingly put it, it is a mixture of the idea of an ethnically pure state with populist rhetoric and a nostalgia for stability under dictatorship. This trend is currently thriving all across the former Yugoslavia, from Zagreb to Belgrade. That is why as soon as they heard familiar music from Moscow, Vladimir Volfovich's Yugoslav counterparts invited him to reinforce their orchestra.
