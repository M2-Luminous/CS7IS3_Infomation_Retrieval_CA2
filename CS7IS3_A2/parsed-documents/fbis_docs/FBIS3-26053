In 1993 the prefecture registered a total trade volume of 1.285 billion yuan, an increase of 20 percent over the previous year. Last year Nanning Prefecture's border trade declined for a period of time. For this reason, the prefectural party committee conducted market surveys, formulated a preferential policy, and coordinated relations between different departments, thus developing border trade to a new height. Now this prefecture has taken new measures to bring about further development in border trade.
