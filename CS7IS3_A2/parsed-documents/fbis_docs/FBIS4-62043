A statement to this effect was made by the Russian prime minister on Wednesday as he addressed lawmakers of the State Duma during debates on a draft law on the state budget for 1994. According to Chernomyrdin, the suggested figures of budgetary expenditures and revenues and the budget deficit envisaged by the draft law and insisted upon by the Russian Government will enable to keep inflation rates under control. If the suggested federal budget is not approved by the State Duma as soon as possible, the Government will be devoid of starting points necessary for the formation of its economic policy. If the Duma approves of key figures of the state budget, Russian lawmakers jointly with the Government will be able to finalize the draft in a calm and orderly way, redistribute funds and decide "where to channel extra funds and at whose expense," Chernomyrdin said.
