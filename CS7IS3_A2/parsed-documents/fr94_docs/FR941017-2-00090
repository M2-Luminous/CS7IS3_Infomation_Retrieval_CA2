FR941017-2-00090 FR941017-2-00057 [Release No. 34&hyph;34807; File No. SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;94&hyph;06] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change and Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 to the Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. Relating to Exercise Cut-Off Procedures for Expiring Equity Options October 7, 1994. Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''). 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 on March 16, 1994, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') a proposed rule change relating to the exercise procedures for expiring equity option contracts. The proposal was published for comment in the Federal Register on May 18, 1994. 3 No comments were received on the proposed rule change. The CBOE filed Amendment No. 1 to the proposal on September 19, 1994, and Amendment No. 2 on October 5, 1994. 4 This order approves the proposed rule change, as amended. 5 1 15 U.S.C. ยง78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1993). 3 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34051 (May 12, 1994), 59 FR 25970 (May 18, 1994). 4 In Amendment Nos. 1 and 2, the CBOE proposes to make certain clarifying amendments to Rule 11.1, as discussed herein. See Letters from Jeffrey Schroer, Vice President, Market Regulation, Regulatory Services Division, CBOE, to Sharon Lawson, Assistant Director, Office of Market Supervision (``OMS''), Division of Market Regulation (``Division''), Commission, dated September 19, 1994 (``Amendment No. 1''); and from Patricia Cerny, Director, Department of Market Surveillance, CBOE, to Brad Ritter, Senior Counsel, OMS, Division, Commission, and dated October 5, 1994 (``Amendment No. 2''). 5 The Commission notes that substantively similar proposals by the other options exchanges are being approved concurrently with the CBOE's proposed rule change. See File Nos. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;94&hyph;01; SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;93&hyph;37; and SR&hyph;PSE&hyph;94&hyph;12. Currently, with regard to expiring equity options, CBOE customers and member organizations 6 are required to indicate their exercise decisions to clearing members no later than 5:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time (``E.S.T.'') on the business day immediately prior to the expiration date of the options (``Exercise Cut-Off Time''). 7 This is the latest time at which an exercise instruction 8 may be: (1) Prepared by a clearing member for positions in its proprietary trading account; (2) accepted by a clearing member from a market maker or floor broker for positions in the market maker's account or the floor broker's error account; or (3) accepted by a member organization from any customer for positions in the customer's account. 9 The only exceptions to Rule 11.1 are: (1) To remedy mistakes or errors made in good faith; (2) to take appropriate action as the result of a failure to reconcile unmatched Exchange transactions; and (3) where exceptional circumstances relating to a customer's or member's ability to communicate exercise instructions to a member organization (or a member organization's ability to receive such exercise instructions) prior to the Exercise Cut-Off Time warrant such action. 10 An exercise instruction memorandum must be prepared and time stamped for the exercise of all option contracts not automatically exercised pursuant to OCC Rule 805. 11 If a member organization receives an exercise instruction or tenders an exercise notice to the OCC pursuant to one of the exceptions described above, the member organization must maintain a memorandum setting forth the circumstances giving rise to the exception. 12 6 As used herein, the term ``member organization'' also includes individual members of the Exchange. 7 See CBOE Rule 11.1. Generally, equity options may be traded until the close of business on the last business day before expiration, which is generally the third Friday of the expiration month (``Expiration Friday''). 8 For customers, an exercise instruction is a notice delivered to a member organization to exercise an option. For a clearing member, market maker, or floor broker, an exercise instruction is a notice to The Options Clearing Corporation (``OCC'') to exercise an option that would not be automatically exercised pursuant to the OCC's exercise-by-exception procedure (``OCC Rule 805''), or not to exercise an option that otherwise would automatically be exercised pursuant to OCC Rule 805. See infra note 15. The OCC has separate rules regarding the cut-off time by which exercise notices must be delivered to the OCC by the clearing members. The proposed rule change does not in any way affect the rules of the OCC. 9 In most cases, exercise instructions are transmitted to Exchange clearing members electronically through the Clearing Management and Control System (``C/MACS''). Telephone conversation between Jeffrey Schroer, Vice President, Market Surveillance, CBOE, and Brad Ritter, Attorney, OMS, Division, Commission, on July 27, 1994. 10 CBOE Rule 11.1 does not apply to expiring series of index options on the business day immediately prior to expiration. See CBOE Rule 11.1, Interpretation .03(e). An additional purpose of the proposed rule change is to specifically state within Rule 11.1 that the Exercise Cut-Off Time does not apply to expiring index options. 11 See infra note 14. The Exchange deems the preparation, time stamping, or submission of an exercise instruction memorandum prior to the purchase the contracts to be exercised to be a violation of Rule 11.1. See CBOE Rule 11.1, Interpretation .02. 12 Should the market maker, customer or firm subsequently determine not to exercise all or part of the advised contracts, the member must also deliver an ``advice cancel'' in such form or manner as prescribed by the Exchange. See CBOE Rule 11.1, Interpretation .03(a). Presently, it is a violation of Rule 11.1 for clearing members to accept exercise instructions after the Exercise Cut-Off Time, except in reliance on one of the above exceptions. Because exercise instructions are submitted to the clearing members and then to the OCC by the clearing members, without having the audit trail pass directly through the Exchange, it is difficult for the Exchange to surveil for violations of Rule 11.1. 13 13 The Commission believes that the Exercise Cut-Off Time serves an important investor protection function. Specifically, the Exercise Cut-Off Time protects holders of short positions in equity options from unanticipated events occurring after the close of the market. As the Commission has previously stated, if expiring equity options were allowed to be exercised after the Exercise Cut-Off Time for reasons other than the exceptions set forth above, the Commission believes that options writers could be unfairly disadvantaged with respect to options holders by not having the same opportunity to react to such unanticipated events. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 19589 (March 10, 1983), 48 FR 11196 (March 16, 1983).
