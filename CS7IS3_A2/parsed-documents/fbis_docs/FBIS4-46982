The foundations for this meeting were laid in Moscow on March 12, 1993, by heads of the CIS member states who signed an anti-monopoly agreement. A few months later CIS representatives met to set the appropriate guidelines. Another meeting in Almaty on October 15, 1993, dealt with legal imperfections in the Moscow agreement and lack of coordination. Basic principles for competition and integration were set forth in Ashhabad on December 23, 1993: the CIS representatives agreed on anti-monopoly policies and establishment of an Interstate Council. In opening the conference Oleksander Zavada, head of the Ukrainian Anti-Monopoly Committee, noted that the Kiev forum was the best attended and included Eastern European representatives. He underscored the fact that the purpose of the meeting was to enhance cooperation in anti-monopoly policies among the CIS members and develop analogous relationships with Baltic and East European countries. Since all the countries shared a common economic system in the recent past, there is great need for such coordination, particularly where international trade is involved. To that end, Ukraine had initiated this meeting to coordinate anti-monopoly measures and safeguard entrepreneurs and consumers alike. This was particularly important because of expansion of the activities of trans-national corporation. While Zavada agreed that the experience of Russia or some Eastern European countries may not have been too impressive, Ukraine must take their experience into account when formulating its anti-monopoly policies because of their encounters with market economy problems and monopolistic practices. Moreover, Ukraine has already implemented over three hundred anti-monopoly measures and has created a corresponding legal framework to support them. It is important for Ukraine that these laws fit in with the rest of Ukrainian jurisprudence. The meeting culminated with the signing of the appropriate documents of understanding, integration and implementation among the CIS members, Baltic states and Eastern European countries. In addition, the Interstate Council considered methodological ramifications of cooperation in light of individual national laws. The meeting ratified a memorandum issued by the Interstate Council to the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly entitled "Concordance of National Anti-Monopoly Laws with the Anti-Monopoly Agreement Signed by CIS Heads of State at Ashhabad on December 23, 1993." Leonid Bochyn, head of the Interstate Council and of the Russian State Committee on Anti-Monopoly Policy, has characterized the memorandum as being important because it calls for concordance of anti-monopoly laws, passage of applicable laws by parliaments of CIS member states, and creation of enforcing agencies.
