FBIS4-54613 "dreeu085__a94026" FBIS-EEU-94-085-A Daily Report 3 May 1994 ANNEX Slovakia Daily `Apologizing' to Meciar on Affair Story Daily `Apologizing' to Meciar on Affair Story AU0305124494 Prague CTK in English 1025 GMT 3 May 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU0305124494 Prague CTK English BFN [Text] Bratislava, May 3 (CTK) -- The editorial staff of the Bratislava evening paper VECERNIK are apologizing to ex-Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar and the former director of his secretariat, Anna Nagyova, for publishing on April 26 an article headlined "Will Vladko Be Rocking the Cradle?", the daily REPUBLIKA writes today. Last week VECERNIK wrote that "the love, kept secret for several years, between Vladko (diminutive for Vladimir) and his right hand Anicka (diminutive for Anna) who until very recently were calling the shots in the political heavens is to bear well-deserved fruit for the benefit of our country in five or six months." "It is true that we have published something in small italics, written in a considerably ironical manner, and headlined Will Vladko Be Rocking the Cradle?, on April 26, without mentioning specific," but making it possible to guess that it concerned the above mentioned figures, VECERNIK confessed. The paper called on the Austrian Press Agency APA to publish a denial of its report, in which it cited the full names of former Slovak ex-Prime Minister and director of his secretariat, referring to the VECERNIK story. A spokesman of Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) said that "Austria was interfering with the election campaign in Slovakia in the dirtiest possible way."
