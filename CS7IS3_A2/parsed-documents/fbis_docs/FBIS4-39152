Parliament commissions and factions have discussed the structure for a long time, and elaborated three drafts of the corresponding law. The draft of the standing commission for state building, legislation, lawfulness and legal order coordinated with the government has been basically approved. The draft includes a number of changes and amendments to the current law on the system of central bodies of the Crimean state executive power. Under the document all ministries and state committees of the republic shall be formed and liquidated by the parliament on proposal of the president. The minister shall be a government member, appointed and removed from his post by the president on coordination with the parliament. The government can also include heads of other central bodies. The suggested number of ministries and state committees provoked parliament debates. It was finally decided to form key ministries in order to enable government work. Proposals on other ministries and committees will be submitted by the government to the parliament within two weeks. Asked about the discussions, Vice-Premier Yevgeniy Saburov told UKRINFORM "it is a normal procedure. At the same time, the situation is rather tense and we cannot afford even a week. We should do it more quickly. But we have opponents in the parliament, and they are using all methods to protract the process. I am not sure everything will end today". Despite this forecast, the parliament quickly agreed to confirm the appointment of Anatoliy Franchuk minister for control over state enterprises, Sergey Nikolskiy minister for agriculture and foodstuffs, Andrey Chernyavskiy minister of economy and Lyudmila Zaitseva minister of finance. The last three have moved to the Crimea from Moscow. Working groups of deputies from the Ukrainian and Crimean parliaments continued working simultaneously with the debates to elaborate proposals on settlement of the Crimean problem.
