But in a private conversation with me an acquaintance of mine, an employee of the abolished ministry, provided a different description of this edict -- "a taming of shrews." Who, then, will take the place of the former Ministry of Security? To all appearances, Russia's Federal Counterintelligence Service [FCS], directly subordinate to the president, will now become "the motherland's shield." In addition to combating foreign special services, it is also entrusted with functions such as combating terrorism, illegal arms trafficking, the drug mafia, and armed bandit formations. Economic and military counterintelligence remains under the FCS wing. The investigative apparatus passes to the Russian General Prosecutor's Office, special subunits pass to the Federal Agency of Government Communications and Information and the Main Administration of the President's Guard, while the notorious "Lefortovo" passes to the jurisdiction of the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs]. The Russian Federation Border Guard Troops have also been detached and transformed into the independent Federal Border Service with the rights of a separate ministry. The staff of the counterintelligence organs has been reduced -- to 75,000 employees in the provinces and 1,500 in the management apparatus. In the opinion of Sergey Stepashin, first deputy director of the FCS, such a reorganization will not affect the quality of the special services' work. But those who wish to stay will have to undergo recertification at the president's request, which will drag on for approximately one month. The question of the transfer of the "Alfa" and "Vympel" subunits to the FCS has not yet been raised, but, bearing in mind the struggle against terrorism, the counterintelligence service will still have to acquire its own special-purpose subunit. The Main Administration of the President's Guard and the MVD, which is increasingly turning into a supermonster like the sadly memorable GPU-NKVD [State Political Administration-People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs], will most likely tackle "internal intelligence" or, roughly speaking, political surveillance of the opposition and of political parties. There is another "expected surprise." Yuriy Baturin was appointed the Russian president's assistant for national security. He seems to be becoming one of the most influential figures in Boris Yeltsin's entourage as controller of all the country's power structures.
