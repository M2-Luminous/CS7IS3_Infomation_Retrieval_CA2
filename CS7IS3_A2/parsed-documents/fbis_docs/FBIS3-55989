Although he did not rule out some urgent requests from the government, he emphasized that usually departments were asked to prepare applicable documents in advance. Nonetheless, he suggested that Russian and American negotiators might discuss cooperation in the field and air appropriate "intentions". As Interfax has learned, the sides have several big projects at various stages of readiness, which could place U.S. firms among the biggest investors in Russia's fuel and energy complex. According to one plan to get under way within the next few weeks, Russia will receive a $2 Bn loan under U.S. export-import bank guarantees to buy American oil and gas extracting equipment. Besides, a project to develop two oil fields on the Sakhalin shelf is in the final stage of preparation. The deal is estimated at $10 Bn and involves three U.S. firms. Russian officials are also considering a possible lucrative contract with Texaco to extract oil in the Archangelsk region and advance its infrastructure. The project could take 50 years to implement at the cost of over $50 Bn.
