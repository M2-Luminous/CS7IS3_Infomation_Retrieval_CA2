The Central Jakarta District Court found the 30-year-old Nuku guilty of producing and distributing stickers insulting to President Suharto. The sentence was less than the maximum allowed by law and sought by government prosecutors. Nuku faced the sentencing alone since his lawyers have boycotted the trial in protest over the court's refusal ta allow them to call witnesses to testify on Nuku's behalf. For his part, Nuku remained silent throughout as he continued his silent protest which began two sessions earlier, also over the court's refusal to hear the testimony of his witnesses. Nuku, who chairs the Pijar Foundation human rights group, was arrested during a demonstration at the House of Representatives last November. Police claimed he was distributing stickers offensive to the president. "This court finds Nuku Soleiman guilty of all charges and sentences him to four years in prison," said Presiding Judge Nurhayati. The panel of judges said they could find only one mitigating factor when passing the sentence, Nuku's relative youth. They cited several factors that worked against him, including the lack of respect he showed the court during the trial, two previous convictions, and no evidence of remorse. They also deplored the harsh language employed by Nuku during the trial. The judges later asked Nuku whether or not he would appeal the sentence. The defendant, still maintaining his silence, walked up to the judges and presented a written statement which his close friends confirmed as a note claiming that he will appeal. The courtroom was packed with the defendant's supporters, mostly clad in the green jacket of the National University, Nuku's almamater. They yelled at the judges and challenged them to pass a heavier sentence. Also present in the public gallery were opposition figures, including Ali Sadikin and Chris Siner Key Timu. Adnan Buyung Nasution, chairman of the Legal Aid Foundation, which organized Nuku's defense, was also present. As Nuku was being escorted out of the courtroom, his supporters yelled encouragement and sang the patriotic song Padamu Negeri (For You the Nation). Buyung later termed the verdict a tragedy for the nation because punishment was meted out to someone who merely acted out his constitutional right. "This shows that free impartial movement is no longer guaranteed, he said. He said that courts of law in Indonesia are controlled by the government and that judges could not be impartial when presiding over politically sensitive cases such as Nuku's. "Under such a suppressive atmosphere, it's difficult to find an idealistic judge. The judges had taken their stand against the defendant from the very beginning," he said. Buyung labeled this trial worse than the mid-1980s political trial of dissident leader Lt. Gen. (retired) H.R. Dharsono whom he helped defend. Nuku's friends later distributed to reporters a five-page typed statement he crafted while in detention, which said he had made no attempt to defend himself because he did not believe in the impartiality of the court. "A strong and powerful force from outside the court has arranged the trial and the verdict has been rendered long before the trial began," said Nuku in the statement.
