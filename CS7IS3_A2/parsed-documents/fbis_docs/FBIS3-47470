Vice International Trade and Industry Minister Hideaki Kumano told a press conference that the Japanese side will seek the understanding of their U.S. counterparts by explaining the circumstances surrounding a recent fall in the share of foreign microchips in Japan. Although the ratio has dropped the absolute quantity of foreign microchips sold in Japan has increased, Kumano said. The foreign share of Japan's microchips market during the July-September period of 1993 fell below 20 percent for the third consecutive quarterly drop. Dissatisfied with the results, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor asked Japan for an emergency meeting on the matter in January. The 20 percent is cited in a 1991 bilateral semiconductor trade pact as the share level of foreign-made microchips in Japan expected to be achieved by the end of 1992. Under the pact, emergency meetings are provided for if the objectives of the arrangement are not being achieved. No such consultations have been held so far. The share of foreign microchips in Japan, as calculated by the U.S. formula, reached 20.2 percent in the last quarter of 1992, heading off U.S. sanctions, but has fallen since, to 19.6 percent in the first quarter, 19.2 percent in the second quarter, and 18.1 percent in the third quarter of 1993.
