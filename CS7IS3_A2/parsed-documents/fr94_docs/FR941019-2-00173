FR941019-2-00173 FR941019-2-00092 II. Description of the Proposal A. CAPS and QIX Options A capped-style option is an option that will be automatically exercised prior to expiration if the exercise settlement value 7 for the option on any trading day equals or exceeds (in the case of calls) or equals or is less than (in the case of puts), the cap price for the option. 8 CAPS based on the S&P 100 index (``OEX''), S&P 500 index (``SPX'') and the Russell 2000 index are currently listed for trading on the CBOE. Quarterly Index Expiration (``QIX'') options generally have the same contract terms as regular options, except that they expire on the first business day of the month following the end of a calendar quarter. 9 QIXs based on the SPX and OEX indexes are currently listed for trading on the CBOE. 7 The exercise settlement value for OEX and SPX capped options is the value of the OEX and SPX, respectively, determined for each trading day as of the close of trading, unless another time of day is specified by the CBOE. 8 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 29865 (November 1, 1991), 56 FR 56255 (order approving SPX and OEX CAPS on the CBOE) for a more complete description of CAPS. 9 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 31800 (February 1, 1993), 58 FR 7274 for a more detailed description of QIX options. B. Q&hyph;CAPS A Q&hyph;CAP is an option possessing the same attributes as a capped-style index option contract that expires on the first business day of the month following the end of a calendar quarter. Q&hyph;CAPS will be subject to the same rules that presently govern the trading of existing CAPS, including, as more fully discussed below, position limits, exercise limits, 10 the setting of cap price intervals 11 and margin requirements. 12 10 See Amendment No. 3 and CBOE Rule 24.5, Interpretation .02. 11 See CBOE Rule 24.9, Interpretation .03. 12 See Amendment No. 3 and CBOE Rule 24.11. Under the proposal, Interpretation .03 to CBOE Rule 24.9 would be amended to provide for the listing of up to eight near-term quarterly expirations for Q&hyph;CAPS on the S&P 100 and 500 indexes. 13 New at-the-money series of Q&hyph;CAPS will be brought up every three months and/or after significant market movements. 14 Q&hyph;CAPS will feature European-style exercise and will have their exercise settlement value based upon the closing prices of applicable index component stocks on the last business day of the quarter. 13 Any proposal to list or trade Q&hyph;CAPS with more than twelve months to expiration would be filed with the Commission for its review under Section 19(b)(2) of the Act. See Amendment No. 2. 14 Id.
