FR940804-0-00061 FR940804-0-00022 Third, if EPA proposes (after month 18 but before expiration of the subsequent 6-month sanctions clock) to fully or conditionally approve a plan or proposes to find that a State is implementing its SIP, application of the offset sanction is stayed unless and until EPA's proposed positive finding is reversed. (This scenario assumes that EPA's reversal occurs before expiration of the 6-month sanction clock.) For both types of findings, the offset sanction reapplies on the date EPA's preliminary positive determination is reversed. The highway sanction applies 6 months from the date the offset sanction initially applied, if EPA has not determined that the State has corrected the deficiency prompting the finding. (This scenario is provided for in the rule at ยง52.31 (d)(2)(ii), (d)(3)(ii) and (d)(4)(ii).) The following discussion and Figure 3 provide an example of how this process functions for a SIP disapproval. The process is the same where EPA has made an initial finding of failure to implement. Suppose EPA makes a SIP disapproval, initiating the section 179 sanction process. Suppose that the State submits a revised SIP which EPA, after 18 months but before the subsequent 6-month clock expires, proposes to fully or conditionally approve. The EPA would simultaneously issue an interim final rule, finding that the State has corrected the deficiency. In that case, application of the offset sanction would be stayed unless and until EPA's proposed approval is reversed. Now suppose that, at month 22, EPA reverses its proposed approval. The reversal would be a proposal to disapprove the SIP in whole or in part or a final disapproval of the SIP in whole or in part. At month 22 (or, for final actions, on the action's effective date), the offset sanction reapplies. The highway sanction then applies at month 24, 6 months after the offset sanction originally applied, unless EPA determines that the State corrected the deficiency within that period.
