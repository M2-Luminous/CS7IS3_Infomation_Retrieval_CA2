"The European Union (EU) cannot function as a Union unless there is a willingness to cooperate on the part of the member states," European Commissioner Van Miert (Flemish-Speaking Socialist Party) stated yesterday. These sterile debates form a fundamental impediment to the employment conference of the European socialists, which started in Brussels yesterday. The conference is presided by former Swedish Finance Minister Allan Lansson, and is attended by delegations from labor unions, employers and politicians of the twelve EU member states and of the four applicant member states. [passage omitted] White Paper Karel Van Miert came up with another reason why Europe is so powerless, while there is an increasing need for action now that the army of unemployed has grown to 20 million. Yesterday, on behalf of Jacques Delors he was supposed to come and explain how the implementation of the latter's white paper was proceeding. Instead, his speech soon turned into a complaint about the reasons why we are not much further with the white paper and with many other European initiatives. "The European Commission has its hands tied," he argued. "Ninety percent of the white paper is connected with national and even regional powers. Who is responsible for its implementation?" Van Miert wondered. Van Miert believes that Europe has insufficient means to fight unemployment on a European scale. He does consider the Maastricht Treaty to be a step in the right direction, but regrets the lack of willingness on the part of the member states to actually cooperate. According to Van Miert, this paralysis also explains why so much potential still remains undeveloped within the unified market. He was mainly referring to telecommunication networks and the transportation infrastructure, but also to post offices and to the energy sector. Companies such as the national railways do have the technical means, but lack the financial capacity to cooperate within Europe. That is why Van Miert also calls for more support to companies which are taking chances for European integration. According to Van Miert, this inadequate support is due to a lack of ambition for "ideological and political reasons." He says that both employers and unions are being obstructive because they are primarily concerned about national interests.
