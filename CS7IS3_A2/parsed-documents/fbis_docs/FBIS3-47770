This trend is growing in present-day international relations, he said in an interview granted to VIETNAM NEWS AGENCY. Le Mai said each nation has the responsibility of guaranteeing human rights within its territorial boundaries. He also acknowledged that human rights were the concern of the world community as a whole. He said Vietnam agreed to talk with other countries on human rights because it wanted those countries to understand that the people of Vietnam had given so much for man's sacred fundamental rights on this land, and were making tremendous efforts in all fields -- political, economic, cultural and social -- to ensure human rights in their country. "We will talk with other countries", Le Mai said, "so that a correct understanding can be had on the fundamental principles of an international law on human rights, namely respect for national independence and national sovereignty, respect for the right of nations to self-determination, particularly the right for each to choose its own path of development, respect for national, community of individual rights, respect for political, civil, economic and social right of the citizen and respect for the right of nations for development which is now a topical problem of the world". [sentence as received] Le Mai dismissed recent press reports about dialogue on "certain aspects of human rights in Vietnam". "Vietnam and other countries have agreed that their exchanges of views will be conducted on the basis of equality, mutual respect and non-interference", he stressed. Le Mai said he believed the talks would be positive and constructive. "If our interlocutors can say concretely where and how our law does not conform strictly to international law we will [words indistinct] seriously and refer them to Vietnamese competent bodies for consideration". "At the same time we will try to make other countries share our views that man's most fundamental rights are national self- determination and development, which must be strictly respected," Le Mai added. He said he hoped the world community, through dialogue, would gradually establish mutual respect and [words indistinct] and equal, mutually beneficial cooperation on human rights. "Human rights should not be used as a tool for one country to impose on, or interfere in, another country", Le Mai concluded.
