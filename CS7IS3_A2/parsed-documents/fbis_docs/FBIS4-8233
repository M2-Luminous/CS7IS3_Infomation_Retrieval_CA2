At a distance of four kilometres from the border, in a military training centre, two of the group killed the soldier Arsen Llazar Gjini, 20 years, from the Seman village, Fier. After that, four others rushed into the bedroom of the officers and opened fire against some officers who were sleeping. As a result, the training chief officer, first captain, Fatmir Sali Shehu, 34 years old, was killed. Shehu was born in Tepelena and lived in Gjirokaster. Three soldiers were also wounded and many others had injuries. During these terrorist acts, one of them screamed: "You have this for the north Epirus. Don't think we have forgotten". The investigation group led by public order minister, Agron Musaraj, went to the spot immediately. It was concluded that the act was carried out by Greek terroristic commandos in military uniforms and with masks on their faces. They wore high shoes of Greek production. All of them were armed with shotguns. Material proofs found in the spot and the testimonies by officers there prove that this is a planned barbarous act. The fact that traces of the criminals lead to a Greek border point is a clear proof that it is a massacre, the report of the spokesman of the Public Order Ministry says.
