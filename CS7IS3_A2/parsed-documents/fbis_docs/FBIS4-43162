On a stopover in Paris, the Yemeni vice president [as published], who is a northerner though he rejects the definition in the name of the country's unity, was received by Jean Vidal, diplomatic adviser to Mr. Mitterrand, on Thursday, 8 June. He was also due to meet with Denis Bauchard, the Foreign Ministry's North Africa and Middle East desk chief. By "foreign interference," Mr. 'Abd-al Ghani meant the support granted to the leaders of the Yemeni Socialist Party (YSP), which governs in Aden, by the Gulf countries, and more specifically Saudi Arabia. He said that the oil monarchies "do not want to see the emergence in this region of a strong, densely populated (14 million inhabitants -- LE MONDE editor's note) state that possesses oil and that is moreover a democratic republic." Mr. 'Abd-al Ghani omitted to say that the conflict between the YSP and the General People's Congress (GPC) of the (northern) president, 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, over power sharing and a constitutional framework for the state has been growing worse for almost a year and that YSP cadres and assets have been the target of a number of attacks, without this overly upsetting the central government, however. And though he admitted that there were some problems, he only acknowledged that 'Ali Salim al-Bid, leader of the south before the proclamation of unity in 1990, has never agreed to become second-in-command in the unified state. Mr. 'Abd al-Ghani said that he would not have leveled charges at the oil monarchies, but for the following facts: "Articles in the Kuwaiti press stating that the emirate would be willing to spend its last cent to achieve the partitioning of Yemen, and a visit to Riyadh in February by former Vice President al-Bid, amid great publicity and with full honors." The same, he said, applies to a statement by the Kuwaiti foreign minister, citing the possibility of working for the "recognition" of the "Democratic Republic of Yemen" proclaimed by Aden and its "recent implicit recognition by the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council." Not to mention the fact that weapons "have continued to arrive at Mukalla" in the south in recent months. "So who funded these purchases?" Mr. 'Abd-al Ghani asked. For all these reasons the Sanaa government is convinced that it was on the instigation of "foreign parties" that the YSP leaders initiated hostilities, with the aim of proclaiming a secession. As for the southerners, they blame the northerners for the outbreak of war, secession being only the unavoidable result. `Weakening the Country' Mr. 'Abd-al Ghani is convinced that Saudi Arabia and the other oil monarchies are acting "not out of love for the Yemenis of the south or for Mr. al-Bid, but in order to weaken the country." While admitting that Riyadh also finances the powerful Hashid tribe, loyal to the central government, he believes that this is also in order to split the Yemenis and to keep several irons in the fire. "Our brothers in the Gulf also want to punish us for our stance" in support of Iraq during the Gulf war. "Despite everything, we want to maintain good relations with them," he said. Though fighting continues, despite successive cease-fires, Mr. 'Abd-al Ghani reaffirmed the Sanaa government's determination to "safeguard unity" by peaceful means but also, if necessary, by war. As for a possible dialogue with the "secessionists," this remains dependent, he said, on the relinquishment of separation and the exclusion of those who proclaimed it, and especially of Mr. al-Bid.
