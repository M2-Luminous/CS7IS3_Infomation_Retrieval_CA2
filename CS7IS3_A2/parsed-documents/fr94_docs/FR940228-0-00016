FR940228-0-00016 FR940228-0-00002 Comment: Two comments were received regarding the provisions in the Wheat Winter Coverage Endorsement that allow an insured to destroy damaged wheat acreage, replant the acreage to spring wheat, and consider such replanted acreage as a separate crop. One comment indicated that the endorsement may cause program abuse by encouraging an insured to gamble and seed winter wheat if he is normally a spring wheat producer. If there is not a good stand in the spring, the insured could destroy the crop, collect an indemnity, and plant spring wheat as is normally done. The second comment indicated that the provision will cause FCIC to insure two different crops of wheat on the same acreage during one crop year, which could cause a myriad of administrative problems. Response: As written, both Option A and B allow an insured to destroy damaged winter wheat, receive any applicable indemnity payment, and then replant to spring wheat. The spring wheat can then be insured separately for a separate premium. If the insured is forced to include acreage replanted to spring wheat as part of the winter unit, a significant coverage provided by the options is eliminated. FCIC does not anticipate the administrative difficulties will be unmanageable. Comment: The following question was submitted: ``Under Option A, if damaged winter wheat is replanted to spring wheat, does the harvested spring wheat production count against the winter wheat unit production guarantee?'' Response: Yes. Comment: The following question was submitted: ``Does the winter wheat guarantee continue on the replanted spring wheat crop under paragraph b of Option B.'' Response: Yes. Comment: One comment stated that Option B provides better coverage than Option A and will be more attractive to insureds. The comment found no appreciable differences between the new Option B and former Winter Coverage Option for wheat. Response: Option B is not similar to the current Winter Coverage Endorsement. Option B allows spring wheat (planted to replace damaged winter wheat) to be treated as a separate crop. The current Endorsement requires that spring wheat in this situation be a part of the winter wheat unit. This new choice provides more comprehensive coverage than the current Endorsement. Comment: One comment inquired if FCIC is aware of the recommendations from the meeting of the Montana Committee and the Billings RSO regarding clarification of the Malting Barley Option. Response: FCIC has considered and incorporated the recommendations of the Billings Regional Service Office and the Montana Committee. The recommendations were to: (1) Include a clearer definition of the entity (i.e., a brewery or business that makes or sells malt or processed mash to a brewery) contracting with the insured to produce malting barley; and (2) clearly state that the insurer's liability under the Option is limited to the lesser of the number of contracted bushels or the production guarantee. Comment: One comment inquired if malting barley basic units can be divided into optional units by section/ASCS FSN and/or irrigated/non-irrigated acreage. The comment stated that if this division is possible, paragraph 4 of the Malting Barley Option needs to be revised to refer to the Small Grains Crop Provisions, not the Basic Provisions. Response: Paragraph 4 of the Malting Barley Option refers to the ``Basic Policy,'' not the ``Basic Provisions.'' The ``Basic Policy'' includes all provisions applicable to small grains (both the Common Crop Insurance Policy, and the Small Grains Crop Provisions). Revision is not necessary. Comment: A comment recommended that the approved malting barley varieties be specified in the Special Provisions.
