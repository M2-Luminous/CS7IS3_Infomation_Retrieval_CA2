Makarov; place and date not given: "I Believe in 'The Good Hereafter' of the Belarusian Armed Forces"] [Text] Not long ago, the State Secretariat for Fighting Crime and National Security was transformed into the Council of Ministers Office for Coordinating the Activities of Administrative Bodies. The very fact of this transformation as well as tasks facing the newly formed structure have already been discussed in the Belarusian press. Our correspondent has asked Chief of the Office Valeriy Pavlov to speak on the steps planned by the government to eliminate the difficulties that worry the people in uniforms. [Pavlov] A normative act is to be adopted soon stipulating that those servicemen who served 20 or more years in the Army receive apartments while in active service. While this used to be a mere wish and a kind of declaration by both the Council of Ministers and the Defense Ministry, we now believe that this declaration should be provided with a legal footing. To achieve this goal, housing construction will be continued at the expense of the government and will involve foreign investments; credits will be granted to retired officers. The 9 billion rubles obtained from selling surplus arms will also be spent on implementation of the housing program for servicemen in 1994. Aside from this, as we all know, compensations for food rations were increased as of 15 April. In May, the office will draft a resolution on changing salaries paid for military ranks. The government has requested that we review the issues of medical care, improve the norms of servicemen's allowances of food and clothing. [Makarov] Nevertheless the planned measures will hardly bring our living standards close to those in the neighboring states. [Pavlov] It is hard to compare the economic situations in Belarus and Russia -- the comparison would definitely be to our disadvantage. However despite this, the state is doing everything in its might for the Army. I do not deny that we still have certain officials who tend to compare incomparable things. For example they suggest replacing two or three regiment exercises with personnel work in the economic sector. One should understand that every man and every state structure should be engaged in their business. If we stop holding exercises and reduce the scope of planned combat training, the Belarusian Army will change likewise. [Makarov] How do you treat those forces in the Republic that promise to pour riches from "the horn of plenty" as soon as they come to power? [Pavlov] I would ask them to answer just one question: How are they going to finance those promises? Unfortunately there is no source other than the state budget. The latter, incidentally, has its limits. [Makarov] Speaking of the eternal sore point -- that of money -- what should the Armed Forces expect from the unification of the monetary systems of Russia and Belarus? [Pavlov] The unification of monetary systems will allow us to maximally integrate our efforts in the spheres of military construction, material supplies for the Army, and improvement of our scientific research. The current artificial exchange rate of Belarusian and Russian rubles does not permit carrying out these strategic tasks. Moreover, defense enterprises are overstocked and their products are not competitive because of excessive prices. Of course, we will receive a real chance to more easily rearm and re-equip the Belarusian Army; more servicemen will acquire rare professions in Russia. A decrease in prices for power resources will provide for full implementation of the program for combat training of troops. [Makarov] However the Republic's Armed Forces are comprised of people who suffer many hardships.... [Pavlov] This is why immediately upon joining the single ruble zone, the wages of Belarusian officers will be reviewed. The wages of our officers will not be lower than those of Russian ones. We will also try to correct certain drawbacks that we have in the system of payments for the military. It is no secret how insignificant is the difference in wages paid for military ranks and jobs. Very often officers working with personnel are paid the same salaries as those who do not have to occupy themselves with test-range exercises or spend nights in the barracks. We are going to suggest that those officers who have commanded subunits ranging from company to division for a long time are paid certain bonuses. We will also review post differentials for servicemen on combat duty, servicemen who serve far from oblast cities, under difficult conditions, in remote units. Of course, we will not have differentials similar to those paid in the Far East or in polar regions simply because there are no places with similar conditions here in Belarus, but salaries of the military will be targeted for review. [Makarov] When will people feel the tangible results of all this? The transition to the ruble zone may take a long time. [Pavlov] We have already gotten down to work and have completed some 30 percent of it. In fact, two out of our four departments have been "shoveling" Belarusian and Russian legal acts dealing with officer service, comparing, and thoroughly analyzing them. Everything that depends on us, we are doing right now. [Makarov] Once the monetary systems are unified, will officers going abroad on vacation be entitled to travel allowances, as was the case in the past? [Pavlov] An agreement between the Belarusian and Russian Defense Ministries is being prepared for signing, in accordance with which Belarusian servicemen will be entitled to travel allowances on the territories of ruble zone states. We should keep in mind that more than 35 percent of our officers and warrant officers have relatives in Russia. The system of treatment in recuperation and holiday centers will also be reviewed. [Makarov] Speaking at the Baranovichi House of Culture on 3 May, Stanislaw Shushkevich said that retired officers had not created material wealth, while the share of their pensions in the total pension fund, unlike the share of civilians' pensions, is incommensurably higher than their contribution. According to Shushkevich, Russia should pay pensions to the retired officers who used to serve in the Soviet Army. How would you comment on this? [Pavlov] I believe that those statements do not deserve any comment. To know all the hardships of military service one should move with his family thousands of kilometers to new places of service every couple of years and be the only breadwinner in his family. Army life should not be discussed at meetings held at breweries. Unfortunately, a majority of our politicians regard the liquidation of the Army and revision of bonuses for the military as the primary way to increase people's welfare. [Makarov] But frankly, do you believe that our Army will be strengthened and that it has a future? Officers seek termination of service, graduates of military colleges prefer civilian life. [Pavlov] Not only do I believe in the good hereafter of the Army. I am sure that the Belarusian Armed Forces will manage to overcome the current problems. The state will spare no efforts to support its defenders and make military service a respected profession. There are all grounds for such optimism. The point is that the forming of an economic union with Russia and the signing of the CIS collective security treaty permit a cardinal revision of the issues of the development of the Belarusian Army. The implementation of these documents will put an end to the Army's self-isolation, which in fact amounted to continual degradation. The issues of developing military science, supplying the Army with modern equipment, training of personnel, and many others will be resolved on the basis of integration with Russia, proceeding from the unity of defense interests. As early as this summer, as stipulated by an appropriate agreement, Belarusian formations and air-defense units will have a chance to hold field firing and intensive training of gun squads at Russian test-ranges. I am fully confident that the fate of our Army -- just as our economy, our people, and all of Belarus -- depends on how fully we are able to restore what we have thoughtlessly ruined. A union with Russia gives us a chance to do this. It is sad that the candidates for Belarusian president do not seem to understand this.
