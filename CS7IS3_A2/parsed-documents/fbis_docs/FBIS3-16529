It is called Accord for the Sake of Russia [Soglsiye vo imiya Rossii]. Its main tasks are to avert the final disintegration of the country, to halt the destruction of production capabilities, to protect the market and the national capital, and to prevent unemployment and hunger, allowing every citizen of the country to live at a proper subsistence level and in a dignified way. Dmitriy Pinsker, our parliamentary correspondent, has asked the authors of today's appeal to the citizens of Russia to explain what the new movement is about. [Begin Pinsker recording] The future belongs to this movement -- it is a force which consolidates all patriotic parties and associations, Anatoliy Lukyanov told a correspondent from Ekho Moskvy. He stressed that he had taken part in the drafting of the appeal, but does not see any necessity as yet to sign it. Mikhail Lapshin, the leader of the Agrarian Party, thinks that the creation of the Accord for the Sake of Russia is not a step towards confrontation with the president but, on the contrary, a desire to achieve civic accord. It should be noted that Vasiliy Lipitskiy, whose name is given as one of the founders, told an Ekho Moskvy correspondent that it was the first time he heard of this movement, never mind his participation in it. [end recording] Let me add that today's appeal to the citizens of Russia has been signed by Valeriy Zorkin, Gennadiy Zyuganov, Sergey Baburin, Aleksandr Prokhanov, Aleksandr Tsypko, Nikita Mikhalkov, and a number of others.
