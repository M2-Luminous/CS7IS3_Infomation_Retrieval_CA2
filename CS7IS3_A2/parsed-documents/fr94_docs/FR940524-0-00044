FR940524-0-00044 FR940524-0-00011 The FAA agrees that the service requirements of an individual airplane do not always conform to the time initially allotted for maintenance, and that the definition needs clarification. However, the FAA disagrees with the ATA's proposed wording since it includes the words ``heavy maintenance check'' within the definition, and, as noted in the NPRM, that term has no regulatory meaning and is subject to broad interpretation among operators. The concept the FAA is attempting to convey is one in which the airplane is scheduled to be out of service for 4 or more days, not an unplanned 4-day period. This provision highlights the FAA's expectation that the retrofit be completed as soon as possible, and not deferred until some time near the extended compliance date. The term ``heavy maintenance check'' as used in the rule should be thus interpreted. •The ATA states that operators should not be required to submit evidence that they have ordered sufficient flight data recorder equipment to meet the May 26, 1995, compliance date. The ATA does not see the connection between submitting proof of orders and the FAA's admonition to operators to the take full advantage of the additional compliance time. In addition, the ATA considers such documentation to be confidential, and suggests that the FAA use ``standard surveillance practices to ensure a carrier's intent to comply with the rule.'' The FAA disagrees. The inclusion of the requirement to submit evidence of equipment ordered is based on FAA experience with similar requirements and the tendency for covered operators to delay compliance as long as possible. This very tendency is what leads to routine requests for such extensions. Submission of equipment orders shows good faith on the part of the operator to comply and avoids later delays based on equipment unavailability. Conversely, FAA surveillance cannot determine the intent of an operator to comply, much less ensure an operator's intent, as the ATA states. Likewise, a Flight Standards Information Bulletin telling FAA inspectors to ``survey the operators on the status of their DFDR installation plans'' would be equally ineffective. It is unrealistic to expect that a survey question from an FAA inspector to a part 121 operator would ensure that DFDR installation becomes a priority. Submission of the equipment orders keeps attention focused on compliance and provides proof of plans to comply that is unavailable by any other means. Accordingly, that provision will remain in the final rule. Finally, the FAA will treat all such information submitted as proprietary, as it does the planning information submitted under the Stage 3 transition rule. The ATA also responded to the request for specific cost information in the NPRM. The ATA states that it ``did not receive any specific cost data outlining the cost savings/benefits of the proposed rule'' from its members. It estimates, however, that 25 percent of the noncomplying fleet will not have to be specially scheduled if the proposed 1-year extension is made final, and that this estimate represents a savings of $9.8 million to its members. The ATA does not provide any information on how it arrived at this estimate. The Amendment The FAA extends the compliance date in §121.343(c) for all Stage 2 airplanes subject to the Stage 3 transition rule (§91.801(c)). The amendment requires that the DFDR installation be accomplished at the next heavy maintenance check, but in no case later than May 26, 1995. A heavy maintenance check is considered any time an airplane is scheduled to be out of service for 4 or more days. The extension will allow more flexibility in retrofit planning for those operators that have experienced difficulty in obtaining engineering approval for DFDR retrofit designs, or an inability to obtain parts and installation services before the May 26, 1994, compliance date. This change may also function to bring operators past the first interim compliance date of the Stage 3 transition rule, possibly eliminating the necessity for any airplanes to be DFDR retrofitted before being removed from the fleet for noise compliance purposes, depending on the individual circumstances of the operator. By its connection to the Stage 3 transition rule, this amendment does not extend the compliance date for Stage 2 airplanes under 75,000 pounds, since they are not covered by the transition rule.
