Sporadic cases of currency dealers' cuts are of a passing character and the exchange rate of dinar remains stable, Prime Minister Radoje Kontic assesses. Vladimir Nikolic reports: [Begin recording] [Nikolic] From 24 January to 11 June, prices have increased by a mere 0.8 percent altogether. However, the structure of increases is not satisfactory because we have noted a (?great) increase in the prices of agricultural produce and the prices of services, Kontic said. For this reason, the Federal Government has pointed to further possibilities to cut prices, especially some of them. The main attention focused on the accomplished level of incomes and its influence on the realization of the program, the strengthening of the overall economic activity and production, and elimination of the budget deficit in the second half-year. In connection with this, at yesterday's session, the Federal Government passed a decree that regulates the salaries of deputy prime ministers, federal ministers, and officials, changes to the law on earnings, compensations, and other incomes of the employees in the federal ministries, federal offices, federal organizations, and federal government services, and changes to the decree on expenses that are being recognized as material expenses for the federal administration offices. According to Kontic, salaries have increased greatly, especially in May. He assessed this as a negative trend, primarily because of its intensity, which does not match the increase in production and the trends in the economy. An accompanying factor is a disproportion between the incomes in industry and non-industry. However, the federal prime minister believes that the total income mass in May means that we have accomplished equilibrium with the available national product. He said that further increases in salaries could endanger the strategic goals of the program of the economic stabilization: [Kontic] Departing from these conclusions, the Federal Government, with the decrees that I have just read, passed a decision to reduce all calculation factors at the federal level, better to say, in the federal administration, by 30 percent and to additionally reduce the highest salaries in the Federal Government by an additional 10 to 15 percent. To avoid any misunderstandings in your reports and interpretations of my words, I must draw your attention to the fact that the Federal Government has, even so far, been paying out approximately 30 percent lower salaries in comparison to the established calculation factors. Therefore, nobody should conclude that the earnings in the federal administration will be reduced by this amount. [Nikolic] The Federal Government is preparing a law that will, in a unique way, regulate all the issues regarding the entire state administration. Regarding general economic activity and the increase in production, they concluded that positive trends are taking place. Statistically speaking, the industrial production in May was lower than the month before, however, according to the federal prime minister, positive trends have continued in industry. The energy supply, which has noted an expected drop, has a considerable share in all this. This primarily refers to electrical energy, whose production is matched with the requirements. Excluding the energy industry, the remainder of industry is nevertheless [words indistinct] than in April, Kontic said. We expect further cuts in the share with which the public expenditure participates in the national product, which has already been brought below 41 percent. Kontic assessed that the budget deficit will also be eliminated by increasing incomes from real sources. [Kontic] Departing from this, we have drawn up and already agreed a consolidated balance of public expenditure at the level of the country, which involves a certain amount of deficit financing of the budget in July only, however even then exclusively on the basis of foreign currency coverage. The uncovered balance of the federal budget has been reduced to 100 million dinars altogether, while the republics have practically managed to eliminate their budget deficits. [Nikolic] Prime Minister Kontic informed the reporters that at yesterday's session the Federal Government passed a proposal on the law banning the construction of nuclear power plants on FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] territory. With this, the existing legal provision has been harmonized with the FRY Constitution. The law envisages a ban on the construction of nuclear power plants and a ban on the construction of installations for manufacture of nuclear fuel and processing of exhausted nuclear fuel on FRY territory.
