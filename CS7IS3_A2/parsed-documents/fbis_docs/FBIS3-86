Majdi Hifni, Egypt's ambassador to Ethiopia, chaired the meeting because Egypt is the current OAU chairman. Ambassador Hifni said that the ambassadors discussed aspects of the mechanism's work in light of the resolutions passed at the summit meeting of the central apparatus, chaired by President Mubarak in Cairo last December. Ambassador Hifni told a MENA correspondent in Addis Ababa that discussions during the meeting also dealt with the mechanism's functions and the creation of an OAU peace fund. The Egyptian ambassador said that the conferees agreed that a plan should be drawn up to finance the mechanism. Such a plan, they agreed, will be formulated by a working team from the OAU General Secretariat and African countries, with the aim of raising donations from companies, African institutes, and non-government organizations. The budget plans, Hifni added, will be submitted to the ministerial meeting of the mechanism, which will meet in Addis Ababa in March under the chairmanship of Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa. The ambassadors also discussed the formulation of a general legal framework governing the participation of OAU member countries in peacekeeping operations in the continent. The ambassadors discussed a report by the OAU secretary general's special envoy to Burundi and reviewed the conflicts in Somalia, Liberia, and Angola, Hifni noted.
