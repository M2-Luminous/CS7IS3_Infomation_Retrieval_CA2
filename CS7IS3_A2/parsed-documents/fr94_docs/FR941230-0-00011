ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: We are amending the regulations in title 7, chapter III, and title 9, chapter I, to change the address of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service's central offices. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service's central offices in the Federal Building at 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD, are relocating to 4700 River Road, Riverdale, MD, in January 1995. This final rule is necessary to announce the relocation and inform the public of the new address. EFFECTIVE DATE: December 31, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mrs. Deirdre Holder, Regulatory Analyst, RAD, PPD, APHIS, USDA, P.O. Drawer 810, Riverdale, MD 20738. The telephone number for the agency contact will change when agency offices in Hyattsville, MD move to Riverdale, MD during January. Telephone: (301) 436&hyph;4339 (Hyattsville); (301) 734&hyph;4345 (Riverdale). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The regulations in 7 CFR, chapter III, and 9 CFR, chapter I, govern animal and plant health. Prior to the effective date of this document, these regulations indicated that certain forms and other information were available from and could be sent to central offices of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) in Hyattsville, MD. We are revising 7 CFR, chapter III, and 9 CFR, chapter I, to reflect the relocation of the APHIS central offices from Hyattsville, MD, to Riverdale, MD. We are removing all references to the Hyattsville, MD, address and replacing them with references to the Riverdale, MD, address. In addition we are making nonsubstantive wording changes for consistency. This rule relates to internal agency management. Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, notice of proposed rulemaking and opportunity to comment are not required, and this rule may be made effective less than 30 days after publication in the Federal Register . Further, since this rule relates to internal agency management, it is exempt from the provisions of Executive Order 12886. Finally, this action is not a rule as defined by Public Law 96&hyph;354, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, and thus is exempt from the provisions of that Act. Miscellaneous In addition to the changes set forth above, we are making several nonsubstantive editorial changes to correct typographical errors and minor editorial inconsistencies. In addition, we are amending ยง97.2, Commuted Traveltime Allowances table, to reflect service for Dulles International Airport in Virginia from the regional office in Annapolis, MD, rather than from Hyattsville, MD. The service time will not change; therefore, this is a nonsubstantive change. Paperwork Reduction Act This rule contains no information collection or recordkeeping requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq .). Accordingly, we are amending 7 CFR parts 301, 318, 319, 322, 340, 352, 354, 355, 360, 370, and 371 and 9 CFR parts 2, 11, 50, 51, 54, 71, 72, 75, 77, 78, 79, 82, 85, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 97, 98, 102, 113, 114, 124, 130, 145, 147, 151, 166 as follows: Title 7_Agriculture PART 301_DOMESTIC QUARANTINE NOTICES 1. The authority citation for part 301 continues to read as follows: Authority: 7 U.S.C. 150bb, 150dd, 150ee, 150ff, 161, 162, and 164&hyph;167; 7 CFR 2.17, 2.51, and 371.2(c).
