How do the Palestinians view the visit and where do they stand on the results that have appeared? [Al-Khatib] First, not all the results of the visit have appeared. It is clear that some issues were discussed but not publicized. The two sides announced that they agreed on several issues, which have not been publicized fully. So it is hard to make a final judgment on the outcome of the visit. The results announced so far fall short of meeting the minimum demands or needs that the Palestinian leadership put forward as urgent prerequisites for resuming negotiations and guaranteeing their success should they be resumed soon. [passage omitted] The U.S. Government has unfortunately failed to cooperate in convincing Israel to respond to these demands. Hence, the Israelis are not serious and the U.S. stance backs them. [Al-Miliji] You said that the Palestinian leadership conveyed these demands. Were they conveyed during the visit to Tunisia by Dennis Ross, the U.S. coordinator of the Arab-Israeli peace negotiations? [Al-Khatib] These demands were conveyed earlier, through the Palestinian delegation that visited Washington. [Al-Miliji] The delegation that Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat led? [Al-Khatib] Yes. The day after the massacre a meeting was held between Dr. 'Urayqat and representatives of the U.S. State Department. The demands were conveyed during that meeting. They were also conveyed to Dennis Ross, during his visit to Tunisia, and were directly conveyed to Rabin more than once. [Al-Miliji] Has the Palestinian leadership received no response? [Al-Khatib] It received a reply from Rabin saying that the demands concerning settlement cannot be met because this would violate the Oslo agreement. He added that the Israeli Government would take a set of measures to curb the settlers' terrorist activity. These measures were announced later following a meeting of the Israeli inner cabinet. [Al-Miliji] What about the U.S. response? [Al-Khatib] There is no direct or material U.S. response. The U.S. Administration has shown no understanding of these demands. But there was no direct rejection. [Al-Miliji] Some believe the PLO can resume the peace negotiations and submit these demands for discussion at the negotiating table. What do you think? [Al-Khatib] I do not believe this approach will work. To return to negotiations without defining the basics that take note of the recent tragic experience will again involve us in negotiations that waste time uselessly. To make the resumption of talks feasible, the bases of the negotiations must be amended so that the issues pertaining to settlements can be addressed. [Al-Miliji] We now turn to another topic, that is, honorable Jerusalem and the U.S. President's remarks that viewed it as the united capital of Israel. This is the first time a U.S. President has made such a statement. Do the Palestinians have an official stance on that statement? [Al-Khatib] Certainly. First, it constitutes a backing down on the previous U.S. stance. In the context of preparations for talks, as well as during the talks, the U.S. stance provided for postponing discussion of the issue of Jerusalem until the final stage. Second, this stance violates and is inconsistent with the UN Security Council resolutions and international legitimacy. We have recently noticed that the United States has tended to take Israel's side. We believe that this complicates rather than facilitates negotiations. We believe there should be critical reaction, not only by the Palestinians, but also by the Arab and Muslim parties, since Jerusalem concerns all Arab and Muslim brothers. [Al-Miliji] We thank Ghassan al-Khatib. [Al-Khatib] Thank you.
