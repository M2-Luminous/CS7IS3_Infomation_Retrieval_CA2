Speaking to CTK at the close of his one-day talks in Vienna, Dlouhy said that only the problem concerning imports of industrial fertilizers from the Czech Republic remains to be solved. In his talks with Austrian Minister of Environment Maria Rauch-Kallat concerning the Czech nuclear power plants at Temelin, south Bohemia, and Dukovany, south Moravia, Dlouhy said that Temelin would be completed. He refuted the opinion voiced at times in Austria that Temelin was a Russian project. He pointed out that Temelin would have safety standards corresponding to those of Germany, Switzerland, France, and other advanced countries. During his talks with Economic Affairs Minister Wolfgang Schussel, Dlouhy expressed interest in talks on Austria's integration into the European Union (EU). Dlouhy said these talks might be instructive for the Czech Republic as all Austrian representatives were convinced of the positive effect of the integration on Austria's economy.
