Marco Gandasegui, director of the CELA survey, reported that the fifth CELA poll was conducted in early April among 2,600 people, excluding the Provinces of Darien, Bocas del Toro, and the San Blas Intendancy. According to Gandasegui, in light of the call to unite civic forces against the PRD, a virtual union between Carles, Mireya Moscoso de Gruber, and Eduardo Vallarino could garner a high enough percentage of votes to challenge the candidacy of Perez Balladares. The poll revealed that Perez Balladares continues to lead voters' preferences with 29.7 percent. However, he descended in popularity in comparison with the previous CELA poll, in which he obtained 33.2 percent support. Meanwhile, Blades, who in the previous poll got 13.4 percent, which placed him third in voter preference, won 16.5 percent of popular support in this poll, boosting him into second place. Although he registered a 0.4-percent increase in popular support over the previous poll, Ruben Dario Carles of MOLIRENA [Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement] has fallen back to third place on the chart with 14.8 percent support. Meanwhile, Mireya Moscoso de Gruber of the Arnulfist Party came in fourth in voter preference with 14.3 percent, reflecting a 6.3-percent hike over the previous poll in which she won 8.5 percent support. The CELA poll revealed the following order for other candidates: Eduardo Vallarino of the Christian Democratic Party (PDC) with 2.6 percent, Samuel Lewis Galindo of Solidarity with 1.3 percent, and Jose Salvador Munoz of the Doctrinaire Panamenist Party with 0.3 percent. Gandasegui said that this was the last CELA poll before the 8 May elections. He announced that the organization plans to conduct another survey once the elections are over. He added that this poll was conducted before President Endara aired the videos showing compromising footage against the PRD, as well as before the latest ILDEA-sponsored [Latin American Institute of Advanced Studies] presidential debate. Gandasegui noted that it is possible that these events have changed the level of preference for specific candidates.
