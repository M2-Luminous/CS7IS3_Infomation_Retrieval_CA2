FR941025-1-00019 FR941025-1-00005 Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop in other Pilatus Britten- Norman BN2A, BN2B, and BN2T Islander and BN2A Mk III Trislander series airplanes of the same type design that are equipped with a nose wheel steering disconnect system with either a Modification NB/M/503 or Modification NB/M/733 nose undercarriage unit, the proposed AD would require repetitively inspecting the nose wheel steering drive ring for cracks, and replacing any cracked drive ring. The proposed inspection would be accomplished in accordance with Pilatus Britten-Norman Service Bulletin No. BN&hyph;2/SB.214, Issue 1, dated September 23, 1993. The drive ring replacement, if necessary, would be accomplished in accordance with the applicable maintenance manual. The FAA estimates that 15 airplanes in the U.S. registry would be affected by the proposed AD, that it would take approximately 1 workhour per airplane to accomplish the proposed action, and that the average labor rate is approximately $55 an hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $825. This figure does not take into account the cost of repetitive inspections nor the cost of replacing any cracked drive ring. The FAA has no way of determining how many repetitive inspections each operator would incur over the lifetime of the airplane or how many drive rings may be cracked. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action has been placed in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES . List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. The Proposed Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1.
