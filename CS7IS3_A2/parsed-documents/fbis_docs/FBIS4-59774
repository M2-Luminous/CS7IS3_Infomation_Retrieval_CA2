It means that if al-Asad agrees to full peace, Israel will be committed to full withdrawal with all this entails. On the face of it this is fine, but in fact it poses obstacles on Israel's negotiating path. Al-Asad claims he has already made his move when he publicly and privately declared in President Clinton's presence in Geneva that Syria has made a strategic decision to seek peace. Even though he did not enter the details, the Syrians claim he meant full peace. He is willing to discuss the stages leading to peace, but the basic decision has already been publicly stated. Al-Asad claims it is now Rabin's turn to reciprocate according to the stipulations of the Israeli formula. If full peace is intended, Rabin must complete the formula by stating: Full withdrawal. According to al-Asad it will be possible to discuss the security arrangements which the two sides require at a later stage. The Syrians claim, however, that Rabin has retracted and is unwilling to implement his formula. I believe Israel's attitude should have been different. Israel should have presented a different formula: The depth of withdrawal will equal the depth of the security arrangements! According to this formula, for example, if al-Asad demands to limit the size of the demilitarized zone, then the depth of Israeli withdrawal will also be limited. If al-Asad is opposed, for example, to Israeli-manned warning stations on the Golan Heights, then the progress and stages of Israeli withdrawal will be prolonged by years. If al-Asad unequivocally rejects border modifications, Israel will demand to maintain the warning stations for a longer duration. The internal link between the depth of withdrawal and security arrangements will enable Israel to conduct the negotiations from a more convenient position. According to this formula peace is self-evident and above argument. The only argument will revolve around the security arrangements, a position which will be very easy to explain to the Israelis and the U.S. mediator. For many Israelis peace primarily means security for them and for Israel. We are being informed by spokesmen and the media that Israel and Syria have already made significant progress during Christopher's recent visit. This progress in the negotiations with Syria should have been made during September, prior to the Oslo agreement. At that time it was concluded that the negotiations will be held at the highest level, between Rabin and al-Asad with Christopher as mediator. Now we have reached that stage again, and even though we are not talking here about direct negotiations between the two leaders, a higher level of contacts has been attained. However, this is not enough for completing the complicated negotiations on many sensitive issues between two countries which have been at war for dozens of years. The gap between the sides is still profound and we must not harbor any illusions that the negotiations will be easy. It is more likely that we will witness serious crises before a breakthrough is made. Al-Asad and Rabin are known to be tough negotiators. Both of them want this reputation of toughness to be justified and vindicated. They have experience in negotiating with one another from 1974. During Christopher's last visit, the two sides entered the stage of preliminary clarifications, each seeking the other side's clarifications on the issues of normalization and the withdrawal stages. This stage was preceded by various declarations, with Rabin being the one who made the more significant move in his statement regarding Golan Heights settlements. Al-Asad is still concentrating on the method of negotiations, namely on how to take the best advantage of the U.S. mediator. This is not a simple issue for al-Asad, and not only because Washington is suspicious of Syria (due to its support of terrorism and drug dealing) and is behaving unfairly toward it, as the Syrian president maintains. Al-Asad's associates say that the Syrian president believes that Washington is in Israel's pocket. Even if we are dealing here with an extremely supportive U.S. Administration, however, this does not mean that Israel is dictating things to Washington. Al-Asad, however, does not want to forfeit the possibility of a more intensive involvement of the U.S. mediator (he also has no choice). He correctly surmises that Washington is unlikely to exert heavy pressure on Israel to make more concessions and to disregard its vital interests. Al-Asad will henceforth focus on demanding intensive negotiations in which Christopher will serve as a traveling mediator. Al-Asad has still not reached the stage in which he will ask the United States for any recompense. Even though he would have preferred mediators of the like of Kissinger and James Baker, he has to adjust to the present mediator, who strikes him as being too soft. Al-Asad expects to reach the stage in which President Clinton himself will intervene. His mere presence will exert pressure on Israel, which will not want to prevent the friendly President from scoring an achievement. As long as we have not reached this stage, al-Asad will not agree to hold a meeting with Rabin. Such a meeting will take place if Rabin suddenly decides to make a grand concession, or when the two meet with President Clinton at a very advanced stage of the negotiations.
