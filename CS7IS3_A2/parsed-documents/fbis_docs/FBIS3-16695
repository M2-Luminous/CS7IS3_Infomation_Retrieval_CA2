From 1 February compensation to pensioners is to be increased from 11,700 rubles to 20,000 rubles and from 1 May to 29,600 rubles. This was reported today at a session of the Russian Federation Government Presidium by Vasiliy Barchuk, chairman of the board of Russia's pension fund, during an examination of the draft budget of the fund for the first six months of 1994. He explained that the fund's draft budget presupposes that its income amounts to almost 17 trillion rubles, and its expenditure to approximately 16 trillion rubles. Of the budget's income, 16.1 trillion rubles derive from insurance contributions from employers and citizens, and 784 billion rubles come from the republican budget. In his speech Vasiliy Barchuk drew attention to the "need to ensure the timely payment of state pensions, otherwise we will have serious social conflicts." In this connection Viktor Chernomyrdin stated that "the government cannot allow pension payments to be overdue; we have to act in a precise manner here." The chairman of the government has warned leaders of the regions which delay payments to the pension fund that this practice is inadmissible. At the suggestion of Viktor Chernomyrdin, the draft budget of the Russian Federation pension fund for the first six months of 1994 was approved as a whole by the presidium of the government.
