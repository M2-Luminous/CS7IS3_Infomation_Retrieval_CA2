[passage omitted] The president's decision forming the so-called committee to prepare for the national dialogue came as a major shock that immensely frustrated Egyptian political circles. The formation of the committee was totally contradictory to the agreement among the political parties. The formation of the committee was supposed to come as a result of consultations among the political parties, not a decision by the National Democratic Party [NDP]. The overwhelming majority of the committee members are affiliated with the NDP, which is to blame for all the policies that caused the current crisis in the country. This was an ominous indication that its purpose is not to launch a serious political dialogue in which the energies of the nation are mobilized, creating a new hope, but to establish an elegant democratic facade to deceive our people at home and the world abroad--a facade behind which the current policies are justified. It was not possible for our party to accept this fait accompli, especially considering that the committee includes some people who left their original posts a long time ago and devoted themselves to abusing and cursing the greatest and noblest symbols of our nation at the political and intellectual levels, and others who have dedicated their lives to defending Israel and Zionism.
