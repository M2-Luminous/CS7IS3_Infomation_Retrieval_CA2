So far it has been announced officially that a significant, 70-percent share in the development will be given to a Western consortium headed by British Petroleum. According to IZVESTIYA's exclusive information, however, the new government of Azerbaijan has confirmed its intention to grant the Russian oil company Lukoil a 12-percent share in the development. Lukoil has also secured approximately 10 percent from that part which now belongs to Azerbaijan. An agreement to develop the Caspian shelf was earlier concluded with Western firms by the Elchibey government, and at that time no provision was made at all for Russia's participation. In the opinion of observers, the revision of the preliminary accords in Russia's favor attests to an attempt by Geydar Aliyev to enlist the support of his northern neighbor in resolving Azerbaijan's internal problems, including the Karabakh crisis. It cannot be ruled out that Azerbaijan will go still further in its concessions to Russia and will opt for transporting the oil not across Turkey as originally proposed, but through Novorossiysk and the "Friendship" pipeline. The unstable situation in Iranian Kurdistan, across whose territory the oil pipeline proposed by the Western side was to have passed, militates in favor of this decision. According to preliminary information, another promising deposit at Gyunashlty might be taken away from the Western consortium altogether in favor of Lukoil. The final details of the agreement, which at present is being kept top secret, will be agreed during the 15 March visit to Baku by Lukoil President Vagit Alekperov. Meanwhile a scandal is developing around a court action brought against Lukoil by the small Liechtenstein company of Frankenburg. The Lukoil leadership believes that the huge $550-million suit for breach of contract with regard to restoring wells in West Siberia has been provoked by Western competitors so as to compromise the Russian oil company at the moment of its entering the world market. In addition to Azerbaijan, Lukoil has penetrated the markets of Tunisia, Egypt, Nigeria, and Trinidad and Tobago. According to recent information received from Lukoil Vice President Leonid Fedun, Frankenburg has spent approximately $300,000-400,000 on a newspaper campaign over its suit. Strange though it may seem, the Estonian press stands out for being particularly active. As L. Fedun said, Frankenburg will endeavor to "fleece" Lukoil of approximately $10 million, but nothing will come of this venture. To date the Southern District Court of the State of Texas, United States, with which the statement of claim has been lodged, has not accepted it for examination. The development of the court investigation has been hampered for legal reasons, above all. At the time of the conflict in 1992 Lukoil was a state company (the first check auction is only now being scheduled), and under U.S. legislation suits directed by private companies against the state property of other states may not be accepted for examination in the usual manner. Lukoil President Vagit Alekperov calls his former partner's claims ridiculous and expresses doubt that a court at any level will accept the scandalous case for examination. In the macroeconomic sense the Russian oilmen's emergence onto the world market expresses a change in the strategy of the sector's development. The sales crisis in Russia and the huge nonpayments, which in 1993 exceeded 450 billion rubles for Lukoil alone, essentially leave the company with no other way out. So it cannot be ruled out that Lukoil will channel the considerable credits from Mitsui ($700 million) and the World Bank ($268 million) partly into developing its own business abroad. But the company's strategic goal of stabilizing Russian oil extraction by 1995 is not yet subject to revision.
