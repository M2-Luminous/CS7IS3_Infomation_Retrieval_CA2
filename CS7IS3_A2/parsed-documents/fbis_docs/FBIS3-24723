The deal on a possible volkstaat [homeland] was scuppered after it was watered down by the ANC's national executive committee (NEC). Yet more "final" talks are due on Monday. AVF sources said they had shown the draft agreement to their most militant elements, including Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] leader Eugene Terreblanche, Cape Conservative Party [CP] leader Jan Hoon and the [Orange] Free State CP executive, who all gave it their blessing. CP leader Dr Ferdi Hartzenberg also accepted it. AVF moderates warned grimly late this week that the initiative was slipping from their hands as hardline elements threatened to make the running. One negotiator warned nervously: "There will be no elections if we don't take part." It is understood that the AVF, the ANC and Government negotiators had earlier agreed on a draft amendment to the constitution reading: "Provision shall be made in the constitution for the recognition of the right of self-determination of the peoples of South Africa. It shall be understood that the right to self-determination relates to the right of any of such peoples to determine their own destiny. Such right may be exercised in such a manner which does or does not entail a territorial entity." However, the ANC's NEC watered down this agreement, and replaced it with: "Nothing in these constitutional principles shall be construed as precluding recognition by the Constitutional Assembly of the AVF's idea of self-determination." The AVF regards this amendment as "ANC tomfoolery" couched in sneering tones. The ANC's latest proposals also tended to increase central government power instead of greater provincial powers as demanded by the Freedom Alliance [FA]. The ANC still rejects two ballots for national and provincial elections as the FA demands. The IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party], an FA member, is due to decide at a conference this weekend on whether it will take part in the election. But IFP organiser Senzo Mfayela said the conference might take a decision which was conditional on the outcome of Monday's negotiations.
