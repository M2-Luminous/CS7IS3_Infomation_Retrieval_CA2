Two important issues were discussed at the recent meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] foreign ministers. One was how Israel would be permitted entry into the region, and the other was what policy these countries would adopt toward Iraq. It is interesting to note that the two issues are ultimately interrelated! 2. The United States is closely following the issue of Israel's entry into the region and Israel is also awaiting the decision impatiently. During the course of the current talks, Israel will only take steps to help it make major gains toward an extensive presence in the Arab (and Islamic) world, especially in the Persian Gulf region! 3. Why should Israel enter the Persian Gulf region? It is obvious that the various parties involved would supply different answers to this question. For Israel, it is an opening to the Arab and Islamic world, in addition to the immense oil resources. The people in these regional countries have not evolved any cohesive national identity; they are merely naturalized in those countries, which were born from the unclean womb of British colonialism. Even today, their affairs are directed by other hands. This is why entry into this region is easier than into Egypt, Syria, Algeria, or similar countries. It was a great achievement for the United States to keep the current regime in Iraq in the present disgraceful circumstances. Every time the U.S. wishes to intimidate the regional rulers and to shovel in their wealth, it just smiles in the direction of the Iraqi regime and this immediately instills fear in the regional rulers and gives them nightmares. The statement issued at the latest GCC foreign ministers' session in Riyadh clearly shows their psychological state. In other words, what has transpired in Iraq has not only destroyed the longstanding prestige and sovereignty of that country, but has also dragged the entire Arab region of the Persian Gulf into the jaws of the United States. 4. This fragile status quo is fraught with danger, and it can very easily get out of control, as in Somalia. Therefore, the Zionists are to be brought in in order to help stabilize conditions in the region. In other words, the Zionist element will have to do the following: First: Prevent all ties between the regional Arab countries and Iran. Second: Keep a watchful eye on conditions in Iraq and escalate dangerous crises! Third: Plan and direct changes in the regional governments, particularly in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates. In my view, this is the minimum that the United States expects from Israel. It is obvious that extensive benefits from generous "pockets" and unlimited resources of the region will accrue to the United States. 5. What is the outlook for the future? The Islamic world will never accept the Zionist entity. Even if this element is forcibly thrust down its throat today, it will be spat out even more forcefully tomorrow or in the near future! This trend can be easily perceived in the nexus of the deep and extensive social and political events currently taking place in the Islamic world. If our friends in the Persian Gulf littoral countries are prudent and rely on expediency instead of being willful, they will realize that paving the way for Israel's ingress into the region would be tantamount to striking at their own roots! They will not only be consigning the region's resources to destruction but their own existence as well! Why have you let Zionism dominate the House of God and now strive to pave the way further? Regardless of religious considerations, have you even thought about preserving your own power?
