In particular they threatened air strikes to break the strangulation of Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and other parts of that state where the population is at risk. Their priorities are to open the large, modern airport at Tuzla for the distribution of humanitarian aid and to enable Danish troops to relieve a Canadian contingent blocked in Srebrenica. The embarrassing question of Bosnia was forced on to the Brussels agenda by the French, who have the largest national contingent in former Yugoslavia. It remains to be seen whether yesterday's declaration will amount to anything more than a similar commitment made by Nato, but never implemented, more than five months ago. At present, the UN is devoting greater resources to supplying its own forces in Bosnia than to the purpose for which they are there: the delivery of emergency aid to civilians caught in the vicious struggle between Serbs, Croats and Muslims. The lack of political will is such that a lone gunman can halt an entire convoy with its armoured escort. Such impotence is humiliating, both for the governments which have contributed to the UN force and for the soldiers themselves. It has led General Jean Cot, the French overall commander, to call for reinforcements, and last week provoked the resignation of General Francis Briquemont, the Belgian commander in Bosnia. The current situation is obviously intolerable. There is a case for the UN to abandon its operations in Yugoslavia. But, if relief is to continue, then UN troops must be empowered to use whatever degree of force proves necessary to move supplies. The NATO declaration merely threatens air strikes. It omits to mention that a tougher policy would also require reinforcements on the ground. If the UN is to use Tuzla Airport, open the road from Mostar to Sarajevo and assure access to the Muslim enclaves in eastern Bosnia, it must be prepared not merely to make an armed demonstration, but also to protect areas which have been secured. The worst course would be for NATO, acting for the Security Council, to make a one-off gesture without any intention of following up. The alliance must pursue a coherent plan for relieving those areas most at risk from the fighting. Fortunately, in General Cot and General Michael Rose, Briquemont's successor, it has two able officers who have worked together before. Several NATO governments, including the British, have talked of the possibility of withdrawing their forces in the spring if a settlement has not been reached. That option should remain open. But the immediate task is to turn a flagging aid operation into an effective channel for relief through the rest of the Bosnian winter.
