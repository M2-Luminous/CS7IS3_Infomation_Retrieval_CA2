A quadripartite agreement on the return of refugees and displaced people and a declaration on the measures to settle the Abkhaz- Georgian conflict peacefully reached in Moscow have become the subject of parliamentary discussions. You have already voiced your stance on these documents but I still want to ask you: Do you think the internationalization of the conflict has produced any positive effect? And what effect could have been expected had the documents been denounced in the parliament? [Shevardnadze] Only now can we speak about a real internationalization of the settlement and general handling of the conflict. Before this, everything was at the level of resolutions, as it were. However, resolutions passed by the UN Security Council, statements made in various states and the like comprise a very significant stage leading to the present situation. Favorable conditions have come about for international forces to be involved in settlement of the conflict. Russia's political role, mentioned repeatedly by the Russian leadership and the president, has become more clearcut. Our friends have embarked on more active work -- I mean the United States, France, England, the FRG, and the CSCE, which is also involved in the issue. Negotiations will begin in Geneva tomorrow on the deployment of international forces in Abkhazia. The first round of talks about the return of refugees ended in Sochi yesterday. A special commission has been established in connection with these issues. A meeting will be held on the 19th. A very important meeting will also be held in Geneva on the 19th which will be mainly dedicated to a discussion of various aspects of Abkhazia's political status. Thus, a long-expected process has started. And it started relatively smoothly. I would like to single out two issues again and again for everyone's attention and especially for the attention of our brothers, our friends, sisters and mothers -- I mean the Abkhazian refugees. The principal aim and task we have assigned ourselves during the process of negotiations is the return of refugees to their homes. The return must be secure and honorable, which will only be when they are met there by joint international forces who will have been given adequate rights by the United Nations. I cannot avoid repeating that it is regrettable that some politicians demonstrate not simply critical or even negative attitudes, which are acceptable, but an unexplained aggressiveness toward the changes for the better and I would say even resentment and fury toward a tendency which has more or less shaped as a reassuring one of late. They seem to be putting up obstacles against their own country and their own people. This cannot provoke a resentful reaction in me. I just want to read out, to understand the reasons for such conduct. I believe that a power struggle is behind all this. This is also understandable. But in times of present difficulties hardly ever experienced by a rich country, we all should think of consent and unity and seek ways of overcoming this most difficult test for the state and ways of easing the movement toward peace and stability, unity and the restoration of territorial integrity. I believe that these outbursts in the parliament and elsewhere are temporary. Everything depends on how the events will develop at negotiations and various meetings and, eventually, what decision will be taken by the Security Council. If all this develops in a positive way, and decisions are taken in conformity with our government's requirements, it will die away of its own accord and we all will forget it. [Oniani] Batono Eduard, you have requested the parliament to discuss two issues referring to the demands by the opposition. One was an issue of the denunciation of the above documents and the other was an issue of vote of confidence in the authorities. The opposition has withdrawn the demand. Will you raise the question of confidence again, say at tomorrow's sitting or later? And how justified do you consider raising this issue taking into consideration the current complicated critical situation? [Shevardnadze] The issue of denunciation was raised but, I would say, they lacked the courage to defend their position because they were not confident in their correctness and the logic of their activities. This position appeared to be mostly a pose, I could say a lie or they were probably securing their position. In case what has been decided and planned does not come true, they will say: Look, we have been warning you about all that. That is why I really wanted this issue to be raised and voting on the issue to be put on the agenda. And the history would retain the names of who was for and who was against. This has not happened and I do not worry about it any more. At least, the parliament did not share an opinion about the denunciation of the agreement and practically consented to what we had agreed on in Moscow. As for the vote of confidence, I have stated that after the Cabinet of Ministers is established we will have to return and consider this issue. Regrettably, the Cabinet of Ministers has not been confirmed yet. I have already expressed my stance about the parliament's failure to endorse the minister of education. I have expressed my opinion about Mr Tamaz Kvachantiradze and a certain sorrow. The session will probably be resumed tomorrow and I do hope that the issue of establishing the government will be settled in a few days. As regards to the next stage, of expressing confidence in the authorities and the head of state, definite regulations exist in motions for a no-confidence vote. The opposition can take a motion by getting over 50 votes. Fifty-one votes are required to get the issue on the agenda. If the opposition fails to get those or does not dare do this, I will find another way to have the parliament and the people discuss the issue. The discussion will lead to a decision. Because an end should be put to a situation when the authorities or the name of the head of state or a figure of any other rank are constantly sullied; there should be an end to talks about something anti-national, anti-state, unjustified, criminal, and various other things which are commonplace in parliament. This must be finished one way or another. If the state is governed by criminal elements or by inept or rather incapable people, and I know who is usually meant and this does not require deciphering, we cannot simplify it or shut our eyes to it or plug our ears or swallow it just like that. That would demonstrate recklessness and incompetence. Neither the head of state, not the parliament nor the people can adapt to this. If it is close to the truth, a healing mechanism must be found. Either remaining or quitting. But whichever it is should be deserved. [Oniani] Batono Eduard, I would like to return to the Abkhazian issue. Some politicians say that you went to the United States to request the deployment of NATO troops in Georgia. How do you view the assumption that a head of state goes to the United States with a proposition like that? How true is this? [Shevardnadze] I would like to say one thing as regards to the deployment of U.S. troops or NATO troops and so on. Political debates are essential. Nothing can be done without them if we want the truth to be achieved. However, generally, we have to exclude illegal holds, as sportsmen say, or rather lies and arbitrary handling of lies and rumors in politics. A lot of lies are said and then the person who is to answer has no time and opportunity first to study all these lies and then to expose them. For instance, here is a lie that Shevardnadze requested the United States to deploy their armed forces and his request was refused. In fact, this would be a failure. If you asked something and it was the sole purpose of your visit and it was turned down, that would be a failure. This was said just like that, as if in the course of a conversation. I telephoned the television center and asked them to broadcast a reminder that I had not made a request like that while in the United States. I requested support for taking a decision on the deployment of peace-keeping forces and financing this action, because this is one of the most difficult and serious problems. [words indistinct] A Western newspaper allegedly said that Shevardnadze' request was turned down. If it is true, if you really read something like this, please do us a favor and name the source, the newspaper, the article, and the author who offered a version like this. This is an elementary rule. It is an elementary rule to cite a person, an author, a work which you are quoting. This just said that Shevardnadze was turned down and nothing happened. Luckily, I had the television on and I heard this. Otherwise, there would have been no reaction and the idea would have gained a hold that the head of state went on a visit without having studied the issue well in advance and his request was turned down. I am talking of only one example. This is a false idea wrapped in rags, which has nothing to do with the truth. Then they demand that you prove something that cannot be proved. However, they speak so convincingly that inexperienced people find it difficult not to believe. We have to learn this culture of discussions, arguments, and political debates. There should always be commitments during discussions. Without commitments the opposition will not be able to gain the stand and image to which it aspires. I really want to have an opposition, an opposition which can seriously argue with the majority or the authorities or whoever. But using correct arguments. If we all learn this we will have a real opposition. As regards to troop deployment, we have two variants. One is being discussed at the moment. This is the deployment of international peace-keeping forces. It is not easy but outlines of a decision can already been seen. Or the other hand, there could be a completely Russian contingent. This will be easier to implement. Easier, because both President Yeltsin and I have given our consent to this in principle. [Oniani] But not under the UN flag, only Russians ... [Shevardnadze, interrupting] Certainly, only under the UN flag. And they support this idea. However, at the present stage, the issue of international troops is being discussed. These forces will include a certain number of Russian troops. They may comprise 20 percent or 30 percent maybe. I do not think it matters much. A few countries have applied to the United Nations expressing readiness to participate in the peace-keeping mission. I do not know how sufficient this will be. This must be elucidated. [Oniani] We have to point out, Batono Eduard, that we speak of peace-keeping forces rather than the deployment of NATO troops in Georgia. [Shevardnadze] Indeed. Perhaps some time later, when we sign certain documents and start cooperation with NATO, this issue will be topical. But I do hope we will need neither NATO troops nor Russian troops. However, NATO forces could take a definite part in our [word indistinct] [Oniani] Soon a summit of the CIS countries will be held in Moscow. What can our country expect from this meeting regarding two problems most acute for us, I mean Abkhazia and our economy? [Shevardnadze] I will not elaborate on this issue. In the coming two days I will probably speak to our listeners and TV viewers. At present, work is being done on documents sent by various countries. We have our opinion. A definition of a frame for economic cooperation will be the main issue under discussion. A scale and conditions for this will also be discussed. It is natural that issues of conflicts will be considered, as well. As I have said, a serious work is being done in all the ministries, agencies and the Cabinet of Ministers and soon I will be able to share my opinion with the listeners and TV viewers. [Oniani] Batono Eduard, recent operations by the Interior Ministry, Defense Ministry, and Security Ministry have produced certain changes for the better. These are the first effects and maybe they cannot be well noticed by the population. We are coming closer to the establishment of order such as exists in our neighbour, Azerbaijan. Last week, railway cars were blown up in Sadakhlo. On 9 April a device was exploded on the premises of the SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA newspaper. Facts like these have accumulated. [Shevardnadze] Everyone will obviously agree with me that order has improved a little. This is probably a result of a better implementation of a decree on this issue by the law-enforcement bodies. [words indistinct]. Now, the law-enforcement bodies have to turn their whole attention to revealing the crimes. Criminal cases like the explosion in Sadakhlo or the explosion in the SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA building must not be closed without investigation. I would like to voice my great hopes that the law-enforcement bodies will work efficiently on these cases. In any case, the trend toward general improvement can be seen and all efforts should be directed toward establishing law and order in the country. These are real prospects today rather than those of the future. We have begun our work in this direction and will lead it to a conclusion. [Oniani] Finally, five years have passed since the tragic day of 9 April. The 16th anniversary of the events that took place on 14 April 1978 will be marked this week. One is considered a day of national unity and the other is considered a day of the Georgian language. April seems to be eventful. [Shevardnadze] I have a request in this connection. Any anniversary related to a sorrowful event is used by one part of the population only with one aim, I mean, not to allow the country to calm down, to have instability continued and to press the authorities to resign, as it was demanded on 9 April. Such a mood cannot receive a positive assessment. I sometimes wonder what these people want. Do they want good for the country and its unity or destruction? [passage indistinct]. In this connection I would like to say that they will fail because Georgia is not and will never be what it used to be. The people will not follow dark forces and no one will take them to the dark and the mire.
