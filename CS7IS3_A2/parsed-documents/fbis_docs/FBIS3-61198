Nazarbayev received a group of economic consultants from South Korea. The group consisted of leading economic scientists from the Korean government's economic planning office, the government's institute for development, and the institute for economic research. The activities of the group were led by Korea's former deputy prime minister, Dr Kim Mahn Je. Agreement on the group's work in our republic was reached during a meeting on 13 May of this year between N. Nazarbayev and Kim Shin Yong, chairman of the South Korean group of the Khankhva [transliteration] company. In the course of two months the experts from Korea worked in Almaty, where they studied the details of the financial and banking systems, foreign exchange relations and privatization policy. A report was written on the basis of the collected and generalized data characterizing the current situation. In this case the South Korean experts made specific proposals regarding the matters they studied. The report was presented together with the proposals to N. Nazarbayev at a meeting attended by Prime Minister S. Tereshchenko and other leaders of interested departments. Kim Mahn Je briefly described the project offered for study, which consists of four parts, and suggested that Kazakhstan take South Korea's road to establishing market relations. The third and fourth parts of the project presented in the report pertain to analysis of the problems of privatizing and reorganizing the banking system. In the opinion of the leader of the group of experts, privatization is being held back in Kazakhstan because little capital has yet been accumulated in private hands. A proposal was made to create 20 holding companies that could help more than 200 large enterprises to travel the road linking denationalization to full market relations. Rather than the planned 3-year period of mass privatization, the Koreans propose a more gradual road over a period of 5 years in order to avoid major upheavals. They advise beginning mass privatization with competitive, strong enterprises. The experts believe that the existing banking system is the largest problem on the road to reform. Presence of a large number of small banks is an obstacle to a clear financial policy. In the opinion of Kim Mahn Je capital needs to be concentrated in Kazakhstan in one or two large banks. For example a large bank for Kazakhstan's reconstruction and development possessing authority abroad could be established by merging the capital of the Turanbank and Kredsotsbank [transliterations] with the National Bank. The capital of the Alembank and Kazsberbank [transliterations] could be merged into a second bank. A proposal was also made for reorganizing small banks and establishing a minimum amount of authorized capital. It was revealed in the course of discussion that many of the proposals enjoy support among members of the Kazakhstan government. Besides this, N. Nazarbayev said that the republic will have to abandon subsidies to unprofitable enterprises. But this should not proceed as it did in Russia, the president stressed. There, around 10,000 enterprises may go bankrupt in the course of such an approach, which is 30 percent of their number. Russia is huge, and it can endure, but Kazakhstan couldn't. Some enterprises, in the president's words, will receive support from the state. Included among them are the giants of metallurgy--Karmetkombinat, Balkhashmed, and chromium producers. N. Nazarbayev thanked the group of Korean scientists for the work they did, and recommended inviting them to act as experts and specialists in banking affairs. They are to provide assistance in drafting documents on reforming the banking system. Following the meeting with the South Korean group N. Nazarbayev met with 30 directors of the largest enterprises of the former defense complex. The hope is that they will lead the Kazakh economy out of its stagnation. A huge engineering and technical potential capable of solving the most serious problems is concentrated at these enterprises. A specific task was posed to each director.
