They also discuss U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's current tour of the region. In one of its commentaries, AL-THAWRAH discusses the importance of the Arab boycott of Israel and the attempts to end the boycott. The paper says: What amazing logic that calls for canceling the Arab boycott of Israel before reversing the Israeli occupation of the Arab territories and its consequences! The paper notes that the Arab boycott was a natural result and a position adopted by the Arabs in self-defense in the face of Israel's aggressive policy and its expansionist ambitions toward the Arab nation. AL-THAWRAH adds: Israel has not changed its function and role in the service of expansionist ambitions, based on plundering the wealth of the Arab nation and undermining its political and economic status. Canceling the boycott, therefore, while Israel continues to adopt an aggressive policy, has two aims: Stripping the Arabs of their right to use the boycott as a legitimate weapon in the face of Israel's ambitions and aggressive policy; and sabotaging the peace process and efforts for peace. Concluding, the paper says: Israel's policy, in all its manifestations, is the only reason that the Arabs, primarily Syria, adhere to the Arab boycott as a regimen to immunize Arab existence against the danger of Israel's inclination for expansion and aggression. Developments on the ground have proven that Israel will never abandon this inclination, even under the peace process and efforts to make it succeed. On the same issue, AL-BA'TH says: In order to prevent the peace process from becoming divorced from its objectives, there is now a pressing need to rectify the course of this process since the Rabin government has tried to derail the process and distort the basic substance through a series of attempts to circumvent the issues. These attempt began in Madrid and are still continuing today. AL-BA'TH says it is the role of the U.S. secretary, who is visiting the region to intensify his efforts, on behalf of his administration that sponsors the peace process, to advance this process. AL-BA'TH stresses Syria's full right to give its frank opinion, as usual, and to give a final say on the course of the peace process, particularly regarding a full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan and the rest of the occupied Arab territories. Concluding its commentary, AL-BA'TH stresses that Syria's demands have never departed from the foundations of the peace process, which was launched on the basis of international legitimacy and relevant UN resolutions. In another commentary, AL-THAWRAH speaks about U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's tour of the region, asking the world and the U.S. Administration to identify the party that is obstructing the peace process and pushing it toward a dead end, and to take action to deter that party. AL-THAWRAH stresses that the political process lacks vitality and vigor because of the continued Israeli policy of maneuvering and that sincere efforts need to be made now to press for the implementation of UN resolutions and the exchange of land for peace. The paper asks Washington to quickly fulfill its obligations and pledges so as not to undermine its credibility. AL-THAWRAH concludes by stressing the constant principles in Syria's policy and its sincere attitude toward peace and adherence to its just demands to preserve our national and pan-Arab rights and ensure their return in full.
