According to Borowski, the measures implemented by Waldemar Pawlak's government are proof of its left-wing nature. "The attitude to the issue of participation of the state in economic life is also a social-democratic element," the deputy prime minister said. He also emphasized that "a transition from a liberal to a left-wing government is not easy because this is the first such transformation attempt in any Central European country." Borowski rejected the accusations, mainly from UP Chairman Ryszard Bugaj, that there is a continuation of the monetarist policy, and that he maintained a "small budget" and "the privatisation principle." "This budget slows down certain trends but does not overcome them; we have to continue the privatization process because the state cannot manage 6,000 companies," Borowski said. The deputy prime minister also disagreed with Sejm Deputy Wieslawa Ziolkowska, who said that this year's budget does not bring Poland closer to the European Union [EU]. According to Borowski the situation is just the opposite because the budget is aimed at curbing inflation, which is one of the conditions for membership in the EU. At the meeting Borowski listened to papers delivered by several dozen academics on social policy and economic issues.
