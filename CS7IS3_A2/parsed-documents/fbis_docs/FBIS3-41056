Rol: The association's chief goal is to promote consolidation of the Armed Forces and therefore strengthen the Ukrainian state, because the Army is one of the fundamental institutions of its protection. As everyone knows, the SOU is a public organization including officers in active service as well as those discharged into the reserve or retired. The association is experiencing hard times because of an ambiguous attitude to it on the part of the Defense Ministry. Obviously, there were some mistakes made by its leadership -- and therefore by myself since I belonged to it. One of them is preoccupation with political activities while the association's main goal is the consolidation of the Armed Forces. Also, issuing various declarations criticizing the commander in chief does not seem to make much sense. This is exactly what triggered a negative attitude among high-ranking officials. No doubt, the SOU needs no help from the Armed Forces. On the contrary, the association itself morally supports the military. How? We consider it our obligation to instill the spirit of Ukrainian patriotism and the glorious traditions of the Ukrainian Army in the military personnel. The SOU sees this as its main thrust of activities, maintaining close contacts with many public organizations and participants of the national-liberation struggle, who can have a strong impact on education of the personnel. Another aspect of our activities is the social protection of servicemen and members of their families as well as assisting the command in establishing a strict order in military units and components. Today, we have to clearly define and adjust methods of restoring the SOU, and this is also a goal of its leadership. At the end of last year, SOU leaders met with Lieutenant General Kobzar, chief of the Main Education Administration and head of the Socio- Psychological Service at the Ukrainian Defense Administration. During the conversation, we found out that our positions regarding SOU's role in strengthening the Ukrainian Armed Forces are the same. As General Kobzar stated, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry will support all organizations that contribute to the Ukrainian Army's combat readiness, and said he would like to see the SOU playing a greater role in the consolidation of officers and cultivating the best military traditions. We talked about involving more amateur groups, professional artists, and simply interesting people in performing in military units. In other words, the general and I had a very businesslike conversation, which he promised to communicate to the defense minister. I think we will soon meet with the latter. The Officers' Association ought to work in close collaboration with the Defense Ministry and all state structures in charge of protecting the independence of our state. After all, the SOU and the Defense Ministry fulfill that same task of state importance. Bazelyuk: What is your attitude to Ukraine's nuclear disarmament? Rol: Since 1991, I have repeatedly spoken through various media, maintaining that Ukraine must have nuclear weapons until any state that could become our potential adversary gets rid of its own nuclear arsenal. This is what I think. Whatever large army we have, it would be nothing compared to the nuclear potential, which is a means of protection for Ukraine. The position of our political leadership has caused a number of negative processes. Back in the days when Ukraine was moving toward independence, it hastily proclaimed its intention to become a nonnuclear state. Here is another example. They ask: Why should Ukraine have the Black Sea Fleet since it declared that it needs the fleet only for local purposes? This is how the Black Sea Fleet arose with all its consequences. It is too bad that we so hurriedly gave up tactical weapons that could defend Ukraine better than even the strongest Army. You cannot guarantee national security without modern weapons. Ukraine must proceed from the fact that it is impossible to ensure protection of the state against an enemy's armed assault, relying on other countries' guarantees only. In terms of combat readiness and national security of Ukraine, we should count only on our own strength. Why does the West help Russia in all possible ways? Just because it has the powerful nuclear potential and is a strong state in this sense. Bazelyuk: Is there anything one could do to retain the nuclear status? Rol: In my opinion, the question "Should Ukraine be a nuclear state?" should be put to a nationwide referendum. I am outraged when some state lays down the law to us: "You must get rid of nuclear weapons." Who would dare to tell this to China, Great Britain, or France? Bazelyuk: What do you think about the fact that the 43d Rocket Army personnel has not yet pledged allegiance to Ukraine? Rol: I will look into this as the head of the Ukrainian Officers' Association. Bazelyuk: You were proposed as a candidate to the Ukrainian Supreme Council. You have accepted the nomination... Rol: Yes, I have. First of all, because I have a clear notion of what I would be doing in the Ukrainian legislature. If people trust me, I will press for strong political power that would introduce and maintain legal order in the country. After all, a political crisis is a power crisis. I will stand for a balanced implementation of reform based on all forms of ownership. In my opinion, state property should cover those industries and enterprises upon which the protection of our country's independence and national interests depends. I will demand the buildup of a national Ukrainian Army -- a guarantor of independence -- equipped with modern weapons.
