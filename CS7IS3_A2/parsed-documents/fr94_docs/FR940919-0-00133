FR940919-0-00133 FR940919-0-00017 Fairy shrimp have delicate elongate bodies, large stalked compound eyes, no carapace, and 11 pairs of swimming legs. They swim or glide gracefully upside down by means of complex beating movements of the legs that pass in a wave-like anterior to posterior direction. Nearly all fairy shrimp feed on algae, bacteria, protozoa, rotifers, and bits of detritus (Pennak 1989). The second pair of antennae in the adult females are cylindrical and elongate, but in the males are greatly enlarged and specialized for clasping the females during copulation. The females carry the eggs in an oval or elongate ventral brood sac. The eggs are either dropped to the pool bottom or remain in the brood sac until the female dies and sinks. The ``resting'' or ``summer'' eggs are capable of withstanding heat, cold, and prolonged desiccation. When the pools refill in the same or subsequent seasons some, but not all, of the eggs may hatch. The egg bank in the soil may be comprised of the eggs from several years of breeding (Donald 1983). The eggs hatch when the vernal pools fill with rainwater. The early stages of the fairy shrimp develop rapidly into adults. These non-dormant populations often disappear early in the season long before the vernal pools dry up. Tadpole shrimp have dorsal compound eyes, a large shield-like carapace that covers most of the body, and a pair of long cercopods at the end of the last abdominal segment (Brusca and Brusca 1991; Pennak 1989; Linder 1952; Longhurst 1955a; Lynch 1966, 1972). They are primarily benthic animals that swim with their legs down. Tadpole shrimp climb or scramble over objects, as well as plow along in bottom sediments. Their diet consists of organic detritus and living organisms, such as fairy shrimp and other invertebrates (Pennak 1989; Fryer 1987). Mating in tadpole shrimp is described by Longhurst (1955b). The females deposit their eggs on vegetation and other objects on the bottom. Vernal pool tadpole shrimp populations pass the dry summer months as diapaused eggs in pool sediments. Some of the eggs hatch as the vernal pools are filled with rainwater in the fall and winter of subsequent seasons. Vernal pools have a discontinuance occurrence in several regions of California. Generally vernal pool habitat is found west of the Sierra Nevada and extends from southern Oregon into northern Baja, California (Holland and Jain 1977, 1988). Vernal pools form in regions with Mediterranean climates where shallow depressions fill with water during fall and winter rains and then evaporate in the spring (Collie and Lathrop 1976; Holland 1976, 1978; Holland and Jain 1977, 1988; Norwick 1992; Thorne 1984). Overbank flooding from intermittent streams may augment the amount of water in some vernal pools (Hanes et al. 1990). Downward percolation is prevented by the presence of an impervious subsurface layer, such as a claypan, hardpan, or volcanic stratum (Holland 1976, 1988). Due to local topography and geology, the pools are usually clustered into pool complexes (Holland and Jain 1988). Pools within a complex typically are separated by distances on the order of meters and may form dense, interconnected mosaics of small pools or a more sparse scattering of larger pools. Temporary inundation makes vernal pools too wet during the wetted period for adjacent upland plant species adapted to drier soil conditions, while rapid drying during late spring makes pool basins unsuitable for typical marsh or aquatic species that require a more permanent source of water. However, many indigenous plant and aquatic invertebrate species have evolved to occupy the extreme environmental conditions found in vernal pool habitats. Fairy shrimp and tadpole shrimp play an important role in the community ecology of many ephemeral water bodies (R. Brusca, pers. comm., 1992; Loring et al. 1988). They are fed upon by waterfowl (Ahl 1991; Driver 1981; Krapu 1974; Swanson et al. 1974) and other vertebrates, such as western spadefoot toad ( Scaphiopus hammondi ) tadpoles (M. Simovich, pers. comm., 1991). The genetic characteristics of the three fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp, as well as ecological conditions, such as watershed contiguity, indicate that populations of these animals are defined by pool complexes rather than by individual vernal pools (Fugate 1992; J. King, unpubl. data). Therefore, the most accurate indication of the distribution and abundance of the four vernal pool crustaceans is the number of inhabited vernal pool complexes. Individual vernal pools occupied by the four species listed herein are most appropriately referred to as subpopulations. Urban, water, flood control, highway, and utility projects, as well as conversion of wildlands to agricultural use, have eliminated vernal pools in southern California (Riverside and San Diego Counties), the Central Valley, and San Francisco Bay area (Jones and Stokes Associates 1987). Changes in hydrologic pattern, overgrazing, and off-road vehicle use also imperil this aquatic habitat and the four species listed herein. Human activities that alter the watershed of vernal pools indirectly affect these animals. The flora and fauna in vernal pools or swales can change if the hydrologic regime is altered (Bauder 1986, 1987). Anthropogenic activities that reduce the extent of the watershed or that alter runoff patterns (i.e., amounts and seasonal distribution) may eliminate the animals, reduce their population sizes or reproductive success, or shift the location of sites inhabited by these animals. According to Holland (1978), there were an estimated 1.7 million hectares (4.2 million acres) in the Central Valley that possibly supported vernal pools at the time Europeans arrived in California. Holland estimated that between 67 and 88 percent of this acreage was destroyed by 1973, largely by human activities (Holland 1978). However, both the acreage of historic vernal pool habitat and estimates of loss determined in this study have been disputed by others. Vernal pools in southern California have been highly impacted by human activities (Zedler 1987). The rate of loss of vernal pool habitat in parts of California has been estimated to occur at approximately 2 or 3 percent per year (Holland 1988).
