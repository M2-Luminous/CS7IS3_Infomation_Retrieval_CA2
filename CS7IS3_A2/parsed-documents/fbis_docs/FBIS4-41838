Dubinin said the fund should be formed in two ways. Firstly, a special account should be opened for voluntary donations. The other part of the fund could be formed with the help of an additional income tax. The suggestion is: incomes under 75,000 rubles a month would be tax-exempt. Between 75,000 and 300,000 rubles the rate would be 0.5 pct, between 300,000 and one million -- 1 pct, between one and two and a half million -- 2 pct, and over 2.5 million -- 3 pct. Dubinin believes the tax would help collect 700 billion in half a year which is the sum necessary for financing the federal program according to ministry estimates. "I do not know how pleasant that is politically, but if we approve a program and intend to carry it out, it should be financed and we do not have additional sources in the framework of the approved budget," the acting minister admitted. Thus, an additional, alternative source has to be found: these could be special bonds totalling 700 billion or one trillion rubles, Dubinin said. Dubinin added that bonds could be distributed among legal entities and individuals on a voluntary basis. In any case without defining the source it is impossible to finance the program, therefore something has to be chosen, Dubinin said. He added that the ministry does not fear to be sharply criticized for the proposed tax because it already is a target of constant attacks. Dubinin said that the proposal is being made at a time when the ministry intends to reduce the rates of several other taxes. "I think this will be understood properly. I am ready to pay for my personal security. I might not be right, but I think that the majority of the population will understand", he concluded.
