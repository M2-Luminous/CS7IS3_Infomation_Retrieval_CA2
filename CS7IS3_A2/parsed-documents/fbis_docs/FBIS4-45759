Another study shows that acid rain occurs in rural or remote areas like Chongwon, North Chungchong Province, Cheju Island and the Taean peninsula -- not as a result of air pollutants from Korea but from China. Chong Yong-song, head of the Korea-China Center for Atmospheric Research based at the Korea National University of Education in Chongwon, and his associate researchers presented their observations at the four-day fourth international conference on Atmospheric Sciences and Applications to Air Quality (ASAAQ) that started Monday at a hotel in southeastern Seoul. Their studies, particularly of the Taean peninsula, were compared with the results of carbon dioxide and monoxide, and methane observations obtained by their counterparts from China, Mongolia and Hawaii at Mt. Waliguan, Ulaan Uul and Mauna Loa. Their observations of carbon dioxide levels since November 1990 show that the Taean peninsula is generally under the influence of airflows coming from China. The Korean scientists says their analysis indicates that according to methane data from Mongolia and several sites in the North Pacific, the Taean peninsula is influenced as much as 31 PPB (parts per billion) on average by Chinese emissions. In his study on the background-level acidity of precipitation in Korea, conducted jointly with fellow researcher Kim Tae-kun, Chong concludes that annual pH values in rural areas that are isolated from major industrial regions are "weak acid" ranging between pH 5.0 and 5.3. In Chongwon, a rural area situated in central Korea, 173 days (64 percent) showed acid precipitation out of a total 271 days. Higher frequencies of acid precipitation indicate that it is spreading out in the rural areas of Korea. Acid rain in rural or remote areas like Cheju Island and the Taean peninsula, the scientists say, is carried by rain clouds from southern China usually containing high values of acidity. Considering the annual 10-percent rise in energy production in China, acid rain is feared to frequently occur in Korea, they conclude.
