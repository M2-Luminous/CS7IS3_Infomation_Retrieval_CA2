Tanks and armoured personnel carriers were moved into Poipet as protection for the visit, a government officer at the border said. As preparations were being made to boost protection for the visiting dignitaries, fresh fighting erupted in Phum Takong Krao about 18 kilometers to the south, the latest in a series of clashes between the government troops and the Khmer Rouge in the area. In northern Preah Vihrear province, Khmer Rouge guerrillas burnt more than one thousand acres (400 hectares) of ricefields, Ministry of Information spokesman Sieng La Presse said. "This is the harvest season and they try to sabotage the economic system of the royal government by burning rice, threatening the lives of peasants and cutting the roads so they cannot move their produce to the market," he said. Sieng La Presse said guerrillas were operating a "hit and run" strategy, attacking a village at night and burning the houses, killing livestock and destroying paddies.
