FR940907-2-00104 FR940907-2-00076 Forms Under Review by the Office of Management and Budget Acting Agency Clearance Officer: David T. Copenhafer, (202) 942&hyph;8800. Upon Written Request, Copy Available From: Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of Filings and Information Services, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, D.C. 20549. Proposed Amendments Regulation S&hyph;X_File No. 270&hyph;3 Form N&hyph;1A_File No. 270&hyph;21 Form N&hyph;2_File No. 270&hyph;21 Form N&hyph;3_File No. 270&hyph;281 Form N&hyph;4_File No. 270&hyph;282 Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq .), the Securities and Exchange Commission has submitted for OMB approval amendments to Regulation S&hyph;X under the Securities Act of 1933 (the ``1933 Act'') and Form N&hyph;1A, Form N&hyph;2, Form N&hyph;3, and Form N&hyph;4 under the 1933 Act and the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ``1940 Act''). The amendments pertain to the disclosure of investment company (``funds'') expenses when such expenses are paid by broker-dealers in exchange for the direction of the fund's brokerage transactions to the broker-dealer. The proposed amendment to Regulation S&hyph;X would require funds to include in their statements of operations the amount of any expense that would have been paid had a broker-dealer not paid the expense, in whole or in part, in exchange for fund brokerage. The proposed amendments to Form N&hyph;1A, Form N&hyph;2, Form N&hyph;3 and Form N&hyph;4 would require that this ``total expense'' figure also be set forth in the fee table and financial highlights table in fund prospectuses and be used in the calculation of fund yield. The change in burden associated with these amendments will be reflected in the burdens associated with the various forms proposed to be amended. It is estimated that 270 funds that file on Form N&hyph;1A will each incur 3.0 burden hours in addition to the time currently required to complete the Form, while 2,430 funds that file on Form N&hyph;1A will each incur 1.0 additional burden hour. It is estimated that twelve funds that file on Form N&hyph;2 will each incur 2.5 burden hours in addition to the time currently required to complete the Form, while 113 funds that file on Form N&hyph;2 will each incur 1.0 additional burden hour. It is estimated that five funds that file on Form N&hyph;3 will each incur 1.5 burden hours in addition to the time currently required to complete Form N&hyph;3. Finally, it is estimated that twenty-eight funds that file on Form N&hyph;4 will each incur 1.5 burden hours in addition to the time currently required to complete Form N&hyph;4. Direct general comments to the Desk Officer for the Securities and Exchange Commission at the address below. Direct any comments concerning the accuracy of the estimated average burden hours for compliance with the Commission rules and forms to David T. Copenhafer, Acting Director, Office of Information Technology, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, D.C. 20549 and Desk Officer for the Securities and Exchange Commission.
