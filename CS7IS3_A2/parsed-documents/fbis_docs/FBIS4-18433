FBIS4-18433 "drweu065_p_94005" FBIS-WEU-94-065 Daily Report 6 Apr 1994 GREECE * PASOK Congress, Succession Discussed * PASOK Congress, Succession Discussed 94P20609A 94P20609A CSO [Editorial Report] As the April date for the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) congress approaches, candidacies for the second slot in the party's hierarchy are "timidly emerging," writes Tasos Pappas in the 20 March Athens weekly KIRIAKATIKI ELEVTHEROTIPIA. No doubt Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou will remain party leader and general secretary Akis Tsokhatzopoulos will probably be reelected, Pappas comments. Tsokhatzopoulos' advantages are his familiarity with the party apparatus and the control he exerts over "critical state-nomarchies-districts" links with the party. While Tsokhatzopoulos contends Papandreou favors him, "only time will tell," Pappas observes. While another candidate, Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis, is "keeping his cards close to his chest," influential PASOK deputy and trade-unionist D. Piperyias, a long-time friend of Arsenis, is cited by Pappas as stating in a recent interview that he prefers the defense minister over other heirs apparent. For his part, Minister of Industry Kostas Simitis is "steadfastly" following his modernizing course and recently "inveighed" against trade unions and party hacks pressuring for additional hirings of public workers. PASOK luminary Vaso Papandreou is moving "in the same vital space." While on the surface Minister of Environment Kostas Laliotis shows indifference to party developments, he surely entertains his own ambitions and expects to play the role of "gold reserves," Pappas continues. He goes on to mention deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Theodhoros Pangalos, who has "many friends and sworn enemies," as well as PASOK luminary Apostolos Kaklamanis, president of the Chamber of Deputies, and old party members Yiannis Alevras and Yiannis Kharalambopoulos. Of course, Pappas concludes, the major unknown elements are Minister of National Economy Yiorgos Yennimatas and his followers' stance, as it is generally believed that the outcome of the race will depend on their moves. According to Notis Papadhopoulos and Yiannis Politis writing in the 19 March Athens daily TA NEA, Theodhoros Pangalos is "no longer hiding his leadership ambitions." His most recent statements regarding the government's "unrealistic foreign and economic policies" are perceived as attempting to influence PASOK congress developments, the authors comment. They point out, however, that Pangalos always "hastens to correct his course" by following up with support for the government. The deputy minister clearly has a personal strategy, which he believes will bear fruit both at the congress and on a long-term basis. While his "impulsiveness" may cause temporary unpleasantness, Pangalos aides are cited as believing it increases his popularity as a politician "who says it like it is." Papadhopoulos and Politis cite a recent poll commissioned by the New Democracy (ND) (no further details) showing Pangalos as one of the best liked Greek politicians. In contrast, they note, Pangalos' colleagues are very guarded about his sometimes "heretical" stance, even if reluctant to state it publicly, the authors conclude. Government reaction to Pangalos' criticism of governmental policies was swift, reports the 19 March TA NEA. Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos emphasized the present "specific, coordinated, and pondered" economic policy and indirectly accused Pangalos of ignoring Papandreouf's directive requesting his ministers to refrain from expressing individual views on important issues. In another development, the 13 March KIRIAKATIKI ELEVTHEROTIPIA comments on the "well-known" conflict between Minister of Foreign Affairs Karolos Papoulias and Pangalos. According to the brief article, while it is clear that Papandreou sides with the former and has already decided to dismiss Pangalos, a public announcement will only come "at the right moment." The 20 March I KATHIMERINI echoes this by reporting that despite Papandreou's determination to dismiss Pangalos, he will only do so when the Greek European Union (EU) presidency ends, to avoid making him a "hero" and turning him into a potential successor at the PASOK congress. The 20 March TO VIMA TIS KIRIAKIS published an interview with Pangalos by Petros Evthimiou, in which the alternate minister advocated the modernization and Europeanization of PASOK and of society, changes that will begin to take place during the forthcoming congress. Pangalos also maintained that while the party should be the state's inspiration and play a critical role vis-a-vis the government, this should only occur at the top, through a parallel structure unconnected to the government. Evthimiou asked Pangalos whether this will be a "post-Papandreou" congress charged with defining the party's course if Papandreou moves to the presidency and leaves the field to party officials. He also linked the question to an unidentified Pangalos central committee colleague's hope that the party will not break up in the post-Papandreou era, and that the PASOK fragments will remain friendly even if it did. Pangalos replied that the congress will have a unifying influence in that there will be a synthesis of the various views, which an overwhelming majority will approve. The alternate minister then expressed his conviction that "there will be no second Andreas Papandreou," and that in the future, the party will have a collective leadership, one of whose members will be nominated for the prime ministership on a rotating basis according to the needs of the moment. While this may be difficult to accept, it constitutes the normal political life of a modern democratic European country, Pangalos concluded.
