[Shams al-Din] [passage omitted] In view of the fact that the designs of the Zionist movement have been implemented in Palestine, we can say that from this angle we have sustained defeat. [passage omitted] However, defeat does not mean that we have lost all our means of defense. I stress that the ummah has not used all its offensive resources but has merely suspended the use of its means for defense. [passage omitted] Our condition at present is such that the Arab plan has failed and the Islamic plan has failed. The only place where the Islamic program continues is the Islamic Republic of Iran, which is also under an embargo that is being tightened in the political, economic, and security fields. I fear that the Zionists will drive a wedge thus paving the way for the infiltration of the enemy's designs of our ranks. [passage omitted] Western politicians say that this situation is a reality and has evolved this way. We tell them that evil is also a reality in this world, but should we bow down to it? We should resist it instead. [passage omitted on World War I] The fact is that the ummah's struggle against Zionism is not a struggle of one generation at one particular time. The Zionist plot belongs to a nation which has placed itself in the thick of international interests; right from the outset, the ummah should fight against it, and it should be considered a struggle spanning many generations. A long-term strategy should be formulated; part of this strategy is to ignore governments, because this struggle does not end with the death of a king or a president. It the battle of all the ummah, whether it spans one generation or three generations. We should also accept the fact that we will have many losses on this path. This is because the plot that we have to fight against is not confined to Palestine, but is a worldwide plot. This is one of the strategic errors--that is, the Arabs thought they could combat Zionist plots in the short term. It is for this reason that we state that the ummah should reassert itself to combat the Zionist plot, as the ummah is not limited to a single generation.
