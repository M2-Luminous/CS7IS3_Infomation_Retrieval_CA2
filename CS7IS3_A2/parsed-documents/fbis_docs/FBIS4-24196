Finance Minister Derek Keys received good news from taxpayers, whose contributions in April and May -- the first two months of the current fiscal year -- were substantially over budget. On the other hand he has been confronted with Reserve Bank criticism that excessive state spending has pushed SA into a "debt trap", a fact which he vigorously disputes. Figures released by the Central Statistical Service on Friday show that revenues from taxes and customs duties in April and May at R14.2-billion [rand] to R20.4-billion, leaving a deficit before borrowing of R6.14-billion (1993: R7.84-billion). Mr Keys has budgeted for a 10.2 percent rise in spending to R135.1-billion and a 11.2 percent increase in revenue to R105.8- billion for the year as a whole. "While there are some technical factors coming into play, higher corporate earnings and rising consumer spending should ensure that the government's revenue targets are easily met this year," says Mike Brown, economist at stockbrokers Frankel Pollak Vinderine. He is, however, concerned that the new departments will not be able to stick to spending targets, which could raise the deficit above the budgeted R29.3-billion (6.6 percent of GDP). Financing the deficit, the R15-billion debt of the former TBVC [Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda, Ciskei] states and R7-billion losses related to gold and foreign exchange reserves will lift state debt to about R244-billion by February 1995 -- just under 55 percent of projected GDP. In March this year the debt totalled R192- billion, or 48 percent of GDP, according to the Reserve Bank's latest Quarterly Bulletin. The mounting debt burden and the high deficit have already placed SA in a debt trap, says the Bank's deputy Governor, Jaap Meijer. Using the rigorous IMF formulation of a debt trap, he says that the government needs to borrow money to pay the interest on its debt burden, which 1994/95 will amount to R24.6-billion. Interests payments on government debt have risen by 19 percent yearly over the past five years and constitute the second largest expenditure item in the Budget, after education. If the proportion of interest payment to total spending continues to rise, spending on other sectors, such as education, health and housing, will have to be progressively reduced. "A continuation of this trend is unsustainable and the government will have to take corrective measures," Dr Meijer says. Appearing before Parliament's joint standing committee on finance on Thursday, Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals also warned that the high deficit, capital outflows and low savings were placing upward pressure on interest rates. Dr Ernie van der Merwe, head of the Bank's economic department, says, however, that government debt has not yet reached the levels where a further increase cannot be prevented, either by higher taxes or a decline in spending. "I believe that Mr Keys' commitment to a restructured tax system and a real cut in state spending will ensure that we will not be caught in a debt trap," he says. Dr van der Merwe also points out that the ratio of public debt to GDP at 54 percent is not excessive in international terms. The European Union had prescribed a ratio of 60 percent in the Maastricht treaty. Mr Keys dismisses fears of a debt trap. In an interview this week he said that international guidelines were not strictly applicable in SA, "where a sizeable proportion of the debt -- the deficit on the state pension and provident funds -- is owned by the civil service".
