(15 points) In making grant award decisions the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Population Affairs (DASPA) will fund those projects which will in his judgment best promote the purposes of section 1003 of the Act, within the limits of funds available for such projects. Grants will be approved for project periods of up to 5 years. Grants are funded in annual increments (budget periods). Funding for all approved budget periods beyond the first year of the grant is contingent upon satisfactory progress of the project, efficient and effective use of grant funds provided, and availability of funds. Review Under Executive Order 12372 Applicants under this announcement are subject to the review requirements of Executive Order 12372, State Review of Applications for Federal Financial Assistance, as implemented by 45 CFR part 100. As soon as possible, the applicant should discuss the project with the State Single Point of Contact (SPOC) for each State in the area to be served. The application kit contains the currently available listing of the SPOCs which have elected to be informed of the submission of applications. For those States not represented on the listing, further inquiries should be made by the applicant regarding the submission to the relevant SPOC. The SPOC's comment(s) should be forwarded to the Grants Management Office, Office of Population Affairs, East-West Towers, suite N1115, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857. Such comments must be received by the Office of Population Affairs by June 6, 1994 to be considered. When final funding decisions have been made, each applicant will be notified by letter of the outcome. The official document notifying an applicant that a project application has been approved for funding is the Notice of Grant Award, which specifies to the grantee the amount of money awarded, the purposes of the grant, and terms and conditions of the grant award. Dated: February 22, 1994. Gerald J. Bennett, Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary for Population Affairs. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;8154 Filed 4&hyph;5&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4160&hyph;17&hyph;M
