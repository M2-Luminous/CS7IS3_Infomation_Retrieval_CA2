General Pol Saroeun, Phnom Penh's deputy chief of general staff, said Khmer Rouge guerrillas were staging attacks elsewhere to try to draw government forces out of Pailin. "But we are not so stupid to do that. We have to maintain Pailin forever," he said. To hold the former rebel headquarters in northwest Cambodia, he said, 20 kilometers (12 miles) of the old main road into Pailin had to be cleared of the jungle overgrowth and mines which had left it impassable for years. "Soldiers have already started to clear the road from Chireang to Pailin and the work should be finished within a week," the general told AFP. Pol Saroeun said access to Pailin via the stretch of former National Route 10 through what had been Khmer Rouge-held territory was essential so that fresh troops, supplies and heavy weaponry could be sent in to secure the town. The access would also help thwart any Khmer Rouge counter-attacks, he said. Government reinforcements, supplies and weaponry are now taken in by truck over a muddy jungle track which snakes around hills and mountains for some 30 kilometers (20 miles) in a journey that can take up to three days. The general admitted the unusually heavy rains in the past few days were creating difficulties for government forces. Two soldiers were killed and one wounded when a tank they were travelling on hit an anti-tank mine Tuesday as [words indistinct] to bypass the bogged-down traffic on the road.
