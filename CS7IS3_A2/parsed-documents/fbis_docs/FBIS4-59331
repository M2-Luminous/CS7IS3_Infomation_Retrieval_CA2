First, I would like to welcome all of you. I am happy with this first meeting in my capacity as the head of the Council of Ministers. Also, since [words indistinct] I have not met with you often. Therefore, this is an opportunity [words indistinct] all of us. I will begin this news conference with an approximately 10- minute introductory statement. Afterward, I will take your questions. We want a dialogue to be established between ourselves and journalists. Statements are not enough. We hope this dialogue will provide a clear picture of what is really going on in Yemen. I do not want to start from the very beginning of the crisis, or the so-called Yemeni crisis. I believe all of you know a great deal about it. However, allow to me to say that the [word indistinct] crisis began many months ago, specifically [words indistinct] the last six-seven months. [passage omitted] I would like to reiterate what all leaders in Sanaa have said. The crisis was started by members of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] Political Bureau. We distinguish between the YSP and its leadership, or some of its (?leaders). This is because [words indistinct] is rebellion against constitutional legitimacy. In view of this rebellion, and after the first battles took place, the Army of the Republic of Yemen had to play its role and perform its national duty. This Army has played its role. [sentence indistinct]. However, contrary to what has been [word indistinct] here and abroad, the battle is not between the north and south. This is untrue. This is because among the Yemeni Armed Forces fighting today in support of legitimacy and the constitution are many southern brigades. This statement is supported by the fact that the defense minister, who was appointed two days ago, is from the Abyan region. He is not the only one. There are many southerners among the Armed Forces. In fact, as you know, thousands, or at least hundreds, of our brother troops who are fighting against the official troops join us daily and fight against the other side. This is clear. You and the Information Ministry, God willing, should visit these areas to see for yourselves this [word indistinct]. This is the point I wanted to [word indistinct]. Therefore, it is not a north-south battle, nor even a battle between the General People's Congress and the YSP. Rather, it is between the legislative and Constitutional authority on the one hand and the rebels on the other. Some elements of the (?political bureau rebelled) [words indistinct]. This is the situation [words indistinct]. So, back to Arab mediation. When we were asked about Arab troops being sent to disengage the two armies, our response was that there are not two armies or two countries. Rather, there is one country and one constitutional authority, representing constitutional legitimacy versus rebels. [Words indistinct] discussing troops [words indistinct]. If we want so [word indistinct] this is being observed. I will give an example from Europe. In France, there are some rebels in Corsica. The French Government is fighting them, but there are no international troops disengaging the two sides. The same can be said of Ireland and many other states. If now or in the future something takes place against Egyptian authority [words indistinct] separation in Asyut or elsewhere, will we send troops to disengage them and the Egyptian government? Do we want to send disengagement troops between the Algerian Government and those who represent the opposition, for example? If it happens in the United States that Los Angeles, for example, clashes with the official government or security troops, will disengagement troops be sent there? I believe this is a wrong idea. Therefore, we support dialogue. We are ready to accept and welcome all mediation, particularly by sisterly states. However, this is on condition that they distinguish between sending troops, and exchanging views and ideas and proposing solutions. The government is fully prepared to discuss them within the framework that has been approved by the entire Yemeni people, which is the constitution, unity, democracy--not only [word indistinct] democracy, but also political, economic, cultural, and information democracy. In this framework, we welcome all mediation -- strictly within this framework. As for [words indistinct], a brother from the chief of staff command will brief you on the situation from a military point of view. I have a long experience in this field. As you perhaps know, I was an official during the events which were called the 70-day siege in Yemen [words indistinct]. Then, I was the minister of economy [word indistinct] and adviser to brother [name indistinct], may God have mercy on his soul, who was a great citizen, a great nationalist, and a great struggler. We have some experience, but it is not part of my responsibility [words indistinct] to give details. However, I can say one thing. We hear international press reports talking about an advance here, a retreat there, and that the media [sentence incomplete as heard]. We want all our military statements in our media to be credible. We do not want to exaggerate. All figures [words indistinct] and the regions in which we are deployed, I hope will be visited by all correspondents. [sentence indistinct]. We are one people. As President 'Ali 'Abdallah said [words indistinct), we differentiate between a rebellious clique from the YSP and the entire people, who are part of us and our (?blood). We are very sad that we have to kill each other. This is a crime [words indistinct] the brothers in the political leadership of the YSP. This is what I wanted to say. Now I will take your questions. Thank you.
