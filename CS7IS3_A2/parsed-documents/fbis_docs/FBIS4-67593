The German Space Agency, DARA, and DASA have presented the satellite's new instruments and tasks at a news conference in Munich: The science satellite, bearing the name Crista-Spas, is scheduled to begin its "inspection" of the upper earth atmosphere in October this year. Crista-Spas has the job of studying the upper earth atmosphere (10 to 150 km). The photochemical, energetic, and dynamic processes that take place in the upper atmosphere are of great significance to life on earth. An understanding of these processes and the behavior of the atmosphere is central to an understanding of current environmental issues, such as the ozone problem and the much-feared climate problem. The measurements will be performed with two instruments: Crista and Mahrsi. Crista (cryogenic infrared spectrometer and telescope for the atmosphere) is an infrared measuring device with unprecedented three-dimensional resolution: 2.5 km vertical and 500 by 600 km horizontal. It was developed to study small-scale dynamic structures in the upper atmosphere that have hitherto eluded measurement by satellite. Small-scale structures in the several hundred to several thousand kilometer range have only been detected to date by rocket, balloon, or ground measurements. However, these only gave local "snapshots," with the result that very little is known of the frequency of small-scale structures in time and space. Crista will make the first-ever global measurement of these structures and attempt to determine their frequency. The measurements performed by Crista will be complemented by Mahrsi (middle-atmosphere high-resolution spectrograph investigation), a device for measuring radicals in the atmosphere. Mahrsi's main task consists in the global definition of the vertical density profiles of the hydroxyl radical and nitrogen oxide with 2-kilometer resolution at an altitude of 40 to 150 km. The experiment will also provide information as to the neutral density and temperature in the atmosphere. Responsibility for the development of the experiments, the scientific preparations for the mission, and the analysis of the parameters recorded is shared by the Bergland University in Wuppertal (Crista) and the Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, D.C. (Mahrsi). The third Astro-Spas mission is scheduled for the fall of 1995 and will be a second flight by the Orfeus and Imaps telescopes, which are being modified and enhanced in the meantime in the light of experience acquired during their first flight. A fourth mission -- with the Crista/Mahrsi payload -- has been firmly booked for fall 1996.
