Let us not make too much of this Miglio business. I still do not know what is going on, I do not know what he wants to do. I heard that he is annoyed, that he is this, that he is that... Let him decide. If he wants to leave the League, he is free to do so." [Sangiorgio] Mr. Bossi, the professor [Gianfranco Miglio] has announced that he will not vote for the government in the Senate because he was rejected as institutional reforms minister. And he says that you are the traitor. Does that charge not worry you, either? [Bossi] Nonsense; I have not betrayed anyone. Miglio's is an idle argument, not a defense of federalism. And that says a great deal about his anger. [Prime Minister] Berlusconi and [National Alliance leader] Fini would never have granted him that ministry. That is the truth of the matter. [Sangiorgio] What if the government were to fail to gain a vote of confidence, through Miglio's fault? [Bossi] Come, now... Let us not exaggerate. We are short of a majority in the Senate, but I am sure the government will succeed nevertheless. Those people are not stupid. To hold another election could be dangerous to the stability of the country's democratic framework. People want governability. It would be a huge mistake to hold another election. Everyone knows that. You will see that when the time comes to vote in the Senate many representatives of the forces that are attacking us now will do the opposite of what they have said. [Sangiorgio] So you think that, whatever happens, the government will win the confidence vote and the League will lose Miglio? [Bossi] Well, personally, I will be sorry if Miglio leaves, but from the strategic and political viewpoint it changes nothing for the League. The League is a mountain, and if a rock breaks away nobody will notice. [Sangiorgio] What about the friendship, affection, and gratitude that you owe Miglio? [Bossi] Just a moment. I have already told you that I would be sorry from a personal viewpoint, and that is all. My relations with Gianfranco have always been clear and correct. We probably speak no more than once every two months... Yes, there is also some affection; I cannot deny it. I have always liked children and old people. [Sangiorgio] Miglio has always claimed to be your teacher, to have instilled the idea of federalism in you. Have you already forgotten it all, Mr. Bossi? [Bossi] What teacher? That really is not true. Miglio joined the League in 1990, when we were already very strong; we already had 15 regional council seats in Lombardy. [Sangiorgio] Do you not think that you are being too harsh? [Bossi] Look, if somebody makes all this trouble because he is not granted a ministry, he is making a big mistake. I telephoned him last week and found him very angry. And I can understand it. But in politics you cannot permit yourself to take things personally. No, you really cannot. I tried to recommend him for the post, but there was nothing to be done. [Sangiorgio] But Miglio has apparently said that you promised him Institutional Reforms. [Bossi] Nonsense. We of the League never promise anything, and none of us has ever said: I want this or that post. He was the only one to have done so; he asked Berlusconi or Fini, since he knows them. [Sangiorgio] Then what happened? [Bossi] Simple; they both deceived him. [Sangiorgio] Why? [Bossi] What do you mean, "why?" Miglio was an impossibility for that post. Consider Fini: Do you think that the leader of the National Alliance, which needs votes from the South, could want as minister someone who calls southerners "hicks." Fini and Berlusconi did not trust him, and now Miglio is making too much of the issue. He expected too much; Berlusconi probably made him all kinds of empty promises, and now he is venting his anger on me. [Sangiorgio] Will you talk to him before the Senate vote? [Bossi] I do not know, I do not know. Tabladini went to see him yesterday, and he told me that he is still angry. I think, I hope, that he is sufficiently mature to realize on his own where his contentiousness could lead. [Sangiorgio] What if he persists? [Bossi] Then there would be a problem with Miglio in the League. I really do not see how he could vote against this government. [Sangiorgio] Be patient, Mr. Bossi. Is Mr. Miglio not one of the founding fathers of the League? [Bossi] What do you mean by "founding fathers?" [Sangiorgio] The ideologist, one of the linchpins of the movement, one of its members' reference points. [Bossi] Look. He is someone with a special background; he is a teacher, and I have always given him a free rein. But he has never played the devil with me, and he must not start doing so now. I like him, but he must not confuse his battle for federalism with the battle over ministerial posts. I have certain very clear principles, and I hope that he will remember that he has them too. [Sangiorgio] But do you think he is angry partly because you preferred Speroni to him? [Bossi] I do not know. Speroni is an extremely efficient person, who used to travel around a great deal at a time when Miglio was a university teacher. And, as we know, teachers do not achieve much in politics... The federalist objective, which is my plan and the League's plan, does not change if that ministry is entrusted to one person rather than another. There will be a great deal of work to do, and Miglio's knowledge, expertise, and experience will certainly be useful too. I hope that he will be proud to cooperate, to help young Speroni. [Sangiorgio] So, there is a dispute. Who is more stubborn? You or Miglio? [Bossi] How should I know? I can talk to him as a friend, but I also have to think as secretary of the League. He counts for a great deal in the League; he is a likable old fellow. But in the League when someone starts talking about appointments, he becomes less likable. So, remember, my friend: The League is a mountain. The sound of a falling stone is virtually inaudible.
