FR940713-1-00053 FR940713-1-00011 On August 21, 1992, NHTSA published a final rule amending the pneumatic timing requirements of Standard No. 121 with respect to the control signal pressure balance for tractor trailer combinations. (57 FR 37902). The agency added S5.3.5 which specifies a new test procedure for determining the control line pressure differential in converter dollies and trailers designed to tow another trailer equipped with air brakes. Specifically, the rule requires that the pressure differential between the control line input coupling and a 50 cubic inch test reservoir shall not exceed 1 psi at all input pressures between 5 psi and 20 psi and 2 psi at all input pressures greater than 20 psi. Agency research indicates that input pressures below 20 psi represent routine braking applications, input pressures between 20 psi and 40 psi represent moderate to heavy braking applications, and input pressures above 40 psi represent severe braking applications. As explained below, NHTSA is proposing to modify the limit above 40 psi to allow a 5 percent differential (which at higher pressures exceeds the current limit of 2 psi) based on the Society of Automotive Engineer's (SAE's) Recommended Practice SAE J1505, Brake Force Distribution Test Code Commercial Vehicles. The agency explained that the amendment is designed to ensure that the control signal ``passes'' through a towing trailer or dolly without being altered along the way. Since the control signal passes through unaltered, each vehicle in a combination unit receives the same brake control signal. This serves to increase the braking compatibility of combination vehicles since each vehicle in a combination has comparable braking performance. Sealco Petition On June 18, 1993, Sealco Air Controls, Inc. (Sealco), a valve manufacturer, submitted to NHTSA a rulemaking petition to amend Standard No. 121 with respect to the control line pressure differential requirements in S5.3.5. Specifically, it requested that NHTSA amend these requirements to permit the manufacture of its low opening valves that serve to adjust air flow in control lines. These valves are used as control line relay valves and service line relay valves in trailers and converter dollies. The petitioner stated that unlike other relay valves that use a common poppet, 1 the low opening valves have a balanced spool technology 2 that incorporates a low pressure at which the valve initially opens (i.e., crack pressure) of 1.5 psi. According to Sealco, the spool technology enables the valve to track closer between the input control air pressure and the output delivered air pressure. As a result, it claimed that hysteresis 3 is not so prevalent with low operating valves as with the high crack pressure poppet design valves. 1 A rising and falling valve consisting of a disc at the end of a vertically set stem. 2 A valve whose primary means of diverting pressure or flow is through movement of a cylindrical valve mechanism along its axis. 3 The time lag in a system in reacting to changes in the forces affecting it. With respect to braking, the relay valve's output (apply pressure) lags more than a few psi behind ascending control line (treadle) pressure, and stays more than one or two psi above descending control line pressure. Complications may arise when a second brake application is made before the first one is fully released. Hysteresis in a valve may cause the valve not to track (i.e., follow closely) the control line pressure properly, which may cause the brakes in the trailer to lag behind the control signal. For example, when the driver applies the brakes, the valve's hysteresis may not allow the same pressure to be applied to the trailer brakes, which will cause less braking in the trailer and cause the trailer to ``push'' the tractor. Similarly, when the driver releases the brake, the hysteresis in the valve may not allow the brakes in the trailer to be released quickly enough and will still have the brakes applied while the driver is trying to accelerate, causing the kingpin to jerk on the inside of the fifth wheel. On more extreme conditions where the driver goes through several fast brake applications and releases in rapid succession, the jerking and pushing of the trailer or trailers could be difficult to control. Sealco stated that the use of low operating valves would further NHTSA's goal of ensuring balanced braking in combination vehicles. However, the petitioner claimed that while its valve meets the amendment's application requirements, it does not meet the provision requiring release at high pressure ranges, given the valve's mechanics. To comply with the amendment, Sealco has drilled a hole in the valves' piston, thereby allowing pressure to bleed to the supply side. This action prevents the valves from cracking open when tested according to S5.3.5. Sealco believes that this modification to allow compliance with the amendment has reduced the valves' effectiveness. Sealco also criticized the test procedure which it believed did not simulate actual braking conditions. It stated that slow and fast ascending and descending control line pressures should be used to check the valves' ability to respond appropriately. Agency's Decision To Issue Proposal After reviewing the petition, NHTSA has decided to propose an amendment to Standard No. 121 to permit the use of low operating valves. Specifically, the agency is proposing to amend S5.3.5 to account for input pressures over 40 psi. Under the proposal, the pressure differential would not be permitted to exceed 2 psi at any input pressure between 20 psi and 40 psi and it would not be permitted to exceed 5 percent at any pressure over 40 psi. In other words, the pressure differential requirements would remain the same, except for applications resulting in pressures over 40 psi. The agency requests comments about whether the modification to pressure levels over 40 psi is appropriate.
