The condition of the Soviet-type facilities is alarming, Pierer said at the RWE [Rheinisch-Westfaelisches Elektrizitaetswerk] "Energy" Workshop in Braunlage. The safety standard is low and, in addition, the importance of safety is judged differently than in West Europe. In some places, reactors are kept on line even though safety problems would require a shutdown. In addition, spare parts are missing and the operating crews are often unmotivated. Due to the geographic closeness, the European neighbors must be interested in improving the power plants, Pierer said. A German-French alliance could form the core of a European initiative -- for instance, together with the Swedes and the Finnish -- in order to provide financial and technical "help for self-help" to the CIS. Some nuclear power plants must be closed down for good and, therefore, replacements must be established. Pierer said that in this connection, he is primarily thinking of the new construction of conventional gas power plants. In Central and East Europe, there are still 58 Soviet-type nuclear power plants in operation at the moment, 15 of them are of the Chernobyl type. The Siemens director estimates the costs for reequipment at 12-14 billion German marks. However, equipment for only 4 billion marks would have to be imported; the large remaining part could come from CIS production. [passage omitted]
