The provincial budget as well as a Government Work Report by Governor Zhu Senlin will be tabled at a provincial People's Congress which opens in Guangzhou today. In his work report, Mr Zhu is to swear allegiance to the central Government by pledging to implement Beijing's tax reform programme. He will also stick to calls for "sustained, high speed, and healthy" growth of the economy this year, avoiding phrases such as "fast-track growth". The Government will reduce fixed asset investments by 10 per cent and cut down re-investment by enterprises by about 30 per cent, Mr Zhu says in his report. But he vowed to take all means to ensure Guangdong is one step ahead of other provinces in marching towards a market economy. About 800 delegates arrived in Guangzhou yesterday to attend the Second Session of the Eighth Guangdong People's Congress. Although no major personnel changes are expected at the congress, the week-long conclave has been seen as significant as the drastic tax reform, which was considered the centre-piece of this year's economic reform, will face the test. For instance, delegates will be asked to endorse the controversial value-added tax (VAT). According to conference documents, Guangdong and Beijing agreed to a formula on the share of revenue from VAT. Beijing will get 75 per cent while the remaining one-quarter goes to local funds. However, Guangdong will receive a yearly increase of rebate from Beijing to guarantee the local treasury will not suffer under the new package. Moreover, Beijing has also agreed to allow Guangdong to keep its annual increase of financial contribution to the central [authorities] to nine per cent. This was despite the fact that Guangdong achieved a 56.42 per cent increase of government revenue last year. The tax arrangements have been seen as concessions made by the central authorities to the southern province, which had earlier been widely seen as the worst-hit region under the tax reform. According to the Governmenl Work Report, the economic growth rate for 1994 has been set at 15 per cent. The national target adopted by the central Government for this year is nine per cent. Industrial output is expected to rise 21 per cent while the province's agriculture will grow at five per cent. While Guangdong's social retail index--a key indicator of inflation--jumped 18.2 per cent last year, the Governor is hoping to keep the figure below 12 per cent this year. Mr Zhu will also give a rundown of the glowing success of his province last year and ask the delegates for their support in pushing ahead the reform agenda, especially the new tax reform package. Three areas--runaway fixed investment, neglect of agriculture by the government, and inflation have been singled out for concern this year. The report says fixed assets investments increased 58.5 per cent reaching a staggering 146.1 billion yuan (about HK$130 billion) last year. Damages by deluge and typhoon also cost the province as much as 1 billion yuan last year. "The third [problem] is a relatively large increase of inflation. The social retail price index rose 18.2 per cent over the previous year," the report says. However, Mr Zhu's report made no mention of a series of industrial accidents in Shenzhen last year, killing more than 100 people. The report also has little to say on the chronic problem of inflation. Prices of grain went up by more than 40 per cent in Guangzhou last November. The surge of prices has prompted the central Government to re-impose price control in major cities. Last night the China News Service reported that the State Planning Commission and the State Administration of Taxation had recently issued a joint directive ordering the authorities to maintain stable prices following the implementation of tax reform. Meanwhile, a tight budget is to be delivered by top finance official at the Guangdong conclave. According to a report to be tabled by head of the Bureau of Finance, Zeng Bingsheng, total revenue for the Government last year reached 34.6 billion yuan, 11.1 billion up from the previous year. That represented a 56.4 per cent increase. Mr Zeng is to tell delegates that Guangdong is unlikely to suffer under the new tax scheme. The provincial Government is expected to have a 9.89 per cent real increase of revenue this year.
