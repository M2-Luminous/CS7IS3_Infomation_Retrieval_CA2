General Department of Taxation (GDT) officials told the weekly Vietnam Investment Review (VIR) that they were planning to introduce the procedure to halt income-tax dodging by expatriates. "Currently, there's no coordination at all and many foreign businessmen slip through without any tax payment," the GDT's Truong Chi Trung was quoted as saying. He did not say when the plan would be put in place. Trung said GDT would also like to work with banks operating in Vietnam to achieve tighter control over the repatriation of profits overseas. "So far, we have no idea who sends what," he told VIR. Trung said loopholes in tax-collection procedures were costing Vietnam massive revenue losses. Foreign-invested enterprises nonetheless paid 5.5 trillion dong (511 million dollars) in taxes last year, nearly twice as much as in 1992.
