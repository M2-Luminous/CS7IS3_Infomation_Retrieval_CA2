Do you reaffirm this view? [Belmont] Yes, I reaffirm my statements. Taken out of context, their terms may sound very confrontational; but within the context of an explanation, each has its logic. [Pedraglio] Do you believe that without funds of its own Lima's municipality can carry out projects by simply coordinating with the district authorities, as the central government representatives asserted in rationalizing DL 776? [Belmont] According to the government representatives, something that has been working rather well--and the proof is that I was elected to continue carrying out works projects--does not work. They say that it is not technical and that it is not fair because it does not distribute the benefits equitably...and they pull a figure out of a hat, wave it, then clam up. They practically issue the order to dynamite Lima. It is, as I term it, the biggest of all attempts, one that nobody can justify. And now, everyone has grown silent. They accuse me of pursuing electoral ends. But no one can defend stripping a municipal administration's budget of 44,887,900 soles, by a mere stroke of the pen. [Pedraglio] That is a reduction from 64 million soles to 19 million, as I read it. [Belmont] In one round. And from 144,359,000 for the Invermet project I have been slashed to 17 million, also in one round. Half of that 144 million was to have been invested in new urban settlements. [Pedraglio] Why do you think Fujimori supported your candidacy a year ago? [Belmont] Fujimori did not support me. Fujimori had a candidate named Pablo Gutierrez. When the results of the polls were submitted to Fujimori--the same polls also rated me--Pablo Gutierrez was summoned to the Government House and told, "You must withdraw." Pablo Gutierrez asked, "Why?" And the answer was, "Because you are going to lose." The Administration had decided to pull its candidate out of the race so as to not be on the losing side. It had begun comparing the views of the two contenders. Those views obviously gave it the answer it was seeking, a week or 10 days in advance, as to which of the two was likely to win. [Pedraglio] Do you believe that the executive branch's behavior--including that of the president, of course--is owing to its viewing you as a potential adversary in the 1996 presidential elections? [Belmont] That is plain as day to the taxi drivers, the household help in the homes I visit, the civil construction workers...and even to the kids. They are all aware that Fujimori is jealous of anyone who could overshadow him. In Lima, he never got more than 26 percent of the vote, and in each of two elections I have scored 48 percent. [Pedraglio] The government has said that the bulk of available funding has heretofore been centralized in Lima to the detriment of the rest of the country's municipalities, and that its intent is to decentralize those funds so as to benefit the small districts, the little urban centers. What is your view of this argument? [Belmont] I have already said, on one occasion--laughing at that attitude--that this was the national dirty-tricks government, the leg-puller of all of us Peruvians who have seen history unfurl before us and who have lived it and taken part in it. Lima's municipality is not a rich one. It is a very poor one. Its budget is one twentieth that of Bogota. As a candidate, Pablo Gutierrez said, "If I am elected mayor, I shall have money to provide water, electricity, and sewers, and to finish the Santa Anita market, and I shall complete more construction projects than all the other previous mayors together." One can legitimately wonder whether, had he won, the government would have acted in the same way. [Pedraglio] Do you regret having taken a favorable position on 5 April toward Fujimori's decision to dissolve Parliament, and toward everything else he did? [Belmont] I must again point out that memories are very faulty. I issued a statement approved by Lima's Metropolitan Council in which I deplored the break with the constitutional order and earnestly hoped for its early restoration. But interviews taking on a political turn, as they sometimes do, the next question was, "What do you think of Parliament?" I answered that Parliament was a disaster, good for nothing, in the belief--shared by thousands of Peruvians--that a democratic Parliament would be created within the shortest possible time, that would be much closer to the people, more austere, and more dynamic. That is what I urged. And this I will admit: I believed in the good faith of the government. I understood the government's position because I have my own municipal parliament to deal with. And as it is designed, the city's "executive branch," the mayor, is unable to function unless he is backed by a majority and a consensus. The city retrogressed badly during my initial term, because of the considerable resistance I encountered in the "municipal parliament." I could see that I, too, would have welcomed a change in the municipal parliamentary structure; but, as written and published in all the newspapers of 23 April 1992, I was never in agreement with the break away from the constitutional order. But I did believe in President Fujimori. I acknowledge that. I saw in him a man who was acting pragmatically in areas in which I would have done the same. [Pedraglio] In which areas, for example? [Belmont] In that of social reinsertion, in privatization--but not in the way he has now done it. That way is not the most elegant, to say the least. [Pedraglio] At what point were you no longer convinced of the government's orientation? At what point did you say "this is not working?" [Belmont] When he won his second election. Because I noted that the government became very touchy about my very high standing in the polls. The government was already cooking up his reelection, but I did not know that. No one knew it. Then they started talking about a new Constitution. I did not lean toward a yes. Instead, I published a very harsh commentary that leaned toward a no. I maintained an impartial position as a mayor, but from a municipal viewpoint, I pointed out the reasons that put all local governments at risk. It was at that point that I realized the danger of the octopus. [Pedraglio] You had a critical opinion of the previous Parliament. Do you believe that the present one is better? [Belmont] No. It is worse. That is why I am frustrated. This is a Parliament designed to have Fujimori reelected, so that he can push through the laws he chooses to. It is simply a Parliament of puppets. The opposition is painted on the walls. And I feel that I was mistaken in putting too much faith in the people. [Pedraglio] Do you think Fujimori is going to easily relinquish power in 1995? [Belmont] No. It is going to be very difficult. It has been very well thought out. One who intends to run a clean election, as president, answers the questions asked by the press. But he does not mock, he does not go around acting like an adolescent, he does not delegate whatever is not to his advantage, he does not inaugurate things, day after day, that are beneath the dignity of a president.... There is only one player on the stage. In my view, the drug of power has converted him into an addict who has no intention of abjuring what I call the morphine of power. [Pedraglio] You have said that you are not going to run for office. In sports terms: Is this a feint or for real? [Belmont] No, no, no. This is for real. I do not intend to stand. But I do intend to remain in my role as the elected mayor and defend the municipal charter to the bitter end. It is only since I became a potential candidate that I have had all these problems. Between 1990 and 1993, the president lauded my works projects. He consistently complimented me. He would ask me, "How do you do it, Ricardo?" He would accompany me to view them. But at the most recent project inauguration, to which I invited him--and, I might say, his name has figured on all the dedication plaques; I was not interested in having my name figure on them--I noted in his gaze that he was already seeking a candidate for Lima. He had told me on many occasions that he saw no other candidate who could compete with me, with so many public works. But a month and a half before elections, he telephoned me at home to give me orders, to tell me that I must rescind some specified taxes because he was not in agreement with them. I replied: "Mr. President, I am the mayor. I am grateful for your suggestion, but leave it to me to decide." He did not like that, and in one blow he annulled one of the vehicle taxes I was about to announce. At that point I realized that the president wanted to govern Lima. Subsequently, I submitted the bill of a new organic law of municipalities to him that would enable Lima to operate under the next mayor to be elected. At that time, it was not my intention to stand, but I did feel that whoever did stand should have the easements that I did not have. He received the bill, thanked me for it, and in the end I believe he must have said to himself, "I am going to implement this plan without Belmont." I thanked him for his frankness.... [Pedraglio] Why? [Belmont] He suggested to me that I withdraw, that I not run for election. I had told him, "Mr. President, I am an independent...." [Pedraglio] When did that happen? [Belmont] About two months before the elections; more or less in November 1992. He was very courteous to me in this regard. But he already wanted to control all areas. [Pedraglio] When you spoke of supporting an independent candidate, did you have in mind Perez de Cuellar? [Belmont] He is the man who could beat the president, on the basis of a very precisely detailed governing platform that would deliver what it promised. [Pedraglio] What would you consider the basic lines of a government platform? [Belmont] First, an economic program. One cannot promise to deliver an antishock economy and proceed to deliver a shock instead, an economy that has forgotten the mass sectors and has made the rich richer and the poor poorer. The program would all have to be studied by a team of economists, in order to tell the Peruvians, the many unemployed and the many underemployed, that from the day the next party takes office, the rules of the game will be these, and will not change. The platform would also provide that whoever takes office as head of the government and fails to keep his or her word will fare as the presidents of other countries do. They must resign immediately for having lied to the people. A president's lie in the Middle East, and in the United States as well, entails his immediate resignation. Here, instead, presidents, members of Parliament, politicians, lie, but they complain when a political group commits an act--which I do not justify-in the face of powerlessness stemming from so many lies. The liars themselves are the root cause of such occurrences, because they have lied so much. That is all there is to it. [Pedraglio] Of the independents, today, Perez de Cuellar appears to be the best positioned, objectively speaking. [Belmont] Basically, I do not believe in polls. [Pedraglio] Thus, I could not infer that if you were to support an independent capable of beating Fujimori, Perez de Cuellar would be your best choice as of today. [Belmont] Perez de Cuellar is one of this country's highly eminent assets. Peru would immediately gain international respect and that of all the Peruvians, for what he represents. But I would not be part of the ticket, nor would I accept a position in the government. On the contrary, I would announce my retirement from Peruvian politics. That says it all. [Pedraglio] But could you, as you have stated it, support him? [Belmont] I would support the ideas posited by Mario Vargas Llosa, as I did in his time. I have been frank enough to say, "Gentlemen, if I were president I would do what Vargas Llosa has said he will accomplish." He had an emergency social platform, he was initiating a serious privatization process, he was opening the economy to a free-market one.... That platform was supported by three master beams which I applauded. What we Peruvians need at this stage is to agree on a master plan. But I would like for the person who assumes responsibility for its implementation, as the representative of those majorities--and I do not want to be that person; I sincerely believe that I am not cut out for these things; I have given six years of my life to public service and I now want to return to my own work, my business affairs, my personal life, for strictly family reasons--but I would like that person to be one of known qualifications, not a new arrival, appearing from one day to the next with rabbits under his hat, inventing government along the way. I would like that person to be one who is prepared to accept a serious commitment to the country and to the solution of the problems that we all see and that have not been resolved for the past many years. And the person best meeting these conditions is Perez de Cuellar, because of his record. I would like to see him representing Peru so as to bring dirty-tricks government to an end. [Pedraglio] It is said that you are trapped by the Channel 11 thing, and that if you were to run for election, your opponents would bring out some things.... [Belmont] Then, let them bring them out once and for all. There is no dirt. On the contrary, I have proven to be an entrepreneur who builds his enterprise on the basis of human capital, with a broad stockholder base in which 70,000 persons participate, who invests all of his money in fixed assets that today are enabling Channel 11 to transmit and compete head-on--not as a monopoly--with the television monsters, which have lost much more money than Channel 11 has lost. On the contrary, the government should reward me for having survived two crises: that of Alan Garcia and that of Fujimori, with its brutal recession that has forced the sale of one of the biggest television enterprises, Channel 4, to the Mexicans, because Channel 4 could no longer survive. Channel 11, on the other hand, with all its faults and mistakes, has made no profit, but it is solid as a rock because it owes nothing to anyone, and because its economic base is entirely shipshape. [Pedraglio] Is the enterprise's relationship with that broad base of shareholders really operative? [Belmont] Of course it is. We hold stockholders meetings. We hold them publicly. The problem is that in this country, success is prohibited. Channel 11 is always present on the screen. It has never gone dark in its seven years on the air. Moreover, I would not have been elected if I were a swindler, a man who had defrauded his contingency. I have 70,000 partners, and if we multiply each family by five... If I have won the elections that I have, it is because my partners voted for me, as did others who were not partners, of course. Furthermore, I am certain that if I issue a new block of shares in Channel 11, the number of my partners will exceed 1 million. [Pedraglio] What is the basis of the suit that you have announced will be brought by the municipality against the government? [Belmont] My lawyers are looking into it. It is the first case of this type, in which government sues government. Generally speaking, throughout history, the government has been a great ally of the mayor. My team of lawyers, accredited by the Lima Bar Association, is presently studying the legal aspects of the action.
