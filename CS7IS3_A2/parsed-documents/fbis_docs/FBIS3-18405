Ruehe was commenting to the CDU/CSU [Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union] Bundestag group in Bonn today on the shooting down of four Serb aircraft by U.S. fighters over Bosnia-Herzegovina. Peace could only be achieved if the decisions made by the United Nations were implemented. The Serb aircraft had violated the UN no-fly zone. Ruehe described it as "right" that German soldiers had been on board the AWACS reconnaisance aircraft during the mission. He said he was satisfied that the German Government had decided in favor of the participation of German soldiers in the reconnaisance flights.
