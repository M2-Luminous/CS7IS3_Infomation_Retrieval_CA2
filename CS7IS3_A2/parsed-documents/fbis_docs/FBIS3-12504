FBIS3-12504 "drnes041_o_94002" FBIS-NES-94-041 Document Type:Daily Report 2 Mar 1994 SYRIA TISHRIN Says Israel Responsible for `All Crimes' JN0103125994 Damascus SANA in Arabic 0820 GMT 1 Mar 94 JN0103125994 Damascus SANA Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [Text] Damascus, 1 Mar (SANA)--The newspaper TISHRIN has stressed that in light of the serious Israeli escalation, it is natural for the Arab delegations to view the talks as a waste of time and to agree on the need to assess the situation and place the international community and the cosponsors of the peace process before their responsibilities. The paper says that the Arabs have done everything to render the Washington talks successful. They have offered the establishment of a just, comprehensive, and durable genuine peace in the Middle East. However, Israel's response has always been the intensification of the settlement activity, arming of settlers, and urging them to commit crimes and destroy Arab property and houses. The paper explains that the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and the subsequent events are the natural outcome of the Rabin government's policy of arming settlers and deploying armed settler patrols throughout the occupied territories. The Rabin government has ignored their crimes and threats to expel the Arabs from their homeland en masse. In the same vein, the Rabin government expanded settlements and allocated large funds from the U.S. loan guarantees to build new settlements. It also forced the Palestinian side to accept keeping the settlements in Gaza and Jericho, where they will act as hotbeds of aggression and a sword brandished against the Palestinians. TISHRIN says that Israel is responsible for all crimes and for the obstruction of the Washington talks. The international community is dutybound to protect the Palestinian people against Zionist terrorism. It should compel Israel to comply with the requirements of peace so that peace may prevail. Such requirements necessitate full withdrawal by both the army and settlers from the occupied Arab territories. For its part, AL-BA'TH stresses in a commentary that the campaigns of denunciation of the occupation's crimes and glaring hostility to peace cannot be useful unless these campaigns are translated into practical pressures to curb Israel's defiance of the international community, which is looking forward to peace in this region. The paper says: Therefore, practical steps must be taken to prompt the Rabin government to declare its explicit compliance with the bases of the peace process, so that the bilateral talks may resume. The paper stresses that otherwise, the peace efforts will continue to revolve in a vicious circle and the occupation crimes will continue indefinitely. AL-THAWRAH indicates that the sinful hands that shed the blood of our children and brothers in occupied Palestine and Lebanon are the same hands. Moreover, the fingers and even the fingerprints are the same. The paper says that even police dogs could trace the perpetrator and the criminal who masterminded the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and the explosion at the Sayyidat al-Najat Church in Lebanon. In a comment, the paper asks: Besides condemnation and denunciation, what will the international community do to stop the Zionists' crimes? What will it do to curb this racist Nazi Zionist ghoul? The paper says that the UN Security Council has an opportunity now to prove that it is truly a council for defending the security of those who need it. The UN Security Council should defend the defenseless Palestinian people from the ferocious and horrible Israeli machine of aggression, the paper notes. The UN Security Council's responsibility today is immense, historic, crucial, and doubled. The paper adds that the UN Security Council faces major challenges, especially with regard to safeguarding the peace process, at whose tables Israel is committing peace massacres that are not less appalling than its bloody massacres. It has a responsibility toward protecting the Palestinian people against the Zionist terrorism. The biggest responsibility and the biggest challenge is to safeguard the entire international security against the dangers of Zionism and racism, which thrive on rivers of blood.
