FBIS4-31004 "dreeu106__a94016" FBIS-EEU-94-106-A Daily Report 31 May 1994 ANNEX Czech Republic ODS Favors One-Round Elections for Senate ODS Favors One-Round Elections for Senate AU0106100994 Prague CTK in English 1502 GMT 31 May 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU0106100994 Prague CTK English BFN [Text] Prague, May 31 (CTK) -- The 15-percent maximum difference in the population of the Senate constituencies is as acceptable as the 27-percent difference for the ODS (Civic Democratic Party), Libor Novak, an ODS deputy, told journalists at a press conference of the ODS Deputies Group today. The elections to the Senate, the not-yet established upper chamber of the Czech Parliament, will take place probably in the autumn, along with local elections. The Senate is to have 81 deputies, one-third of which will be alternated every two years. It is an "administrative" rather than political matter, Novak added. Novak was alluding to the debate on the authenticity of the presented bill, in which some deputies, including those from the coalition parties, pointed to the fact that the government draft bill included 15-percent difference and was more in line with the equal electoral right embedded in the Constitution, while the bill submitted to the parliament included the 27-percent difference. The ODS considers the order of the constituencies, whose list should be included in a supplement to the law on parliamentary elections, an administrative issue, Novak said. The order is decisive in determining in which constituencies senators will be elected for two, four or six years in the first senatorial elections. However, the ODS considers the biggest possible "fragmentation" of the constituencies ideal because it believes this would help minimize cases in which senators in several adjacent constituencies would be elected for the same term of office, Novak added. The ODA will support the one-round variant for the senatorial elections which is based on the principle of a relative majority (the British system), Novak reported. The two-round system, proposed by the bill, is also acceptable for the ODS, he added. No ODS deputy will vote for the abolishment of the Senate, Novak said. However, Jiri Honajzer, chairman of the ODS deputies group, admitted that only about half of the ODS deputies supported the Senate elections.
