The main target of the attack was the crowded market, where there was an enormous amount of destruction and many casualties, mostly women and children. Regrettably, the international community has not yet paid appropriate attention to the policy of bombing peaceful communities that the Azerbaijanis have followed since 1992, which has given the Azerbaijani authorities free rein to continue such operations with impunity. By such savage operations, Azerbaijan is reiterating that it has not foregone its policy of state terrorism against the people of the NKR, the aim of which is to annihilate the civilian population in gross violation of international law, particularly the Geneva Convention. This policy is designed to expand the conflict and undermine the recently instituted peace initiatives. The Armenian Republic's Supreme Council declares that the Azerbaijani side will bear full responsibility for any such operations. It calls on the UN secretary general, the CSCE, the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly, the Europarliament, and the parliaments of the world to strongly condemn these military operations against civilians and to take effective and urgent measures as envisaged by international law to prevent the further bombing of communities and to end the unacceptable behavior by the Azerbaijani Republic.
