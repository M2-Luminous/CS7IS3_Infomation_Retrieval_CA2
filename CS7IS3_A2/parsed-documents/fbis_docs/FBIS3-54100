First of all, good morning to all of you. On the basis of an invitation from the General People's Congress [GPC] secretariat, I have come to attend this opening session. However, my fear is that foreign journalists and some observers might think that the GPC is a parliament and that I am a president. They are used to the traditional protocol whereby the head of state chairs the opening session of parliament. [passage omitted] Regrettably, there are those who purposely practice blackouts on the people's authority and the people's direct democracy as part of the war against small peoples' aspirations and their attempts to liberate themselves, and as a way of belittling peoples by insisting that only big powers can impose their views, and that anything other than that is dictatorship. There are some hirelings who are paid to write and talk with a view to smearing people's authority. [passage omitted] Other countries should take this experiment from us and benefit from it by learning from the Libyan people. Instead, they ridicule us from their arrogant, imperialist, and disdainful stands. Normally, they should encourage a small people seeking liberation. On the contrary, they are hostile to the Libyan people and deride their experiment, so much so that they do not talk about the people's congresses. You have journalists here. Wait and see what they will write. They will not refer to the people's congresses and the people's authority. First, they will say the Libyan parliament. Then, some will say people's committees, and this is very deceitful. [passage omitted] We are exposing the rancor and ill intentions of the Western colonialist powers and their lackeys, the hireling newspapers and agent rulers. We just want to expose them so that the people will read these newspapers and listen to the radios and laugh at them--the Voice of America, for example, when it says al-Qadhdhafi the dictator. This is a great country, supposed to be respectable, and peoples are expected to listen to its radio. When a Libyan listens to the Voice of America he falls on his back laughing when he hears it talk about al-Qadhdhafi, the Libyan dictator. Thank God, this is a privilege and a blessing enjoyed by us Libyans in this country--love and brotherhood, and this is the unbeatable force with which we face up to the enemies. They have now realized that for Libya to be defeated, several million people, four or five million Libyans must first be defeated, one by one. But in other countries, if they topple a president then that is it, perhaps the people... [pauses] or they could incite a people against a president, or cause the defeat of a party in elections, forge elections and bring in another party against it, involve people in the farce of pluralism, bring economic pressure to bear against them, and threaten them militarily so as to cause the fall of a ruler, a government, or a party. [passage omitted] This would not exist in Libya where there is no foundation for it, because in Libya there is neither party, nor sect, nor ruler, nor government. These facts give strength to the Libyan side. They give us determination and self-confidence that we will win in any confrontation, and they undermine the will of the enemies. [passage omitted] We are determined to enter into a confrontation and we are 100 percent confident in victory in the end, no matter how long the battle may be, and it should be long. [applause] [passage omitted] We would have thought, after the insignificant Reagan, that the American administration--the current republic or democracy--we, and all reasonable people, would have thought that, had there been a conscience in this world, America would apologize to the Libyan people and to the families of the innocent victims--children and women in Benghazi and Tripoli--that it would give compensation to those who accept it, and be sorry for all its life toward the Libyans and mankind for having committed a horrible barbaric massacre against children in 1986. On the contrary, here they are, forgetting all this and pursuing us again, threatening us, laying siege to us, and seeking more human victims. This means that conscience is dead. This is a dangerous moral decline in the world and in big powers. [passage omitted] They are holding us responsible for Lockerbie--the Pan-Am crash--as if our sons who died in 1986 were mice, and your sons are human beings. What is our link with an airplane that crashed in the North Pole? Even if we did this, they should still be ashamed and keep quiet. They should say: we killed the Libyans' sons in their sleep. It was a mistake. Reagan was crazy and insignificant. He did a great deal of harm to the American reputation in the world. He committed a horrible crime that made America speechless and very embarrassed. Let us turn a blind eye to Lockerbie even if the Libyans are behind it. Despite the fact that we did not do it, they are still after us. They are holding us responsible no matter what. [passage omitted] The UN Security Council asked Libya to cooperate with a French investigation and Libya expressed its readiness to cooperate with the French investigation and informed France. France refused the investigation out of solidarity and linked the UTA issue to the Lockerbie question. What is the link between UTA in Niger and Pan-Am at Lockerbie? France does not want a solution and took a stance which contradicts that of the UN Security Council. If there were a real UN Security Council which was not under Western hegemony, it would meet and pass a resolution against France, declare Libya not guilty, and drop this aspect from the resolutions and the issue, considering that Libya has fulfilled its commitments toward France and it is the latter that refused. After that the council would have to condemn France. [passage omitted] Yesterday, Dr. Swire, the chairman of the Association of the Lockerbie Airliner Victims, made a proposal and said that The Hague was an approriate place for the trial, and should the English want to hold this trial, let them move to The Hague. This is the chairman of the Lockerbie victims association who said this. They are telling the world: We, the U.S. and UK Governments, are under pressure from the Lockerbie victims association, at a time when the chairman of the Lockerbie victims association is saying before the world: I am not obstinately attached to a trial in Scotland, and even The Hague is an appropriate place. So, their argument is no longer valid. Should someone claim responsibility for Lockerbie now, they would not be able to recognize their mistake. Because they have already involved the Security Council against Libya, it would not be able to deal with an unidentified criminal. Let us suppose that one person was involved in the Pan-Am explosion over Lockerbie, they would obliterate all the facts, because this would put them in a very embarrassing position. How could the Security Council be involved in an issue because it was told that a country was behind it, and all of sudden an unidentified person claims responsibility for this act? How could the Security Council issue resolutions against this person? Would it deprive him of spare parts? Would it break off diplomatic relations with him, with Carlos for example? The Security Council would become a joke in this case. Consequently, no matter how much evidence there might be, the Security Council would not heed them, on the orders of the Western countries, so that they would not get into difficulties in front of the world. It must be Libya. Even if another country were proved to be involved, they would not admit it. It must be Libya. This is what made the Libyan people angry; this is what made them revolt, and prepare for confrontation. This issue has become one of defiance, confrontation, and blatant injustice which can only be met with resistance. [passage omitted] There is yet another factor that had prompted the Libyan people to engage in revolution. Now they are saying that the Libyan people are escalating the crisis, al-Qadhdhafi is escalating the crisis. Indeed we have been more patient than Job. There is a saying which says: Job's patience is adoration of God, and a fools' patience is silly. We have been patient for a long time, and it is you [the West] that are escalating the crisis. [passage omitted] After all this patience, perseverance, give and take, our brandishing an olive branch, cordiality, and even courting of the Western states, they surprised us with Resolution 883 or I do not know which number. Then they say the Libyans are escalating the crisis. But why you are escalating the crisis? What do you want? Yesterday, the UN commissioner told our foreign secretary: you are escalating, and this is unsettling. But you, for your part, are not you escalating? Very nice, you want us to retreat while you escalate the crisis. So long as there is escalation we must face up to escalation, and so long as there is confrontation we must face up to confrontation. The Libyan people have been wronged and must confront and resist wrongdoing. [applause] What made the Libyan people angry too was something at the pan- Arab level. Brothers, these days we are hearing a slogan being raised and we are required to carry it out. It is very grave. It is the slogan of land for peace. This is the gravest slogan. This misleads the revolution from Syria to Mauritania, not just in Libya. O Arabs, the slogan of land for peace is grave. It means that it legitimizes and permits occupation for the realization of other objectives: you occupy land and then pose the condition you want. If you meet their condition they give you the land back. This is very serious. [passage omitted] This is the gravest of slogans. The slogan of land for peace is the gravest of slogans and it must be torn up even at the price of millions of Arabs and a sea of blood. This slogan should be torn asunder. It is a very serious slogan as far as the future of the Arab nation is concerned. Land for peace? First, according to the UN Charter acquisition of land by force is not permitted. Therefore, the Jews have no right to occupy Sinai or the Golan or southern Lebanon. They should withdraw from these territories unconditionally. This was approved by the world from the first day--the world said that there should be an unconditional withdrawal. The withdrawal from Sinai, the Golan, and southern Lebanon has no connection at all with the question of Palestine. They should withdraw from Egyptian territories unconditionally; the enemy should withdraw from the territories of Syria, otherwise Syria should fight this enemy to make it withdraw unconditionally--either Syria fights this enemy or this enemy withdraws from Syrian territories. This has no relation whatever with recognition at all. The same applies to southern Lebanon. With regard to the West Bank, this is part of Jordan. Gaza is part of Egypt. In 1967 some Egyptian territories were occupied--Sinai including Gaza. Gaza belongs to Egypt. Throughout the years it belonged to Egypt. It was not Palestinian land before 1967. It is Egyptian territory. The West Bank belongs to Jordan as far as the armistice line. It was occupied when it was Jordanian territory in 1967. The same thing applies to the Golan--it is Syrian territory which was occupied. Therefore it is the right of Syria, Jordan, and Egypt to unconditionally retrieve their territories because they were occupied by force. They will be supported in this by the entire world. It is serious when someone deliberately intends to occupy your land in order to impose conditions on you. This is very serious. The Palestinian question has not been solved; no one has touched it, either in Gaza, or in Jericho, or anywhere else. Jericho is a spot in the West Bank and the latter belongs to Jordan and was occupied in 1967. Jordan has the right to demand unconditionally all its territories which were occupied in 1967. Syria should insist on the return of the Golan unconditionally. This has no connection whatsoever with the Palestinian question because the Palestinian question existed and the struggle for it existed long before the occupation of the Golan. Sinai was occupied while the Palestinian question was in existence; the question had no connection whatever with the occupation of Sinai. The Palestinian question has existed since 1948 and before, while Sinai and the Golan were occupied in 1967. Lebanon was occupied recently--in 1982, or what? Yesterday they occupied southern Lebanon. It has nothing to do with the question of Palestine. Tomorrow they may say: who has not recognized us? Libya, Algeria, Iraq, Sudan, and so on. They have not recognized us. All right, go and occupy part of their territories. Land for peace--we give you your land which we occupied and you establish peace with us. This is very serious. I am astonished--and I call on the Ba'th Party which is ruling Syria--this pan-Arab party for the sake of which people were imprisoned and young people lost their future in the 1960's, while people died for it; it used to be the party raising the banner of Arab nationalism. It was the one which fought in Palestine. It is not possible that the end of the Syrian Ba'th Party would be recognition of Israel in exchange for the Golan. The Golan should be returned either through the United Nations or through war. The Syrian people have the right to fight to recover the Golan. [passage omitted] The Libyan people are ready to embark upon a long battle. By God, even if we all die we will not accept this injustice; we do not accept land for peace or the recognition of Israel at all. We recognize the democratic Palestinian State which encompasses Jews and Arabs. Israel is an innovation which we do not know, the Israeli world does not exist in geography. [passage omitted]. Brother ambassadors, tell the rulers who now are racing to embrace Israelis and please the West that they might regret it; perhaps America will blow up like the Soviet Union and you might get up one morning and not find it there. Anything is possible to God, and he can do this. We only believe in God who has the power. [applause] You might get what happened to those who were worshipping Moscow and were saying: The great Soviet Union, the red universe, the red flag will cover the earth and there is nothing but Marxism-Leninism. The god of the Soviet Union died; the poor people became orphans looking for someone to protect them. They asked for God's forgiveness saying that they were not communists. [passage omitted] Have no fear as your enemy, in the first place, is an exploiting capitalist who will collapse. Do not say that this enemy is on the ascendant. The enemy is descending. It is on its deathbed. The entire West is experiencing death. It is covered with a thick cover but it is collapsing from within. [passage omitted ] Your enemy is made of glass and will break and destroy itself. There is now a struggle for Serbia. They are divided over Serbia. It may appear to be a dangerous struggle and break-up in Europe over Serbia, beginning with Bosnia-Herzegovina. Naturally the issue does not concern Bosnia-Herzegovina. All the others are in agreement regarding the liquidation of the Muslims. All of them--Russia, America, and so on --have decided not to recognize a Muslim people in Europe; Europe is 100 percent Christian--this is what they have decided. As for the Arabs, they should accept a Jewish state in Muscat and a racist Israeli state at that, armed with nuclear weapons. America is pursuing North Korea and says to it: We should inspect your installations; you should not have nuclear weapons. Why does not America pursue the Israelis who have more than 200 nuclear warheads? These are the things which make the Libyan people angry. He who does not become angry is without conscience; he is a slave. Anyone seeing this arrogance would get angry. Is it logical to see them pursuing Korea and leaving the Israelis? They should pursue all those who have nuclear weapons. Look at the racist policy. When they saw South Africa becoming a black country, they began to [word indistinct] its nuclear capability. When the whites had that country they turned a blind eye to it although they knew that it was about to manufacture nuclear weapons. [passage omitted] Recently they came to Egypt and said that that country should sign a treaty banning the manufacturing of chemical weapons. Egypt told them that the Israelis have not signed anything, not even the treaty banning the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and now you are asking us to sign the treaty banning the manufacture of chemical weapons. I do not sign. If there is a state most feared by the Israelis it is Egypt. Egypt was the first Arab state to recognize the Israelis and so on, but the real cultural defiance felt by Egypt is not felt by any other Arab country. Egypt knows that along its border there is a traditional enemy. [passage omitted] Take American justice and this young man Clinton; he is a good man and a man of peace--he does not hate anyone in the world, but the poor man must believe the policies the Americans are involving us in when they tell him to go after Libya, or Korea, or wherever, because they have nuclear weapons. Who believes him if he does not pursue the Israelis? No matter how good he may be, the poor man is the victim of the imperialist policy; they treat him as they did Kennedy. They may get rid of this poor man as they did Kennedy. If he does not go along with them they will get rid of him. The CIA, the American Central Intelligence Agency--I hope someone brave will come along one day and disband and destroy it. It is this that sabotaged the world; this notorious agency has brought the United States into disrepute and the whole world into disrepute. It has undermined the world. It is like woodworm and poison. It played havoc with governments and regimes and the economy, the dollar, and currencies and everything. It is behind the undermining of the entire world. One hopes that a brave man will come along and do something and deliver America and the American people and the world of this nightmare called CIA. It has spread its nets everywhere. You are aware of all this. Your sons might be among those caught in these nets. Everyone in this whole world is worried about his children lest they get caught in the CIA's nets. The CIA is like a deadly disease. The CIA forges money, the dollar, and the currencies of the whole world. It has long arms and it has devilish plots. [passage omitted] How can Clinton escape from it, the poor man? How can he free himself of it, no matter how good a man he may be or how much he is a man of peace? How can he get rid of this nightmare short of dissolving it? If he did this, he would be able to breathe easy. There are some imperialist quarters which are very, very dangerous and against freedom and peace. They are to be found in America and the West and are more powerful than Clinton, more powerful than his administration, and more powerful than anyone who loves peace. If Abraham Lincoln or George Washington came back to life they would be powerless unless they destroyed and dismantled these nightmares. [passage omitted] The same applies to America. If the National Security Council is not dismantled, and the White House which is like the Kremlin and the CIA which is like the KGB, no one, not the American people, will be liberated. What kind of freedom is this when they have these organizations? It is all lies if they say that have a free people, a free press. It is all lies. These claims are continually made by the West. They are the dictatorial regimes. Yet they accuse us of dictatorship. Generally, they are beating the drums of confrontation with us. And not only with the Libyan people but with all the East. They are getting ready for a crusade. You must know that, after the end of communism, they decided to terminate Islam, the East, and the Arab nation. That is the gist of it. They changed their tactics. They were confronting the Soviet Union, confrontation in Berlin, and now it has shifted to Rome. It has become North and South. It has become East and West. The East means the Islamic East--that is, the Arabs, or rather the Arabs first. The front line is the Arabs. The Arabs must be attacked and destroyed. Afterward they will go deep into Asia and all those countries. All their actions and their "Satanic Verses" have a great significance. We must not meet Abu Nidal or Ahmad Jibril. I very much regret that they have not accepted the invitation for them to come over here. They are supposed to accept the invitation and come so that I can meet them publicly. They are meeting with the leaders of the IRA and yet they forbid us to do so. They receive the author of "The Satanic Verses" who insulted Islam. Today they are making dancing dresses with Koranic verses printed on them in France or the nightclubs of France. One wonders if the Arabs or those who are defenders of Islam would protest to France or break off relations with France. They would not dare. [passage omitted] We are warning the Egyptian people against those who have opened fire, the Algerian people against those who have opened fire, the Sudanese people against those who have been opening fire, the Lebanese people who are being trampled on, the Palestinian people who are being treated like a flock of sheep, and the Syrian people whose land is being occupied until it recognizes them. Tomorrow they will occupy Damascus so that they can impose more conditions on the Syrian people. We are warning all these people. They destroyed Iraq and it was they who got Iraq into the Kuwaiti mess. It was they who destroyed Kuwait, and particularly Kuwait's oil. It was not even Saddam who set fire to Kuwait's oil. It was set on fire by America. All the technology which was used in burning Kuwaiti oil was Western technology. It was deliberate and intentional. They were the ones who set it on fire. They collaborated with Iraq, provided it with experts, gave it the capabilities, and told Saddam to set Kuwaiti oil on fire for reasons which concerned only them. Iraq would need a whole year to be able to set Kuwaiti oil on fire. It was a Western and an American action. It was intentional. It was America who plotted for Iraq's occupation of Kuwait. It told Iraq: In order to reward you for your war against Khomeyni we reward you with Kuwait. Take Kuwait. All this in order to destroy Iraq. These things are quite clear. We are determined to live with dignity over our land. We can never accept living on this earth while we are lacking in sovereignty. One of us is a slave and the other is a master. We will fight this. We prefer death to acceptance of being their slaves, or surrendering to them, or allowing them to impose their injustice on us. Right is turned into wrong and vice versa. They want to solve the Lockerbie case; there are a hundred solutions on the table. [passage omitted] They can go wherever they wish to go. We have decided that we do not need the oil. Oil has now become like any other commodity. Today we are selling a barrel of oil at $10 while production costs are $6 per barrel. It means that a barrel of oil brings in $4. This is nothing. What can we do with $4? Today we are more or less living without oil because a barrel of oil is worth $4. [passage omitted] If we sell the water of the great man-made river we get double the price of the oil. France does not want a solution. So be it. They do not want friendship. Let there be hatred. They do not want peace; let peace go to hell. What are we? Are we more desirous of peace or friendship than they are? What is our relationship with them ? We do not need them. That is it. We have decided definitely to do without oil. If it continued, well and good, and if it did not--definitely we have made our decision to live without oil and live in the manner that suits us. Today, we have electricity and this and that and air conditioning units; they must not think our independence and our freedom are dependent on them. When it comes to the real thing and the issue becomes an issue of dignity and an issue of existence and an issue of the future and they want on encroach on us, to hell with all these things. We shall go back to back to burning logs and do away with electricity [words indistinct drowned by applause] [passage omitted]. Now they are asking why Libya has been escalating the situation. They are doing so because they are afraid that such an escalation would spread to other Arab countries and other peoples. What they would like to see is that when they attack the rest should surrender. Once there is someone who says no, there should be no surrender, others might follow suit. They might say: Look, here is someone who has not surrendered; why then should we surrender?. And thus a new awakening might begin. Yes, we should be exporting our people's revolution to the rest of the Arab nation because a sin is being committed there. First, the slogan Land for Peace must be burned. All right, peace requires a price so let us motivate the Arab nation to pay the price. Here we are not warmongers, as they have been claiming, nor are we calling for the destruction of Israel or anything like that. However, the word Israel is a strange name which we do not comprehend. What we know is Palestine; Jews and Arabs should live in Palestine in a democratic state. We said this before. Peaceful solutions should mean, furthermore, that nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction must be removed from the Israelis. A democratic state, like that in South Africa, must be created; we should organize free elections and allow the 7 million Palestinians to return because as long as the 7 million have not returned there will be no solution to this problem. The Golan is, however, another problem; it is Syria's right to demand its return or to fight until its land has been liberated. But no one should ask it to recognize Israel at all. Syria has every right to liberate the Golan inch by inch and no one has any right to ask it to recongnize Israel. This is its land; it was occupied in 1967. What is dangerous here is linking the two things together. [passage omitted] I would like here to salute the Libyan people for their pan-Arabism and for understanding the aims of the plot, as well as for their readiness for confrontation. We have no other choice than a confrontation; we have no choices left. But if they are looking for a solution with us they are welcome. If they choose peace we will reciprocate. Peace be upon you. [crowd applauds, chants]
