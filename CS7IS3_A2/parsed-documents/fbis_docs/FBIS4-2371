The meeting, the first one on unification and security policy coordination, decided that all unification matters, diplomacy related to the DPRK and security problems should be discussed among various ministries so as to harmonize their views. The various ministries and secretariats should push ahead with the policies of unification and security under the principle that the government must seek progress in inter-Korean relations. The meeting was presided over by minister of the National Unification Board (NUB) Yi Yong-tok and attended by heads of the foreign and defense ministries, the Agency for National Security Planning, Presidential Secretariat as well as Secretariat for Foreign and National Security Affairs. "We looked into the overall situation of unification and security" following the United Nations Security Council's presidential statement on the DPRK's nuclear issue and the suspension of inter-Korean working-level contact, NUB Minister Yi said after the meeting. The government ministries and departments concerned will discuss every relevant policy to iron out their differences, Yi added. Coordination meetings will be held more than once a week and President Kim Yong-sam will chair the sessions when necessary, according to official sources.
