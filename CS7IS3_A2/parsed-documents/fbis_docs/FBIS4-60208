The conferees discussed the latest developments in the secessionist plot engineered and executed by the rebellious separatists in the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] leadership against unity, democracy, and Constitutional legitimacy in the country. The conferees also discussed the blatant and escalating treasonous stand of the so- called 'Ali Salim al-Bid -- the war criminal and enemy of unity, democracy, and Constitutional institutions -- who has finally revealed his real nature and the reality of his destructive intentions and illegitimate ambitions. These were revealed in his secessionist declaration, which is based solely on his grudge against the people and his plot against their unity. Only two hours after the people rejoiced over the declaration of the three-day peace made yesterday by the joint meeting of the Presidential Council, the Speakership Council of the House of Representatives, and the Council of Ministers on the occasion of the blessed 'Id al-Adha and the fourth anniversary of the Republic of Yemen, in response to the call of the YSP unionists and a number of Arab leaders, and to give the misled and helpless people an opportunity to declare their clear principled stand against the secessionists and in support of unity and Constitutional legitimacy; following a review of the treacherous stands adopted by secessionist elements that were accompanied by premeditated violations of the call for peace and continued attacks by the secessionist gang on the units of our Armed Forces, the forces of unity protecting Constitutional legitimacy; and in light of the steps and events that would result, the conferees adopted a group of sovereign and Constitutional decisions aimed at protecting unity and democracy and pooling all efforts in the holy national war. The joint meeting of the Presidential Council, the Speakership Council of the House of Representatives, and the Council of Ministers issued the following statement: In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. In light of these very delicate and important circumstances through which our Yemeni homeland is passing; in the course of confrontation against the challenges facing the national constants on which society is based and to which the Republic of Yemen adheres, particularly the Constitutional principles and the dear national achievements of the people -- the dearest of which are unity and democracy -- the joint meeting firmly reiterates that the Yemeni people, particularly the Armed Forces, the Security Forces, and all Constitutional institutions, will confront all serious plots aimed at encroaching on their unity or tampering with their national choice. Our Yemeni people, who offered great sacrifices to achieve unity, are always ready to offer more sacrifices to safeguard this great historic achievement. Our lofty Yemeni people, who foiled the attempts to create a new secessionist reality in the homeland, under the slogan of the fabricated crisis raised by traitor 'Ali Salim al- Bid, can also bury his miserable secessionist declaration, which was born dead and which came as the rebellious secessionists were dying. They will face their destiny, thanks to the steadfastness of our Yemeni people and their rallying around their legitimate leadership and their brave Armed Forces. This declaration is considered by every Constitutional, legal, and political criteria as high treason. It will not go unpunished. It is considered a violation of the Constitution of the Republic of Yemen and a departure from the collective will of the people who declared their unionist word on 22 May 1990 when they said yes to the Constitution of the Republic of Yemen, to unity, and to democracy, in the public referendum of 15 May 1991. While we underline these facts, we urge all sons of our struggling people to rally behind the ranks of eternal unity and stand in the trenches to defend and preserve that unity. We urge them to sacrifice everything they hold dear and to pool all available resources and energies to ensure that popular efforts are coordinated with military operations to ensure results as soon as possible and at the least possible cost. We are confident that our people and all their political, social, and cultural forces -- including the ulema, thinkers, shayks, intellectuals, merchants, workers, students, youth, men, and women -- will set the most splendid examples in this eternal national confrontation of a serious threat to their single existence, their independent political entity, and their shining civilized fate. In this regard, and because we appreciate and value all the previous positions of the fraternal and friendly states with our people, and their unity and democratic march, we are certain that they will not continue to deal with the gang of rebellion and secession, especially after its secessionist trend was confirmed in practice. Consequently, any kind of dealing by any party with the traitor 'Ali Salim al-Bid and his declaration of secession is considered an act against the Yemeni people and flagrant and rejected intervention in the Republic of Yemen's internal affairs. All Constitutional authorities in our country have the right to deal with such an act in the appropriate manner. In a spirit of sincere brotherhood and with the feelings of noble tolerance that live in the hearts of all Yemenis; and with a substantive, deep view of the requirements of logic and a deep faith in the one country and in the loyalty and tolerance of all of its children, we urge all unionists in the Socialist Party, all those deceived by the rebellious secessionists, and all those living under the tyranny of these criminal, secessionist gangs to take swift, clear, and decisive positions on the side of the people, their unity and Constitutional legitimacy, and its institutions, which are based on the will of the people and which were established according to the people's free and democratic choice. Out of concern for them and out of respect for the principle of participation, we urge them to shoulder the national responsibilities and reject any further killings, and to help break the circle of destruction of the people's resources and energies, for which the adventurous secessionists show no concern. Al-Bid's statement confirms their destructive and bloody intention. Here, we stress with all confidence and growing ability that our Yemeni people, and all their united forces and segments, particularly in the Armed Forces and the security agencies, are able to (?raise higher) the word of the people, which stems from the words of God, and to champion the people's free will to protect unity, preserve Constitutional legitimacy, and protect security and stability under the lofty banners of the Republic of Yemen.
