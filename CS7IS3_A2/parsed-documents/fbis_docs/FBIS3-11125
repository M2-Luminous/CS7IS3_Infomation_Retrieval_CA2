Of these studies, 10 were ranked as outstanding, and one entitled the Environmental Radiological Study of the Republic of Cuba won an award from the Academy of Science of Cuba (ACC), one of the most important awards of all the institutions under the ACC. According to Sean, in the 1993 contest the introduction and categorization of studies of previous years were made. Among these studies is one of three varieties of rice in which genetic traits were introduced via irradiation, and one of the technology for activating polystyrene plates [placas de polistireno], which are of great use for investigations of various types. During this period, different institutions sold and contracted 12 pieces of equipment developed by specialists from the Center of Applied Studies for the Development of Nuclear Energy (Ceaden). In addition, it was learned in 1993 Sean guaranteed the country's basic services in the field of dosimetry and radiological protection. Sources of nuclear energy that were not being used in the 14 provinces and in the special municipality of the Isle of Youth were gathered and rendered inactive and were taken to the nuclear waste site near the outskirts of the capital. During the period, nuclear experts were able to maintain a stable functioning of the national network of radiological operations. Other works continued by Cuban atomic energy experts with the arrival of new patients concerns the evaluation of radiation effects on children from Chernobyl at a tourist installation east of Havana. After a detailed study of current conditions, it was agreed to maintain the nuclear option in the electromagnetic Cuban system. During the last six months of last year, work was done in this regard, and a gradual national planning strategy was devised to face the future programs of nuclear energy development. The construction of the first electronuclear center (CEN) on this Caribbean island has come to a standstill due to the difficult situation the Cuban economy is facing. A program in which nuclear builders and experts will participate was designed to offer maintenance to installation programs. This will be done until conditions permit the completion of the first two reactors in the central-southern Province of Cienfuegos. Meanwhile, qualified personnel of the first Cuban CEN have devoted their work to applying nuclear energy to other fields, so as to contribute to national economic development.
