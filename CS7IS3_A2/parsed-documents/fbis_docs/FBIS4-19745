Last week this interest rate had been 5.7 percent and the week before 5.73 percent. The slightly faster decline of the so-called "third prime rate" was no surprise to most participants in the market, after the Bundesbank had reduced the two traditional interest rates, the discount rate and the Lombard rate, last Thursday [14 April]. A few hours after the allocation by the Bundesbank, the Belgian National Bank announced a reduction of its money market rate from 5.8 to 5.7 percent.
