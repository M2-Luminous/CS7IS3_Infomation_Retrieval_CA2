Ernesto Samper Pizano is the new Colombian president-elect. He won over his contender Andres Pastrana by a margin of more than 132,000 votes. He is our special guest this evening. Good evening, Dr. Samper. Samper: Good evening, how are you doing? Zavarain: Very well, thank you. Tell us, when you awoke this morning, what was the first thing that came to your mind? Perhaps you thought it had all been a dream? Samper: Well, no. I felt as if a piano had been lifted off my head and an organ had been placed there instead. [sentence as heard] It was a sensation that is very difficult to describe. [passage omitted] Zavarain: We now welcome Dr. Andres Pastrana. Good evening, Dr. Pastrana. Pastrana: Good evening. Zavarain: We have invited you to pay tribute to your campaign. After all, you received 3.5 million votes, the highest number of votes received by a conservative candidate in our history. We would like to know what you plan to do with all that electoral support. Pastrana: I will continue working. The Colombian people have given me a mandate of 3.5 million votes, which is 50 percent of the vote. Those 3.5 million votes are sending us a message. They say that change is possible, that it is possible to defeat the old policy, the machinery. They are telling us that the country wants to build a new Colombia. Therefore, we will work hard with those 3.5 million Colombians, and many more, to build the Colombia we want so much. Unidentified reporter: Good evening, Dr. Pastrana. Last night, after acknowledging the partial results of the elections, you made a statement that has given rise to many doubts. I invite you to hear the recording. Pastrana: Let us hear it. [Begin recording] Pastrana: That is why I assured the country that a president who has received money from drug traffickers has no moral authority to lead Colombia. [end recording] Reporter: Dr. Pastrana, what exactly did you mean? Pastrana: You know that since Friday I have been deeply concerned because, a week ago, the international media--TIME magazine, and other U.S. media--published reports hinting that drug money was being used in the political campaign. During the previous campaign there were 18 candidates, and I insisted that we all should send a note to the U.S. Government demanding clarification of who they were referring to. Later on, when only Dr. Samper and I were campaigning, the media insisted on saying that there was money from drug trafficking. Therefore, I sent a letter to Dr. Samper to tell him--as I said in my letter--that I have no knowledge of any funds from drug trafficking used in my campaign. Therefore, I swear before God and my conscience that I can say to Colombians that there were no such funds. I believed a reply to my letter from Dr. Samper was important to tell the world that there was no money from drug trafficking in our respective campaigns. Reporter: You have specifically said that there was no money from drug trafficking in your campaign, and that there were only two candidates. Do you mean that Ernesto Samper has no moral authority to lead the country? Pastrana: No, no. In my letter to Dr. Samper, I invited him to tell the world that if it was confirmed that there were funds from drug trafficking in either of our campaigns, that candidate would resign from the Colombian presidency because it would be an affront to the Republic and the nation. Reporter: Did you receive a reply to that letter? Pastrana: No, I have not received a reply, but I hope Dr. Samper... Reporter, interrupting: Do you have proof that drug money was used in the electoral campaign? Pastrana: No, no. I simply said that no such funds were used in my campaign, that I could swear before God and my conscience that those funds did not exist. I invited Dr. Samper to do the same so the world and the media would know that in Colombia there is no drug money in our campaigns. Reporter: Will you participate directly in Samper's government? Pastrana: I have not really thought about that yet. I am currently talking with our people. Whether we participate or not is not the real issue. My message to Dr. Samper is: We will support you in all the good things you do. Whenever we think we should criticize and contribute with our ideas, we will do so. We are not in favor of the old policy in the sense that if we are given a ministry, we will participate in the government. If the government does a good job and we believe that the results are good, Dr.Samper can be sure we will support him. We will also criticize the government when necessary. Zavarain: Thank you, Dr. Pastrana. Congote: Ines Maria, before going to more news, I would like to ask Dr. Ernesto Samper a question. Good evening, Dr. Samper; this is Gloria Congote. In view of Dr. Pastrana's proposal and to eliminate any doubts Colombians may have about you, would you truly be willing to resign from the presidency should it be discovered illegal funds were used in your campaign? Samper: Gloria, I do not think resignation is the issue. I think the doubts expressed by Dr. Pastrana are reckless because they compromise, in one way or another, the entire country in the eyes of the nation [as heard]. I interpret it as an attempt to discredit the electoral results. Over the past few days, I have said emphatically that no drug money was used in my campaign. As proof I described the ethics code that has guided us from the very beginning of the campaign, not just now at the end, as Dr. Pastrana suggested, but for the entire year. We implemented this code to keep an eye on all funds entering the national treasury. I want to invite any reporter or anyone at all who wants to review our books to check the origins of all funds. We adopted this institutional procedure a year ago to monitor where our resources were coming from. Congote: Dr. Samper, why didn't you answer Dr. Pastrana's letter? Samper: I answered it publicly. I received his letter two days after the media received it [chuckles]. I answered it as I told you, and I repeat: A year ago, ours was the first campaign team to worry about money of doubtful origin or about the concentration of resources in the campaign. That is why we established these procedures so we can show anyone our books and the origins of the funds. [passage omitted]
