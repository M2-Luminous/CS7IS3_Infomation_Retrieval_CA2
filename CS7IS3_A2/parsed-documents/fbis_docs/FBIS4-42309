At a talk with 100 key managers of Brandenburg and Berlin industry on the subject of Germany's industrial situation, Rexrodt said that some of Germany's partners are still not happy about the idea of a single Europe. Nothing can happen, he said, unless France and Germany reach agreement on some thorny EU issues. On the other hand, some partner countries have been complaining about excessively narrow German-French agreements, according to Rexrodt. "Right now, there is a lack of initiatives on the subject of the EU's development that would enjoy the support of most members from the very beginning," said Rexrodt. In reply to fears from some of the industrialists concerning monetary union, Rexrodt pledged that Bonn would reach no hasty decision on this matter. This is a subject that can only be dealt with in small steps, he said. The German Government assumes that its EU partners would not like to see an instable Deutschmark and are, therefore, willing to accept some German solutions in their own interests. In the long run, there is no alternative to a single European currency. Rexrodt said that the currency issue is directly linked to the government's efforts to "bring something new" to Europe. "The united Europe must be more than a league of nations but less than a federal republic," he said. "If we do not achieve this kind of Europe, there will be more situations where people are dying in a terrible war just a few hundred kilometers from Munich and everyone else is just watching it happen." The absence of a unified security concept is one of the EU's greatest shortcomings, according to Rexrodt. Monetary, economic, and security policy should be viewed closer together. Rexrodt said he fails to understand the tendency of the British, Spaniards, Portuguese, and Greeks to restrict East European countries' access to West European markets. One cannot expect progress in the economic transformation process if one deprives the developing East European markets of maneuvering space, this being a prerequisite for these countries' full EU membership, he said. According to Rexrodt, the current EU members are located a long way away from the East European reform countries and have little understanding of these countries' dilemma. The Germans in the middle of Europe should adopt a leading role. An eastward expansion of the EU can only be performed slowly, through a process of separate association agreements. It is important that the east European countries see each step as part of the general road toward full EU membership, said Rexrodt.
