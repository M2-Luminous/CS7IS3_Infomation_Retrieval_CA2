Zheng Chen, and 14 other criminals have already been arrested and brought to justice. On 6 July last year, the Pingyi County Public Security Bureau seized five unlawful elements for illegally purchasing old bills of U.S. dollars in the county's (Hongshi) Town. And 4.5 million yuan in Renminbi, seven cars, and eight wireless mobile telephone sets were captured on the spot. According to preliminary investigations, they were an exceptionally serious criminal gang engaged in fraudulence. This case has drawn the attention of the provincial party committee, the provincial government, and the Ministry of Public Security. The provincial public security department has directly commanded the investigation of this case and organized the public security organs of related prefectures and cities to conduct investigation in all directions. Through a lot of investigation work, it has been ascertained that Zheng Chen, principal offender, had been sentenced to three and half years of imprisonment in Beijing on the charge of embezzlement and bribe-taking. In April 1992, criminal Zheng, in collusion with his partners, fled to Shandong and got acquainted with a foreign trader through all sorts of relations. Under the condition of paying $50,000 or 500,000 yuan in Renmenbi to this foreign trader every year, Zheng used the name of this foreign trader to run some false joint ventures in Weifang and Taian one after another. Zheng Chen himself served as president and general manager of these joint ventures. Then, by using the signboard of Sino-foreign joint venture, and by using the mentality of urgently needing foreign exchange among large and medium-sized enterprises, Zheng Chen forged the certificates of foreign exchange funds and signed many contracts on exchanging U.S. dollars in the name of supplying goods. Whenever he gained a certain amount of money by cheating, he wrote new certificates of funds from banks to lure even more customers to be deceived. In addition, by using the difference of time, he adopted the method of drawing in a large amount of money and paying a small amount of money and the method of tearing down the east wall to repair the west wall to occupy a huge amount of funds for operation and circulation. He also spent money without restraint. It has been ascertained that this criminal gang defrauded some 106 million yuan from more than 40 enterprises in Hebei, Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Shandong, and seven other provinces and municipalities. In the course of handling this case by public security organs, in order to reduce the economic losses of the deceived units and support enterprises to develop production, the captured 60 million yuan of illicit money and property have already been returned to the deceived units. At present, this case is still under further investigation and handling.
