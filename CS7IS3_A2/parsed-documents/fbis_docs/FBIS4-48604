Those appointed include: -- Professor Jakes Gerwel, the former rector and vice-chancellor of the University of the Western Cape who has been appointed as Mr Mandela's director-general. -- Mr Ahmed Kathrada, the Rivonia trialist who was imprisoned on Robben Island along with Mr Mandela. His job in the president's office involves acting as Mr Mandela's liaison with Parliament. Mr Kathrada has a reputation for being a backroom worker totally loyal to Mr Mandela. -- Mr Joe Netshitenzhe, who is also called Peter Mayibuye, will be employed as the chief director of communications in Mr Mandela's office. Mr Netshitenzhe, 38, is considered one of the bright young intellectuals in the ANC and served on the organisation's Negotiations Commission and the Electoral Commission. He edited the ANC's propaganda publication Mayibuye since 1980 and worked on Radio Freedom before then. He is also a member of the ANC's national working committee. -- Mrs Mary Mxadana, an employee of the SA [South Africa] Council of Churches for more than 10 years, has been appointed as Mr Mandela's private secretary. From 1992, she headed the Ecumenical Monitoring Programme in SA (Empsa), which brought out 500 monitors from church organisations abroad to monitor violence and later the elections. She also has a good voice, having been one of the members of the choir which sang at Mr Mandela's inauguration.
