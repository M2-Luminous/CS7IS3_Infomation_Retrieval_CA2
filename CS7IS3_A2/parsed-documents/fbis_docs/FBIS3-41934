He said that the U.S. report stated that there are 200 Thai laborers working at that chemical weapons plant. The three employment agencies that sent the workers were the S.P.C. Suphachok Company, the W. and M. Associates Company, and the Handle Group Company. The Ministry of Labor has placed the S.P.C. Suphachok Company on the black list. The other two companies are illegal companies that have never registered, and officials have been ordered to take action against them. "There is no cause for concern among Thai workers in Libya, because we have ordered the Thai labor attache in Greece to look after the laborers in Libya. Officials have information on the bombing targets and will immediately evacuate the Thai laborers to safe spots. That chemical weapons plant is located in Rafta. So far we have not been able to make contact, because Libya has refused to grant visas to officials. And those that have been allowed into the country have been restricted with respect to where they can go, making it difficult to meet with the Thai laborers. But the Thai-language service of the BBC radio has contacted those Thai laborers and told them to find a way to leave the munitions plant. The Ministry of Labor has prepared evacuation measures and has submitted a request to the cabinet for 200 million baht to pay for this," said Mr. Phaithun. He added that Thai workers continue to go to Libya to work. But employment companies have been told that if they send workers to work in munitions plants, their permits will be revoked immediately. The Ministry of Labor has a list of all employment companies and knows which companies are doing what. Dr. Bun Wanasin, an adviser to the minister of labor said that at present the situation in Libya is not serious. That threat made by the United States is just an attempt by the United States to put pressure on Libya to turn over the two terrorists. The United States is not expected to bomb Libya for at least two weeks, and Libya has not made any preparations because it is still negotiating with the United States. [passage omitted] At 1630 hours that same day at the Labor Skills Development Department, police officials from the Suppression Division took a number of suspects and a large number of documents concerning illegal job placement and turned them over to the director-general of the department. After reviewing the documents, Mr. Sinchai Riantrakun, deputy director-general of the Labor Skills Development Department, said that General Chawalit Yongchaiyut, minister of labor, ordered the department to cooperate with officials from the Suppression Division and special operations units in searching the offices of the Handle Group Company Ltd. located at 119/265 Sukhaphiban Road. There, they found job applications, pictures of the workers, money orders that the job applicants had given to the company, money orders for agent fees, airplane tickets, 119 passports, and labor contracts from Libyan employers. Some of these documents were fakes that had been copied from the Labor Employment Department. The officials arrested Mrs. Sisuphat Hongthong, Mr. Suchat Hongthong, Mr. Suphot Phetmunwai, and Mr. Narong Yingsap and charged them with placing laborers without first obtaining permission from the registrar. These people are all company officials. The owners of this company, Mr. Chatchai Hongthong and Mrs. Arak Phinrat, managed to escape. Officials are now looking for them. Mr. Sinchai said that during the interrogation, the company officials said that the company had been sending workers to Libya for 2 to 3 years. Their fee was 30-40,000 baht per person. On the application, it stated that the workers would be employed as mechanics, welders, blacksmiths, concrete workers, and physicians' assistants. But it hasn't been confirmed that this company was sending laborers to work at the chemical weapons plant in Libya as American officials have stated. The suspects will have to be questioned further, and the data on the large number of disks will have to be studied. "I want to stress that this action was taken in accord with the labor employment law. Employers in Libya probably understand this. This should not have any effect on our international relations, because this action was taken in accord with Thai laws. The illegal labor issue is a major problem today. The Labor Employment Department will take resolute action in investigating matters. Those who find jobs for people abroad must do things in accord with the law," said Mr. Sinchai. He added that these violations are criminal violations for which people can be imprisoned for up to ten years and fined 60,000 to 200,000 baht.
