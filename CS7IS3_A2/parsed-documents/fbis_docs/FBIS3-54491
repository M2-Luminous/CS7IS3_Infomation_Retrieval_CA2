The session's final communique shows that the member countries have reached comprehensive agreements on various issues. Our correspondent, who attended the very lengthy closing session, reports: [Unidentified correspondent] According to the official agenda, originally the session was to issue its final communique at 1900 yesterday. However, due to existence of different points of view expressed by the members, the communique was not ratified until 0600 this morning, thus the session was in effect extended by 12 hours. We can explain this delay in the light of the speeches made earlier by the participants. Later on, each of the speakers were seeking to incorporate in the final communique their points of view vis-a-vis the overriding national issues in their respective countries. A great deal of the session's time was thereby taken by this process. Nonetheless, the participants seemed satisfied with the debates since they had been able to put forward their problems and issues. [passage omitted] In general, however, one's impression of the two-day session was that the participants as a whole were satisfied with the session's decisions. In my conversations with the participants, including Shemshad Ahmad, the ECO secretary general, I learned that they were happy with the session's outcome. At the end of the session, I asked Mr. Velayati to remark on the outcome of the session, even though he was very tired. [Begin Velayati recording] One of the most important decisions adopted in the session was to call the next 10 years the decade of communication and transport. In view of the need to carry out infrastructural works in order to facilitate economic development and pave the way for all-embracing cooperation, activities in the areas of communications and transport are fundamentally important. The transport ministers of ECO member countries recently met in Almaty, and as far as we know, ECO members pay special attention to this sphere. It was, nonetheless, decided that national projects should be formulated and implemented in harmony with ECO's general communications plans and projects. This is particularly significant in view of the fact that the majority of ECO member countries do not have any maritime borders, hence the importance of developing communication and transport networks.
