The Islamic Republic of Iran is well aware of the sources of such information. The embassy of the Islamic Republic of Iran would like to stress once again its neutral position regarding the Karabakh conflict and strictly rejects such baseless declarations which are aiming to aggravate the crisis and therefore to internationalize the conflict. The Islamic Republic of Iran is consistent in its external policy and is trying to support the peace course from the very beginning of the Karabakh conflict. Meanwhile it keeps the right to take strict measures if any of the conflicting sides violates the borders of the republic. The Islamic Republic of Iran considered one of the main topics of its external policy to be in friendly relations with all its neighbors including the Republic of Armenia. The people of Armenia and Iran have a good history of friendship and coexistence. By this very reason after the official relations between the two countries have been restored, the Islamic Republic of Iran has been taking all efforts to further improve these links and relations. Therefore the provocative news of this kind based on the principle of separating and ruling are will not create any obstacles in the relations between the two countries.
