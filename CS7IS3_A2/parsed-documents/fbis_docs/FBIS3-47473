Upon unveiling the new Sunny model, Nissan President Yoshifumi Tsuji said the switch was prompted by the appreciation of the yen. Nissan has already started to locally manufacture about 70 percent of Sunny cars sold in the U.S. market. Just less than 120,000 vehicles of 165,000 Sunny cars sold in the U.S. last year were locally made, with the remainder imported from Japan. Tsuji said its new manufacturing plant in Tennessee will be in charge of production of all Sunnys from late this year. The cars produced there will be put on the U.S. market starting 1995. Nissan's Zama plant in Kanagawa Prefecture will continue making Sunnys for the domestic market, but its production will be phased out, as the operation is gradually moved to the Kanda plant in Kyushu as part of the company's restructuring program.
