He was accompanied at the audience by Lambert Kouassi Konan, the Ivorian minister of agriculture. Dr. Okias came to discuss the active integration of our two economies. Here are more details from Dr. Okias: [Begin Okias recording] We had the honor to be received by President Konan Bedie and we held lengthy discussions. I delivered a message from his brother and friend Alhadj Omar Bongo of Gabon. I am not allowed to disclose the exact contents of this message, but at least one part of the message can be retained, pertaining to the economic and trade issues contained in the message. [passage omitted] Cote d'Ivoire is one of those African countries which has achieved self-sufficiency in food production. Gabon needs to have closer ties with Cote d'Ivoire to discover in what sectors we can develop relations, so that the Gabonese housewife's shopping bag remains full. [passage omitted] It is up to us to take advantage of what food already exists in quality and quantity. Later, we will base our policy on the Ivorian experience to help us develop our agricultural sector. As you know, Gabon -- due to its specific climate, its semi-tropical geography -- has always based its economy on its industry, land and minerals. With the Ivorian experience, and the parallels in trade in existing products, we will benefit from your experience and learn how to sow our own seeds both in quantity and quality. [end recording]
