A member of the PCC provincial committee presented a detailed analysis of the current situation and prospects for the province during the two-day plenum. The plenum stressed the economic results of the first part of 1994, a period during which the province registered modest increases in mercantile production. This reflects the beginning of the recovery process and how much still needs to be done to meet the population's needs. The sugarcane harvest's goal was a 50-percent increase in 1994, and although more sugar was produced than in the previous harvest, and several mills are still grinding, this goal will not be reached. Slight increases were registered in potato, tomato, and egg production, as well as in the harvests of tobacco, pine resin, and self-sufficiency crops. The plenum called for increased efforts to quickly reach the production level of previous years and insisted on the need for more efficiency in collection, especially in the farming sector. The fight against crime, and defense issues were also discussed. Fidel Ramos Pereda, member of the Central Committee and first secretary of the PCC in Pinar del Rio Province, praised the frankness with which the issues were discussed, acknowledging the modest progress made and the awareness that it is not enough, and that the results rest on the efforts of every revolutionary.
