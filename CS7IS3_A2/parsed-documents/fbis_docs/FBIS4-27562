FBIS4-27562 "dreas106_a_94023" FBIS-EAS-94-106 Daily Report 30 May 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Chip Makers Positive on FY '94 Investment Chip Makers Positive on FY '94 Investment OW3005055594 Tokyo KYODO in English 0516 GMT 30 May 94 OW3005055594 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, May 30 KYODO -- Japan's six major electric machinery makers plan to spend 15.4 percent more on business investment for semiconductor production in fiscal 1994 than they did the previous year, according to their projections. The six concerns -- Hitachi Ltd., Fujitsu Ltd., NEC Corp., Toshiba Corp., Mitsubishi Electric Corp. and Oki Electric Industry Co. -- set aside a total of 461 billion yen for investment for the fiscal year that ends March 31, 1995, up from 399.6 billion yen the year before. Industry officials cited an unabated personal computer boom in the United States and bright prospects for domestic demand as factors behind the bullish spending plans. The bulk of these investment is targeted at memory chips, for which demand is shifting from 4-megabit dynamic random access memory (dram) chips to 16-megabit dram chips. "The shift in demand for 16-megabit dram chips will be put into top gear" in the latter half of this year, said Hajime Sasaki, managing director at NEC. NEC, now an industry leader in 16-megabit dram chips, expects to raise manufacturing capacity to 3 million units a month by next March from the current one million. Hitachi is trying to catch up with NEC in the 16-megabit dram chip market with a project to raise monthly capacity at one of its main domestic chip factories to 3 million units, also by next March. Fujitsu's investment plan calls for investing more than 100 billion yen, its first such layout in three years, while Toshiba and Mitsubishi plan to increase investment for the first time in three years after keeping their investments flat for the past two years. Oki, which returned to profitability in the latest business year ended March 31, expects to double its investment for chip production.
