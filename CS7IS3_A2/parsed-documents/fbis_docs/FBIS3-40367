Developed by Jerusalem firm EFL, the battery uses zinc-air electrodes and has successfully completed a practical test with the Bavarian Federation for Technical Control. Whilst a 900 kilogram lead-gel battery gave a Post Office electric van a range of only 54 kilometers, with a 650 kilogram EFL battery it can travel 300 kilometers. Apart from the new battery's drastically increased storage capacity, Professor Wabner stressed in particular the system's operational safety in the event of a short circuit. By contrast, some electric vehicles fitted with sodium sulfide batteries had gone up in flames when a short circuit occurred. The remarkable thing is that even when cooled to minus 18 degrees the EFL battery can still give full power within millionths of a second. Wabner described the EFL energy system as the best battery in the world at present. Initially, starting in 1995, not more than 70 vehicles owned by the Post Office and various firms and municipalities will be fitted with the new batteries. The field trial will serve to clarify not so much technical as operational questions. Dr. Tumm said the running costs of an EFL vehicle were initially 1.40 German marks [DM] per kilometer, whereas a diesel vehicle today costs only 42 pfennig [0.42 DM] per kilometer. But Post Office experts calculate that once the EFL batteries have been introduced the price per kilometer could fall to 54 pfennig [0.54 DM] by the year 2000.
