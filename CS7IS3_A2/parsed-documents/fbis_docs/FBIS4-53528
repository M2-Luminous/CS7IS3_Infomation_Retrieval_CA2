FBIS4-53528 "dreas098_c_94005" FBIS-EAS-94-098 Daily Report 20 May 1994 North Korea KCNA Cites SKNDF Statement KCNA Cites SKNDF Statement SK2005123694 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0523 GMT 20 May 94 SK2005123694 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, May 20 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee of the South Korean National Democratic Front [SKNDF] (Hanminjon) issued a statement on May 14 concerning the recent discovery of much plutonium in Japan, the Seoul-based radio Voice of National Salvation reported. The statement said: The discovery of 70 kg of plutonium in Japan is patent proof that the Japanese authorities, while accelerating nuclear armament behind the curtain of "peaceful nuclear development" for scores of years, have produced and stockpiled a large amount of plutonium in secrecy and are diverting it for military purposes in actuality. This also clearly proves that the surveillance system of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] is not mechanism for nuclear non-proliferation but a tool of pressure and aggression allowing the United States and other nuclear-weapon states to dominate non-nuclear weapon states. With a view to diverting to the North the attention of Asia and the rest of the world concerned over Japan's nuclear armament, the Japanese authorities are playing the role of a shock brigade in the anti-DPRK nuclear racket of the United States and promoting their nuclear armament in real earnest behind the big scene made over the "suspicion of the nuclear development" by the North. Japan's nuclear armament is a cancer in the peace of Asia and the rest of the world. The danger of nuclear war on the Korean peninsula is growing due to Japan's efforts to become a nuclear power. Nevertheless, the United States and the IAEA are kicking up a pressure campaign against the North over its "nuclear suspicion" while closing their eyes to Japan's undisguised nuclear armament. This is a grave violation of international justice, peace and impartiality. We express the hope that the governments, political parties and organisations of all countries that love justice and peace and pursue common prosperity and development as well as international organisations will more extensively organise the struggle to check Japan's ambitious nuclear armament and establish a new order of nuclear control based on international impartiality. Our Hanminjon will in the future, too, wage a strong anti-war, anti-nuke peace movement against Japan's nuclear armament threatening peace and human existence in the Korean peninsula, Asia and the rest of the world and against the anti-North nuclear intrigues of the United States and international reactionary forces intended to put the Korean peninsula on the altar of a nuclear war.
