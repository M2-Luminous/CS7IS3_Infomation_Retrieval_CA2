It comes as pressure mounts for effective action against foreign companies, many said to be part of a huge Malaysian operation accused of plundering Papua New Guinea's rain forests for huge profits. The 5.5-million-dollar contract is aimed at tightening scrutiny and inspection of logging and timber exports to maximise government revenue from log sales. SGS will also guard against transfer-pricing and illegal sale of logs in a deal which Forestry Minister Tim Neville said would pull unscrupulous companies into line. Neville said in an Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) television program Monday that he had been offered bribes of up to 20 million dollars and threats were made on his life because of his strong drive for reform of the timber industry. He told the ABC the threats and offers of bribes were serious and those responsible faced criminal charges, but did not not name the companies responsible. Following a visit to logging areas of the country with Neville, the program highlighted what it termed as the "wholesale devastation" of PNG's forests. SGS, based in Geneva, has been engaged in the business of trade surveillance since 1878. "We will be present at all loading ports to check the volume of timber loaded and do species identification," SGS general manager Len Cordiner said Tuesday. "We will also be checking all the contract documents and setting up a computerised data base for keeping records on all of the concessions and timber going out from these concessions." Cordiner said the principal objective was to obtain precise figures and facts on how much timber was being exported from Papua New Guinea so that the government had more effective control over the forest industry. "At the moment there is a belief that a lot of logs are going out of the country without being declared," he said. "There's also a belief that the revenue the government is collecting is well below what it should be. "So the objective is to control the industry and to make sure that the loggers are doing the right thing; that the correct value is being declared; and that the government is getting the correct income.
