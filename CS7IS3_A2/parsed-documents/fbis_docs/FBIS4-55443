The international community is not even considering a partial relaxation of sanctions against Montenegro alone, and such a solution "would not be good for either Montenegro or Serbia," he said. Speaking about a possible lifting of the sanctions against Montenegro, which has been talked about increasingly often among the public, Djukanovic said at a news conference that the only relaxation that Montenegro could expect is the reestablishing of traffic links with Italy and somewhat more generous humanitarian aid, due to the large numbers of refugees. The Montenegrin prime minister stressed that the awareness of how senseless the sanctions are is gaining strength in the international community, for it is being realized that they have not achieved their objective. Asked how much the sanctions have cost Montenegro, Djukanovic said that the "amount of the losses" cannot be precisely quantified. However, he added, the lost exports and revenue from tourism, the non-functioning of the merchant fleet, and the inability to meet contractual obligations to foreign partners have so far cost Montenegro some $3.34 billion. Speaking about new economic measures, Djukanovic mentioned a possible increase in salaries in the republic, but warned they have to be kept in line with other parameters, particularly with production.
