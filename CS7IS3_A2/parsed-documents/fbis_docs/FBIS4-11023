Although the Electoral Tribunal is the leading organization in the electoral process, it is not the Electoral Tribunal's responsibility to assess this action because, according to the Constitution, the Legislative Branch is the only branch empowered to judge the public actions of the president of the Republic. The Electoral Tribunal magistrates reiterate our constitutional independence from the Executive Branch and other government organizations. We ratify our commitment to guarantee that Panamanian voters will be able to vote freely on 8 May, and that their votes will be counted with absolute honesty so that those who obtain the majority of the votes will be proclaimed the legitimate winners. Issued in Panama City on 15 April 1994 Eduardo Valdes Escoffery, President Magistrate Dennis Allen Frias, Vice President Magistrate Guillermo Marquez Amado, Member Magistrate
