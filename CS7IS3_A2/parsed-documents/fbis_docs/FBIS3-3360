Wu made the remarks when asked to comment on a report in the Japanese media that China exported moldy rice to Japan. He said that the Chinese State Administration for the Inspection of Import and Export Commodities had re-examined the samples of the rice exported to Japan before shipment and established that there was nothing wrong. The spokesman noted that officials from the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries also admitted that the responsibility of the rice going moldy was not on the Chinese side and that the Japanese press reports had over-exaggerated the incident.
