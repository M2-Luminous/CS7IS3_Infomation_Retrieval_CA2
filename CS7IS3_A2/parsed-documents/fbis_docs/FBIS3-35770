A source close to the republic's government has told Interfax that the president must undergo an annual medical examination. The source said that on March 24, 1993, during his unofficial visit to the United States, Niyazov had been examined at Washington's Walter Reed Medical Center. On October 6 of the same year, the Turkmen press carried a letter by former U.S. secretary of State Alexander Haig, in which he recommended that Turkmenistan's president visit St. Luke's hospital in Houston, where the world's best cardiologists work. Unverified reports say that Houston is one of the cities to be visited by Niyazov in the United States.
