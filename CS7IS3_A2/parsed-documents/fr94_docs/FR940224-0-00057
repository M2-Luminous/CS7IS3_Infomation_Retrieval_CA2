ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the food additive regulations to provide for the safe use of 2,4-di- tert -pentyl-6-[1-(3,5-di- tert -pentyl-2-hydroxyphenyl)ethyl]phenyl acrylate as an antioxidant in the manufacture of polypropylene and styrene block polymers that contact food. This action is in response to two petitions filed by Sumitomo Chemical America, Inc. DATES: Effective February 24, 1994; written objections and requests for a hearing by March 28, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit written objections to the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Vir Anand, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (HFS&hyph;216), Food and Drug Administration, 200 C St. SW., Washington, DC 20204, 202&hyph;254&hyph;9500. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In a notice published in the Federal Register of June 23, 1993 (58 FR 34058), FDA announced that two food additive petitions (FAP's 3B4357 and 3B4359) had been filed by Sumitomo Chemical America, Inc., 345 Park Ave., New York, NY 10154, proposing that food additive regulations be amended in §178.2010 Antioxidants and/or stabilizers for polymers (21 CFR 178.2010) to provide for the safe use of 2,4-di- tert -pentyl-6-[1-(3,5-di- tert -pentyl-2-hydroxyphenyl)ethyl]phenyl acrylate as an antioxidant in the manufacture of polypropylene and styrene block polymers that contact food. FDA has evaluated data in the petitions and other relevant material. The agency concludes that the proposed uses of the additive are safe and that the regulations in §178.2010 should be amended as set forth below. In accordance with §171.1(h) (21 CFR 171.1(h)), the petition and the documents that FDA considered and relied upon in reaching its decision to approve the petitions are available for inspection at the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition by appointment with the information contact person listed above. As provided in 21 CFR 171.1(h), the agency will delete from the documents any materials that are not available for public disclosure before making the documents available for inspection. The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. Any person who will be adversely affected by this regulation may at any time on or before March 28, 1994, file with the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written objections thereto. Each objection shall be separately numbered, and each numbered objection shall specify with particularity the provisions of the regulation to which objection is made and the grounds for the objection. Each numbered objection on which a hearing is requested shall specifically so state. Failure to request a hearing for any particular objection shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing on that objection. Each numbered objection for which a hearing is requested shall include a detailed description and analysis of the specific factual information intended to be presented in support of the objection in the event that a hearing is held. Failure to include such a description and analysis for any particular objection shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing on the objection. Three copies of all documents shall be submitted and shall be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Any objections received in response to the regulation may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
