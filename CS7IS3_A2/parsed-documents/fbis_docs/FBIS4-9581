The standard of political culture also has an impact on stability. We have had negative experience in this respect. We know that a confrontational style and the search for an enemy at any price do not suit us because they lead to political crises. We should, by our own conduct, create a positive image of the style of exercising political power. Among the problems that upset our citizens and make their lives unpleasant are growing crime, vandalism, corruption, and a general deterioration of interpersonal relations. I realize that our situation in this field is not too critical when we compare it with countries we tend to consider stable and prosperous. In spite of this, I am convinced that we must take steps to stave off such negative phenomena. We must now allow what I recently heard from one foreign visitor to become a permanent truth: "You have an interesting country, we feel good here, but what puzzles us are the grim and sad faces of your people." In short, we must see to it that contentment and smiles return to the faces of our citizens. A special problem is the impartiality and nonpartisanship of state administration staff. To secure the stability of state administration staff, this staff must inevitably be above party affairs. We must not hesitate any longer in this regard. It is necessary to prepare and introduce within a short period of time a law on civil servants that would bring about the needed stability in this sensitive sphere of state administration. It is difficult to speak about the stability of the state administration, however, when we are not even clear about its structural changes. These, too, are unavoidable. We realize that the present structure of state administration bodies leads to the persecution of citizens by the bureaucracy. The large degree of redistribution of resources through the state budget, particularly in the sphere of health care and education, creates tension on the revenue side. This tension can be eliminated by increasing either revenue or the deficit. A higher deficit means living at the expense of the future, however. Dilemmas of this kind are characteristic of the present. We cannot waste time pondering them. It is necessary to take vigorous action also in this regard. This means more private initiative in education and health care. Savings in these areas will allow us to reduce the tax burden of, in particular, entrepreneurs, allowing them to devote more resources to the development of business. It seems that the entrepreneurs' present tax burden exceeds the critical mass of tolerability. It is evident that this excessively heavy burden erodes the psychological barrier against tax evasion and other forms of tax fraud. When we deduct from taxes tax evasions of this kind, the actual tax burden is lower. It would be far more effective if the formal tax burden matched the actual burden, leaving aside the fact that such criminal elements in the economy corrupt the social atmosphere. A sore point of Slovak economic policy is support for small and medium-sized businesses. There exists a mass of documents approved by various governments reflecting the endeavor to find a way of giving support to this form of enterprise. In spite of this, we still owe much to small and medium-sized businessmen. We must start eliminating this debt as soon as possible. Our integration into European and transatlantic structures is not free of problems. It is taking place at a time when a new model of European cooperation and a new architecture of European security are being sought. In the same way that we are interested in the borders of the zone of stability and prosperity not ending at our western border, we must be interested in having democratic and stable partners to the east of our republic. We set particularly great store in good relations with Ukraine and the Russian Federation. Our immediate task is to contribute to the stability of Central Europe. I think Slovak-Hungarian relations represent the greatest liability in this respect. It needs to be stressed that this liability rests on both sides. This liability, which is a liability of the two countries' governments not only toward their citizens but also toward the expectations of the entire democratic Europe, must be settled as soon as possible. A condition for this is the establishment of an atmosphere of mutual trust. In other words, we must get rid of mutual distrust. This requires, among other things, the resumption of dialogue at various levels of state representation, including the highest level.
