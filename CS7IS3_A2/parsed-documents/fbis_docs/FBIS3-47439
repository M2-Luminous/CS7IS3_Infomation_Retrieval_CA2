The president's luncheon guests were former Presidents Choe Kyu- ha, Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u. During the two-hour get-together, Kim explained details of the reform policy that he put into effect in the first year of his administration and told them that the country has to join the ranks of advanced nations by boosting its competitive strength this year, presidential spokesman Chu Ton-sik said. "His administration will continue to pursue changes and reform to attain the goal of his national policy," the spokesman said Kim told the former presidents. "In order to do so, revitalization of the economy, political reconciliation and high degree of morality on the part of the people is absolutely necessary." Kim asked for active support from the former presidents for this goal, Chu said. "I have given my all in the past 10 months," Chu quoted Kim as telling the former presidents, pledging that he will remain clean and work hard in the remaining four years. The country recorded a trade surplus last year and, since there are signs of economic recovery, it is all the more important to maintain harmonious labor-management relations, Kim told them. Kim also briefed them that the government set an export goal of 90 billion U.S. dollars for this year and in order to achieve this goal, national unity and solidarity are needed now more than any time before. "The government has set aside 42 trillion won for investment in the farm and fishing industry as part of measures to cope with the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations," Kim said. In addition, the country will try to raise another 1.5 trillion won through a special tax to strengthen the nation's agriculture and fisheries, Kim told them. All three former presidents expressed their agreement with the plans, Chu said. The three also expressed their satisfaction to President Kim for making an opportunity to get together, Chu said. The former presidents said that they believe Kim's broad- mindedness will contribute to the development of a new political culture and national reconciliation, according to Chu. Monday's presidential get-together was seen as significant not only because of its symbolism but also because of perceived efforts on the part of President Kim to unify the country and reconcile the various factions, some of which could have hurt the civilian government's reform policy and anti-corruption campaign. In addition, the luncheon attracted unusual public attention because it was the first encounter between Chon and No since they ran into each other at Kim's inauguration Feb. 25 last year. There has been intense speculation on when, and whether, the two former presidents will reconcile. Animosity between the erstwhile friends and fellow Army generals developed after No succeeded Chon as president in 1988. Chon was said to be angry over what he apparently perceived to be a failure by No to protect him when he had to go into exile in a remote Buddhist temple amid rising public outcy against misrule by his administration. After the meeting Monday, the spokesman told reporters that Kim did not refer to "the problem of reconciliation between Presidents Chon and No." "President Kim simply observed that it is undesirable for the public to talk about a good or bad relationship between two former presidents," Chu said. Chon told reporters after he returned home from the lunch that Kim had suggested a reconciliation and he had replied that "it was a good idea." Pressed further whether he intends to reconcile with No, Chon asked: "Do men like us who have been presidents need a (special) opportunity to reconcile? "I believe we can reconcile naturally if we keep meeting at occasions like today's. "There was nothing awkward about (my) meeting with President No," Chon said, discussing the atmosphere at Monday's meeting. "We talked a lot about the North Korean nuclear problem." Chon said he had asked Kim to pay close attention to national security problems, and Kim was well aware of the importance of the security question. No, upon arrival home from Chongwadae, did not talk to reporters. An aide, Yi Su-chong, told reporters that No personally was very satisfied with Monday's get-together. Yi declined to go into the question of reconciliation with Chon.
