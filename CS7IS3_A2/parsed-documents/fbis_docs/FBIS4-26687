This shows that comparatively great progress was made at yesterday's meeting; hopefully, a comprehensive agreement on the new airport financial arrangements will be reached. In answering reporters' questions, the Chinese team leader Guo Fengmin stated: "The accomplishments scored by the two sides are the result of their common efforts." What gives much food for thought is that here, Guo Fengmin laid special stress on the two characters "both sides." Doing a good job of handling important matters during Hong Kong's transition is a responsibility shared by both the Chinese and British sides, and calls for common efforts; only then will it be possible to score results satisfactory to both sides. If only one side shows sincerity, but the other side not; if only one side hopes for cooperation, but the other side goes its own way; some simple issues will become complicated, whereas complicated issues will become increasingly so. The new airport issue is one that has already been settled, and not a complicated one at that. After eight months of negotiation, they signed a memorandum of understanding on building a new airport and related issues back in 1991, with explicit rules on some basic principles and important specific issues. So long as the British Hong Kong Government takes up its responsibility, and does business earnestly in accordance with the memorandum of understanding, the new airport project will fold smoothly, and Mr. Chris Patten will be sure to return to London from the Lantau Island airport on 30 June 1997. However, the British side has created side issues by setting out financial arrangements in violation of the memorandum; in addition, it has unilaterally and repeatedly made financial allotments based on such arrangements; thus an issue that has already been settled was once again placed on the table, and the talks have continued on and off for more than two years. The building of a new airport aims to help Hong Kong's development; the Chinese side has all along adopted a positive attitude, which is given full play in the memorandum. However, the building of a new airport involves huge funds; the Chinese side must show concern over costs and economic returns as well as the finances of the future Hong Kong SAR [Special Administrative Region] Government. While negotiations were under way before the signing of the memorandum, the British side proposed leaving only a HK$5 billion [Hong Kong dollars] financial reserve to the HK SAR Government; whereas the Chinese side argued strongly on just grounds, and fought for every additional penny; with great efforts, the two sides reached an agreement on HK $25 billion. To avoid leaving a heavy financial burden on the SAR Government from loans to build the airport, the two sides agreed that the debts left over to the SAR Government should not exceed HK$5 billion; if the amount of debts exceeds that sum, the matter must first be negotiated between the two sides. The future Hong Kong SAR Government will be totally independent financially, and the Chinese Government will not take one cent away from it. Now, on the new airport issue, the Chinese side shows special concern about and insists on the two figures, HK$25 billion and HK$5 billion, out of consideration for a sound financial basis for the Hong Kong SAR Government so that SAR taxpayers will be spared additional burden. The question lies in the fact that the British side has failed to perform its commitment in the memorandum of understanding and show consideration for Hong Kong's future, but always attempted to acquire as much money as possible for its motherland through building the new airport. Consequently, a financial plan by which "the British Hong Kong Government takes out loans, the SAR Government will repay the debts" surfaced. According to the first plan, some HK$70 billion loan would be taken out, which was around 15 times greater than the sum stipulated in the memorandum, equivalent to approximately three times the total of the financial reserve to be left to the SAR Government. The third plan would still involve a loan of some HK$40 billion. And the fourth plan would take out some HK $23 million, 4.7 times the sum stipulated in the Memorandum. On the one hand, the British Hong Kong Government would leave the Hong Kong SAR Government HK $25 billion financial reserve; on the other, it would leave the SAR Government a debt of some HK $23 billion. Is it not true that the British Hong Kong side attempts to make things very difficult for the SAR Government? How can Hong Kong residents agree to that? The arguments between the two sides over the new airport has all along centered around the issue of whether or not consideration should be shown for Hong Kong residents. Representing Hong Kong residents' interests, the Chinese side has engaged in talks with the British side for two years or so; it has persisted in principle, while expressing extremely great patience and due flexibility. On the issue of taking out loans, the Chinese side has actually handled the matter with some flexibility. Based on the stipulation in the memorandum that "taking out any loans exceeding the sum of HK$5 billion must first acquire unanimous agreement of the two sides to the proposal on making the loan," the Chinese side is willing to conduct truth-seeking discussions with the British side to seek a rational settlement. We may put it that in discussing the issue of the new airport financial arrangements, the Chinese side has already shown great sincerity and exerted very great efforts. So long as the British side is willing to cooperate and show consideration for Hong Kong residents' interests, it will not be difficult to settle the differences. The Sino-British Airport Committee's discussion on the new airport financial arrangements held yesterday has made pleasing progress. We believe that the British side has also exerted some efforts. However, experts of the two sides will continue to contact each other in drafting a summary of the meeting, and a comprehensive agreement on the new airport financial arrangements is yet to come. From the statements by team leaders of both sides yesterday, we can see that the two sides have reached common understanding on some basic issues; however, "there are sill some specific issues and wording to be studied," which calls for the common efforts of experts from both sides. We hope that the two sides will show mutual understanding and make concessions to each other in studying specific issues and wording, while bearing Hong Kong residents' interests in mind to complete the drafting of the summary as quickly as possible. Even if the two sides reach an agreement on the new airport financial arrangements, it only means that a solution to implementing one aspect of the memorandum is found. In handling all sorts of issues related to the new airport, the spirit of the memorandum and the principle of cost and economic returns, as well as avoiding burden to the SAR Government should persist. From now on, in handling all important issues straddling 30 June 1997 in relation with the airport project, such as the establishment of the airport administration and advisory committee, both sides should conduct negotiations in accordance with the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the memorandum in the spirit of cooperation. Any behavior in violation of commitment and trampling the agreement will jeopardize the building of the new airport and Hong Kong residents' long-range interests.
