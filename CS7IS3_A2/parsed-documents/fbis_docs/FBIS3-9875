Until such time as the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] or the candidate himself makes a decision on this matter, the candidacy remains in force. [Begin recording] [Pawlak] Apart from this matter, there is an entire series of other problems that must be taken into account. A decision was made by the Council of Ministers yesterday, in the presence of the president, on the presentation of an application for membership in the EU. The decisions of the president on the matter of the budget law await us, and this decision has a very significant and important meaning from both an internal and an external point of view. Even if this budget does not fully fulfill all expectations, it is still an exceptionally important matter--that the decision on this matter be a very serious one, taking into account the needs of the economy and of society because, after all, this budget also contains amendments and modifications decided in parliament. An important matter is the decision on the electoral law to parish councils. Here, we will shortly have elections to parish self-governments and the Senate by-elections. This shows that the relationship between the government and the president ought to have a substantive and concrete character. That is how it ought to be seen. [Unidentified correspondent] Discussions are in progress among politicians on the subject of a possible coming together, as between the Polish Peasant Party and the Belweder camp, at the cost of the SLD. How do you judge the permanency of the current coalition? [Pawlak] I think that the facts show the reality at the moment. The coalition is behaving in a manner that is in accord, and these relationships of which I spoke earlier ought to be seen in their entirety. Then they take into account all the circumstances, both those associated with the functioning of the coalition, with the functioning of the government, and those of the office of the president. All of these activities ought to take into account the expectations and needs of society and the interests of the state, the interests of Poland. [end recording]
