The celebration was held under the slogan "Arabs and Kurds: One Hand in Defense of Great Iraq." Vice President Taha Yasin Ramadan, member of the Revolution Command Council and representative of the president of the republic, delivered a speech at the celebration. At the outset, he conveyed greetings from leader President Saddam Husayn, may God watch over him, to the attendees, wishing them continued success. Taha Yasin Ramadan added: On this day, 24 years ago, the glorious 17-30 July revolution made an important national achievement by issuing the historic 11 March Statement to resolve the Kurdish question peacefully and democratically. This solution was meant to serve as a strong and broad basis for Iraqi national unity between Arabs and Kurds. The solution was also an embodiment of the true principles of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party and the policy of the glorious 17-30 July revolution, as well as its true, sincere belief in the legitimate rights of other ethnic groups under the greater umbrella of Iraq and the unity of its land and people. Taha Yasin Ramadan added: The Iraqis -- Arabs and Kurds -- warmly welcomed the historic 11 March statement. They were aware of the great objectives and noble meanings behind this statement of national unity. The leader president put an end to the fighting among brothers, the sons of one nation. On the achievement of the great objectives of the 11 March Statement, people all over Iraq held big celebrations, from the farthest village in southern Iraq to the farthest village in northern Iraq. Men and women, youth and children, all took part in these celebrations to express their true joy over this great victory by leader President Saddam Husayn, may God watch over him. He went on: In the glorious Saddam's al-Qadisiyah [war with Iran], our Kurdish people were the faithful guards and brave defenders of their great Iraq in the north, center, and south, whether with the Armed Forces or the sectors of the People's Army. During the war, the Kurdish people acted as an impregnable bulwark in the face of the Iranian aggressors and the agents who tried more than once to mislead them, divest them of their true Iraqi character, and urge them to change their strong allegiance to the unified, independent Iraq of Arabs and Kurds. Also, during the immortal Mother of Battles, the sons of our Kurdish people demonstrated an honorable stand, just like the free Iraqis, by holding fast in the face of a fierce 30-state aggression. They also resisted tonnes of bombs and missiles dropped and fired by the aggressors against their installations, schools, homes, and mosques. The 30-state coalition and its agents were alarmed by this great Iraqi cohesion. Thus, they initiated a second episode of treason and treachery, assigning it to small agents, who inherited treason and agentry from their fathers, the large agents. They tried to mislead the sons of our Kurdish people by using slogans whose falsity became clearer day after day. The agents sought, with U.S., French, and British spears, to divide Iraq and separate its north from its center and south. Jalal Talabani and Mas'ud Barzani, the two traitors, and their gangs donated the land of our beloved north to serve as a den for Zionists, Americans, and their allies, paying no heed to their oppression of our Kurdish people, who adhere to their revolutionary leadership and who live under the shade of Iraq's big umbrella and the 17-30 July revolution. The Kurdish people have known the sweet taste of the revolution and reaped its fruits and gains; primarily peace, security, and prosperity. Taha Yasin Ramadan added: After many meetings, with flexibility and goodwill to resolve problems through constructive dialogue based on full national unity, the leadership is now convinced that the leaders of those cliques are agents of the foreigner and care only about their personal interests and those of their masters. Those agents are using the Kurdish question to achieve gains. They cannot live in peace, security, and national unity because they have grown accustomed to living on the crumbs and leftovers of foreigners. They have also grown accustomed to a life of humiliation, subservience, and slavery to satisfy the colonialist policy of their masters and their rotten personal whims that reject dignity, freedom, and national unity. Taha Yasin Ramadan asserted: Our great Kurdish people, who have, since time immemorial, adhered to Iraq -- in terms of its land, people, history, civilization, and brotherhood with the Arabs of Iraq -- will rise and rebel against this agent clique. The 36th parallel will be shattered by the Kurds of Iraq, just as the Arabs of Iraq shattered the 32d parallel. All attempts at temptation and deception will not fool the sons of our Kurdish people, who are suffering under foreign occupation, the domination of agent cliques, poverty, hunger, and lack of security. Taha Yasin Ramadan concluded: All methods of deception, falsification, and allegations are short lived, no matter how long they persist. All these methods will be exposed as the days go by. Our beloved north will return shortly to the mother homeland and the greater umbrella. National unity will be restored to great Iraq, in terms of the land and people, from its north to its south. The policies of agentry, treason, and subservience will be defeated so Iraqis will continue to live under the aegis of the wise, prudent leadership of the symbol leader, Saddam Husayn, may God watch over him. Tomorrow is not far off for those awaiting it. Glad tidings for those who patiently persevere. [Koranic verse] Afterward, Baha'-al-Din Ahmad, speaker of the Legislative Council of the Kurdistan Autonomous Region, made a speech in which he asserted that the Kurdish people will intensify their struggle to return to the state of law and order, which is lacking under the agent, sabotage cliques sitting in the lap of their foreign masters. Those cliques have turned the Kurdistan paradise into a hell of death and destruction. Ahmad Muhammad Sa'id al-Atrushi, secretary of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, also made a speech. He underlined the current looting of resources and the unjust control of the Kurdish people's means of livelihood in the Kurdistan region. This is happening under false slogans that do not deceive our Kurdish people and honorable figures worldwide. He said the actions of the agent, traitorous cliques have exposed their intentions and shown their true colors and their miserable situation. Afterward, Majid Rashid al-Zibari, secretary of the Kurdistan Revolutionary Party, made a speech. He said the autonomy of the Kurdistan region and the national rights achieved for the Kurdish people are among the major reasons for the plots of hostile, evil forces, which persistently seek to undermine Iraq's sovereignty and the unity of its people and pure land. The celebration was attended by comrade 'Abd-al-Rahman Ahmad 'Abd-al-Rahman, member of the Iraq Command and official in charge of the Ninawa and Dahuk organizations of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party; Ja'far 'Abd-al-Karim al-Barzanji, chairman of the Executive Council of the Kurdistan Autonomous Region; as well as the council's secretaries general; several members of the Legislative Council of the Kurdistan Autonomous Region; and a large audience.
