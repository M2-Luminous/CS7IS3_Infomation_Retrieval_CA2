Launching a wide-ranging review of the sector's future, Mr Eggar said of the possible privatisation: "It would not be practical to do it in this parliament." His comments are a significant setback to the hopes of Nuclear Electric, operator of nuclear power plants in England and Wales, which has been pressing strongly for privatisation. Although Mr Eggar did not elaborate on why an early sale was impractical, the Department of Trade and Industry [DTI] -- where he is a minister -- is already preoccupied with privatisation of the Post Office, among other issues. Privatisation of the nuclear industry would lead to a highly charged political debate. Tories fear the Labour party could make political capital of the issue in the run-up to a general election. But Mr Eggar's dismissal of an early privatisation could annoy some in the Treasury, where ministers are much more enthusiastic about a sell-off. Differences of opinion between the Treasury and DTI are believed to have been a factor in delaying the review, which the government had hoped to start last year. The DTI's review of the nuclear power industry will run in tandem with a Department of Environment inquiry, also announced yesterday, into the disposal of radioactive waste. The preliminary results of this investigation are due to be announced in the summer and are likely to feed into the nuclear power review, which will probably last longer. Environmental organisations welcomed the waste review yesterday, saying it would expose problems that would make the power industry more difficult to privatise in the long term. In spite of Mr Eggar's caution, the DTI has agreed to consider privatisation as a key element of its review, which will also focus on the economic and commercial viability of new nuclear stations. The government imposed a moratorium on building nuclear power stations other than Sizewell B in Suffolk when it excluded nuclear power from its plans to privatise the electricity industry in 1989. The government said its review would not consider whether Sizewell B should be brought on stream as planned by Nuclear Electric later this year. This was a matter for "appropriate ministers and authorities." The review will also consider nuclear waste and decommissioning liabilities.
