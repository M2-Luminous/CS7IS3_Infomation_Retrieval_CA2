These figures, released by Wang Tao, president of the China National Petroleum Corp. (CNPC), at a national oil work conference here today, are both higher than the government-set output targets. This is an effort to match the development of the oil industry to the demand of the country's rapid economic growth, Wang told the conference. He described the situation of the oil industry as "good", although it falls short of demand and has become one of the bottlenecks of the national economy. China produced 139 million tons of crude and 15.9 billion cubic meters of natural gas, thanks to strengthened exploration and development of oil fields. However, the ever-expanding demand has pushed China onto the verge of becoming a "net oil importer." Wang called for intensive exploration for additional resources to prepare China for the next century. China expects to extract 200 million tons of oil and gas in oil equivalent by the year 2000, according to an ambitious plan. To this end, China has embarked on a strategy of stabilizing the production in the eastern part of China and developing reserves in the western part. The eastern part of China, which includes such important oil fields as Daqing, Shengli and Liaohe, is China's main oil producer. CNPC will invest billions of yuan in a bid to maintain the production level in the eastern part of the country. New technology and management will be adopted in the Daqing oilfield in order to keep its annual oil output well above 55 million tons up to the turn of the century. The western part of China, especially the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, is regarded as a key alternative. Its crude output for the first time topped 10 million tons for the first time [as received] in 1993. This year the figure is expected to rise to 11.9 million tons, Wang said. Exploration will be carried out both intensively and extensively, he added. CNPC is striving to strike a balance between oil output and new recoverable reserves and between capital input and output, according to Wang. As the government eases off restrictions on oil prices, the industry has wiped out red inks. However, Wang warned against high cost and low efficiency in oil production. Wang welcomed the participation in oil exploration and development by other sectors, enterprises, localities, people from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao, overseas Chinese and foreign investors. CNPC has announced the second round of international bidding for risk exploration in 26 blocks and 11 projects to enhance oil recovery in the existing oilfields. Preparatory work for the third round bidding is to start soon and more blocks in southwestern and western China are expected to open to foreign bidders. Wang admitted that China's oil will not be able to meet the demand by the year 2000. He said crude import will depend on economic growth but China still needs to sell some oil abroad for foreign currency, technology and equipment.
