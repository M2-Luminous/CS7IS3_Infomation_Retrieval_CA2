[Frayj] Thank you. [Al-Aswad] We start this dialogue by asking you to fill us in on any of the new dimensions regarding the incident at the al- Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron at dawn on Friday. [Frayj] The criminal act that took place at dawn on Friday at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron can only be explained by the fact that it is based on racists who hate the presence of the Arabs. Killing worshipers who are kneeling in prayer to God Almighty indiscriminately and without prior warning is an organized crime with very dangerous political significance. It did not take place in a vacuum. All the sons of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip have been terribly hurt and shocked by this act. We are now demanding international protection. We are demanding that the criminals in the Israeli settlements be disarmed. We are demanding that all worshipers--Muslim, Jew, or Christian--be prevented from entering any holy place carrying weapons. Under no circumstances should any person be allowed to carry weapons in a place of worship. Second, we are demanding that a high-ranking judicial committee be formed to investigate the circumstances of the crime. This has cast dark shadows on the peace process. How can there be peace when the settlers tamper with security as they please? The successive Israeli governments for the past 26 years have not tried to curb the belligerence of the settlers or their attacks on Arab citizens. The settlers all over the West Bank are trying to occupy Arab lands to expand the territory they have. [passage omitted] [Al-Aswad] Mr. Frayj, what, in your opinion, should the scope of Palestinian action be at the United Nations to secure international protection for the Palestinian people? [Frayj] We ask the Security Council to provide protection for the Palestinian Arab citizens in the occupied territories from the attacks of the settlers and the army, which take place repeatedly without any deterrent. For example, over 15 Palestinian youths were killed by the army under false pretexts, while not a single Israeli soldier was injured. [Al-Aswad] In light of these circumstances, Mr. Ilyas Frayj, who has responsibility for the security of the Palestinian citizens? [Frayj] I believe that security is the responsibility of the present authority, the responsibility of Israel. Since Israel does not provide us with the basic minimum security required, we demand that the United Nations and the Security Council form an international force to keep the peace and provide security. [Al-Aswad] You noted in this interview that Israel is responsible for what happened. What are the limits of this responsibility? And is it true what is being said -- that 20-50 Israeli armed men participated in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre? [Frayj] Israeli sources claim that only one person carried out the operation. I doubt that. I hold Israel fully responsible for the total security of the Arab citizens and residents of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip so long as it controls the situation there. Either the Palestinian police should be allowed to enter the West Bank and Gaza Strip immediately, or an international force should be deployed to protect the citizens. However, I insist that the settlers should be disarmed and prevented from entering places of worship carrying arms. [Al-Aswad] How do you see the general atmosphere in the occupied territories after the recent massacre? And will it affect the credibility of the current peace process? [Frayj] The vast majority of citizens now do not believe the peace negotiations are useful since they do not include the issue of the settlers. The vast majority are now confused. What is the use of having talks while 120,000 settlers romp and kill people in the West Bank for no reason whatsoever? The Israeli Army sometimes helps them but it often turns a blind eye and does nothing. The settlers are very spoiled and behave like cowboys [preceding word in English] in the occupied territories. The Israeli settler who committed this crime did it because he thought he was a cowboy dealing with Red Indians. [Al-Aswad] Mr. Frayj, thank you for this dialogue on Voice of the Arabs.
