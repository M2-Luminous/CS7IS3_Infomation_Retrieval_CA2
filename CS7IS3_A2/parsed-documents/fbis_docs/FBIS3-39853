The Liberal Party will be the main enemy in the campaign leading up to the election set for 9 June. The leading candidate for the SDP, Kirsten Jensen, acknowledged following a news conference at Christiansborg yesterday that it is the open strategy of the party to hit the Liberals as much as possible during the campaign. "We will try to confront the Liberals during the entire campaign. Because they are most visible. We want to meet with Liberal figures and debate with them at every opportunity we can arrange," said Jensen. During the election the SDP wants to sell itself under the slogan "A human Europe." "We will demonstrate that it makes a difference whether one votes nonsocialist or SDP. Social democracy stands for defending the national compromise [Edinburgh opt-out package]," said Jensen. "Some people are trying to make this into a third referendum on Danish membership relations with the [European] Union, or a referendum on the Western European Union. But this is irrelevant," said the SDP member of the European Parliament.
