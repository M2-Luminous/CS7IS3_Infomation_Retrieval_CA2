"I am extremely anxious, not so much about the fact that four Serbian planes have been shot down, but rather in the light of the observations of sudden movements of heavy weapons in (the exclusion zone -- BELGA editor's note) within the 20 kilometers surrounding Sarajevo, and also following the outburst of renewed acts of hostility elsewhere in Bosnia," highlighted the foreign minister, speaking on the sidelines of the European Union's enlargement talks. Mr. Claes believes it is clear that the aircraft that were brought down most definitely belong to the Serbian forces. The minister also confirmed that six or seven tanks belonging to the Bosnian Serb forces had been moved within the safe area surrounding Sarajevo. "Apparently, these arms had not been withdrawn or placed under UN control, and had evidently not been registered" by NATO forces, added Mr. Claes, giving rise to the suspicion that the Serbs might have concealed some of their equipment. "The cease-fire around Sarajevo is imperilled once again, but I think that the international community must surely be capable of preventing the situation from deteriorating," continued the foreign minister. "However, I am less fearful of an escalation of violence in Sarajevo than in other regions of Bosnia," he concluded.
