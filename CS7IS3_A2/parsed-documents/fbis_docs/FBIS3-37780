The fact of a joint operation of units of the two armies, which were adversaries in the recent past, is not surprising. However, details of such events are always interesting. Here is Colonel General Georgiy Kondratyev, Russian deputy defense minister, with the details for "Slavyanka." [Begin Kondratyev recording] It is the first time in the existence of the Russian Armed Forces, and, beyond it, in the whole period of the former Soviet Union, that such exercises will take place. They will be joint, and will involve the 27th Motor Rifle Division of the Volga military district of the Russian Armed Forces and the 3d Infantry Division of the U.S. Army. Currently we -- that is myself, as deputy defense minister, the infantry command, and the command of the Volga military district -- we have already designed these exercises. According to our design, the main aims of these exercises are: First -- to jointly consider issues of a possible planning of peace keeping operations -- which documents are necessary for them, how the personnel should be trained -- and also, during the exercises themselves we will practice the real actions, an approximation to actions of U.S. and Russian subunits in conflict zones, i.e. real peacekeeping operations. Not only the headquarters of those two divisions, but also some subunits will be involved from both sides, because these are command and staff exercises that also include troops. We agreed that from 200 to 250 men, up to two companies, will take part on each side and will use their usual military hardware and means of reinforcement. I believe that these exercises will go very well, and our officers will obtain certain expertise in planning and deploying peacekeeping operations not only in CIS countries but possibly anywhere in the world. [passage omitted] Why has this become necessary? From 1992, as you know, we have deployed peace keeping operations in the Dniester area, in South Ossetia, and also in North Ossetia and Ingushetia to some degree -- there is a group of troops there. We also we took part, to a degree, in the Abkhaz-Georgian conflict, and the recent agreement between Russian President Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin and Mr. Shevardnadze in Tbilisi envisages that Russians may deploy a peace- keeping operation in Abkhazia under the umbrella of the CSCE and maybe the United Nations as well. We have been working toward it. That is why there is an obvious necessity today to share experiences by way of organizing such exercises. We will continue to have exercises. I believe this is useful for both the Russian and the American sides. It is also useful for other countries. [end recording]
