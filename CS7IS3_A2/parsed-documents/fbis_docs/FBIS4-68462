Shkarban, President of of the Association of Farmers of Ukraine: "`Inexpensive' Fuel"] [Text] According to the decision of the Cabinet of Ministers of 9 February 1994, the exchange of farm production for material-technical resources is foreseen. The concern "Ukragrotekhservis" will realize this in exchange for the funds allotted for the financing of the state contract for the purchase of agricultural production. In particular, it is foreseen that 28.7 trillion karbovantsi will be used for the purchase of petroleum products, including 13.3 trillion karbovantsi for spring field work. From this sum, the Ministry of Finance has already paid 630 billion karbovantsi to "Ukragrotekhservis." This concern, which has great advantages in transportation and tariffs, buying hard currency at a fixed rate (12,610 karbovantsi per dollar), for the use of state resources for wheat storage and processing enterprises, would have to do this so that charges would not exceed 50 percent of the customs cost of the fuel. Therefore "Ukragrotekhservis" raised the price for petroleum products and gets 4.3 trillion karbovantsi for this from the producers, including 2.5 trillion karbovantsi for gasoline. This happened because the ratio of prices for so called "inexpensive" fuel is worse than the ratio of prices on the world market. For example, at the "inexpensive" wholesale price for diesel fuel of 3.9 million karbovantsi per tonne and the starting cost of grain at 1.29 million karbovantsi per tonne, the ratio becomes approximately one to three, while on the world market it is one to 1.5 (in the commercial structures of Ukraine, one to 2.12). Reference to the point that, supposedly, the ratio of one to three will be lowered by future indexation is baseless, since there is no guarantee that, with the change in the price for grain as a result of indexation, the price for fuel will not also change at the same time. In our view, it would be better if the state paid in advance with funds allotted in the budget (on the basis of a futures agreement) for the full price, equivalent to the world price, that part of the contract, which the producer transfers to the state as a pledge for the future harvest. The agricultural producers have to consider seriously everything while making contracts for the sale of grain, sunflower and sugarbeet, so that another robbery of the villagers by state structures will not take place.
