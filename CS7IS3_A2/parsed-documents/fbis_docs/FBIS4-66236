The first paragraph in italics is a source-supplied note.] [Text] "Return to GATT" will also have a positive impact on China's banking industry and economic development. For example, it will increase the foreign fund utilization channels, enhance the industry's sense of competition, and will raise the technological and management standards. It will also promote the thorough reform of the financial system and the internationalization and marketization of China's financial system. However, we will not deal with those aspects in this article. The day of China's recovering its status as a GATT signatory is drawing closer and closer. When that day comes, according to the "market admission" principle, China's banking industry will face serious challenges from foreign banks, especially banks from the developed nations. This article is an attempt to analyze this issue and to suggest some solutions. I. Specific Impact of "Returning To GATT" on China's Banking Industry The "return to GATT" will have the following major impact on China's banking industry: 1. It will diminish the regulation and control functions of China's monetary policy. The main goal of China's monetary policy is to stabilize prices and promote economic growth. The central bank's tools for implementing the monetary policy include deposit reserves, discounting and rediscounting, lending and relending, total credit loan control, and administrative measures. Since reform and opening up, and depending on the needs of economic development at different times, China has utilized the above monetary policy tools to continuously regulate and control the amount of currency input in order to maintain basic balance between currency circulation and industrial and agricultural productions and commodity circulation. Currently, China's product prices are basically stable and the economy is growing at a fairly rapid rate. This proves that our monetary policy is basically sound and can function to regulate and control the economy. But in the wake of the opening up of China's banking industry, some trans-national banks will move in, and because of their presence, when we try to implement a tight monetary policy, some of them may continue to obtain funds from their overseas branches and continue to make loans to their customers. Their business will not be affected by, but may even jeopardize, our tight money policy, and consequently we will not be able to effectively utilize our monetary policy's regulatory mechanisms to control the economy. In this sense, it will greatly diminish the effectiveness of our familiar traditional monetary mechanism where the central bank's tightening of the money supply will always lead to the contraction of the domestic economy. This no doubt will be a serious challenge to our traditional financial system. 2. It will make the implementation of China's credit policy even more difficult. The principle behind China's credit fund management is central planning, allocation of funds, actual loans based on actual deposits, and ease of interbank lending and borrowing. The emphasis of a credit loan policy built on these premises is to maintain volume and structural balance. The goal is to promote the benign fund cycle and improve economic efficiency in all sectors and departments. Volume balance refers to the compatibility between currency issuance and industrial and agricultural production and product circulation. Structural balance refers to guaranteeing the funds needed by the state's key industries and cutting back on funds needed by ordinary trades and businesses. Currently, China's specialized banks' total credit is balanced and allocated centrally at the People's Bank headquarters. This policy lends support to the realization of our macroeconomic development goals and structural goals. It gives expression to the country's so called preferential development policy, which is a structurally biased policy that supports certain industries and restricts others. This approach may to some extent limit the specialized banks' automony and flexibility, but for a country that has scarce funds and is structurally unbalanced, it is a necessity. But foreign-funded banks have a very different approach. They adopt the usual international loan percentages and risk management methods. Their loan percentage is based on the amount of deposits and capital fund and is not controlled or constrained by volume and structural balance. That is to say, their credit policy is very liberalized. Therefore, how to coordinate the differences between international practices and China's own credit structure policy is another problem China's banking industry will be facing. 3. China's existing foreign exchange control system will face serious challenges. China adopts a tight foreign exchange control policy. The guiding principle of our exchange control is to "centralized control and unify management." Based on this principle, the state exchange control department has promulgated a series of very strict exchange control policy and laws and regulations, but to meet the needs of reform and opening up, the department has begun to reform and adjust the exchange control system and ease control somewhat. For example, we have implemented a managed, variable exchange rate system; set up a foreign exchange regulation market; and gradually eased the administrative control of foreign exchange revenue and expenditure and exchange remittances to and from the country. In particular, beginning on 1 January of this year, the state has adopted a managed, variable RMB exchange rate that is based on market supply and demand. It was a major move in the restructuring of the foreign exchange system and even for the restructuring of the entire financial system. But under the new system, administrative-type foreign exchange control measures still play a very important role, and the entrance of foreign-funded banks no doubt will pose a challenge to the current foreign exchange management system. Therefore, we must continue to pursue in-depth reform of the existing foreign exchange management system to meet the needs of the opening up of China's banking industry and international practices. 4. China's finanical institutions will face intense competition. Since the 1980's, competition in the international banking industry has been intense. The developed nations utilize their fund and technological advantages to take and maintain their lead. It can be expected that in the future, most foreign-funded banks that come to China will be financial institutions from the developed nations and regions. They not only have substantial financial strength and advanced technological means and management methods, but they also have abundant knowledge about and experience in international market competition. And if we look at our own banks, our loan funds are controlled by the state's credit policy, we are behind in technological and management skills, and our services lack quality. We will be no match for the foreign banks, and we will inevitably lose as we try to compete for business. This situation has already happened in Shenzhen and Xiamen and other SEZs. Because our financial institutions lack initiative and versatility, and their services lack quality, many businesses have already been taken away by the foreign-funded or Sino-foreign joint venture banks. Take foreign exchange settlement for example. We have already lost a lot of business there, which is very worrisome. 5. It will make the management of the financial institutions more difficult. Exercising administrative control over the financial institutions is an important part of the central bank's function as a "government bank." Today, the control and supervision of China's financial institutions extend mainly to the following: The scope of business activities, assets and liabilities, credit forms and tools, fund settlement, interest rates, cash input and withdrawal, trust investment, financial market, and foreign exchange businesses. Yet, because the restructuring of China's financial system is very incomplete, even though the state is very strict with its control and supervision of the financial institutions, signs of some financial institutions violating laws and regulations are still apparant everywhere despite repeated prohibitions. Once foreign-funded banks begin to move into this country en masse, the state's control will face even more serious challenges. This is because based on today's method of managing the foreign-funded financial institutions, foreign-funded banks that set up branches in China must have $20 billion in capital. Although this guarantees that the foreign-funded financial institutions will have the scope and the business capability, we should also see that by the same token, they will be huge trans-national bank groups with advanced technologies and substantial business experience that can make use of their global network to evade taxes, remit their profits and capital, or engage in speculative operations. These will make controlling the financial institutions much more complicated and much more difficult. 6. Foreign-funded banks will ignore risks and engage in "aggressive" operations. No doubt, most foreign-funded banks that come to China will be trans-national groups. Their assets are separated by nationality and their business is all-encompassing; they profits are substantial, which gives them tremendous ability to handle risks. In comparison, China's financial institutions may have a large, well-equipped network at home, and the headquarters and branches are tightly-knit, but they are not global, trans-national banks in any sense, and their business operations are primarily domestic, and they have little to do with the outside world. Therefore, from the asset standpoint, it makes the Chinese banks' fund utilization more risky. If they run into trouble and lose money, there is no way they can remedy the loss via other channels or in other ways. When the foreign-funded banks run into trouble and lose money, they can get help from other profitable branch organizations in other countries or regions. Meanwhile, they can also use the profits they make elsewhere to engage in "aggressive" operations here. They can use lower interest rate to dump funds here as a means to defeat their competitors and achieve their high profit goal. II. Some Suggestions Currently, more than 130 financial institutions from 29 nations have set up more than 240 representative offices in the SEZs and 14 coastal open cities. Among them, 52 are business-oriented organs. Their momentum far surpasses that of Asia's "Four Small Dragons" in the early days. Once China returns to GATT, this process will move even faster. To reduce the impact of foreign-funded banks on China's banking industry after our "return to GATT," to increase our ability to fight them, and to stabilize our own socio-economic lives, we hereby make the following suggestions: 1. Promptly change the financial policy and the industry personnel's ideologies and concepts and make the financial institutions more conscious about competition. Ideologies and concepts play a critical role in people's thinkings and in their activities to change society. If we use the correct ideologies to guide their actual practices and activities, we can succeed; otherwise we will fail. Thus, under the new conditions, our financial decisions as well as industry personnel must adopt the kind of thinking and concept that is consistent with the socialist market economy and GATT. We must pay attention to the real issue of opening up and gradually liberalizing the banking industry as stipulated by GATT and consciously put this issue before everything else. We must plan and design our financial tasks meticulously and handle every link of the financial tasks diligently, so as to raise the financial institutions' consciousness about competition. We must compete with the foreign-funded banks with courage and strategy and raise our service standards amid competition to meet the foreign banks' challenge. 2. Fully utilize GATT's exceptional provisions extended to the developing nations to cushion the impact of the foreign-funded banks on our banking industry. According to the pertinent GATT principles and provisions, developing nations enjoy certain preferential treatments, one of which is the rule on protecting the threatened domestic industries, and another is the extension of deadline for radically opening up the banking industry. These will help us to be better prepared and to improve our banking industry's ability to resist the foreign assault. We should take full advantage of these favorable regulations and go all out to raise our banking industry's service standards, so that we can meet the needs of international economic development as soon as possible. Meanwhile, we must protect certain domains and regions where our banking industry is still immature and allow foreign-funded banks to enter into designated financial markets selectively to let them launch their business in markets that will benefit us the most. In this way, we can cushion some of the impact of the foreign-funded banks and gain some time and initiative and in turn help our banking industry link tracks with the international banking industry in a steady way. 3. Promptly formulate laws to administer the foreign-funded banks and strengthen their supervision To acclerate the legislative process is an important means to guarantee effective administration of the foreign-funded banks. Only through legislation can we systemize and standardize the foreign bank management system and effectively protect our rights from infringement. In addition, according to a GATT "grandfather clause," "certain laws and regulations already established prior to a signatory's participation in any agreement should be honored," and this makes it essential for us to speed up the formulation of laws to manage the foreign-funded banks. We should promptly gather the finanical experts and economists to study and discuss the matter and formulate the laws on administering the foreign banks as soon as possible. Those laws should mainly stipulate the foreign-funded banks' types of business, sizes, and treatment. The emphasis should be on the utilization of home currency, that is, to put tighter restrictions on the utilization of home currency to ensure that our banks can make full use of our home currency resources while forcing the foreign banks to bring in their own funds to dull their competitive edge and guarantee the leading role of our financial institutions and the effective implementation of the state's general and specific financial policies and promote the coordinated and steady development of the nation's economy. 4. Accelerate the restructuring of China's finanical system and set up a new financial system that is compatible with the socialist market economy and international practices. From the objective point of view, the above-mentioned protective and restrictive measures are measures of expedience that only treat the symptoms but cannot cure the disease. To truly solve the problems, we must accelerate the pace of financial reform and broaden and deepen the restructuring of the financial system and set up a new system that is compatible with the socialist market system and international practices. Therefore, reshaping China's financial system in accordance with the principles of the market economy and the integration of global economic and finanical systems is the only way to increase our banking industry's ability to fight off future competition and to survive and develop. Today we must seize the moment and reflect on and re-create various aspects of the existing financial system, including improving the quality of the personnel, separating business-oriented from policy-oriented operations, loosening foreign exchange control, and modernizing and internationalizing our business technologies and administration. Only in this way can we raise our banking industry's standard to enable us to compete with the banking industry of any nation in the world and remain victorious.
