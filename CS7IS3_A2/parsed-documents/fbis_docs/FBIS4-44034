With preliminary voting figures of 1,543 against 301, Vivianne Franzen's party executive won approval in a vote by 2,960 party members, and it wants now to set the election campaign in motion. However, the enthusiasm of the new party chairman, wearing red culottes and a jacket with a white sailor collar, was dampened by the fact that the battle for the party's funds seems to be continuing. Day-to-day payments can be made as long as [rival party leader] Harriet Colliander or members of the party executive elected at the regular party congress in April and members of the new party executive countersign the bills. But neither of the executives will be able to get their hands on the money needed for an election campaign as long as they are blocked by the other side. "If she carries on like this after this vote, her only aim is to sink the party," Vivianne Franzen declared while the old party executive gathered for a meeting elsewhere in the Riksdag building. Those who support Colliander do not consider the new executive to have been appointed according to the party's statutes. Therefore it is not legitimate and should not have access to party funds that currently are in excess of 7 million kronor. Stefan Kihlberg, the party secretary on the former party executive, has wanted the matter to be brought before a court, and according to Franzen the Stockholm District Court will announce within 14 days whether it intends to investigate the matter. Yesterday evening the two party factions met to discuss the problems regarding party funds, among other things. Vivianne Franzen left the group before 2100 hours, and the meeting broke up just before midnight. Stefan Kihlberg said after the meeting that the Colliander executive does not accept the vote by the party membership, but remains firm that the matter should be settled in court. Taking as its point of departure the party program, NYD will raise issues such as the budget deficit, refugee policy, and youth unemployment in the election campaign, Vivianne Franzen, seconded by Sten Dybeck, said. Both expressed regrets that the established parties are incapable of solving the nation's problems. "This shows that New Democracy is needed." Proposed spending cuts include a 50-percent cut in development aid, reductions in the cost of accepting refugees, and naturally a cut in the financial support for political parties. A 50-percent cut in the value-added tax on services is also in the program. Vivianne Franzen described NYD as a youth party. "I myself can attract beer-drinking youths under 20. They are my fans," she said laughing.
