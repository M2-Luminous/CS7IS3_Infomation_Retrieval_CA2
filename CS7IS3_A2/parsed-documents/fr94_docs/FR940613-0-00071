FR940613-0-00071 FR940613-0-00015 The definition of a maxi-cube proposed in the SNPRM has been adopted in this final rule, with slight modifications for clarity. It should be noted that the word ``semitrailer'' used in the statute and Committee Report has been changed to ``trailer or semitrailer,'' since some of the vehicles built as maxi-cubes in recent years are equipped with pintle-hooks, non-load-bearing hitches used for full trailers. Others are equipped with load-bearing fifth-wheel hitches typical of semitrailers. This modification of the definition is well within the FHWA's authority to promulgate rules to accommodate specialized equipment. The SNPRM also proposed that maxi-cube vehicles should be measured with the adjustable-length drawbar (if so equipped) at its maximum extension, since we assumed that was how the drawbar would be positioned for over-the-road operations. The Pennsylvania DOT supported this proposal in its comments to the docket. It appears, however, that adjustable drawbars usually are not fully extended when the vehicle is in motion. Magna Van and Coca Cola commented that 24 inches is the normal distance between the first and second units of their maxi-cube vehicles during over-the-road operations, but that longer distances are used for access to driveways and transferring freight in off-road situations. Other information submitted to the docket indicated that 27 inches is probably the longest distance between cargo units for highway travel. However, there are times when a longer drawbar setting may be desirable, such as on rough terrain to keep the cargo boxes from hitting each other; in urban areas while making sharp turns; or while loading and unloading cargo from the front unit while the rear unit is attached. The maximum reported unit separation in these instances is 42 inches. The FHWA believes Congress intended the maxi-cube length limits to apply to vehicles in their normal operational configuration. We have concluded that the cargo capacity of these vehicles would be needlessly reduced if the rule required length measurements to be made with the drawbar at maximum extension, since that position is used only to assist in low-speed maneuvering or loading and unloading. The last sentence of ยง658.13(e)(4) has therefore been modified to read: If the maxi-cube vehicle is equipped with an adjustable drawbar, the 60- and 65-foot distances shall be measured with a drawbar spacing of not more than 27 inches. The drawbar may be temporarily extended beyond that distance to maneuver or load the vehicle.
