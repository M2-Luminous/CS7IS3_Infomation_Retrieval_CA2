FR940224-0-00014 FR940224-0-00002 FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 12 CFR Part 215 [Regulation O; Docket Nos. R&hyph;0800 and R&hyph;0809] Loans to Executive Officers, Directors, and Principal Shareholders of Member Banks; Loans to Holding Companies and Affiliates AGENCY: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Board is revising Regulation O to permit the aggregate limit on lending to insiders by eligible, adequately capitalized small banks to be increased from 100 percent of unimpaired capital and surplus to 200. The Board also is revising Regulation O to permit banks to follow alternative recordkeeping procedures on loans to insiders of affiliates, to narrow the definition of ``extension of credit,'' and to adopt certain exceptions to the general restrictions on lending to insiders and the special restrictions on lending to executive officers. Other minor revisions clarifying certain exemptions and conforming certain provisions to the enabling statutes are included as well. EFFECTIVE DATE: Effective February 18, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background The Board is making permanent, with certain additional qualifications, its interim rule permitting small, adequately capitalized banks to extend credit to insiders up to 200 percent of unimpaired capital and surplus, in circumstances where such lending is necessary to serve local credit needs or to attract directors. The Board also is adopting amendments to Regulation O (12 CFR part 215) designed to increase the ability of banks to make extensions of credit that pose minimal risk of loss, to eliminate recordkeeping requirements that impose a paperwork burden but do not significantly aid compliance with the regulation, and to remove certain transactions from the regulation's coverage consistent with bank safety and soundness. The above amendments are expected to increase the availability of credit, particularly in communities served by small banks, and to reduce the cost of compliance with the regulation. In view of the extensive changes made to Regulation O as a result of this rulemaking, the Board is restating subpart A of Regulation O as amended, rather than separately describing each amendment. The Board is making the rule effective immediately in order to prevent a lapse in the 200 percent lending limit available to eligible banks under the interim rule for loans to insiders, and to make all other provisions effective at the same time. II. The 200 Percent Aggregate Lending Limit Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 375b) restricts the amounts and terms of extensions of credit from a bank to executive officers, directors, and principal shareholders of the bank and its holding company affiliates and to any related interest of those persons (insiders). Section 306 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) 1 amended section 22(h) to impose an aggregate limit on the amount a bank may lend to its insiders as a class. See 12 U.S.C. 375b(5). In general, the limit is equal to 100 percent of the bank's unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. The Board is authorized, however, to make exceptions to the general limit for banks with deposits of less than $100 million ``if the Board determines that the exceptions are important to avoid constricting the availability of credit in small communities or to attract directors of such banks.'' 12 U.S.C. 375b(5)(C). The higher limit may not exceed 200 percent of the bank's unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. Id. 1 Pubic Law 102&hyph;242, Section 306, 105 Stat. 2236 (1991). Effective May 18, 1992, the Board amended Regulation O, which implements section 22(h), to incorporate the aggregate lending limit added by FDICIA. The general limit on lending to insiders and their related interests_100 percent of the bank's unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus_was adopted. The Board also decided as an interim measure to permit banks with deposits under $100 million to adopt a higher limit, not to exceed 200 percent of the bank's unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus, for a period of one year to expire May 18, 1993. The interim period was intended to allow the Board to consult with the other federal banking agencies and collect data on the lending practices of banks in order to analyze the effect of the aggregate lending limit on the availability of credit and service of directors. See 57 FR 22417, 22420, May 28, 1992. The Board subsequently extended the interim rule for six months, through November 18, 1993, in order to obtain public comments on whether the interim rule should be made permanent, modified, or permitted to expire. See 58 FR 28492, May 14, 1993. The Board thereafter extended the interim rule an additional three months, through February 18, 1994, in order to review the written comments, call reports of small banks, and relevant information from other governmental agencies. See 58 FR 61803, November 23, 1993.
