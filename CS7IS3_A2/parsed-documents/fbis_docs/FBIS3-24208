Early in the morning several persons, led by City Administrator V. Gildenberg, showed up in the office of T. Vadilyeva, the acting head of Sovetskiy Rayon administration. Two of them wore militia uniforms and were armed. After an "entertaining" conversation, T. Vadilyeva learned that she had been removed from the job, and the new appointee was N. Beletskiy, a former head of the city education department and a former candidate for a mayor. Our readers may recall that during the election campaign he stepped down as a candidate in favor of the current head of administration, V. Cherepkov. After that, V. Gildenberg, again with an escort, visited Pervomayskiy Rayon, where the head of administration, V. Pletnev, was relieved of his duties. His place was taken by V. Kalenik, a former deputy chairman of Sovetskiy Rayon Soviet. The same fate befell the head of Leninskiy Rayon administration S. Zhurmilov, whose chair will now be occupied by D. Ilyinskiy. One can only tell about him that he is 50 and is a retired Captain 1st Rank. By the way, S. Zhurmilov did not accept his dismissal and filed a court complaint. A strange personnel "reshuffling...." Especially keeping in mind that not too long ago the head of the Frunzenskiy Rayon administration was replaced--by a militia officer.
