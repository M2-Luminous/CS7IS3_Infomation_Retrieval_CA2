This protest action against the government's decision to reevaluate the assets of national economic enterprises was announced at a news conference today. Editors in chief of KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA, MOSKOVSKAYA PRAVDA, VECHERNYAYA MOSKVA, MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI, NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, and many other publications said that Resolution No. 1233 of 25 December would result in a 600 percent increase in printing costs and would, in fact, be tantamount to stifling the press. Journalists' unions of Russia and Moscow, the Association of Publishers and Editors in Chief, and the Fund for the Defense of Glasnost have demanded the following: that purpose-built allowances to publications be earmarked in order to continue issuing the numbers of copies prepaid by subscribers; that a special procedure for the implementation of the resolution in printing and communications industries be introduced; and that editorial collectives be offered real possibilities for privatizing printing works and related facilities. Stressing that the planned action was a forced measure, Vsevolod Bogdanov, chairman of the Union of Journalists of Russia, voiced the hope that the government would go halfway toward meeting the journalists' demands in the very near future. He said that a final decision on carrying out the action will be made tomorrow. Furthermore, the majority of regional publications in Russia are ready to participate. Radio and television journalists will back their colleagues.
