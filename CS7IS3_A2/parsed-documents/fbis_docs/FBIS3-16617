Kozyrev quoted Perry as saying that all countries willing to join NATO's Partnership for Peace program were equal. "It is also obvious, however, that Russia is a great power with its own interests. It would be strange if we were late arrivals," Kozyrev said meaning Partnership for Peace. He said that the Russo-American cooperation must be equal, mutually beneficial and have clear cut goals. "Pragmatism and usefulness must be the all-important factors. We should not be guided by ideological cliches. Like in a family, there are issues in the Russo-American relations which call for close coordination while in other fields every member of the family acts on his own trying not to harm the common interests," Kozyrev explained. He emphasized that neither the Russian nor the U.S. leaders intended to give up cooperation or partnership. Answering another Interfax question, Kozyrev said that he had talked with Secretary of State Warren Christopher on the phone to discuss numerous international issues, notably the Middle East. He added that the UN Security Council would discuss a resolution on the Middle East Friday. "This resolution must be passed urgently. The delay of its adoption hinders the resumption of Palestinian-Israeli talks," Kozyrev said. He emphasized that if the resolution were adopted Friday, Russian president's special envoy Viktor Posuvalyuk would go to Tunis to discuss with the PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat the specific day when the talks would resume. Kozyrev said that the delay also provoked new tragedies and casualties in the Middle East. "It is important that the confrontation mechanism should not be allowed to gain momentum," he said. He had also discussed Bosnia and Herzegovina with Christopher. "I expressed my view and the U.S. secretary of State agreed with it, that the Bosnian Moslems and Croats who intend to sign an agreement in Washington on March 18 on the setting up a federation should use this agreement as a tool for rapprochement and compromises with the third party, the Bosnian Serbs, rather than for opposing them jointly," Kozyrev said. He explained that Moscow would like to know if the federation was consistent with territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina. "We hope that this agreement will be a step forward. But even at this point it is important to know what the next steps will be and how the Bosnian Serbs will be incorporated into it," Kozyrev said.
