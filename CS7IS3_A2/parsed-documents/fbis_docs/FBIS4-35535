He said that he had urged them to "coordinate among themselves on fundamental issues like settlements, Jerusalem, and the refugees' return." [passage omitted] 'Abbas Zaki denied that Fatah has issued a decision to withdraw arms from the Palestinians, "especially as there are armed Israelis outside the police and the Army.... When there is incomplete sovereignty over Gaza and Jericho and a partner participating in ruling these areas, it is extremely difficult to apply the decision to Jericho or Gaza, or to the Palestinians and not the settlers." However, he pointed out that there is a big differences between a decision issued by Fatah and "a process conducted here or there and which we tackle in time.... We might withdraw arms from those who err, but to eliminate arms completely without any guarantees and while there are armed people outside the Israeli police -- that would be an unjust decision. And we cannot take such a decision." He added: "The time has not yet come to withdraw the arms. We will withdraw them when we take direct responsibility for the area without anyone's participation."
