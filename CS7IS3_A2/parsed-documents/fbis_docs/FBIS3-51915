In a letter sent to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, Conaie, which comprises the Indian communities of Ecuador, indicated that the uprising in Chiapas "is not an isolated incident but, rather, a social response to the prevailing conditions of poverty" extant in Latin America. Conaie said it is calling on the high-ranking international official to "in human terms" intervene in Mexico to help put an end to the abuses committed by against Indians in Ecuador. The communique adds that it is the UN's "moral and political obligation" to guarantee the lives of the Indians in some way, because they are the "victims of the ferocious genocidal war waged by the Mexican Army." It adds: "It cannot be possible that instead of providing human solutions to centuries of suffering, entire communities are being bombed." The communique also says: "Measures such as declaring an amnesty or calling for a dialogue are insignificant in the solution of this dramatic situation if the economic interests of the dominant classes are not set aside." According to Conaie, the events in Chiapas "are not promoted by a guerrilla group," but are "social reactions that should make all governments on the continent reflect about the need to review and change their neoliberal models."
