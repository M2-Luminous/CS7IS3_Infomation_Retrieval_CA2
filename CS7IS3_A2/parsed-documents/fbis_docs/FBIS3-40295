Markovic: "Air Defense of the Republic of Srpska Ready for Attack; Respond to Fire With Fire"] [Text] The military of the republic of Srpska have the powerful "Kub" and "Volhov" missile systems, which are effective at altitudes up to 30 kilometers. U.S. officers compare military action in Bosnia to searching for a needle in a haystack, but Serbian commanders see it as an adventure endangering the entire region. The latest threats of military intervention and NATO air strikes did not surprise the military of the republic of Srpska. The military air defense of this youngest Serbian republic was in full readiness even before the threats. The military commanders, who take these new threats very seriously, are inclined to believe that "all this serves to pressure the Serbian side before the pending talks in Geneva." However, if the threats of the trigger-happy Western war planners were to be fulfilled, resulting in a military action, it would be dangerous for the entire region. The military of the republic of Srpska, who are known to have a mass of antiaircraft artillery weapons and night-capable missile systems, believe that nobody needs this kind of adventure. The first thing the soldiers of the republic of Srpska like to display are the most modern antiaircraft "Bofors"-type guns made in Sweden. They have laser sights which guarantee maximal precision in hitting aerial targets. They are also capable of high fire concentration, several thousand rounds per minute. Serbian fighters are also proud of their mass of portable shoulder-launched "Strela" [arrow]-type laser-equipped devices. "Strelas" are effective within a range of 3.5 kilometers against approaching or departing targets; they represent a particular threat to fighter-bombers because their range covers the altitude most suitable for fighter-bomber attacks on ground targets. The "Kub" is a highly maneuverable missile system; it consists of three launchers on a single vehicle; it is designed for medium- and high-altitude targets. But the most powerful missile system is the stationary "Volhov"-type system. This system involves the most powerful missiles in the air-defense arsenal of the republic of Srpska military. The system has been modified to incorporate new guidance devices. These missiles are effective even at an altitude of 30 kilometers, and their speed matches that of the most modern NATO planes. The terrain configuration is very advantageous for the Serbian air defense forces; it makes it very difficult for even the most modern electronic equipment to detect targets. Thus, our commanders feel that the probability of destruction is negligible. Their views are supported by data which show that such destruction of ground targets (as proposed by the Western war planners) is hard to achieve even in training exercises. The Gulf War experience also confirms this fact; there were only 17 percent direct hits there. Higher-ranking U.S. officers compare the possible military action against the Serbs in Bosnia to searching for a needle in a haystack. They have publicly expressed their skepticism about air strikes despite the variety of weapons possessed by NATO forces. Although they are aware that the Serbian military does not have fighter planes (interceptors), the high-ranking U.S. officers respect the air defense of the republic of Srpska's military, pointing out that the Serbs could easily conceal their heavy weapons in wooded mountainous areas and settlements. U.S. officers expressed the opinion that this would make pilots reluctant to attack.
