Maley is also the chairman of the National Security Council's Inter-Ministerial Committee dealing with military industry, which operates beside the Russian president. [Vida] Not long before the September crisis, you resigned your position as presidential adviser and expressed your dissatisfaction with the current economic policy in a sharp interview in the KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA. Are you still so pessimistic about the future of Russian military industry? [Maley] The economic situation has not improved but the situation is much better from a structural point of view. The president has acquired full powers. The existence of the National Security Council has also been included in the Constitution, which is particularly important in the coming transitional period, when coalition debates make the government's work more difficult, because its 10 committees can in theory deal with any issues and substitute for any ministries. All this gives us great hope. At the same time, the results of the elections carry the danger that the political struggle will again draw Yeltsin away from the economy's burning problems. Necessary decisions are being delayed while time is running out before our eyes. Within three to five months at the latest, we have to begin massive changes in the economy.... [Vida] Do you want a change of course? [Maley] I would not be with the president if I did not agree with the reform policy. What is more, 80 percent of the military industrial complex's directors would not agree to any kind of regress. We do not want to and cannot return to what was here before. All we want from Yeltsin is that he should make the reforms quicker and more thought-out so that we can at last begin to establish a new economy on the ruins of 1992 and 1993. Therefore, we are supporting him as we did in October, but we are also trying to convince him of our views. [Vida] It is interesting what you are saying because one of the basic tenets of Gaydar's reform ideology is that the military industrial complex as a social phenomenon is a conservative and reactionary factor. [Maley] It is possible that, because of its outward characteristics, the oboronka appears to be a conservative force, but scientific life is concentrated here just as it is anywhere else in the world. The denouncement of military industry was a methodical mistake on Gaydar's part. Instead of using it as a motor for the reforms, he set himself the task of destroying it. No government will be able to do this. This industry has found the suitable counteraction because the line of enterprises with the chain of loans actually began with us. The strategically accumulated stocks of raw material in military industry, which was compulsory in the past, made it possible for production to continue. At the moment, the most important thing is that the president, who had been made to believe that the "oboronka" was an antagonistic environment, has understood that the Gaydar approach is wrong. However, we had to wait 18 months for this, the fight against the military industry lasted as long as that. [Vida] How can the political situation that has emerged after the elections influence the prospects of the military industry? [Maley] All in all, the defense establishment came out victorious from the political shocks of the past few months. First of all, this is because we support Yeltsin and he is beginning to understand that we are the only means left for continuing the reforms. Secondly, the serious defeat of the Gaydar bloc, Russia's Choice, actually means the defeat of the enemies of military industry, and this will probably be a warning for those who still have not realized what kind of force they are facing. Finally, as the military industry is an island of calm and social peace, all political forces will try to win us over. In order to gain as precise as possible information on the interests of the military industrial complex, we will soon establish an electronic information system including all 2,200 enterprises, with the help of which we can ask the views of the directors and trade union leaders of all of these enterprises on important issues within a few hours. We would as soon as possible like to launch the experiment of economic reform that will affect the Udmurtia, Mari, and Chuvashia Republics, and Nizhniy Novgorod and Moscow counties, namely the areas where the military industry is concentrated. We will maximally decentralize the control of the economy and make this industry export-oriented. According to our plans, 70 percent of the foreign currency income would go to the regions and only the remaining amount would have to be given to the federal budget. We will request bids for the military programs and the winner will be the supplier of the Army while the losers will be able to go to the international markets with their own solutions. [Vida] What changes do you consider necessary in Russian foreign politics to establish favorable conditions for the Russian military industry on foreign markets? [Maley] First of all, we need pragmatism. We will restore the state monopoly of weapons exports. The president himself will approve the one-year and five-year export plans. We will market our latest military equipment: We would always like to sell one dollar cheaper and one technical unit better products than our competitors. If you observe the activities of Kozyrev, you will see that he reached pragmatism from an absolutely pacifist position, he realized that the markets that we are leaving are immediately taken up by his closest friends over the ocean, without the slightest sign of a guilty conscience. Even under the current circumstances, when we have lost many of our traditional partners, we consider it possible to get some $10 to 12 billion a year from weapons exports by 1995. [Vida] To what extent is Russia able to work together with Ukraine and the other successor states in military production? [Maley] In this area, our relations continue to be excellent. Russia is the only one of the Soviet Union's successor states that, as a last resort, could be fully self-sufficient, the others cannot even cover 30 percent of their military needs on their own. Therefore, integration is unavoidable, providing our neighbors understand the realities. What if they do not? We have already taught a lesson with energy resources, which mainly made Ukraine suffer, and we can provide another lesson. Weapons are even more expensive than oil or gas.
