This is the content stressed by Chen Xitong, secretary of the municipal party committee, in his speech made at the municipal work conference on 16 December on training and promoting minority cadres. The work conference is chiefly aimed at discussing and arranging the work of how to do a good job in training and promoting minority cadres in the course of accelerating reform, opening up, and economic construction in the 1990's. It is aimed at summarizing and exchanging the achievements and experience gained by the municipality in the work of handling the affairs of minority cadres and at putting forward specific opinions and demands for the municipality to train and promote minority cadres. In his speech Chen Xitong pointed out: A fraternal relation is existing among various nationalities throughout our country. Both minority nationalities and Han Nationality are the member of the large Chinese national family and are brothers-in-arms. An equal relation also exists among them. Therefore, they should support and assist one another and in commonly become prosperous, developed, and well-off. It is imperative to deal with the relationship between minority nationalities and Han Nationality correctly. By no means should we indulge in Han chauvinism. Chen Xitong said: Beijing Municipality has 410,000 persons of minority population that accounts for 3.8 percent in the total municipal population. The residence of minority people in Beijing has significance. Success with Beijing, the country's capital, in dealing with the relation between Han Nationality and fraternal minority nationalities will influence the country as a whole and even the world. Localities throughout the country are watching whether our country is as good as its word in enforcing its policies on nationalities' affairs. If Beijing is successful in enforcing the policies on nationalities' affairs that will be a good influence on the unity among various fraternal nationalities throughout the country. Localities that have minority residents should encourage their cadres of Han Nationality to do a good job with relations between them and minority cadres, and in fostering unity between them. This is a sign indicating whether or not leading personnel at all levels have the art of leadership. Chen Xitong stressed: The work of training and promoting minority cadres relates to the whole situation. The hostile forces are adopting various measures in an effort to whip up the national split and to endanger the social stability, nationalities' unity, and the country's unification. Only by realistically enhancing the party's leadership and making efforts to train a large number of minority cadres who have both ability and political integrity, resolutely support the country's unification and nationalities' unity, maintain a close tie with the mass, and are reliable in leading the minority people and fostering unity among them, will we be able to withstand many a storm or test. The harmony in the people of Han nationality, minority nationalities and the family style unity fostered by them in Beijing are just. Because of them, there are a large number of representative personages and leading cadres of minority nationalities, who have done a great deal of work in safeguarding the country's unification and nationalities' unity. During the forum sponsored by Chen Xitong with voters in Xuanwu district, a compatriot of Hui Nationality said: There are bounds among various nationalities but there are no bounds in serving the people. Such splendid words from him have fully reflected that the compatriots of minority nationalities in Beijing are conscious. Party committees at all levels in localities with minority population should attach special importance to training and promoting minority cadres and further expanding the proportion of minority cadres, including the proportion of deputies to people's congress and leading cadres. Efforts should be made to train new successors for these minority cadres and to adopt realistic measures to vigorously train the younger cadres of minority nationalities. The religious circles, the specialized organs in charge of minority nationalities' affairs, and the governmental organs at all levels should pay great attention to the work. They should formulate a work plan at an early date and must create a new situation when training minority cadres next year. Chen Guangwen, deputy secretary of the municipal party committee, presided over and addressed the work conference. In his speech he urged various fronts and departments to summarize their work in training minority cadres, to find out their shortcomings, to define the work emphasis for the future, and to do a good job in conducting the work in a planned manner and in line with the set programs. Delivering reports at the work conference were Shen Daoren, director of the united front work department under the municipal party committee; and Sha Zhyuan, director of the municipal civil affairs commission. Attending the work conference were Chen Hong, vice minister of nationalities' affairs, and Li Zhijian, deputy secretary of the municipal party committee.
