FBIS4-27216 "dreas104_a_94049" FBIS-EAS-94-104 Daily Report 29 May 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Panel Calls For Greater Spending on Infrastructure Panel Calls For Greater Spending on Infrastructure OW2905070594 Tokyo KYODO in English 0611 GMT 29 May 94 OW2905070594 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, May 29 KYODO -- The ruling coalition's task force suggests that the government should set aside greater public works funds for improving the nation's social infrastructure to cope with a rapidly graying society. The outline of the report, obtained by KYODO NEWS SERVICE Sunday, also says the government should consider making it mandatory to discontinue subsidies five or 10 years after they started to be given if no measures are taken to extend them. The proposals are contained in a report worked out by a working group on public works projects and subsidies of the ruling coalition's Tax Reform Council. The report is to be formally published early next month. The panel is one of the four working groups the ruling coalition has created within its administrative and fiscal reform subcommittee. The task force has since studied ways to slash public works spending and subsidies on the assumption that indirect tax rates will be raised to cope with a rapidly aging society. On public works spending, the panel proposes that the government allocate greater funds to projects aimed primarily at improving social infrastructure, notably the quality of life. In order to identify such projects, the coalition's committee on social infrastructure should come up with clear-cut policies, the panel says. During discussions conducted so far, some members of the working group suggested that three government ministries and as many agencies be integrated into a public-works ministry. The three ministries are the construction, agriculture, forestry and fisheries, and transport ministries while the three agencies are the national land, Hokkaido development and Okinawa development agencies. The panel, however, failed to bring the matter to a conclusion because the proposal met with opposition from some members who maintained that efficiency would lower at such a large government ministry.
