FR941205-0-00050 FR941205-0-00010 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 92&hyph;ASW&hyph;32] Revision of Class E Airspace; Nacogdoches, TX agency: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. action: Final rule summary: This action revises the Class E airspace at Nacogdoches, TX. The development of a new localizer, Runway (RWY) 36, standard instrument approach procedure (SIAP) and a new nondirectional radio beacon (NDB) RWY 18 SIAP has made this action necessary. Controlled airspace extending upward from 700 feet above ground level (AGL) is needed for aircraft executing these approaches. This action is intended to provide adequate Class E airspace for IFR operations for aircraft executing the SIAP's at Nacogdoches, TX. effective date: 0901 u.t.c., February 8, 1995. for further information contact: Donald J.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: History On December 17, 1993, a proposal to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to revise the Class E airspace at Nacogdoches, TX, was published in the Federal Register (58 FR 65947). Two new SIAP's were developed for Nacogdoches, TX. The proposal was to revise the controlled airspace extending upward from 700 feet AGL for instrument flight rules (IFR) operations in controlled airspace during portions of the terminal operation and while transitioning between the enroute and terminal environments. Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No comments were received. However, since publication of the proposal, the FAA has discovered that the proposed minutes in the longitudinal coordinate for the Nacogdoches, ILS Localizer are incorrect: the proposal contained 12 minutes and it should have been 43 minutes. Further, the FAA has determined that the proposed reference to the Lufkin VORTAC and the accompanying description of the airspace stating the radial and distances each side of the radials are unnecessary. Therefore, the ILS Localizer coordinates have been corrected and the reference to the Lufkin VORTAC and the affected portion of the accompanying airspace description have been removed from this final rule. The FAA has determined that these changes will not increase the scope of the rule. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace areas designated as airspace extending 700 feet or more above the surface of the earth are in paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9B, dated June 18, 1994, and effective September 16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. The Rule This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) revises the Class E airspace at Nacogdoches, TX, to provide controlled airspace extending upward from 700 feet AGL for aircraft executing the SIAP's. This action also corrects the geographic coordinates for the Nacogdoches RBN and corrects the airspace description by deleting reference to the Lufkin VORTAC in the final description. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations that need frequent and routine amendments to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
