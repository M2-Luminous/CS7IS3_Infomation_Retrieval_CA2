ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The Florida Panther Interagency Committee (FPIC), composed of representatives from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), National Park Service, Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission, and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, approved the final Florida Panther Habitat Preservation Plan (Plan) January 3, 1994. The constituent elements of the Plan include: (1) A characterization and identification of occupied and potential Florida panther habitat (grouped into 11 ecological units) in 10 south Florida counties (Charlotte, Collier, Dade, DeSoto, Glades, Hendry, Highlands, Lee, Manatee, and Sarasota); (2) identification of threats to occupied and potential Florida panther habitat in south Florida, and (3) identification of 23 possible Florida panther habitat preservation options. The overall goal of the Plan is to ensure a sustainable population of Florida panther in south Florida. The Plan is available in paper and electronic formats. Copies of the Plan can be obtained by making requests to the address(es) below. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The following is a brief chronology and update on the Plan. A Habitat Preservation Working Group, comprised of U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, National Park Service, Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission, and Florida Department of Environmental Protection, began drafting the Plan April 10, 1991. A Federal Register Notice announced the draft Plan was available for public review and comment on February 19, 1993. The Florida Panther Technical Advisory Council reviewed the draft Plan on April 8, 1993, and provided technical comments under existing Service policy regarding panther issues. The comment period closed on April 30, 1993. Thirty-one letters of support and 33 letters of opposition to the draft Plan were received before the comment period closed. Three hundred and thirteen letters of support and 96 letters of opposition were received after the comment period closed. All comments were taken into consideration in subsequent revisions of the Plan. The Plan was approved by the FPIC on January 3, 1994. The FPIC chairman and Technical Subcommittee members presented the final Plan to the public at a town meeting on February 3, 1994, in Ft. Myers, Florida, as requested by the Florida Farm Bureau. As of this date, approximately 900 copies of the final Plan have been distributed. Copies of Plan, as well as a set of maps depicting more detailed information on areas of Panther habitat, have been deposited at the main branch of each of the following county libraries: Charlotte, Collier, Dade, DeSoto, Glades, Hendry, Highlands, Lee, Manatee, and Sarasota.
