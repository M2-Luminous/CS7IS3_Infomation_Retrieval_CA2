This announcement was made by Teodulo Hernandez, secretary general of the CGTP [General Confederation of Peruvian Workers]. He said the U.S. Department of Commerce has suspended until June the implementation of sanctions against Peru for systematically violating 16 workers' rights recognized by the International Labor Organization [ILO]. Hernandez said that the implementation of sanctions was postponed at his request, in his capacity as highest representative of the Peruvian labor union, to the U.S. Department of Commerce in Washington. Hernandez said: "We have given President Alberto Fujimori's government time (104 days) to eliminate the articles of the labor law that violate the Peruvian workers' rights and liberties." Moreover, he demanded the resignation of Labor Minister Augusto Antonioli and of Ricardo Marcerano, CCD [Democratic Constituent Congress] Labor and Social Security Commission president, who are regarded as responsible for the possible sanction. Hernandez recalled that in June 1992 the CGTP and other Peruvian labor unions reported the systematic violation of workers' rights in Peru to the ILO. The labor union leader said: "The final ILO report questioned 16 articles of the labor law. Moreover, the American Federation of Labor of the United States acknowledged this report and submitted it to the U.S. Department of Commerce." Hernandez explained that, in his capacity as CGTP leader, he and other leaders visited Washington between 9 and 11 March to explain to the U.S. authorities the current situation of the Peruvian workers as a result of the laws enacted by Fujimori's government.
