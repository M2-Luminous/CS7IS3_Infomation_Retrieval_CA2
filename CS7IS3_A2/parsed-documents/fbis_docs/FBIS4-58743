He warned of the grave consequences of the spreading confrontation between the armed forces in northern and southern Yemen and said that the situation is ominous and has been so since the start of the current crisis. In his appeal, the president said: Wishing to avoid an armed confrontation among the sons of the Yemeni people, I called upon you repeatedly to exercise self-restraint, resort to reason, and seek understanding and reconciliation through dialogue. With this same motive, Egyptian mediation was and still is active. I have repeatedly warned of the dangers involved in a clash that would be difficult to contain. President Mubarak said: I call on Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih to use the powers of his office in making the decisions necessary to end the current fighting in the country, separate the troops, and deflect the imminent danger the current strife portends for all Yemenis. In his appeal, President Mubarak said that a decision to halt all military operations on both sides and separate the troops will thwart the designs of those who conspire against the sons of the Yemeni people and their unity and give dialogue, reason, and logic a chance to prevail. President Mubarak added: I trust that President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih will side with the interests of the Yemeni people and stop the fighting before it turns into a full-fledged civil war that would engulf Yemen in great dangers and whose complications will be hard to control or reverse. President Mubarak said that everyone would place Yemeni interests above all considerations.
