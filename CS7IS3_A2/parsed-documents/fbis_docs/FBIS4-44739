All stages of the engine parts manufacturing process will be described by the engineers at workstations. These descriptions will be added to a shared database. In due time, the workers will consult the workshop instructions on screens. The Snecma aircraft-engine parts manufacturing "script" is handwritten by the methods engineering department's 160 engineers. It describes all the operations to be performed--machining, milling, stamping, etc.--at each stage of the manufacturing process, and is accompanied by schematics showing the evolution of the parts. This "movie" will soon be displayed on workstation screens. At any rate, this is one of the objectives of the Spirit project that is under way at Snecma's Corbeil site, which employs 4,400 persons, and whose main activity is the fabrication of parts and subassemblies for civil and military aircraft engines. This project, begun in 1990, is part of the steps being taken toward computerizing the methods engineering stages. Of the three stages involving considerable work by the methods engineers, the first and the last have already been computerized. The first consists of defining the major production steps of a new product line. This takes place prior to launching the manufacturing process. The second methods engineering stage converts each production step into workshop instructions addressed to the shopworkers. The third stage serves to define the list of tool setups and quality checks that are indispensable to the carrying out of each instruction. The major production steps and the tool lists are already available in the data base mode named Omega. Only the drawing up of the instructions is still essentially a manual operation. These instructions represent a considerable volume of paper. Suffice it to imagine: Snecma's Corbeil site holds the reference documentation on 8,000 parts. This represents 8,000 manufacturing operations. And each operation can represent as many as 15 workshop instructions, each of which entails several pages of description. In all, a stack of over 500,000 pages! To boot, this documentation must be kept for some 30-odd years. "This keeping and updating of documents was being done very poorly," says Jean-Pierre Chavanon, who heads the Spirit project, the main objectives of which are to improve the traceability of the documents, reduce the cycles involved in the creating of production data, and avoid the problem of retrieval of documents. For the moment, it is yet too early to know if these objectives will be fully attained. The project is still in midstream. After having "polished up" the document display formats so as to rule out deviations stemming from personalized touches, 1991 was the year of technical choices. Since two thirds of the documents consist of drawings, and one third of text, a tool had to be found to manipulate both. "We did not want to produce sophisticated documentation, but simply technical files. We had before us CAP (computer-assisted production) tools oriented mainly toward text and display, and CAD (computer-aided design) tools oriented more toward drafting." Finally, Jean-Pierre Chavanon chose CimLinc, a composite tool distributed in France by Intelligent Document. It provides CAP and CAD capabilities simultaneously. The application, based on CimLinc, is being developed in-house. "We are designing it, to the extent possible, with the engineers who will be using it, and we are trying to preserve their working methods," says Jean-Pierre Chavanon. Since the middle of last year, some 20 workstations have been installed, and 60 persons trained. By the end of next year, 60 workstations are expected to be available. Spirit calls for each engineer to be equipped with a Sun workstation. He will retrieve the drawings created previously with Catia software, detail them, and annotate them. The structure of the document will be automatically updated. He will then draw up the workshop instructions, remarks, etc. These instruction documents are not drafted in a single go. Several persons lend a hand. Some methods engineers are generalists; they are responsible for the part as a whole. But they call upon specialists--welding specialists, for example, specialists in surface treatment, and all other techniques--to fine-tune the document. As of now, these documents, on paper, circulate hand-to-hand among the engineers, with all the problems of updating and the responsibilities this procedure entails. With Spirit, each person, working at his or her workstation, will have access at all times to the document, which will be stored in the shared database. All modifications will be recorded together with the name of the specialist who has made the modification. New manufacturing operations are already being carried out with this new system. The database will be added to progressively. Whatever is on paper will stay on paper, of course. The paper files and the division storerooms, which have the job of duplicating the documents and distributing them within the workshop, will still be around for some time to come, although the idea for the time being is to short-circuit the division storerooms progressively by distributing the documents that are still in paper form directly to the manufacturing stations. Under the new system, each shopworker will make a printout of the documents that are of interest to him or her, and in due time will perhaps access the screen directly for workshop instructions. This second phase of the project has been taken in hand by Snecma's Gennevilliers site. A natural course of events, given that Gennevilliers has decided to adopt what has already been achieved at the Corbeil site. There is no point in duplicating studies at a time when the aeronautical market is hurting badly. And the more so considering that the project as a whole is costing around 9 million French francs [Fr]. Snecma: 13,800 Persons, 6 Main Sites Snecma's 1991 revenue totaled Fr14.5 billion, approximately 80 percent of which was generated by exports. Its 13,800 employees are distributed over six main sites. Its Gennevilliers site manufactures forged and cast parts. Its Evry-Corbeil center, equipped with 1,500 machines, manufactures civil and military aircraft engine parts and subassemblies. New engines are designed and tested at the Melun-Villaroche site. Snecma's highly automated Creusot plant produces the turbine disks. Elecma Suresnes houses Snecma's electronics division. And Snecma's Istres site is its flight test center.
