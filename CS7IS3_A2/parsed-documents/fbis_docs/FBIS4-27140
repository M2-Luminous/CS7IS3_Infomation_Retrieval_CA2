FBIS4-27140 "dreas104_d_94005" FBIS-EAS-94-104 Daily Report 28 May 1994 South Korea `Little' Chance for Further Talks `Little' Chance for Further Talks SK2805110494 Seoul YONHAP in English 1058 GMT 28 May 94 SK2805110494 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Berlin, May 28 (YONHAP) -- International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) negotiators failed to reach an agreement with North Korea to determine whether the communist country is developing nuclear arms and are returning to the headquarters in Vienna, IAEA spokesman Hans Meyer said Saturday. Pyongyang continues to remove fuel rods and chances of more talks between the UN nuclear safeguards body and North Korea are little although IAEA is willing to resume negotiations, Meyer said. He said North Korea refused all proposals by IAEA to verify whether diversion of fuel took place in the past and that this week's talks in Pyongyang broke down without reaching any agreement. IAEA delegates asked various proposals to select, segregate, and secure fuel standards to verify the reactor core is the original one installed in 1986, but North Korea refused every one of them, the spokesman said in a statement. North Koreans referred to their "unique status" -- a formula by which they can pick and choose which international safeguards measures to respect -- and held fast to its opposition to IAEA's activities to determine whether nuclear fuel has been diverted to a secret weapons program. They instead offered some of their ideas, but IAEA turned them down because they were not "adequate and verifiable" to determine past operation. Of five negotiators, two have remained in Yongbyon to report the process of unloading to headquarters, which means safeguards are not completely broken down. The IAEA Secretariat has reported these facts to the board of governors and United Nations Security Council, the statement said. Meyer said the UN nuclear watchdog is still willing to talk with Pyongyang, but that the matter was entirely up to North Koreans. He, however, added that he saw little hope in further talks.
