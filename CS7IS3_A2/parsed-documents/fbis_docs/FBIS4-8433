Longstanding tensions between Greece and its neighbours, exacerbated by upheaval in the Balkans, have apparently led to the increased restrictions on the free speech. Over the past two years, Amnesty International, Helsinki Watch, the International Society for Human Rights, and the U.S. State Department have expressed concern to Greek authorities regarding cases where individuals have been prosecuted for the contents of their speech or writings. During that time eight cases were brought against 21 individuals criticized the Greek Government's policy toward Macedonia, or for recognizing themselves as part of a Macedonian minority in Greece. The situation of the Greece's ethnic Turkish citizens who reside mainly in Western Thrace, has continued to be a focus of rights observers. While the Greek Government acknowledges the ethnicity of the Turkish minority-formerly considered Greek Muslims, various forms of discrimination are still reported, including official harassment, occasional flare-ups of anti-Turkish violence and use of the citizenship code to revoke the citizenship of ethnic Turkish citizens who travel or live abroad for extended periods. Outspoken ethnic Turkish members of the Greek Parliament have also faced attempts to have their immunity stripped so legal action could be brought against them for various statements.
