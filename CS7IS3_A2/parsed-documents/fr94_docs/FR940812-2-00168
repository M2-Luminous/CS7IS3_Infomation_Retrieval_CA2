FR940812-2-00168 FR940812-2-00062 [Docket No. 93&hyph;76] Diana J. Smith, M.D., Revocation of Registration On August 9, 1993, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to Diana J. Smith, M.D. (Respondent). The Order to Show Cause sought to revoke Respondent's DEA Certificate of Registration, AS2966919, issued to her in Arizona and to deny any pending applications for renewal of such registration. The Order to Show cause alleged that Respondent's continued registration would be inconsistent with the public interest as that term is used in 21 U.S.C. 823(f). Respondent filed a timely request for a hearing. The matter was docketed before Administrative Law Judge Mary Ellen Bittner. Before the hearing could be scheduled, the Arizona Board of Medical Examiners (Board) entered into a consent decree with Respondent, in which Respondent voluntarily relinquished her license to practice medicine in the State of Arizona, effective October 14, 1993. The Government then filed a motion for summary disposition based upon the Board's order, alleging that since Respondent was not currently authorized to handle controlled substances in the State of Arizona, DEA could not continue to register Respondent in that state. Respondent filed a response to this motion, arguing that her DEA registration should not be revoked because she still had current medical licenses in two other states, Virginia and North Carolina, and was applying for medical licensure in the State of Washington where she currently resides. On April 18, 1994, the administrative law judge issued her opinion and recommended decision. The administrative law judge stated that the motion for summary disposition was warranted as there was no question of material fact involved. Furthermore, she explained in her opinion that the only relevant medical license was the one that Respondent formerly held in Arizona, since Respondent's DEA registration was issued to her in that state. The administrative law judge then noted that the DEA lacks statutory power to register a practitioner unless the practitioner holds state authority to handle controlled substances and concluded that Respondent is without authority to handle controlled substances in the State of Arizona. Consequently, the administrative law judge granted the Government's motion for summary disposition and recommended that Respondent's DEA Certificate of Registration be revoked. No exceptions were filed and on May 23, 1994, the entire record of these proceedings was transmitted to the Deputy Administrator. After a careful review of the record in this matter, the Deputy Administrator adopts the administrative law judge's opinion and recommended decision. As DEA has consistently held, the DEA does not have the authority under the Controlled Substances Act to grant a registration to a practitioner if that practitioner is not authorized by a state to handle controlled substances. See Ramon Pla, M.D., Docket No. 86&hyph;54, 51 FR 41168 (1986); George S. Heath, M.D. Docket No. 86&hyph;24, 51 FR 26610 (1986); Dale D. Shahan, D.D.S., Docket No. 85&hyph;57, 51 FR 23481 (1986). There is no evidence in the record to contradict the Government's position that Respondent's Arizona medical license has been revoked and that her authority to handle controlled substances in the State of Arizona has been nullified. Furthermore, Respondent has not requested modification of her DEA registration to one of the two states where she currently holds medical licenses. Consequently, revocation of Respondent's DEA registration is warranted. The Deputy Administrator concurs with the administrative law judge's granting of the Government's motion for summary disposition. In the absence of a question of material fact, a plenary adversary administrative proceeding is not required. See United States v. Consolidated Mines and Smelting Company, Ltd., 445 F.2d 432, 453 (9th Cir. 1971); N.L.R.B. v. International Association of Bridge, Structural and Ornamental Ironworkers, AFL&hyph;CIO, 549 F.2d 64 (9th Cir. 1977); Alfred Tennyson Smurthwaite, N.D., Docket No. 77&hyph;29, 43 FR 11873 (1978). Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104 (59 FR 23637), hereby orders that DEA Certificate of Registration, AS2966919, previously issued to Diana J. Smith, M.D., be, and it hereby is, revoked and that any pending applications for renewal of such registration be, and they hereby are, denied. This order is effective August 12, 1994. Dated: August 5, 1994. Stephen H. Greene, Deputy Administrator. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;19701 Filed 8&hyph;11&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4410&hyph;09&hyph;M
