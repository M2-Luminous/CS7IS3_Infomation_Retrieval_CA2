Confrontation may nevertheless be resolved through talks. Claims that the situation in and around Crimea are now being normalized are unfortunately not true. In fact there has only been a drop in tension. Kiev and Simferopol have moderated the belligerent tone of their statements and have begun talking less about direct confrontation and conflict between the military units and other force structures on the peninsula. However, no fundamental changes in the various sides' positions have occurred. The Republic of Crimea authorities are acting on the basis of the restored Constitution of 6 May 1992, which gives them extremely wide-ranging powers to resolve the peninsula's internal problems. As far as mutual relations with Ukraine are concerned, in the Crimean authorities' opinion there are no insoluble problems here. The Constitution clearly notes that Crimea is part of Ukraine. For its part, Ukraine is pointing to the incompatibility of this document with its own Fundamental Law. However, the Crimean authorities' everyday activities are being described by the Republic's capital as separatism dictated by a desire to leave the Ukrainian state. In this confrontation President Yuriy Meshkov and the Crimean Supreme Council are relying on the unconditional support of an overwhelming majority of the population, which unequivocally gave its opinion on this issue in the poll of 27 March this year. Therefore, a comparison between Crimea and Bosnia is at the very least improper. Regarding the Crimean Tatars, who, as was stated in the Assembly of the Crimean Tartar People, now comprise approximately 10 percent of the Crimean population, their pro-Ukrainian sympathies have their limits. Today, all Crimea's influential political forces as represented in the republic's Supreme Council are stressing that they do not oppose incorporation into Ukraine, but only for the establishment of mutual relations with Kiev on a treaty basis [sentence as published]. The demarcation of the two side's powers should be defined as a result of negotiations. But nobody in Simferopol or Kiev knows when these talks will begin. For the time being the delegations from Supreme Councils of Ukraine and Simferopol [as published] have only managed to secure agreement on establishing a working group of experts which by 15 June are required to submit to the Crimean parliament their recommendations for eliminating inconsistencies between the constitutions and other legislative organs [as published] of Crimea and Ukraine. Yevgeniy Saburov, vice prime minister and leader of the Crimean Council of Ministers, believes that the present process of talks between Kiev and Simferopol will begin after the presidential election in Ukraine. At the present time, serious talks between the two sides are impossible, because Crimea is one of the main topics of the election campaign. Nevertheless, he believes, Kiev will sooner or later arrive at a federative structure, bearing in mind that several more regions of the country are striving for greater autonomy within Ukraine. For the time being, however, Kiev has practically reached the stage of imposing economic sanctions on Crimea. Emissions of finance to the peninsula have been suspended, which in the inflationary conditions that exist in Ukraine may certainly be regarded as a sanction. The construction of a water pipeline to Simferopol, where people can obtain water for just one hour every day, has been halted. Saburov also regards the policy of whipping up tension around Crimea as an element of the sanctions campaign, which has practically wrecked the tourist season. It represents a direct undermining of Crimea's economic base and an attempt to prevent revenue from reaching the Crimean budget. Sanatoriums in the greater Yalta area, for example, are only 30 percent full, which right now means they are only just managing to survive. It has not been ruled out that the situation will sorted out, that a normal talks process will be established between Kiev and Simferopol, and that the two sides will succeed in overcoming all their disagreements, primarily their deep suspicion of one another. In my view, this is currently the main obstacle on the path to finding a compromise. As debates in the Ukrainian parliament regarding Crimea have shown, in this complex situation Leonid Makarovich [Kravchuk] has successfully demonstrated his political skill and managed to secure the most advantageous position in the election campaign. He has been greatly helped in this task by the national radicals. Particularly useful, for example, has been the remark by Vice Admiral Vadim Kozhin, former Ukrainian Navy commander, who not only demanded the immediate imposition of presidential rule and martial law in Crimea, but also the withdrawal of the Russian Black Sea Fleet from the peninsula within 24 hours. Against this background, in the eyes of Ukrainian public opinion Leonid Makarovich looks like a serious and responsible politician who, while concerned for the unity of Ukraine as a power, is not ruling out other, more strong-arm methods of resolving the Crimean problem. But the danger of a sharp deterioration of the situation in Crimea is possible even in the absence of any political complications. In an interview he gave to me, Colonel General Valeriy Malikov, first deputy chairman of the Ukrainian Security Service, who has been stationed in Crimea for a considerable length of time, put forward the idea of establishing a working group under the Crimean Supreme Council to clarify possible misunderstandings between the troops stationed on the peninsula. General Vladimir Lepekhov, head of the Republic of Crimea Security Service, basically agrees with this proposal. Malikov believes that the situation in Crimea became acute in May because of, among other things, the lack of coordination between various military units which during that period were -- in accordance with Soviet tradition -- checking out the training which troops had received for the winter and spring period. There are more than enough troops in Crimea: The Black Sea Fleet, which includes a coast defense division and brigade of marines, naval units, a motorized rifle corps, a brigade of the Ukrainian National Guard, and in addition to this, the Crimean militia, which is subordinate to the Republic of Crimea Government. This whole mass of armed men is concentrated in a very restricted space; they are often practically on top of one another. Nor should we ignore the various special services. According to my incomplete data, there are over 10 Ukrainian, Russian, and Crimean organizations of this sort operating at various levels in Crimea. A mundane misunderstanding or fateful combination of circumstances is all it would take to trigger an uncontrollable sequence of events whose consequences would be simply impossible to predict. A powder keg cannot be kept in a fire-risk zone forever. Some day it will all go up in a ball of flames. Therefore, alongside talks between Crimea and Ukraine on normalizing their mutual relations, and between Russia and Ukraine on dividing up the Black Sea Fleet, a no less important task is the establishment of a kind of coordinating center comprising representatives of the power structures operating in Crimea. This center should at the very least coordinate the activity of power departments and provide the civilian authorities and the public with prompt information about all uncoordinated actions and misunderstandings between these departments. The situation will not deteriorate as a result of this. On the contrary, trust will develop between the various sides involved in the conflict, the people of Crimea will at last be able to breathe more freely, and the number of people deciding to vacation by the Black Sea will undoubtedly increase.
