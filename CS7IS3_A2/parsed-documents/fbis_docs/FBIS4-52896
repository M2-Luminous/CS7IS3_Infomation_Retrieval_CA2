Sison has meted death sentence to four breakaway rebel leaders, according to Carlos Forte, head of the Manila-Rizal Regional Party Committee, one of the breakaway groups of the CPP. This, however, could not be verified from the Sison-led CPP itself. One of its allied organizations, the Revolutionary Council of Trade Unions, had earlier denied there was such a "hit list" of former comrades to be liquidated but "only charges that has to be duly processed in the revolutionary court." In a statement faxed to the CHRONICLE, Forte said Sison's politburo has convened itself as a "People's Court" and voted 5-4 to liquidate Filemon Lagman, Arturo Tabara, Romulo Kintanar, and Ricardo Reyes. Forte is reportedly the nom de guerre of Lagman. "We have identified three of the comrades assigned to carry out this order, one of whom is a long-time operative of the defunct Armed City Partisan (ACP) in Metro Manila of the early 1970s," Forte said. "They are now in Metro Manila but are being monitored by ABB [Alex Boncayao Brigade] units."
