It pointed out that Resolution 904 opens the door to the resumption of bilateral negotiations. Syrian sources said that the Security Council resolution "has provided a new opportunity to resume the peace negotiations...and will prevent a repetition of the ugly crimes committed by settlers against Palestinian citizens with support from the Israeli Army." The sources added that "the strong condemnation" contained in Resolution 904 "is bound to open the door to the resumption of the negotiations, but in isolation from Israel's maneuvers, which nearly managed to undermine the foundations on whose basis the peace process was launched." The sources said that Syria's eagerness to rid the peace process of the effects of the Hebron massacre caused Syria to respond to the U.S. Administration's efforts, "as represented in the telephone calls President Hafiz al-Asad received from President Clinton, because Syria expressed every interest in giving the peace process every impetus that is bound to make it a success and achieve its desired aims." The sources added that Damascus's eagerness prompted it to invite the Arab parties to hold a coordination meeting next April to agree on resuming the negotiations. But they stressed that "it is not important for the negotiations to begin today or tomorrow. The important thing is Israel's compliance with the need to implement the resolutions of international legitimacy so that a just and comprehensive peace can be achieved." After revealing that Syria has invited the parties concerned to meet in Damascus, the sources said that Syria "did that because of its absolute belief in joint Arab action and because of its awareness that the coordination issue and commitment to this issue mean denying Israel any opportunity to try to achieve another infiltration along the lines of the Oslo agreement."
