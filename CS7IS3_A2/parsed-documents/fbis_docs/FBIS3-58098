There are also leading deputies within the CDU/CSU [Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union] parliamentary group who do not agree with Kohl's rejectionist stance, the HANNOVERSCHE ALLGEMEINE ZEITUNG (Friday [7 January] edition) reports. Within CDU/CSU circles in Bonn it was being said on Thursday that Ruehe is very disappointed that the Chancellor has "apparently changed" his stance following his talks with Russian President Boris Yeltsin shortly before Christmas. This came as a shock to the Defense Ministry, the newspaper writes. Hence Ruehe is "quite relieved" not to have to attend the NATO summit next week. Ruehe, it is being said within his entourage, is "very unhappy" that Kohl and Foreign Minister Kinkel attach great weight to U.S. concerns about broadening membership to the East. If Kohl takes the same view on the issue as he does, he should not relinquish that view because of diplomatic considerations, Ruehe says. The report goes on to say that it is not enough to say simply that one does "not totally rule out" NATO membership for those states. Attempts must be made to bring about their entry. Support must be given in the political, economic, and military spheres. The Defense Ministry sees reform of the armed forces as a criterion for membership. Structures must be comparable and the military leadership must embrace the same values. There are reservations within the Defense Ministry on isolated membership for the Baltic states because here the risks are in reality greater than the benefits. [Passage omitted]
