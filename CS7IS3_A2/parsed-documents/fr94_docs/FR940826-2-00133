FR940826-2-00133 FR940826-2-00068 As is the case for fees applicable to OEX RAES participants under existing CBOE Rule 24. 17, ``RAES Eligibility in OEX,'' the proposed fees do not constitute disciplinary action, although the CBOE's review procedures in Chapter XIX, ``Hearings and Review,'' of the CBOE's rules will be available for review of fees assessed under the proposal. The CBOE states that the Commission has noted the appropriateness of such fees and appeal rights in a related context. 6 6 Specifically, in approving a CBOE proposal that included procedures for contesting the fees assessed for delayed submission of trade data, the Commission stated that ``Although such formalized procedures are unusual for challenging fee assessments, they actually make the imposition of the fee fairer by allowing members to challenge erroneous fee charges. Moreover, these procedures are reasonably designed to afford a member assessed a fee the opportunity to challenge the veracity of the assessments.'' See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 30001 (November 26, 1991), 56 FR 63529 (order approving File No. SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;90&hyph;06). See also OEX RAES Approval Order, Supra note 5. In addition to establishing a fee schedule for failures to comply with log-on and log-off requirements, the CBOE proposes to issue a Regulatory Circular that will reaffirm the nature of CBOE market makers' RAES log-on and log-off responsibilities in equity and SPX options classes and describe the consequences that attach to any market maker's failure to observe these responsibilities. The Regulatory Circular addresses four points. First, CBOE Rules 8.16(a)(iii) and 24.16(a)(iii) require any market maker who has logged onto RAES at a trading station on any given trading day to log off RAES whenever the market maker leaves the trading crowd for more than ``a brief interval.'' The Regulatory Circular interprets ``a brief interval'' to mean ``five consecutive minutes.'' Under this interpretation any market maker who signs onto RAES at a particular trading station during a trading session must log off the system prior to leaving that station for more than five consecutive minutes. The CBOE believes that this interpretation should eliminate ambiguity about the amount of time a market maker may be away from the trading crowd without signing off RAES. Second, the Regulatory Circular notes that graduated fees will be assessed under CBOE Rules 8.16(a) and 24.16(a) for failures to observe the RAES log-off requirement. Third, the Regulatory Circular reflects the MPC's designation pursuant to CBOE Rules 8.16(b) and 24.16(b) that the expiration month log-on requirements reflected in those rules will be enforced in all classes of equity and SPX options for which RAES is available. Accordingly, any market maker who has logged onto RAES in accordance with CBOE Rules 8.16(a) or 24.16(a) during an expiration month for a given class of options must log on whenever present at the applicable trading station, until the next expiration. Fourth, the Regulatory Circular reflects a determination by the MPC, pursuant to its authority under CBOE Rules 8.16(d) and 24.16(d), that any market maker who fails to meet the log-on requirements under CBOE Rules 8.16(b) or 24.16(b) ordinarily will be suspended from participation on RAES at the applicable trading station for a period extending to 21 consecutive business days. 7 7 In contrast to this suspension provision, the OEX RAES Approval Order provides that members who fail to observe the RAES log-on requirements for OEX options are subject to a fee. The CBOE has determined that suspensions, not fees, are the appropriate mechanisms to promote compliance with RAES log-on requirements for equity and SPX options. The CBOE states that it may introduce fees for failures to observe the log-on requirements for equity and SPX options at a later date if experience so dictates. The CBOE believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and furthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(5), in particular, in that it is designed to enable the CBOE to enforce compliance with the Act, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, and to protect investors and the public interest by assuring that equity and SPX options market makers are aware of and meet their responsibilities pertaining to RAES. The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange and, in particular, the requirements of Section 6(b)(5) in that it is designed to facilitate transactions in securities and to protect investors and the public interest. 8 The Commission believes that the graduated fee schedule for failures to comply with the RAES log-off requirements and the imposition of suspensions for failures to meet the RAES log-on requirements established in CBOE Rules 8.16(b) and 24.16(b) are designed to maintain the integrity of the RAES system for equity and SPX options. The fees and suspensions, together with the provision specifying that a market maker must log off RAES when leaving the trading crowd for more than ``a brief interval'' of five minutes, are designed to ensure that there is adequate market maker participation at all times in SPX and equity RAES and that market makers are properly logged on to the system. The presence of an adequate number of market makers protects investors and contributes to the maintenance of fair and orderly markets by helping the Exchange to maintain the continued availability of RAES for SPX and equity options, thereby contributing to the effective and efficient execution of public investor orders at the best available prices. 8 15 U.S.C. ยง78f(b)(5) (1982). In addition, the Commission believes that the proposed Regulatory Circular should facilitate compliance with SPX and equity RAES requirements by explaining market makers' RAES log-on and log-off requirements and the fees and suspensions provided for failures to satisfy those requirements. The Commission also believes that the graduated fee schedule should encourage compliance with the log-off requirements and may increase the Exchange's ability to deter repeat offenders. Likewise, the Commission believes that the provision establishing suspensions for failures to comply with the RAES log-on requirements should deter participating market makers from abandoning their commitment to RAES for other than good cause. 9 9 The Commission notes that under CBOE Rules 8.16 and 34.16 the CBOE retains the discretion to bring full disciplinary proceedings. The Commission expects the CBOE to bring full disciplinary proceedings where appropriate, for example, in cases of egregious or repeated violations of the SPX and equity RAES requirements.
