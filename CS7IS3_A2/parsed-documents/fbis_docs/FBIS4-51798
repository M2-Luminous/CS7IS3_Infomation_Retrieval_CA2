The two countries also promised to cooperate in improving conditions for South Korean construction companies operating in Saudi Arabia, the Ministry said. The committee, the 10th of its kind, was convened after a five-year hiatus. Seoul officials captured Riyadh's interest with proposals to jointly bid for construction contracts in third countries and for South Korea to participate in the Saudis' railroad-building project. Saudi Arabia, in return, asked for more private-level economic cooperation suited to the changing political situation in the Middle East after the Gulf War, the drop in international oil prices and the conclusion of the Uruguay Round. South Korea registered 3.73 billion U.S. dollars in imports from Saudi Arabia last year, mostly crude oil, and posted exports of 940 million dollars. Although a heavy imbalance may be inevitable due to oil purchases, officials said they want to rectify it as much as possible -- through a more active advance into the Saudi construction market, for example. Officials said the two sides agreed to work on expanding bilateral import-export activities.
