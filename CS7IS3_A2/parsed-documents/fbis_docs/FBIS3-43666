At the head of the high level mission is Mr. Masao Sawaki, special assistant to the minister for foreign affairs, who was accompanied by the ambassador of Japan to Kenya, Ms. Ginko Sato, during the discussions at the vice president's office at the Treasury in Nairobi. The vice president assured Japan of the Kenya Government's commitment to the principles of good governance, transparency, and accountability. Prof. Saitoti assured further of the government's commitment to the maintenance of security and the protection of lives for both the local and international communities in Kenya. This was in response to concerns expressed by Mr. Sawaki on the two issues. Mr. Sawaki had told the vice president that Japan's assistance would only go to those countries that practiced good governance, transparency, accountability, and respect for human rights. Mr. Sawaki had also said that the international community would not be willing to work in countries where their lives were at risk. Prof. Saitoti stated that the isolated incidents of insecurity were not internal but of induced [as received] nature associated with conflicts in neighboring countries. He said that some of the fleeing refugees brought with them into the country weapons that were used to commit crimes. Prof. Saitoti underlined that His Excellency President Daniel arap Moi was involved with peace initiatives in the African region in the realization that there would be no peace in one particular country if others were in turmoil. The vice president regretted the drought scourge sweeping many parts of the republic which, he said, had adverse effects on the country's economy. He said the country was forced to purchase foodstuffs to meet the deficit at commercial prices and appealed for donors' and agencies' assistance. The country, he said, was further reeling down with high unemployment, but he observed that this state could only be changed through growth in the economy. The vice president emphasized that the government was serious in her efforts to bring further down the population growth and reported that the situation had assumed a downward trend. He said the biggest challenge for the country has been a major slowdown of the economy, but the government was doing everything possible to turn things around. Prof. Saitoti stressed that the government had liberalized many areas of the economy to make it stable. He said that the government had demonstrated its seriousness by implementing far-reaching structural economic measures. Prof. Saitoti underlined that the government had effected major political and economic changes in the recent past. The country now enjoys a participatory multiparty democracy, he said, adding that the government would not relent in her efforts of real democratization and promoting a market-oriented economy. During the discussions Mr. Sawaki said that his government considered Kenya as a priority country in Africa and that is why the country received the highest amount of Japanese aid. He said Kenya's success is fundamental, to be replicated in other areas. He underlined that his country placed emphasis on environmental and population-related programs and warned that no part of the aid should be diverted to military purposes since this could result in the suspension of the aid package. The vice president thanked the Japanese Government for its assistance to Kenya, observing that every area of the economy had benefited from Japanese aid. He mentioned the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation, and various roads and bridges among major beneficiaries and in particular highlighted the Jomo Kenyatta College of Agriculture and Technology as a living testimony of economic cooperation between the two nations.
