We have reached the conclusion that one front has to be extinguished, and that it would be better and less painful if it were done with the Croats. True, our wounds are still fresh from the conflict with them, but they are nonetheless lighter than the ones inflicted on us by the Serbs. It is also important to say that the chetniks' loathsome project had the support of their academicians and the church, which is not the case with the Croatian policy. The Croats did not have the backing of either the church or of a large number of people in Croatia. Fewer people in Croatia have messed things up, Izetbegovic said.
