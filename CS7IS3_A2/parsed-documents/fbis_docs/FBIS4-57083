Today, Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina and South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo signed the protocol that establishes a new status in relations between Pretoria and Havana. Up until now, the two governments had not maintained diplomatic ties because of the Caribbean island authorities' rejection of the now-dismantled racist system of apartheid. Less than 48 hours after assuming the presidency, Nelson Mandela, leader of the African National Congress (ANC), finalized the government decision, reaffirming the relations of friendship and solidarity maintained for years between Cuba and the then-outlawed ANC. Regarding the possibilities of cooperation between Cuba and the South African state, Cuban President Fidel Castro had told PRENSA LATINA: There are few countries that have the fraternal links that we share with South Africa. The country has, on the one hand, great development and standards of living, and, on the other hand, it has enormous social needs in the areas of public health, employment, education, housing, and transportation, which we were able to appreciate in our talks with members of the South African cabinet, Castro said. Castro added: Probably with no other country is there the possibility of such broad Cuban cooperation than with South Africa, as we work on developing fraternal and heart-felt ties between both peoples. After signing the protocol, Alfredo Nzo, former secretary of international relations of the ANC, told Robaina that the new South Africa did not want Fidel Castro to end his visit before making this decision. For his part, Robaina underlined the importance of the signing of the agreement, not only because of its great significance, but because it is the first protocol signed by Nzo as foreign minister. Cuba has close cooperative relations with other African states in the areas of health, construction, sports, and education, which can also be extended to South Africa, he said. Hundreds of ANC youths have studied in the past at education centers in Cuba, it was noted. There were times of serious confrontation between the two states, Fidel Castro pointed out during his visit, recalling Cuba's international opposition to the aggressive policy maintained by the dismantled apartheid regime against the South African black majority and the peoples of Namibia and Angola. "Now there is a new South Africa, where peace, respect, and love toward Cuba exist," he stated. The Cuban delegation, headed by President Fidel Castro, concluded its first official and friendly visit to South Africa today. The Cuban delegation began its visit Monday to attend Mandela's inauguration. Mandela is the first black president of the country, which now has unequivocally left behind more than three centuries of racial discrimination. In terms of Cuba's representation, Roberto Robaina was accompanied at the signing ceremony by Angel Dalmau, Cuban ambassador in Namibia; Rosa Elena Simeon, minister of science, technology, and environment; and Marcos Rodriguez, diplomatic counselor, who will temporarily represent the Cuban Government in Pretoria.
