A raft of encouraging numbers shows unemployment down, inflation still subdued and wage increases in modest decline, after some months of worrying increase. These figures served to emphasise Mr Kenneth Clarke's message that a period of sustained noninflationary growth is now in prospect. Every Chancellor must juggle two audiences -- the voters and the markets. Conventional wisdom holds that their interests -- and especially their ideas on public spending -- inevitably diverge. Last night, with several years to go before the next electoral reckoning, there was no doubt which audience Mr Clarke was looking harder at. Particularly after the recent turbulence in the world's bond markets, a man with a 38 billion pound deficit to fund cannot take chances with the City. Growth, he assured his listeners, will be responsible. Tax cuts were promised, but with strict qualifications: "low expenditure is the key to lower taxes"; taxes will be cut again "only when we can afford to do so and not before we can afford to do so." Tax cuts are, of course, what many in his panicky party would most like to hear about, but the days are gone when a Government could buy easy popularity with a shilling off a packet of 20 and a penny off income tax. Over the past five years the public has had to relearn the hard way the lessons of the 1970's, that inflation and excessive deficits are painful and dangerous. In that sense, the gap between the financial markets and the wider world has narrowed. Tax cuts which the markets deem irresponsible would soon prove politically counter-productive. Yet it remains arguable that, unless the Conservatives can deliver or credibly promise some reduction in taxation before the next election, they will offer little if anything to differentiate themselves from a refurbished Labour Party. The question for Mr Clarke, therefore, is how genuine scope can be found for reducing some of the extra imposts with which he and his predecessor have burdened us. On this, the Chancellor had little to say beyond reaffirming his aim of getting public expenditure back beneath 40 per cent of Gross National Product in the medium term. On present plans, that is not due to happen during this parliament. Here, the spotlight switches to Mr Michael Portillo, Chief Secretary to the Treasury and darling of the tax-cutting Tory Right. Mr Portillo is in charge of public expenditure. He is also charged with carrying out "fundamental reviews" of various departments' spending -- including the massive 80 billion pound Social Security budget. If meaningful savings are to be found, they will have to come through these reviews. So far, ominously little has been heard of them, either officially or via anguished leaks from their targets. In most respects, Mr Clarke's optimism last night was well founded. The economy is again growing reasonably strongly. Thanks to the supply side reforms of the past 15 years, we are better able than most of our European partners to face the changes and challenges that confront all developed countries. With a semi-independent Bank of England anxious to win its spurs, it should even be possible to keep inflation under control. But, if Mr Clarke wishes to present himself at the next election as the man who reduced taxes as well as increased them, he and Mr Portillo will have to show more mettle in the forthcoming public expenditure round than they have so far managed, and it is difficult to be optimistic that they will succeed.
