In an exclusive INTERFAX interview in Minsk Friday Kebich said that he had initially proposed such a move at the meeting of the government presidium Tuesday, 5 April and the idea was supported by all cabinet members. Kebich said that, according to sociological research, an absolute majority of Belarusian citizens supported a union with Russia. Kebich said that Belarus was a stable country and the economic union treaty that had been ratified by parliament contributed to the stability. He thought, however, that a poll would indirectly enhance the long-term stability of that treaty, whatever the political situation in the country.
