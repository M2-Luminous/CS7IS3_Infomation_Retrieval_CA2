When asked if the armed institution would accept a resolution they have openly opposed and which has been demanded by several grassroots sectors, Vargas de Morroquin said: "The Army's position is one of respect for whatever the Peace Commission decides." The military officer reiterated the Army does not fear the formation of such a commission, but she reiterated the inconveniences of establishing such a commission, which have been cited by the armed institution. She said, however: "We will respect the government's decision." Commission Exceeded Its Functions in El Salvador Dr. Armando Calderon Sol, Salvadoran Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA) presidential candidate, who is visiting Guatemala, has commented on the Truth Commission's role in the neighboring country. The commission has played a very important role, but, unfortunately, it has overstepped its functions and, for example, did not allow FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] commanders to run for public posts in a 10-year period. This, he has said, has closed opportunities for political participation. When asked if he recommends formation of a similar commission in Guatemala, Calderon Sol said: "The political situation here is very different to the Salvadoran one. I cannot make any suggestions in this respect."
