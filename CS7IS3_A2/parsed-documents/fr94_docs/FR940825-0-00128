FR940825-0-00128 FR940825-0-00022 Analysis of Comments and Changes In response to the Secretary's invitation in the NPRM, 17 persons submitted comments on the proposed regulations. The following is an analysis of the comments and the changes in the regulations since publication of the NPRM. Substantive issues are discussed under the section of the regulations to which they pertain. Technical and other minor changes made to the language published in the NPRM_and suggested changes the Secretary is not legally authorized to make under applicable statutory authority_are not addressed. Who is Eligible for a Grant? (Section 647.2) Comment: The Secretary received one comment regarding eligible applicants under this program. The commenter encouraged the Secretary to include ``disciplinary groups'' such as professional associations and public or private agencies or organizations or combinations of these groups as eligible applicants under the McNair program. The commenter indicated that these groups are included as eligible under section 402A of the Higher Education Act of 1965 as amended (HEA) and that the Department is being overly restrictive in this limitation. Discussion: The Secretary believes ยง647.2 of these regulations accurately reflects section 402E of the HEA which authorizes the McNair program. While section 402A of the HEA denotes the full complement of eligible applicants for all Federal TRIO Programs, institutions of higher education and combinations of those institutions are generally the only entities that can provide McNair program services. Further, section 402E(d) of the HEA provides for specific award considerations for institutions of higher education. However, applicants are encouraged to solicit and encourage the participation and coordination of professional associations, both private and public, to further enhance the quality of the services to be provided to the eligible participants. Changes: None. Who Is Eligible To Participate in a McNair Grant? (Section 647.3) Comments: Many commenters suggested that the Secretary change ยง647.3 by deleting the eligibility requirement that students must have completed their sophomore year of study to participate in the McNair program. The commenters felt that this requirement was overly restrictive and placed an additional eligibility requirement that went beyond legislative intent. Further, the commenters felt that early intervention, even at the freshman level, may provide the program participants with necessary information and motivation necessary to make future educational choices and decisions. Discussion: The Secretary has determined that the requirement that students must have completed their sophomore year of study before they are eligible to participate in the McNair program is overly restrictive and has deleted the requirement. However, because of the small size of the McNair program (less than 70 grants nationwide and under 2,000 participants currently), the Secretary encourages grantees to focus project services on students in their junior and senior years of undergraduate study. Thus, the Secretary prefers to see the emphasis of the McNair program placed on students who have completed the general college-wide requirements and are ready to select their major fields of study. Nevertheless, the Secretary will not absolutely preclude freshmen and sophomores from participation in the McNair program. Grantees are advised that recipients of summer research internships must have completed their sophomore year. It should be noted that a companion program, Student Support Services, emphasizes the provision of academic support services to freshmen and sophomore students, including mentoring and counseling, to encourage enrollment in postbaccalaureate programs of study. Changes: The requirement that students must have completed their sophomore year of study to be eligible to participate in the McNair program has been deleted except with regard to summer research internships. Comments: Several commenters questioned whether the proposed regulations would allow students enrolled at the master's level of studies to participate in the McNair program. Discussion: The proposed regulations do not preclude the participation of students enrolled in master's level studies. However, given the types of activities and services normally provided by the McNair program, the Secretary anticipates that students at the master's level of study probably have received effective preparation for doctoral studies. Changes: None. How Long Is a Project Period? (Section 647.5) Comment: The Secretary received one comment regarding whether the four-to-five year grant award cycles would be made retroactive to include the grantees currently funded under the McNair program.
