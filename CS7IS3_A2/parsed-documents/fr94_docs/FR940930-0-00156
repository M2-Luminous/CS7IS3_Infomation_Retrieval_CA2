(2) HD CFVs must meet conventional vehicle standards for THC, NO X , CO, PM, and OMHCE. Based on the Acurex report, Regulatory Support Document, and comments received from the Natural Gas Vehicle Coalition, EPA believes that alternative fuel vehicle technology will be available to meet these standards by 1998, and that gasoline and diesel engines may also be able to achieve these ULEV levels by that time or shortly thereafter. In any event, covered fleet operators are never required to purchase ULEVs to meet the requirements of the fleet program. ii. Zero-emission vehicle standards. Zero-emission vehicles (e.g. electric vehicles) are vehicles which have no emissions of the pollutants of concern. Therefore, as proposed, EPA today establishes heavy-duty ZEV standards of zero for NMHC + NO X , CO, particulates, and formaldehyde. (Emissions from non-fuel sources (e.g. tires, seats, paint, etc.) will likely exist as they do for conventional vehicles and other CFVs.) These final heavy-duty ZEV standards each require a 100 percent reduction in emissions from the heavy-duty LEV standards, which for each pollutant is comparable to the respective emission reductions required of light-duty CFV ZEVs. Furthermore, these federal ZEV standards are identical to California's incomplete medium-duty vehicle and diesel engine ZEV standards. Compliance with the ZEV standards may be assessed through engineering analysis, which shall include a description and analysis of all primary or auxiliary equipment and engines which concludes that no emissions of the stated pollutants is possible. The engineering analysis must determine that the vehicle fuel system(s) does not contain either carbon or nitrogen compounds (including air) which, when burned, form the above regulated exhaust emissions. Such criteria will also assure that evaporative emissions will not occur. Given these criteria there is no need to perform emission testing because the above pollutants cannot be emitted from the vehicle. However, compliance for ZEVs may be assessed through testing by performing the tests required by Parts 86 and 88 (Federal Test Procedure) when applicable.
