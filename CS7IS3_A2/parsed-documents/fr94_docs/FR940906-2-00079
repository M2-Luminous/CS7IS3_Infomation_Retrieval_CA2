FR940906-2-00079 FR940906-2-00065 NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION Abnormal Occurrence Report; Section 208 Report Submitted to the Congress Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the requirements of Section 208 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has published and issued another periodic report to Congress on abnormal occurrences (NUREG&hyph;0090, Vol. 17, No. 1). Under the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, which created NRC, an abnormal occurrence is defined as ``an unscheduled incident or event that the Commission (NRC) determines is significant from the standpoint of public health or safety.'' NRC has made a determination that events involving an actual loss or significant reduction in the degree of protection against radioactive properties of source, special nuclear, and by-product material are abnormal occurrences. The report to Congress is for the first calendar quarter of 1994. The report identifies the occurrences or events that the Commission determined to be significant and reportable; the remedial actions that were undertaken are also described. This report addresses seven abnormal occurrences (AOs) at NRC-licensed facilities. One involved inoperable main steam isolation valves at a boiling water reactor, four involved medical brachytherapy misadministrations, one involved a medical teletherapy misadministration, and one involved four lost reference sources. One AO that was reported by an Agreement State is also discussed; the information is current as of April 25, 1994. This event involved a therapeutic radiopharmaceutical misadministration. The report also contains updates on seven AOs previously reported by NRC licensees and one AO previously reported by an Agreement State licensee. For the period January 1 to March 31, 1994, no new ``Other Events of Interest'' were reported but an update to a previously reported therapeutic misadministration is included. A copy of the report is available for inspection or copying for a fee at the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW. (Lower Level), Washington, D.C. 20555, or at any of the nuclear power plant Local Public Document Rooms throughout the country. Copies of NUREG&hyph;0090, Vol. 17, No. 1 (or any of the previous reports in this series), may be purchased from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Post Office Box 37082, Washington, DC 20013&hyph;7082. A year's subscription to the NUREG&hyph;0090 series publication, which consists of four issues, is also available. Copies of the report may also be purchased from the National Technical Information Service, U.S. Department of Commerce, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161. Dated at Rockville, MD this 30th day of August, 1994. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Andrew L. Bates, Acting Secretary of the Commission.
