FR940621-2-00007 FR940621-2-00004 Rural Electrification Administration Central Iowa Power Cooperative; Finding of No Significant Impact AGENCY: Rural Electrification Administration, USDA. ACTION: Notice of finding of no significant impact. SUMMARY: Notice is hereby given that the Rural Electrification Administration (REA), pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations (40 CFR Parts 1500&hyph;1508), and REA Environmental Policies and Procedures (7 CFR Part 1794), has made a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) with respect to a project proposed by Central Iowa Power Cooperative (CIPCO), of Cedar Rapids, Iowa. The proposed project consists of the construction of a 345 kV and a 161 kV transmission line and associated facilities. The facilities would be located in Scott and Muscatine Counties, Iowa. REA has concluded that the impacts from the proposed project would not be significant and that the proposed action is not a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. Therefore, the preparation of an environmental impact statement is not necessary. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Lawrence R. Wolfe, Chief, Environmental Compliance Branch, Electric Staff Division, room 1246, Agriculture South Building, Rural Electrification Administration, Washington, DC 20250&hyph;1500, telephone (202) 720&hyph;1784. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: REA, in accordance with its environmental policies and procedures, required that CIPCO prepare a Borrower's Environmental Report (BER) reflecting the potential impacts of the proposed facilities. The BER, which includes input from the Federal, State, and local agencies, has been adopted as REA's Environmental Assessment for the project in accordance with 7 CFR 1794.61. REA has concluded that the BER represents an accurate assessment of the environmental impacts of the project. The proposed project will not affect any known properties listed or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places. Archaeological resource surveys for the sites of the 345 kV Walcott Switching Station and the 345/161 kV substation at the IPSCO plant and the right-of-way of the 345 kV transmission line will be conducted. In compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, the survey reports will be reviewed by the Iowa State Historic Preservation Officer and REA. Clearance must be obtained from both agencies before CIPCO can commence any ground disturbing activities associated with project construction. In addition, if previously unknown resources are discovered during project construction, CIPCO will halt construction while the significance of the find and proper mitigation is determined. Given these procedures, the project will not have any significant effect on cultural resources. The project should have no impact on floodplains, water quality, federally listed or proposed for listing threatened or endangered species or their critical habitat, and no significant impact on important farmland or wetlands. The purpose of this project is to provide electrical service to IPSCO's steel mill. This would be accomplished by the construction of a 345 kV switching station, approximately 8 miles of 345 kV transmission line, 13 miles of 161 kV transmission line, and a 345/161 kV substation at the IPSCO plant and modification of an existing 345/161 kV substation. The 345 kV switching station, to be known as the Walcott Switching Station, would be constructed and operated by the Iowa Illinois Gas and Electric Company of Davenport, Iowa, on property to be owned by CIPCO. The 345 kV transmission line would extend from the Walcott Switching Station to the IPSCO plant site, a distance of about 8 miles and terminate at a 345 kV/161 kV substation on the IPSCO plant site. Approximately 2.4 miles of the proposed 345 kV line would be double-circuited and share ROW with an existing 69 kV line. Generally a 120-foot wide ROW would be needed to accommodate the 345 kV transmission line. The 345 kV/161 kV substation on the mill site would require a total area of about 3 acres. The CIPCO portion of the substation would require about 1.6 acres and it would include two transmission line terminations; one for the 345 kV line and one for the 161 kV line. Modifications to the existing substation would not require any additional land. The 161 kV transmission line would be constructed from an existing substation to the IPSCO plant site on an existing 69 kV transmission line ROW. The line would be rebuilt to a 161 kV specifications. However, no additional ROW would be needed for the proposed changes. The preferred structures are designed for a future second 161 kV circuit. However, building the second circuit is not a part of the proposed project. Alternatives considered to the project as proposed were no action, onsite generation, upgrading existing facilities, various transmission system additions, alternative transmission line routes, and alternative switching station sites. REA has considered these alternatives and concluded that the project as proposed will allow CIPCO to provide adequate and reliable electric service to the IPSCO steel mill with a minimum of adverse impact. Copies of the BER and FONSI are available for review at REA at the aforementioned address, or may be reviewed at or obtained from the offices of CIPCO, P.O.
