The Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] in turn says that it will impose complete club discipline. According to the SLD, introducing voting discipline within the PSL is exclusively Waldemar Pawlak's business. It is hard to tell to what extent the behavior of some Sejm deputies for the PSL is just a game under which they will vote in favor of the government's budget draft anyway. The PSL Keeps Playing "Voting on the budget will be political, it will be about the stability of the governing coalition, and it will be a test of the PSL's and the SLD's abilities to jointly work out a compromise-based economic program," says the PSL's Janusz Piechocinski. Despite the fact that the governing coalition's leaders have obliged themselves to jointly support the government budget draft, the PSL Sejm deputies of the Sejm Agricultural Commission continue to demand an increase in agricultural expenditures by 10 trillion zlotys [Z]. The commission adopted a proposal for such an amendment as early as two weeks ago. The commission's chairman, the PSL's Roman Jagielinski, defends the pproach: "I will not change my view because I am bound by a decision by the commission and by the PSL Chief Council [no closing quotation as published]. As early as December, the Chief Council imposed an obligation on its members who are Sejm deputies to increase the budget means for agriculture by Z4 trillion, out of which, let us recall here, half has already been taken into account in the government's budget draft. The Sejm Agriculture Commission is demanding an additional Z10 trillion; it says there is a necessity to increase subsidies from the budget for more areas linked to agriculture, among them banks. Jagielinski explains that the contradiction between a statement by the prime minister (PSL chief) and the position taken by the Sejm Agriculture Commission is caused by a lack of an information policy inside the PSL. The issue of supporting the government's budget draft was not discussed with the PSL authorities, not even on the eve of the coalition summit, during which leaders of both parties obliged themselves to jointly support the budget draft that had been submitted. Jagielinski allows for the possibility of a division within the PSL Deputies Club during the vote on the budget, even if clubwide discipline is introduced. Other PSL members are also talking about a lack of consultation on the issue between the PSL authorities and the Sejm deputies. "It is not known to what extent the demands for increases in budgetary expenditures are the PSL's tactical maneuver and to what extent the maneuver has been agreed upon with the coalition partner," Piechocinski says. Both parties could be eager to convince the electorate that they fought till the end to keep election promises. Lack of budget means could be a good explanation for consenting to the government's version. But the SLD regards adopting the budget in the government's version as a principle from which the party has no intention of deviating. According to assurances coming out of the SLD Deputies Club, there will be a discipline enforced during the vote. SLD leaders do not expect Sejm deputies for the All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement to break away from the voting. The trade unionists' moods should be calmed by shifts of individual items within the budget and by devoting these means for social goals and for professional activation of the unemployed. Left Wing Gathers Strength It is not known whether the coalition's stability and durability will be affected by an amendment submitted by the Sejm Ownership Transformations Commission to "Directions of Privatizations" contained in the budget. The amendment introduces greater supervision by the Sejm over privatization of economic enterprises in strategic branches. That provision is also included in the coalition agreement, but, according to some of the Sejm deputies for the SLD, it is so flexible that it is hard to predict what the provision will mean in practice. If Sejm deputies impose too strict a control on measures undertaken by the ownership transformations minister, that could become another reason for a deteriorating situation in the government and the coalition. After the Cabinet crisis, which has been perceived as the SLD's loss, Aleksander Kwasniewski's closest associates went on unscheduled vacations. Until the return of the SLD leader from Lillehammer, which is supposed to be in the middle of next week, they were "forbidden to go within 100 meters of the Sejm building." Only sessions by individual commissions are supposed to be an alleviating circumstance for those who disobey. Sejm deputies for the SLD announce that, after they are back from their vacations, they will begin negotiations.
