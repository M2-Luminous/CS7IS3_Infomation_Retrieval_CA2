"It is essential that human rights are made an intrinsic part of all peacekeeping activities," the report says. It was released today in Mozambique, one of the countries where UN peacekeepers have a weak mandate, according to Amnesty. The report contrasts two countries where human rights monitoring was made part of the UN mandate -- El Salvador and Cambodia -- with six African countries where it is minimal, inconsistent or non-existent. In Somalia, Angola, Western Sahara, Liberia, Rwanda and Mozambique the neglect of human rights has led to disaster or at best stalemate, the report says. "In some operations human rights have been ignored and UN personnel have stood by, silent, while serious violations were taking place.... That must not be allowed to continue." The report condemns the UN's failure to denounce such abuses as Unita's refusal to release prisoners held in Jamba, or the Moroccan government's blocking of investigations into "disappeared" Saharawis. In Angola, Amnesty believes the UN's lack of response to peace pact violations in the run-up to the election contributed to UNITA's contempt for the peace process and the return to war. Amnesty calls for the principle established in the former Yugoslavia -- of all UN bodies having a duty to provide human rights information -- to be applied universally. The report cites Sudan as an "urgent humanitarian challenge" and says UN agencies should monitor and demand compliance with international human rights and humanitarian law standards by all sides, rather than keeping quiet to ensure access to populations in need. "This cannot be avoided in the name of humanitarianism," the report says in a paragraph which will be controversial with aid agencies. Among the report's proposals is the appointment in Angola of a UN human rights commissioner, and for on-site monitors in Iraq, an idea endorsed both by the special rapporteur on Iraq, Max van der Stoel, and the UN General Assembly.
