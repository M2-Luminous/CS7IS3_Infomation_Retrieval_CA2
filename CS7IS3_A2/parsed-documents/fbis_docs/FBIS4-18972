A high-level U.S. State Department memorandum to the White House said: "Considering the political and economic developments in Turkey, President Clinton's receiving Prime Minister Tansu Ciller twice within a short time may convey the wrong message to Turkey. The meeting may encourage particular expectations by the Turkish Government, expectations that cannot be fulfilled. Considering that the United States will be unable to fulfill those expectations, a difficult period may emerge in U.S.-Turkish relations." The emergence of such a view in the U.S. Administration only a few days before Ciller's visit has surprised experienced diplomatic circles in Washington. They have said that the difference of opinion shows the unease in the U.S. Administration over Ciller's visit. A source close to the U.S. Administration's departments concerned with Turkey has said: "The U.S. State Department is worried about the Ciller government's future. It has not said so but it is worried. We know that particular reports have been drawn up within the U.S. Administration predicting that the Ciller government will not survive long. So the U.S. State Department is worried that President Clinton's meeting with Prime Minister Ciller may convey the wrong message to Turkey." In addition to the U.S. State Department, Clinton's closest advisers have also opposed his meeting with Ciller. Only Jenonne Walker, who is responsible for Turkish affairs on the U.S. National Security Council, favored the meeting. Walker reportedly supported the meeting because Tansu Ciller is a woman. Reportedly, President Clinton may agree to meet Ciller briefly in New York so as not to disappoint her. The U.S. Administration is convinced that Ciller wants to meet Clinton to ask him to support her government in removing the economic crisis in Turkey. But Clinton can provide no tangible aid to Ankara because the U.S. budget does not even have one dollar to spare for an additional aid package to Turkey.
