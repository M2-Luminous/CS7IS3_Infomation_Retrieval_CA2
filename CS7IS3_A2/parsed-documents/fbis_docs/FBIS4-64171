Major General Aleksander Einseln earlier this month had asked Laar's explanation for information provided to a Central Staff official in a confidential letter by an aide to Leonid Apananski, considered a key figure in the country's major arms purchase deal with Israel, POSTIMEES reports. Apananski's aide in the letter from May 16 had informed Central Staff Colonel Arvo Sirel about a May 10-12 visit to Tallinn of an Israeli delegation over, as the letter puts it, a cooperation project started by Mart Laar and Israeli General Dan Shamron. "The work group participated together with their Estonian colleagues from the Interior Ministry, police and the Defense Ministry in a joint seminar for resolving the issues related to the country's interior and outside security," the letter reads. The discussions had also been about the defense concept and doctrine, the Apananski aide said. Einseln in his letter to the prime minister on the dame day [as received], May 16, asked why Laar was dealing with security issues without coordinating his activity with the head of the Armed Forces. The commander in chief asked a written explanation from the prime minister on the allegedly existing cooperation project started by Laar and General Shamron and what were the authorities granted to Apananski, a private businessman, for dealing with issues of state defense. Laar in his answer on the following day stated that the government had signed no cooperation projects with General Shamron. He also denied any powers granted to Apananski over state defense, and added Einseln should ask for information from Defense Minister Indrek Kannik, by now resigned, or Interior Minister Heiki Arike. Einseln in his interview with POSTIMEES said he was not satisfied with the prime minister's answer who, he said, was not completely denying that something was going on, but had referred the answer to other ministers. He added that he hadn't still received the answers to his May 23 letters to the defense and interior ministers. The commander in chief said he was going to continue seeking clarity over the issue, as he still didn't know whether plans for the defense cooperation really existed. He said that if something was going on, "such things must not be done without my approval, agreement." Einseln also said that if the government has decided to act without informing him, it must also start looking for a new army chief.
