Four helicopters of the Lesotho Army flew into South Africa yesterday, and apparently the plan was to escape the skirmish in Maseru, and are grounded at Ladybrand. The South African foreign minister, Mr. Pik Botha, arrived in Lesotho aboard a private jet today to discuss the Lesotho Armed forces' fracas with Defense Minister, the Right Honorable Prime Minister, Dr. Ntsu Mokhehle; cabinet ministers; commanders of the army and the police; as well as the opposition leader, Mr. Sekhonyane. In an interview with our reporters Mr. Botha said South Africa will never recognize any government taken by force in Lesotho. He said he had come to Lesotho to establish the nature of the fracas within the Lesotho armed forces, but not to dictate terms to the Lesotho Government. Mr. Botha said after consultations with the Lesotho authorities he was assured that the military problem will be solved peacefully.
