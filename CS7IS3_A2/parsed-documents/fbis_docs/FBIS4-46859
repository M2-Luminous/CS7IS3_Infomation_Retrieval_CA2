The resolution of social questions depends directly on the state of the economy. While the fall in production, mutual nonpayments, and delays in paying wages and pensions continue, the situation in the social sphere will remain tense. However, positive changes have also been noted recently. First of all, as Russian Federation Minister of Labor G.G. Melikyan noted at the conference, inflation rates have successfully been brought down: In recent months they were 20-30 percent, but in April 6 percent. Some rise in the population's standard of living has been noted: Last year prices increased by a factor of 7.5 and incomes by a factor of 8.5. Within outgoings the proportion taken up by food is not increasing, meaning that people have stopped spending all their money on produce and have begun to acquire some material goods as well. Restrictions on demand have begun to take effect, the market is filling up, and trade stocks have increased by one-third. All this is encouraging -- prices will not increase. But, as many of the conference's participants said, the important thing is that there has been a structural advance, from the industrial to the social level. Questions of the provision of essential needs are becoming a priority. In spite of the difficulties involved in financing social programs, all possible measures are being taken in the regions to support the most vulnerable groups in society -- pensioners, large families and families with absent parents, invalids, and persons unable to withstand economic difficulties on their own. The regional administrative organs' influence over the implementation of social policy has increased. Many oblasts have developed and are implementing their own programs for the social protection of the population. In the Komi Republic three programs -- "Childhood," "Health," and "Care" -- are being successfully implemented. In Ulyanovsk Oblast non-production construction projects are being carried out vigorously -- 19 schools have been built, many kilometers of asphalt roads have been laid, and many villages have been provided with water supplies. The oblast has succeded in becoming completely self-sufficient in sugar, vegetable oil, and potatoes, which will make it possible to curb price increases. The conference participants analyzed the experience of organs of executive power in the provinces -- for this the speakers presented interesting information and also discussed the difficulties and problems involved in implementing state social guarantees. It was decided to place the emphasis in this work on the regions on the condition that there is serious support at the federal level. Yu.F. Yarov, deputy chairman of the Russian Federation Government, L.F. Bezlepkina, minister of social protection, V.V. Barchuk, chairman of the Russian Pension Fund, Ye.F. Lakhova, chairman of the Russian Federation President's Commission on Questions of Women, the Family, and Demography, and leaders of departments ensuring that social policy is carried out in this country participated in the conference's work.
