According to Deputy Luis German Lagos, a member of the Innovation and Unity Party, data -- in the hands of the United Nations -- presented at a recent seminar on human rights in the United States indicate that President Carlos Roberto Reina could be a victim of a coup d'etat within a period of time not yet established. Nevertheless, the military officer said that if the nation is entering a state of law and is initiating a phase of democracy, such an idea should not even be brought up. "If Gen. Luis Alonso Discua Elvir, commander in chief of the Armed Forces, were to propose this type of situation, I would prefer to resign from my post before breaking my oath to the Constitution and the laws," he said. He said that this type of speculation "makes us lose some of the credibility we have achieved as a nation in the eyes of the nations of the world," adding that in Honduras the coup d'etat stage has been overcome and we are now on the road that all Hondurans wanted. He added that there have been attempts to pin negative aspects onto Reina's in order to harm his image. "It is certain we are a poor nation but we are also a nation with dignity, with an Armed Forces based on the nation's needs. "While I am at the helm of the Armed Forces such a monstrosity would not cross my mind," he stressed after recalling that "we have sworn before the Constitution of the Republic and before the altar of the nation our loyalty to the established governments." Making reference to Deputy Luis German Lagos, Discua Elvir said that when an independent representative attends events sponsored by such organizations as the United Nations, he should be serious enough to weigh this type of information. "A number of hypothetical aspects and situations related to these countries were discussed there, he assured, after adding that these types of matters do not favor the nation. [sentence as published] Likewise, he asked all Hondurans to "give their total support to President Reina's government for the nation to advance." Meanwhile, he recognized that the armed institution has many times voiced its opinion on matters of national interest, but as recommendations, adding that he personally conveys these to the president. "It is shameful that our country is placed on the same level as African nations where presidents sill die, where there are coups d'etat." I believe that due to our proximity to North America where the headquarters of this important organization is located, this type of situation should not occur," Gen. Discua noted. "I want to tell the Honduran people and the whole world that at no time will the Armed Forces think of acting in such a manner... this was a matter of the past, these were historical, political moments. I do not think this should be repeated," he stressed. According to him, the alleged conspiracy against the president and the accusations of a coup d'etat are the work of small groups that want to create distrust within the community toward their authorities. "They attempt to create a climate of anxiety and weakness within the community," the military chief charged. He recalled that Honduras is beginning a new government that faces a series of problems and the government does not have a magic wand to resolve the problems immediately. "We are not in a position to resist, rather we are in a position to give the president all the support, all the loyalty he deserves as the nation's first authority," he noted. "I do not know where they want to take the nation. I believe we should be the architects of our own destiny, we should be the ones called on to resolve our own problems," he remarked. "I hope that we will not have situations similar to those in Mexico where a political leader dies; Guatemala where a high-ranking government official is murdered; and other nations where fratricidal leftist forces have emerged," he said. Without naming names, Discua said these persons or institutions do not act like friends of Honduras, which is striving to come out ahead. He said: It is not true the military corps has diverted from its constitutional role; "we continue to support and maintain our institution's professionalism." Discua added that, since all the institutions currently face a difficult situation, the Armed Forces are aware of their new role in a country that is immersed in a development and democracy process. The Armed Forces, and not just in Honduras, have a clearly defined framework where they must assume their responsibility; "and I have been clear, and sufficiently explanatory, with the president of the Republic," he said. Discua thinks the military corps must be the backbone of the democratic system which prevails in Latin American countries; and they should not assume a leading role as in previous decades. "That must now be history; we had our role, but now we must all become involved in solving the country's problem. We are contributing our quota of sacrifice; we are assuming our responsibility; and, logically, we must guarantee the social welfare of our corps' members." The Armed Forces chief emphasized he is responsible for the welfare of its members, and he must keep them trained and ready to counter any situation which taints, or tries to taint, the country's sovereignty or threatens its democratic system. Later, the military commander said the Armed Forces have clearly defined their role for the future; and he asked Hondurans who became involved in the previous decade's Cold War to conduct a self-analysis and see exactly what happened. "I have always said that whoever tries to see the past is trying to return to the past," he said when asked if the accusations came from enemies of the armed corps involved in the 1980's confrontation. The military corps looks ahead, toward the country's future, he said. "If the Honduran people were ever involved in the defense of an ideological position that was imposed on them, now is the time to stop and conduct a self-analysis to see exactly what happened," he demanded. Discua added: It was a cold war, a situation imposed on our country; and we became involved, in one way or another, because we believed it was the right thing. "However, if we continue to look back, some people might return to the past; but the Armed Forces are not in that situation -- we look ahead and we believe we have a great mission to accomplish, an important role to play," he emphasized. Discua Elvir believes the Armed Forces have matured in their responsibility as an institution. "We should have always had that maturity but, due to external circumstances, it opposed many situations with which, perhaps, we never agreed."
