FR940610-0-00129 FR940610-0-00023 (c) Actuarial valuations before May 1, 1989. The present value of annuities, unitrust interests, life estates, terms of years, remainders, and reversions transferred by gift before May 1, 1989, is determined under the following sections: ␣ 1After 1Transfers 2Before 2Regulations 1Applicable ␣ Jan. 1, 1952 25.2512&hyph;5A(a) Dec. 31, 1951 Jan. 1, 1971 25.2512&hyph;5A(b) Dec. 31, 1970 Dec. 1, 1983 25.2512&hyph;5A(c) Dec. 30, 1983 May 1, 1989 25.2512&hyph;5A(d) (d) Actuarial valuations after April 30, 1989_ (1) In general. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section and §25.7520&hyph;3(b) (relating to exceptions to the use of prescribed tables under certain circumstances), if the valuation date for the gift is after April 30, 1989, the fair market value of annuities, life estates, terms of years, remainders, and reversions transferred after April 30, 1989, is the present value of such interests determined by use of standard or special section 7520 actuarial factors. These factors are derived by using the appropriate section 7520 interest rate and, if applicable, the mortality component for the valuation date of the interest that is being valued. See §§25.7520&hyph;1 through 25.7520&hyph;4. The fair market value of a qualified annuity interest described in section 2702(b)(1) and a qualified unitrust interest described in section 2702(b)(2) is the present value of such interests determined under §25.7520&hyph;1(c). (2) Specific interests. When the donor transfers property in trust or otherwise and retains an interest therein, generally, the value of the gift is the value of the property transferred less the value of the donor's retained interest. However, if the donor transfers property after October 8, 1990, to or for the benefit of a member of the donor's family, the value of the gift is the value of the property transferred less the value of the donor's retained interest as determined under section 2702. If the donor assigns or relinquishes an annuity, life estate, remainder, or reversion that the donor holds by virtue of a transfer previously made by the donor or another, the value of the gift is the value of the interest transferred. However, see section 2519 for a special rule in the case of the assignment of an income interest by a person who received the interest from a spouse. (i) Charitable remainder trusts. The fair market value of a remainder interest in a pooled income fund, as defined in §1.642(c)&hyph;5 of this chapter (Income Tax Regulations), is its value determined under §1.642(c)&hyph;6(e) of this chapter. The fair market value of a remainder interest in a charitable remainder annuity trust, as described in §1.664&hyph;2(a) of this chapter, is its present value determined under §1.664&hyph;2(c) of this chapter. The fair market value of a remainder interest in a charitable remainder unitrust, as defined in §1.664&hyph;3 of this chapter, is its present value determined under §1.664&hyph;4(e) of this chapter. The fair market value of a life interest or term for years in a charitable remainder unitrust is the fair market value of the property as of the date of transfer less the fair market value of the remainder interest, determined under §1.664&hyph;4(e) of this chapter. (ii) Ordinary remainder and reversionary interests. If the interest to be valued is to take effect after a definite number of years or after the death of one individual, the present value of the interest is computed by multiplying the value of the property by the appropriate remainder interest actuarial factor (that corresponds to the applicable section 7520 interest rate and remainder interest period) in Table B (for a term certain) or Table S (for one measuring life), as the case may be. Tables B and S are included in §20.2031&hyph;7(d)(6) of this chapter (Estate Tax Regulations) and in Internal Revenue Service Publication 1457. For information about obtaining actuarial factors for other types of remainder interests, see paragraph (d)(4) of this section.
