Metropolitan Police Department officials said they have already launched an investigation into the case, in which a large number of such passes are believed to have been copied and put to use. The passes for exemption from highway tolls have been issued by the Japanese Government for the past 30 years under an agreement with U.S. military authorities in Japan. Users of the passes simply write down their vehicle number when passing through toll booths and the agency later reimburses highway administrative bodies. The amount expended by the agency for that purpose amounts to some 600 million yen a year. According to U.S. military officials, over 900 copied passes have been found at toll booths throughout Japan.
