FR940721-0-00045 FR940721-0-00014 GM, Ford and Chrysler also each submitted individual comments. To a large extent, these comments reiterated arguments made by AAMA. An additional argument made by GM concerned the calculation methodology for determining the percentage U.S./Canadian content for a carline. GM stated that the agency had proposed that the proper method to establish the U.S./Canadian content for a carline would be to reasonably project the installation rates for all equipment options and choice offered on that carline; multiply those rates by the U.S./Canadian content value for each option or choice, and divide the result by the total value for all equipment, domestic or foreign. That company stated that it has found for cost management and planning purposes that the use of a high volume configuration carline model results in better management control of the assembly process than the so-called average equipped carline model. GM stated that such a model has found wide acceptance in calculations made for corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) emission testing configurations and most recently for vehicle configurations under NAFTA. That company recommended that the agency permit manufacturers to use established carline cost management models for establishing the percentage U.S./Canadian content required to be included in the AALA domestic content label. Foreign vehicle manufacturers also recommended numerous changes in the proposed requirements, but often from a very different perspective from that of the domestic vehicle manufacturers. For example, while the domestic manufacturers urged a change in the proposed definition of ``final assembly'' so that it is considered to begin earlier in the vehicle manufacturing process, the foreign manufacturers generally urged changes in the definition so that it is considered to begin later in the vehicle manufacturing process. The Association of International Automobile Manufacturers (AIAM) and Toyota stated that the point of final assembly should be considered to be no sooner than the point at which the engine and vehicle body are fastened together. AIAM argued that the Labeling Act defines ``final assembly'' as the time when ``all component parts necessary to the mechanical operation of such automobile are included,'' and stated that the proposed definition would defy the stated intent of the Act and defy all conventional wisdom with respect to the automotive manufacturing process. Nissan stated that an appropriate point to be identified as the beginning of final assembly is the moment in the production process just before the attachment of the engine and drive train to the chassis. Mitsubishi stated that the point where final assembly begins should be defined as the point at which the engine and body are fastened. According to that company, this would be more consistent with the agency's proposed definition of ``final assembly point'', where all components and parts necessary to the mechanical operation of such automobile are included. BMW commented that NHTSA's proposal defined ``final assembly'' with regard to the body as the point at which the body leaves the paint shop. That company stated that this portion of the definition is very precise and that the costs associated with it will likely be similar between manufacturers regardless of painting process or vehicle design. BMW commented, however, with regard to definition of final assembly of the chassis, that it believes a manufacturer would be able to tailor the assembly process to take advantage of the definition and alter its carline's part content percentages. That company stated that this portion of the definition employs the point at which the engine and transmission are placed on the chassis frame or on the assembly cradle. According to BMW, because this point can be varied, a manufacturer would have the opportunity to install or not install equipment such as the brake system including ABS, wheels and tires, and interior components and trim. BMW commented that a manufacturer could choose to install the engine last, essentially including all labor and overhead in its parts content calculations. BMW recommended that the agency investigate assembly processes and include a more definitive point to stop including costs associated with the chassis assembly. The foreign vehicle manufacturers also generally had very different views than the domestic manufacturers with respect to the treatment of vehicle models including some vehicles assembled in the U.S./Canada and other vehicles assembled in other countries. AIAM stated that failing to allow manufacturers to distinguish between countries of production within a particular carline directly contradicts the Act's stated purpose of providing consumers with the best and most understandable information possible. That organization stated that it believes that NHTSA has the authority to adopt a country of production split for determining the parts content percentages for carlines, in order to follow the stated intent of the Act. According to AIAM, without carline subdivision, the information presented to the consumer will be at best misleading, and at worst totally inaccurate. The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association (JAMA) urged that separate calculations for carlines manufactured in more than one country at least be permitted. That organization stated that the failure to specify such percentages separately would result in an overstated domestic content on imported vehicles and an understated one on domestically produced vehicles. According to JAMA, the U.S. consumer cannot possibly be served by such misleading information. While numerous foreign vehicle manufacturers objected to the agency's proposal to exclude country of assembly as a factor to consider in making carline determinations, several indicated that, if NHTSA did not change that position, they supported the concept of providing additional information on the label concerning such vehicles. Honda, for example, stated that such additional information would improve the accuracy of the information provided to the consumer. The foreign vehicle manufacturers differed among themselves on the question of whether an explanatory note should be provided concerning the percentage of a typical vehicle's wholesale cost to the dealer that is attributable to parts content. AIAM, for example, stated that such additional information would only serve to confuse the consumer, and that a single percentage range to be used by all manufacturers cannot adequately illustrate the many variations involved in the manufacture and distribution of motor vehicles. JAMA, however, argued that it is vital to consumer understanding to clarify the fact that the label calculation does not include vehicle final assembly labor. The foreign vehicle manufacturers strongly supported a limited exclusion for vehicles with low U.S./Canadian parts content. However, several of them argued that unless the agency also permits a limited exclusion from providing the information required for item two of the label, i.e., the percentage parts content originating from major sources of foreign content, there would be only a minimal benefit from an exclusion from specifying the percentage U.S./Canadian parts content. This is because the foreign manufacturers would have to collect detailed information from most of their suppliers to calculate the information for item two of the label. The foreign manufacturers suggested various alternative approaches, such as requiring them to specify the countries that constitute major sources of foreign content but not the percentages from such countries.
