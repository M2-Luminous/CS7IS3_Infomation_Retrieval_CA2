During the past week they have been warning that "attacks against our positions will not pay off for the possible aggressor." The prevalent opinion in the Srpska republic army is that in case of an attack, every tenth "steel bird" in a squadron comprising 60 to 70 planes would not return to base. If the NATO planes overflying Serbian positions as part of the "Deny Flight" operation were given the order to unload their deadly cargo, they would have to descend to an altitude of 20,00 meters due to the fog and snow in the Sarajevo area, at which point they would become an easy target for the Serbian artillery and various antiaircraft defense systems. The Srpska republic army currently has in its possession 20-mm, 23-mm, 30-mm (Praga), 40-mm (Bofors), and 57-mm antiaircraft guns. The "Bofors" are the most precise ones, because they have a laser rangefinder device combined with an "Erickson" radar. The missile batteries are comprised of SA-2 missile systems with an 18 km vertical, and a 50 km horizontal range; SA-3 missile systems with a 15 km vertical, and a 25 km horizontal range; SA-6 missile systems with an 18 km vertical and 60 km horizontal range; and SA-9 missile systems with a 5 km vertical, and 7 km horizontal range. The SA-6 and SA-9 missiles can be maneuvered. In addition to this, the popular Arrows (SA-7), Russian "Needles," and the U.S. portable systems, the well-known "Stingers," are stationed in around 100 significant buildings in the Srpska republic. Owing to sensitivity to electronic jamming, the missile systems are combined with guns and portable antiaircraft projectiles [as published]. Antiaircraft guns cannot be electronically jammed, therefore, these weapons, when properly masked and entrenched, could pose a significant threat to the low-flying NATO planes piloted by Englishmen, Turks, Frenchmen, Americans.... According to certain information, NATO pilots already have some 200 targets in the Srpska republic marked on their maps which would be bombed in case an order to launch air strikes were issued. The Western military alliance's threats are, according to the latest information, still topical. That is why the public is still speculating what would happen if the Bosnian Serbs were to take UN Protection Force troops as hostages in the event of air strikes. According to Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency member Ejup Ganic, if this situation were to arise, the NATO planes (Falcons, Tornadoes, Mirages....) would bomb military targets in Serbia, bridges, and the Banja Luka suburbs. Luckily, NATO did not have to go through with this "baptism of fire," but its planes continue to "slash" the skies over Bosnia. The United Nations is planning to open Tuzla airport for traffic on 7 March. According to UN information, this operation again envisages the participation of the Western military alliance's planes.
