A leading official of the Chinese judicial department said that according to yesterday's WASHINGTON POST and WASHINGTON TIMES, Harry Wu said at a news conference on may 15 that the Shandong United Steel Tube Company in East China's Shandong Province had shipped 180,000 pounds of steel tubes to two Florida-based subsidiaries of the Waxmon Company of the United States. Wu claimed that the Chinese company is a "prison-labor factory." The official said that the fact is that the company, based in the coastal city of Qingdao, is a subsidiary of the Shandong Provincial Branch of the China Foreign Trade Transportation Corporation. The factory is by no means a "prison-labor factory" and has never exported steel tubes to the United States, he added. Harry Wu also claimed at the news conference that the Houston- based Cosmos Trading Company of the U.S. had imported hardware and tools from the Shenda Tools Factory based in Hangzhou, the capital of east China's Zhejiang Province. He argued that the factory had "2,000 prisoners." The official said that the factory, built in 1991 is by no means a prison-labor factory, but a factory attached to the Zhejiang Provincial Department of the Machine-Building Industry. The factory manufactures all kinds of manual tools and employs 400 people, none of whom is a prisoner, he added. Harry Wu also claimed that he had taken pictures and videos of prisoner-made toys, hardware and Christmas tree decoration lights. According to the official, everyone knows that such goods are available all over China. "So how can Wu's pictures and videos prove that these goods are prison-labor products?" he asked. Harry Wu boasted that he had collected "evidence" in 26 prison- labor factories in China. The official said that in fact, he had not entered any prison in China, but had just taken pictures and videos at a distance outside prisons. Then Wu montaged these videos with what he had taken in streets to spread sensational rumors, in an attempt to deceive the general public, he noted. The official said that the Chinese Government was conscientious in implementing a memorandum of understanding between the Chinese and American Governments on banning the import and export of prison- labor products. Not long ago, officials of the U.S. Embassy in China visited three reform-through-labor units in Guangdong Province, he said, adding that they were now visiting another two such units in Zhejiang Province. "Sino-American cooperation in this regard is now proceeding smoothly," he said. "At this time, Harry Wu and others are repeatedly spreading rumors everywhere, with their ulterior motives all too clear," he said.
