Beset by financial, day-to-day and political cataclysms, our countrymen are not giving much thought to ecology, perhaps still believing that this is a problem only the state needs to worry about. If one compares the opinion of people in different age groups, one find that the greatest willingness to make sacrifices in order to solve environmental problems is expressed by people between the ages of 25 and 40 (``yes'' -- 45 percent; ``neither yes nor no'' -- 20 percent; and ``no'' -- 26 percent). Among people over the age of 55 there are an equal number of people interested in environmental issues as there are persons who are indifferent to them (``yes'' -- 33 percent; ``no'' -- 31 percent). Most of the people who express a willingness to solve environmental protection problems have higher or incomplete higher education -- with 51 percent saying ``yes'' (``no'' -- 24 percent; ``neither yes nor no''-- 18 percent). Among those with incomplete secondary education 30 percent responded ``yes'' (``no'' -- 31 percent; ``neither yes nor no'' -- 20 percent). Despite the fact that 40 percent of those responding are willing to pay, those who really want to do something to improve the environmental situation are considerably fewer in number. In response to the question ``Are you willing to give up some conveniences in your life in order to preserve the environment?'' only 30 percent of Russian citizens said ``yes,'' and 37 percent said they were ``not willing.'' The least interest in preserving nature at their own expense was expressed by rural residents (``yes'' -- 30 percent; ``no'' -- 28 percent). The most interest was found among urbanites (``yes'' -- 47 percent; ``no'' -- 28 percent). In response to the question ``Are you willing, for the sake of preserving the environment, to pay substantially higher prices for goods and services so that more money will be available for environmental protection?'' 40 percent of those surveyed replied ``yes'' and 27 percent said ``no.''
