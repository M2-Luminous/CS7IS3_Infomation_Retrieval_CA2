The conventional technology used for the removal is consisted of coagulation, sedimentation and filtration systems. However, when quality of raw water changes, the suspended solids leak into filtered water, often fouling subsequent RO membrane modules. If we can substitute conventional pretreatment system with membrane separation technology, the subsequent RO fouling will be eliminated and stable operation will become possible. At the same time, system will also be simplified. However, there have been no appropriate membrane modules applicable for the pretreatment system, and very few attempts have been made to replace the coagulation, sedimentation and filtration process with membrane system. We succeeded in developing a new spiral membrane module which can directly feed the raw water containing suspended solids. Due to its construction with through water channels, this module is applicable to the direct feeding of the raw water containing a large quantity of suspended solids, promising the possible development of its new applications. However, the requirement for the application of this membrane separation technology to water treatment is the reduction of operational cost, that is, an increase in the filtration flux of the membrane module. We studied how to increase the filtration flux from the three viewpoints: promotion of turbulent flow in raw water, coagulation effect and membrane backwashing. As a result, we found that intermittent membrane backwashing combined with turbulent flow promotion is an effective means to maintain high filtration flux of the membrane module. 1. Introduction In the course of membrane filtration, cake layers or gel layers are gradually formed on the membrane surface, decreasing the filtration rate. The major task of our new membrane module is to reduce the formation of cake layers on the membrane surface and improve the filtration flux without increasing energy consumption. Unless this task is achieved, it is difficult to apply the membrane module despite the good quality of filtered water. There are two physical solutions available; one is a hydraulic solution to increase the mass transfer rate by increasing crossflow velocity, and the other is to remove cake layers by membrane backwashing. These two solutions have been already put into industrial applications by improving configuration and operation of membrane modules. In the field of water treatment, a combination of individual pretreatment processes (coagulation, sedimentation and filtration system) has been employed to remove suspended solids from raw water. If membrane separation technology can replace all these processes, it will stabilize the quality of treated water and minimize the installation area of pretreatment systems. Using our newly developed membrane module to which raw water can be fed directly, we studied the methods to obtain a high filtration flux. The results of our study on the operating conditions of the membrane including crossflow velocity, backwashing and raw water treatment for obtaining a high filtration flux, as well as the results of experiments on the module using the raw water containing a large quantity of suspended solids are summarized below. 2. Experiments 2.1 New Spiral Membrane Module Spiral membrane module is widely used in the water treatment system. By designing a unique feed spacer of corrugated type[.sup]1[/] (Figure 1), we developed a new spiral module[.sup]2,3[/] (Figure 2 [not reproduced]) to which raw water containing suspended solids can be fed directly. Ultrafiltration membrane is applied to remove colloidal matters as well as suspended solids. Table 1 shows the operating conditions when raw water is fed to the module. Figure 1.

For the conventional modules, cake layers formed on the membrane surface can be dissociated by backwashing, but the cakes are captured in the net spacers and not discharged from the module. As a result, backwashing does not work in the conventional membrane modules. Our newly developed membrane module is equipped with corrugated spacers, which can swiftly remove dissociated cakes from the module and achieve favorable backwashing effect. To verify the effect of corrugated spacer, we inserted the spacer into a flat channel test cell (Figure 3) to simulate a practical membrane module and conducted various experiments on the cell. The test cell is made of transparent acrylic flat channels (3mmH x 40mmW x 840mmL). Figure 4 is a schematic drawing of the experimental system. Figure 3.

Results 3.1 Filtration Flux in Raw Water Containing Suspended Solids To study the turbulent flow promotion effect of the corrugated spacer, we provided one section inserted with the spacer and another without spacer in the test cell, and compared the filtration flux of these sections in tap water. In addition, to reproduce the raw water containing suspended solids, we injected soft particles, KC Flock (W-100, dp = 77 ï¿½m by Sanyo-Kokusaku Pulp Co., Ltd.) into tap water to make the concentration of suspended solids to 2,100 mg/liter. Figure 5 shows the time course change in the filtration flux. With or without the spacer, the membrane surface was colored to light yellow and the filtration flux decreased gradually with time. We injected KC Flock into the feed water after continuous operation for 240 hours when the filtration flux decreased to 1.5 m[.sup]3[/]/m[.sup]2[/]/day. Immediately after the injection of the particles, filtration flux of the section inserted with the spacer increased sharply and became stable at 2.2 m[.sup]3[/]/m[.sup]2[/]/day. On the contrary, filtration flux of the section without the spacer tended to further decrease after the addition of particles. Figure 5. Filtration Flux in Raw Water Containing Suspended Solid The light yellow color changed immediately after the injection of the particles in the section with the spacer, and the white stripes reflecting the patterns of the spacer appeared on the membrane surface. Those white stripes are the original clean surface of the membrane. We assumed that the particles injected into the feed water collided against the membrane surface and dissociated the cake layers on the surface. The corrugated spacer which promotes turbulent flow effect is effective to increase the filtration flux in the raw water containing suspended solids. However, the turbulent flow promotion effect of the spacer is not sufficient to increase the filtration flux when tap water almost free of suspended solids is fed. This is because tap water tends to precipitate metallic hydroxides and allows formation of rigid cake layers on the membrane surface. 3.2 Formation of Cake Layer in Tap Water Figure 6 shows the time course change in the filtration flux of the flat channel test cell inserted with spacer when tap water was continuously fed. The filtration flux decreased with time but became stable when it reached 1 m[.sup]3[/]/m[.sup]2[/]/day. Figure 6. Relationship Between Filtration Flux With Time in Tap Water It was observed that a large quantity of light yellow gelatinous cakes adhered to the membrane surface. when the filtration flux was stable, the UF membrane was taken from the test cell for analysis. As shown in Table 2, the light yellow gelatinous cakes were composed of inorganic substances whose major components are iron and aluminum hydroxides and acid resistant insolubles like silica, and organic substances at the ratios of 77.5 percent and 22.5 percent respectively. Water content of the cakes was 96 percent. Assuming the density of the cakes as 1.0 g/cm[.sup]3[/], the cake layer was 0.56mm thick. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 2.

More than 1 kg/cm[.sup]2[/], the filtration flux is hardly dependent on the pressure and less affected by the crossflow velocity. In tap water test, the gelatinous cake layers on the membrane surface become so rigid and irreversible that hydraulic operation can hardly dissociate them from the membrane surface. Figure 7. Relationship Between Filtration Flux and Operating Pressure in Tap Water Test Figure 8. Relationship Between Filtration Flux and Crossflow Velocity in Tap Water Test 3.3 Intermittent Operation and Filtration Flux When the feed pump was stopped during the continuous feeding and then started again, dissociation of a part of the gelatinous cake layers from the membrane surface, and an increase in the filtration flux were observed. Figure 9 shows the results of filtration flux with time when tap water was fed intermittently during pump-off period. Increment of recovered filtration flux gradually diminished with time, but in comparison with the filtration flux obtained under continuous water feeding as shown in Figure 6, slightly higher filtration flux was observed with the intermittent water feeding. Figure 9. Dependence of Filtration Flux on Time With Intermittent Operation Although recovery of the filtration flux was limited in the intermittent operation alone, the result suggested improved filtration rate by dissociation of cake layers. 3.4 Feeding Industrial Water to the Membrane Module Examination of the experimental results discussed above indicated hydraulic operation and membrane backwashing as the important factors for obtaining a high filtration flux. To verify the performance of the membrane module in the actual raw water containing suspended solids, we fed the industrial water heavily contaminated with organic substances to the newly developed spiral module. Figure 10 is the flow sheet of this experiment. As we assumed it was unlikely to obtain a high filtration flux by directly feeding the industrial water, we injected poly-aluminum chloride (PAC) into the raw water to coagulate suspended solids. Figure 11 shows the time course change in the filtration flux and the pressure loss (_D_P: inlet pressure - outlet pressure). Figure 10. Process Flow Diagram for Industrial Water Test Figure 11. Relationship Between Filtration Flux, Pressure Without pH adjustment, the filtration flux decreased with time and was never stable. On the other hand, when pH was adjusted in a range from 6.0 to 6.5, the optimum coagulating condition for PAC, the flux was stable at 2 m[.sup]3[/]/m[.sup]2[/]/day. Regardless of pH adjustment, the pressure loss did not increase, which indicated the limited growth of gelatinous cake layers on the membrane surface. With the raw water like tap water containing less suspended solids, membrane backwashing alone without pretreatment of raw water was sufficient to obtain a high filtration flux. However, in the case of industrial water, coagulation of suspended solids was also required. We assume that PAC injection coagulated the colloidal matters contained in the industrial water and transformed them into suspended solids which were easily filtrated since they did not adhere to the membrane surface. 4. Conclusion Using raw water such as tap water which hardly contained suspended solids but tended to precipitate metallic hydroxides and form rigid cake layers on the membrane surface, we studied the operating conditions for producing a high filtration flux. We also evaluated the performance of our newly developed module using the industrial water heavily contaminated with organic substances. We obtained the following findings: (1) In the case of tap water, the cakes formed on the membrane surface were compounds of inorganic substances mainly composed of iron and aluminum hydroxides and organic substances. (2) Membrane backwashing at low pressure hindered compaction of the cakes, and combined with the hydraulic operation effect caused by turbulent flow, a high filtration flux was maintained. (3) Swelling of cakes before compaction was to dissociate them from the membrane surface, and backwashing the membrane at high pressure was not necessary. (4) Even with the flat channels of the test cell and the spiral membrane module in which corrugated spacers were inserted, backwashing became possible by increasing the number of membrane supports and distributing water load over the surface. (5) In the case of raw water such as industrial water containing a large quantity of suspended solids, coagulation of the colloidal matters to transform them into suspended solids was required to obtain a high filtration flux.
