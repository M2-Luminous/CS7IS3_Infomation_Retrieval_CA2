The formation of a Christian bloc in Slovak politics would constitute such a deed. Unfortunately Jan Carnogursky [chairman of the Christian Democratic Movement, KDH] proved unable to rise above the feeling of having been personally hurt and to give priority to a higher moral principle." This is stated in a statement issued by the Christian Social Union [KSU] in response to the KDH chairman's remark that the KSU should not run in the parliamentary elections. KSU Chairman Jan Klepac informed reporters about this statement yesterday. The KSU is of the opinion that Slovakia, where 70 percent of the population declares itself Christian, needs a strong Christian political party. It would be a response to the formation of the left-wing bloc and the ethnic Hungarian bloc, in which Hungarian communists, Christians, and liberals managed to join forces. The KSU chairman submitted this proposal to Jan Carnogursky three weeks ago, even though he was taking the risk of arousing the disagreement of some KSU members who have still not forgotten that KDH deputies voted against the Declaration of Sovereignty and the Slovak Constitution. [Bratislava SME in Slovak on 17 May on page 3 carries a 250-word "dos"-signed report on the KSU briefing. The report includes the following passage: "Jan Klepac assessed negatively the fact that the KDH is offering places on its slate of candidates to `cosmopolitans and exponents of Czechoslovakism.' In his opinion, by opening up to atheism, the KDH is losing its Christian character. The KSU chairman also reacted to reports according to which the Slovak National Party Central Council considers a coalition with the KSU possible only without its chairman and deputy chairman. `Should this be the case, it would be intolerable interference in the internal affairs of another political entity,' the KSU chairman said."]
