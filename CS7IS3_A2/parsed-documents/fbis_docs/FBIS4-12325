Fifty-two others were injured in the attack. The Palestinian youth was martyred in the operation, which marked the passing of 40 days since the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. The youth who carried out the operation had been detained in occupation jails last year and had been tortured by the secret security organs for 75 days. In a statement to London radio, Israeli Government Spokesman (Uri Drumi) urged the PLO to condemn the car bomb operation in 'Afula. The United States also asked PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat to condemn the car-bombing in 'Afula, northern occupied Palestine. U.S. State Department Spokesman Mike McCurry said: We certainly hope that 'Arafat would condemn this act of violence. The language would be of his choosing. McCurry described the operation as extremely serious. In a press release issued by the U.S. State Department on the operation last night, McCurry said that the United States condemns this act in the strongest terms. He stressed that the United States is committed to the security of Israel and to supporting it in its fight against so-called terrorism. At the same time, he stressed that the United States will continue efforts to advance the Middle East peace process.
