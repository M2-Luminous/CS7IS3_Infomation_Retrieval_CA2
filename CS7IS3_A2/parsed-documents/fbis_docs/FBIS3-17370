The party claims the initialled documents correspond with Russia's interests to keep possibly large military potential in Latvia and sustain people supporting Russia's attempts to make Latvia economically dependent from Russia. The party is against granting equal rights both to Latvian pensioners and Russian military pensioners and their families, and remaining of disbanded army units' officers and their families in Latvia. The party also is against Skrunda radar station's further functioning in Latvia for five and a half more years, without even coming to terms as to the rent payments. The party head, Aivars Kreituss, said Wednesday [23 March] at a press conference that the rent for Skrunda radar station's usage could equal 40 million U.S. dollars a year. Kreituss considers Latvia has to determine precisely the radar station's created damages to the environment and demand a compensation for them from Russia. Kreituss condemned Latvian president Ulmanis decision to meet with Russian President Yeltsin only in the middle of April. He stressed that the above mentioned problems had to be discussed immediately to manage the revising of the agreements by May and complete the Russian Army withdrawal by the fixed term. The party members consider the publishing of the not yet fully coordinated agreements unnecessary, and they condemn the Saeima [parliament] faction Homeland and Freedom proposal to organize a referendum on this issue, because it is not even clear who would organize and finance the referendum. The Democratic Parrty is represented at the Saeima by five deputies.
