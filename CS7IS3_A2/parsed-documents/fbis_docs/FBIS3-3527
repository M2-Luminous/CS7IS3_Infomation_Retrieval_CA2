During the past eight years, almost all the previously barren hills in the province have been covered with green, two years ahead of the provincial government's "ten-year greening schedule" initiated in 1985. In the new effort the province plans to plant some 3.33 million ha [hectare] of ecological woods, which will serve purposes such as water and soil conservation, coastal windbreaking, nature reserves and forest tourism. The necessary funds will be mainly set aside in the budget plan of governments at various levels, but the project will also receive money from the state and the general public. Meanwhile, the provincial government has called on local authorities to plant more fast-growing trees, exert more efforts in processing forestry products and tap forestry tourism resources.
