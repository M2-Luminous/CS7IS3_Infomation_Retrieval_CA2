However, Hata defended the formation of the 130-legislator parliamentary group which excludes the SDP, the largest party in the coalition, drawing the latter's ire, saying, "The formation does not constitute any betrayal" of the socialists. In a press interview at the prime minister's official residence, Hata said such a parliamentary convergence is necessary to enable Japan to deal with the difficult times ahead, explaining, "unless we have such a group, coalition parties will not be able to cope with the difficult problems and act in solidarity."
