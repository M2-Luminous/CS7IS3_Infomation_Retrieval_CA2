As a justification for the re-establishment of that coercing body, the decree says: The Committee was set up in order to stabilize the crime situation; the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Security will be subordinated to it. Former Security Minister Shevtsov [name as heard] was appointed head of the new body. The interior minister of the self-proclaimed Dniester Moldovan Republic, as well as his deputy, were relieved of their offices and are now standing at the disposal of the republic's president. The decree became effective immediately after it was signed, that is, last night, and it orders the new body to elaborate, by 1 May, a plan to fight organized crime. A commentary broadcast by Radio Moldova assesses that such reshuffles made by Igor Smirnov are merely further attempts to save the discredited authority of the Dniester leaders and as a method to eliminate the persons they find disagreeable and to mislead public opinion making it believe that decisive measures are being taken to fight crime. In reality the latest reorganization is the implementation of the directions given to them by the Russian opposition forces, which use the Dniester Region for trying their hand at the reestablishment of the Stalinist and Brezhnevist regimes, an attempt made to liquidate the opposition, and a concerted effort to deal a blow at their opponent, General [Aleksandr] Lebed [commander of the 14th Russian Army stationed in the Dniester Region], concludes the commentary broadcast by Radio Moldova.
