FBIS TRENDS-08APR94-NORTH KOREA North Korea: Signs of Shortages Emerge North Korea: Signs of Shortages Emerge Fresh signs of consumer goods shortages have recently emerged in North Korean media. Seeking to ease what seems like a desperate fuel situation, a 20 January article in the government paper Minju Choson urged the use of a heretofore untapped fuel resource: soot. Soot, the article said, should be combined with unburned coal gleaned from ashes produced at industrial plants to make briquettes. Putting the best face on a bad situation, the article claimed that briquettes made of soot and ash are odorless and can be used indoors for heating and cooking "like kerosene," because the sulfur compounds in them have already been burned off. Since both soot and ash are abundant byproducts at the numerous boilers at thermal power plants and other industrial enterprises, the article went on, they should be "inexhaustible." The article conceded that the challenge now confronting the proponents of the scheme is learning how to separate "unburned coal" from ash for use in making briquettes and called on guidance functionaries'' to dedicate themselves to this task. Pyongyang has also applied a similar recycling approach to the food sector. A 28 January Minju Choson article touted North Korean scientific prowess that has created "artificial meat" out of soy bean dregs resulting from oil extraction. This "tasty and nutritious" substance, the article claimed, is also easy to digest, keeps well, and is "very inexpensive." (AUTHOR: CHANG.
