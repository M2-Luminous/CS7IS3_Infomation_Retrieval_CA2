The British Ministry of Defense said in London that it hoped the goodwill visit by HMS Norfolk, the first of the navy's most up-to-date type 23 frigates, would boost Britain's chances of selling military equipment, particularly naval vessels, to South Africa. The Norfolk and its support vessel, Grey Wilbur, will visit Cape Town and Simonstown from 27 to 31 January.
