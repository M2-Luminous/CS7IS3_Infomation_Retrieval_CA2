It has produced a large body of data for experts to process and analyze. The survey was sponsored by the International Research Center of Environmental Epidemiology, an institution jointly founded by Anhui Medical Sciences University and the U.S. Harvard University. The four-month initial survey began last August 1 among almost 60,000 residents near Anqing City. Each survey form contained more than 2,300 items of information. It focused on two subjects: natural history of respiratory system diseases and the relations between pesticide pollution and disease. Regular follow-up surveys will be carried out among the same group of people in the next 15 years and will occupy generations of experts to research and find solutions to problems.
