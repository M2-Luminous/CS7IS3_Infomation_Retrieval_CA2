Second Reading Has Been Postponed for Two Weeks"] [Text] Yesterday the lower parliament chamber failed to discuss the 1994 budget in its second reading. The State Duma's Committee on Budget, Taxes and Prices did not complete work on amendments to the draft law On the Federal Budget for 1994, having by yesterday morning discussed only amendments to budget revenues. Apparently the news conference by Mikhail Zadornov, whose committee continued to work on the amendments, was conducted by his deputy Gennadiy Kulik for this reason. He told journalists that the committee will recommend to the State Duma to redistribute the funds allocated to internal debt servicing, maintenance of the administration apparatus, and foreign economic activity in favor of increased appropriations to the social sphere, fundamental research, and defense. According to Mr. Kulik, the committee understands the "difficult situation in which the army has found itself" and is therefore going to advise the lower chamber to issue a special military loan to support the sector. Economic Policy Committee chairman Sergey Glazyev moved an amendment on increasing federal budget revenues by 26 trillion rubles on account of pending receipts from voucher privatization. Mr. Kulik however noted that the privatization revenues planned by Sergey Glazyev should be "assessed cautiously." The budget committee proposed directing "excess" revenues -- if there are any, they will hardly exceed 3 trillion -- to a special army support fund but not including these funds immediately among revenues and therefore not counting on them in spending. The question of increasing army expenditures will apparently be decided at a closed session of the lower chamber. However, whether Sergey Glazyev's ideas about a constantly growing revenue capability will prevail does not really matter. In discussing the budgetary process, the deputies and the press concentrate their attention mainly on numerical indicators of revenues and expenditures, as well as the maximum size of deficit. By proposing novel ideas like "introducing a market mechanism of leasing/sale of equipment" to agrarians, the deputies are trying to find a compromise between various sectoral groups -- in this event the agro-industrial complex and machine building. Yet, as long as the present order of spending budget resources continues, whereby appropriations are made as revenues come into the treasury while the growth of credit emission is limited by an agreement between the Central Bank and the Finance Ministry, the government retains enough possibilities to hold a more or less consistent financial policy. Therefore most important will be the Duma's attitude to Mr. Glazyev's proposal to "obligate the government and the Central Bank to ensure guaranteed -- equally distributed by the months -- financing of federal budget expenditures" which, in his opinion, will "abolish the vicious practice of arbitrary sequestration of state expenditures." In other words, first money is printed and then backing is provided for it -- or not provided, but the money has already been handed out. This will clearly make the growth of expenditures snowball. The budget committee is not inclined to support this amendment. On 8 June, during the second reading of the budget, this will be a priority item on the Duma's agenda.
