The first 120-strong engineering unit arrived in the Srebenica "safe area" yesterday evening, the Defense Ministry said. At present there are two other groups of Netherlands soldiers in Bosnia, in addition to the engineering unit. Eighty percent of the 400-strong logistical unit is in Lukavac, some 10 km west of Tuzla in central Bosnia. And the first company of the airborne brigade, numbering some 200 soldiers, is driving through central Bosnia toward Lukavac. Despite the increased tension in Bosnia and increased concern on the home front, another group of 280 UN troops will leave Schiphol airport today for the Croatian harbor town of Split. With the arrival of this group, some 1,100 of the total 1,230 troops in Dutchbat will be in Bosnia this week. The maintenance of the plan to deploy the Netherlanders in the Muslim enclaves of Srebenica and Zepa and the logistical center in Lukavac is illustrative of the determination of the Netherlands Government and Parliament to maintain its commitment to the international crisis management operation in the former Yugoslavia. [passage omitted] Defense Minister Ter Beek and Foreign Minister Kooijmans said on Monday [28 February] that the shooting down of the four Serbian bombers by NATO fighter aircraft under the Deny Flight operation was "logical and inevitable." The parliamentary parties also followed the same line. A Defense Ministry spokesman said that Netherlands F-16's could have shot down the planes violating the international no-fly zone over Bosnia. He said it was chance that two U.S. planes were in the vicinity after a U.S. AWACS had detected the violation of the ban by six Serbian planes. The Netherlands has 14 F-16's at the Italian Villafranca base. They take it in turns to operate in pairs in the Deny Flight operation. Ter Beek said that the intervention underlined the fact that statements by the international community should be taken seriously. "That means that in extreme cases, the use of violence is not excluded," he said. Ter Beek cancelled taking part in a PvdA [Labor Party] election meeting in The Hague so that the crisis team at his ministry could keep him constantly informed about the latest developments in Bosnia. Prime Minister Lubbers is in South Africa with Deputy Prime Minister Kok and Kooijmans. Lubbers, who said that first of all he was shocked by the news that the Serbs had flown fighter aircraft over Bosnia for the first time, said in Pretoria he agreed with the NATO intervention. He said the line had to be drawn somewhere against the Bosnian Serbs. Lubbers said he was concerned about the Netherlands UN troops in Bosnia. "But I would have been more apprehensive if NATO had done nothing," he said. "Then they would have been in even greater danger." Kooijmans's thoughts were also with the Netherlands troops who at the moment were still en route to Srebenica. "We hope with all our hearts that nothing happens," he said. As far as he was aware, it was fairly quiet in their area. "There has been shelling in Tuzla," he said. "But it started so soon after the planes were shot down that it is not clear whether there is a direct connection between the shooting down of the planes and the shelling." Therefore, for the time being he saw no reason for extra safety measures.
