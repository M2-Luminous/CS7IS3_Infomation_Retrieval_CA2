The foreign news pages are dominated by commentaries on the results in the elections for the European Parliament. ADEVARUL writes in its editorial: "Among the premieres of the democratic political life in this country the recent initiative of the PNTCD to start the constitutional procedure for the suspension of the president of the republic, counts, from afar, as a spectacular one.(...) It comes against the background of a general agitation fostered by contradictory political statements, by confrontations bordering radicalism, and by trade union actions threatening to overflow into the streets. In such an explosive setting, the PNTCD's move, which formally abides by the law, but comes from politicians only too experienced not to know that they stand no chance of winning the game, seems to be rather meant to add to the general tension with the hope that the disruption it may cause to the present political layout could give it the shape desired by them." CRONICA ROMANA carries an article titled "A Romanian Watergate?," which says: "The PNTCD's proposal to start the suspension procedure will presumably bring the Romanian political climate to the boil, and, at the same time, it will clarify a number of political alliances.(...) Whatever its practical consequences, this end of parliamentary season will obviously be extremely tense and with a hard to predict denouement." VOCEA ROMANIEI, the government's paper, runs the commentary titled "The Rightists' Anti-Presidential Syndrome," saying, among other things: "A sudden revival of the right-wing attacks against the president of Romania, Mr. Ion Iliescu, is, as it appears, the tenor of the Romanian political life these days." The paper says that the "morbid lust for destabilization at any cost" will collide into the high wall of "a consolidated democracy, based on a real reform in full progress, and which, alas for them, is something completely different from the vain revenging dreams of our post-communist right." About the scheduled trade union actions in Bucharest, daily ORA announces: "Today, four years from the events of June 1990, the revolutionaries and the miners are on the same side of the barricade." TINERETUL LIBER carries the headline "The Capital on Alert," and reminds: "Today, 14 June, four years will have passed since the bloodiest of the miners' raids, which put an end to the marathon rally in the University Square. The capital of Romania will again be the scene of wide trade union moves, to be joined by the students, too, the great trade union confederations, and... surprise, about 3,000 miners. And this is not the only trade union action. Almost 110,000 teachers all over the country continue their strike blocking the school year, and road builders have announced theirs for tomorrow. It was perhaps for this reason that Premier Vacaroiu has twice condemned the trade unions, once on the radio and then on television, accusing them, by what has become a set-phrase by now, of "destabilizing the country." CRONICA ROMANA writes: "Even if the prime minister accuses the trade unions of trying to destabilize (Romania) through their new actions, they said such threats no longer scare anyone and therefore they are not going to give up." DIMINEATA carries an article named "Putting on a Solidarity for the Occasion, the Trade Unions Will Try Today To Force the Hand of the Rulers," says: "The object of trade-unionism is not only to claim (with or without aim,) but also to sustain the economic construction so as to be able then to staunchly defend the social order. The trade unions demand partnership, but it is hard to believe that this is to be obtained by hollering in the street. The aim would be much more readily reached if, with dignity, they would pursue laying all the cards on the table. And here, the employers' union and maybe the government are to be blamed for part of the failure. As a rule, the middle way is always the wisest, and, consequently, the best." ROMANIA LIBERA devotes a special commentary to the events four years ago, and finds that "four years have already passed since the miners' guided invasion of Bucharest. Then, used as instruments for developments of the gravity of which they were not aware, they fully contributed to shattering the fragile beginnings of Romanian democracy, and to shocking the world by nightmarish images relayed by television networks. Nobody has so far assumed the responsibility for what happened then, events that had such bleak consequences, both at home and abroad, and immediate and long-term effects." EVENIMENTUL ZILEI has its own view of those days: "As time passes, the thesis that the miners' action was unmotivated and erratic has become the axiom of the entire Romanian society. The only one who continues to justify the savageries of 14 June is Ion Iliescu." ORA devotes its editorial to the Sunday [12 June] television interview of Premier Vacaroiu: "The appearance of the prime minister on the television screens had the precise aim of telling people: Look, we have steered Romania out of the crisis, we have brought it to the point where the recovery is about to start, and just now strikes, rallies, and destabilization are being planned. People have understood how the matter stands, they agree with him in principle, but they wonder why he has to boast. The invitation to political earnestness against attempts to destabilize should not be speculated for the benefit of personal, party, or ruling interests." [passage omitted]
