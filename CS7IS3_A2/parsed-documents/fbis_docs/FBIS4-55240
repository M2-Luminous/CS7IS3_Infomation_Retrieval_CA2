These two ethnic groups have agreed on the form and the structure of a future Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The negotiators were Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic, Bosnian-Croat top politician Kresimir Zubak, and Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic. Minister President Silajdzic reported on the agreement 20 minutes ago: [Begin Silajdzic recording, in English with superimposed German translation] We have reached an agreement on the external borders of the federation and on the internal borders of the individual cantons. We believe that a great step in the direction of a comprehensive peace solution in the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina has been taken -- a great step to preserve unity, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. We believe that not only Bosniaks and Croats, but all who regard Bosnia-Herzegovina as their home will work toward the implementation of this agreement. [end recording] On 14 May, the agreement between the Bosnian Muslims and Croats is to be signed in Geneva. It provides for a federation that comprises 58 percent of the area of Bosnia-Herzegovina. By the way, 70 percent of the territory is currently being held by the Serbs, with whom no negotiations were held here -- thus, one reckoned, so to speak, without one's host, although he had conquered the territory. In the new Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina there are to be eight cantons, two under Croatian leadership, four under Muslim leadership, according to the respective majorities, and two with equal structures, that is, central Bosnia and the canton along the Neretva where the capital of Herzegovina, Mostar, is situated. The first president is to be a Croat and the first prime minister a Muslim. In return, the Croats will get six of 17 ministries. As already mentioned, the Croats and Muslims have achieved this agreement, but they need to get back about 20 percent of the territory that is currently held by the Serbs. And, so far, the latter have not shown any inclination to give back conquered territory.
