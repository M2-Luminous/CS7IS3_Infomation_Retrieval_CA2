FR941125-0-00031 FR941125-0-00015 3. Section 219.501, as published at 59 FR 7462, February 15, 1994, is amended by adding a new paragraph (a), deleting paragraph (e), redesignating existing paragraphs (a) through (d) as paragraphs (b) through (e), and revising newly designated paragraphs (b) through (e) as follows: ยง219.501 Pre-employment tests. (a)(1) Each Class I railroad (including the National Railroad Passenger Corporation) and each railroad providing commuter passenger service shall implement pre-employment alcohol testing beginning on January 1, 1995. (2) Each Class II railroad shall implement pre-employment alcohol testing beginning on July 1, 1995. (3) Each Class III railroad (including a switching and terminal or other railroad not otherwise classified) shall implement pre-employment alcohol testing beginning on January 1, 1996. (4) In the case of a railroad commencing operations after January 1, 1996, the railroad shall implement pre-employment alcohol testing not later than the expiration of 60 days from approval by the Administrator of the railroad's random testing programs. (b) Prior to the first time a covered employee performs covered service for a railroad, the employee shall undergo testing for alcohol and drugs. No railroad shall allow a covered employee to perform covered service, unless the employee has been administered an alcohol test with a result indicating an alcohol concentration of less than .04 and has been administered a test for drugs with a result that did not indicate the misuse of controlled substances. This requirement shall apply to final applicants for employment and to employees seeking to transfer for the first time from non-covered service to duties involving covered service. If the test result of a final applicant for pre-employment indicates an alcohol content of .02 or greater, the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section shall apply. (c) No final applicant for employment tested under the provisions of this part who is found to have an alcohol concentration of .02 or greater but less than .04 shall perform safety-sensitive functions for a railroad, nor shall a railroad permit the applicant to perform safety-sensitive functions, until the applicant's alcohol concentration measures less than .02. (d) Tests shall be accomplished through breath analysis and analysis of urine samples. The conduct of breath alcohol testing and urine drug testing under this subpart is governed by Subpart H of this part and Part 40 of Subtitle A of this title. (e) As used in Subpart H with respect to a test required under this subpart, the term covered employee includes an applicant for pre-employment testing only. In the case of an applicant who declines to be tested and withdraws the application for employment, no record shall be maintained of the declination. Issued in Washington, D.C. on November 17, 1994. Jolene M. Molitoris, Administrator, Federal Railroad Administration. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;28915 Filed 11&hyph;23&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;06&hyph;P
