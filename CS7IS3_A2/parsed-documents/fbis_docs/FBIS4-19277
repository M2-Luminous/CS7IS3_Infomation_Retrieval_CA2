Papandreou's address also included a political message regarding our country's position in Europe but mainly in the Balkans. For PASOK to continue its direction, Papandreou said, it must be revived. We must realize the big changes and contradictions of the times and give answers with our philosophy and political practice, he said. A party, Papandreou continued, which works as a human-centered society cannot be a party of mechanisms, it is a figure of autonomous people. Papandreou said PASOK's orientation is, of course, European but stressed that we are not Europe's poor partner. We are Europe's arm in the Balkans, its eastern border, he said. Papandreou blamed Europe for the tragedy in the former Yugoslavia, talked about the revival of suffering and regional hostilities and said that these clashes are cultivated by the big powers to promote their special interests. With a tone of optimism for the future, Papandreou said that wars and the economic crisis cannot cancel, can only delay for a while, the impressive development at the doorstep of which we find ourselves. Following is that specific part of Papandreou's address: [Begin Papandreou recording] We follow the tragedy of war in the former Yugoslavia with fear. We resist the attempt to revive ancient Balkan disputes and serve the big powers' shortsighted goals. However, no resistance can hide the fact that the Greeks have begun to find their natural role in the Balkans. Half of the foreign investments in Bulgaria now are Greek. In Albania, Greek companies have set up 54 joint companies and we are second after Italy. In Romania, there are 700 joint Greek-Romanian companies. The Balkans's greater area calls on Greece. The Greeks, who throughout their history have stood as a factor of progress and civilization in the Balkans under historical conditions that are incomparably more difficult that today's, are preparing, in cooperation with the peoples of the Balkans, to rediscover their old position. [end recording] Papandreou said that we should again discover our historic optimism and added that PASOK's revival is firmly connected with the restoration of political life in the country. The primary role in this difficult mission belongs to the youth, Papandreou stressed. [Begin Papandreou recording] PASOK's revival is firmly connected with the revival and restoration of political life, not only of ideas, positions, platforms and choices, but mainly of institutions, norms and practices. It is an issue that regards the present and future of democracy and its principles. Through this road, Greek youth and politics will be reunited. It will be a necessary meeting for Greece itself. The country moves ahead only when the youth are in the national and political foreground, only then. [passage omitted] [end recording]
