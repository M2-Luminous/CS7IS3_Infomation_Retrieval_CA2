Taking part in the work of the session was a Russian delegation led by Vice-Premier Yuriy Yarov. The sides noted during the final plenary meeting that it was necessary to promote bilateral economic relations on the basis of a new mechanism. They agreed to hold the fourth session of the intergovernmental commission in Moscow in the first quarter of 1995. Interviewed by ITAR-TASS, Yarov highly assessed the Hanoi negotiations which focused particularly on problems linked with the forthcoming visit of Vietnamese Premier Vo Van Kiet to Russia. "We hope," the Russian vice-premier noted, "that the visit of the head of the Vietnamese Government to Moscow, scheduled for June, will be fruitful and will contribute to the development of mutually advantageous economic cooperation. We do not intend to give up our positions on the Vietnamese market, particularly as regards the supply of machinery and equipment," Yarov said. Commenting on the results of the talks, the head of the Russian delegation told a press conference here today that Russia and Vietnam were now exerting joint efforts to do away with the pause that had appeared in their bilateral relations. "We have devoted special attention to concrete areas of cooperation, for instance, in the sphere of energetics, oil extraction and agriculture," he stressed. The Russian side attaches great importance to the establishment of direct contacts between the regions of Russia and the Vietnamese partners. This is why the Russian delegation included Bashkortostan President Rakhimov and head of the Krasnoyarsk territorial administration Zubov. The Russian Government delegation today flew to the city of Da Nang in central Vietnam.
