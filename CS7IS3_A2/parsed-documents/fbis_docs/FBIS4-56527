At the end of his two-day visit to Stockholm, heading a Peruvian commercial mission, Goldenberg signed an agreement for the mutual protection of investments with Swedish Foreign Trade Minister Ulf Dinkelspiel, who hopes the Swedish presence will increase in Peru. Bilateral trade currently leans in Sweden's favor. In 1992, Sweden bought foodstuffs, fruit, vegetables, and textile products from Peru totalling $8.7 million and sold machinery, vehicles, engines, and optical equipment to Peru worth $40.5 million. Goldenberg also met with Swedish Foreign Minister Margaretha af Ugglas and with some 100 Swedish businessmen to whom the Peruvian delegation explained the economic, political, and social stability Peru currently enjoys. Goldenberg told EFE that Peru "experienced the greatest economic growth in the continent" during 1993, which amounted to 7 percent, while the population grew by just 2 percent, adding that in 1994 "we expect 5 percent growth." Legislator Carlos Montoya and engineer Arturo Woodman, who are part of the Peruvian delegation, lectured at the Stockholm University's Latin American Institute on the subject: Peru, an Emerging Economy. The Peruvian delegation met with representatives of the largest Nordic bank, the Skandinaviska Enskilda Bank (SE-Banken) to whom they explained the privatization of the Peruvian banking sector. Goldenberg told EFE that the Peruvian Government "in the next few months will continue its privatization project" which includes two large banks, two insurance companies, several mining companies, and several hotel chains. Goldenberg also mentioned the constitutional reform that will allow Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori to run for reelection for another five years, adding, "this will not be the only change." Goldenberg said the Constitution, "drafted by a Constituent Assembly, is the only one" in Peruvian history to have been "ratified by a popular referendum." This has never happened with any of the previous Peruvian constitutions. Regarding the possibility of Fujimori being reelected for another presidential term, Goldenberg stated that Peru is "a full democracy," and reelection "is a mere possibility" about which the president "has not even stated his intention." Unlike on other occasions, the subject of terrorism was not raised during his visit to Sweden. Goldenberg asserted that the problem still exists and mentioned the successful arrest of "Shining Path" leader Abimael Guzman. "without the firing of a single shot." The Peruvian minister did not dismiss the link between terrorists and drugs, although he reiterated that coca production and consumption in Peru is an "ancestral tradition" of the people who use it in a "quite different way" from that of modern society. Goldenberg requested "concrete support from the international community" to implement alternative plans, but "the consumer countries have not seriously tackled" the problem. The visit was free of any incidents, although diplomatic circles feared action by some of the 2,500 Peruvians residing in Sweden, which prompted the tightening of safety measures around the Peruvian visitors. The delegation included Lima Stock Exchange Director Jose Luque Otero and representatives of the National Industries Association and of the Chamber of Commerce. They will also visit Italy, Switzerland, and Austria to inform European investors about the Peruvian economy. The visit of the Peruvian commercial mission ended with a meeting with the Swedish Riksdag's (parliament) Foreign Commission. They left for Milan, the second phase of the tour, this afternoon.
