Speaking with journalists during the World Slavonic Congress, held on his initiative, Zhirinovskiy said that "the Czech leadership has the right to make a decision," but "it would be better if Slavonic nations became members of the new Eastern European community." Unification on the basis of the Slavonic idea will produce "a better, firmer and juster union" than NATO's expansion would do, Zhirinovskiy said. At the congress he said the new community would spread "from the Adriatic Sea to the Kurile Islands." Zhirinovskiy told journalists that he would visit the Czech Republic and Slovakia "in the nearest future," but did not specify. He has been invited to the Czech Republic by the parliamentary extreme right Assembly for the Republic-Czechoslovak Republican Party (SPR-RSC) of Miroslav Sladek. The invitation was extended for mid-March, but Zhirinovskiy said he would come for a two-day visit on March 20. Following strong disagreement with the visit among Czech political parties and Interior Minister Jan Ruml's statement that he would do everything to prevent the visit, Zhirinovskiy cancelled it saying it would be too expensive. Sladek, who was invited to the congress, did not take part. Instead he sent a telegram of greetings, the LDP international department told journalists. The about 20 foreign guests sitting in the presidium of the World Slavonic Congress included Juraj Molnar, deputy chairman of the nationalist Slovak National Party (SNS). The SNS along with Vladimir Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (SNS) made up the former Slovak Government, dismissed on March 11. Molnar told the congress that "after 1000 years of Hungarian yoke and after living with the Czech nation," independent Slovakia had realised that it "will not exist unless the Slavs are united." Molnar told CTK that he had arrived to the congress mainly to get acquainted with the LDP leadership. "It is in our interest to know what role Slovakia will play in central Europe in case of the Liberal Democratic Party's victory in Russia," he said. The guests from Slovakia also included two members of "the provisional government of Subcarpathian Rus" which is seeking independence from Ukraine. Subcarpathian Rus, historically part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, came under Czechoslovak administration in 1919. A treaty of 1945 ceded this easternmost region of Czechoslovakia to the Soviet Union.
