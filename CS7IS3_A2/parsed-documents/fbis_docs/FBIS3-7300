The plan will include tax incentives, low-interest loans and support in establishing welfare facilities for foreign companies operating in Japan. In order to encourage foreign companies to export more to Japan or to make more investment in the country, the plan will also call for enhancing information provided by Japanese organizations. For example, it will call on the Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO), which long pushed Japanese exports but has recently begun promoting imports, to send its experts on trade and investment to 12 cities overseas such as San Francisco and Milan. The action plan will be unveiled as part of a new market-opening package the government is expected to announce Tuesday, the sources said. They said the government will review the action plan every year to show its trade partners its continued efforts on the matter. The plan for fiscal 1994, starting from April 1, will be in line with the government's budget plan, they said. Another feature of the action plan will allow foreign companies to carry over losses incurred within the initial three years of operation in Japan for a period of 10 years, rather than the current limit of carrying losses for seven years, they said. The government will also ease within the year conditions for providing a government-guarantee of debt for foreign companies, so as to make it easier for them to raise capital, the sources said.
