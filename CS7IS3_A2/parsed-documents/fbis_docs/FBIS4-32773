Moments before his departure for Cairo, Egypt, Robaina said the island's government is holding talks with the Belgian Government to find a solution to Saturday's incident but said Cuba's position will be the same one it has always maintained. In this regard, Robaina said they must leave the residence, because forcing one's way into diplomatic missions "is not the way to leave the country, and, therefore, it is up to the Belgian authorities, who are aware of the positions we have maintained in this regard, to take the proper steps." [Havana PRENSA LATINA in Spanish at 0101 GMT on 29 May transmits an 80-word report, datelined Havana, citing Belgian Ambassador Paul Vermeirsch, who today told PRENSA LATINA that "he has no comment whatsoever on the forcible entry into his residence by a group of people whose objectives had not been announced."
