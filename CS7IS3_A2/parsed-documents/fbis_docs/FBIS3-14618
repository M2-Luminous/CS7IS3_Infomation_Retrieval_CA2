At a symposium yesterday, organized by the Iraqi Economists Association and attended by Planning Minister Samal Majid Faraj, Dr. Hammadi said that this intentional excessive production by some Arab regimes such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates [UAE] has caused a glut in world oil markets, causing a deterioration of the Arab oil price, which has dropped to $7 per barrel after it had been $34 per barrel. Dr. Hammadi added: The Arab economy in general is essentially based on one commodity -- oil -- as a main source of revenue for economic development. This deterioration in the price of oil has caused large balance of payment deficits in several Arab states, affected development plans, and compelled the Arabs to seek foreign aid under terms that have affected their economic and political independence. Dr. Hammadi wondered about the reason behind this situation, which has burdened the Arab states with financial losses amounting to $1 trillion between 1987 and 1992. He said the reason was that these regimes have thrown themselves into the lap of U.S. policy.
