Yesterday's awe-inspiring historic celebration in Amman and Jerusalem on the occasion of completing the third Hashemite-sponsored renovation of al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock was an occasion for the Arabs and Muslims to contemplate the difficult situation our nation is facing. This situation calls on everybody to reconsider the current deterioration in relations and seek to restore solidarity and reconciliation with the conscience, the mind, and the soul. His Majesty King Husayn's call during the pan-Arab speech he delivered on this blessed historic occasion was amazing. He called on the nation to rise up to save Jerusalem and stand against every siege, oppression, and alienation. Within earshot of all Arabs and Muslims, leader King Husayn uttered three no's which sum up the reality of the nation's will and reflect the feelings, sentiments, and aspirations of the masses in every Arab and Islamic nation. No to any solution that does not restore Arab sovereignty over Arab Jerusalem. No to any solution that does not secure the historic and legitimate rights of the people of Palestine on their chaste national soil. And no to any peace that is not acceptable to the future generations--a peace that they will not protect and defend. It is no secret to the observer that the three no's His Majesty King Husayn uttered are constants of the Jordanian policy our country has been following in all its political activities since the Israeli occupation of our territories. His Majesty King Husayn's donation to cover the expenses of the third Hashemite-sponsored renovation of al-Aqsa Mosque and the holy Dome of the Rock and his donation to rebuild the pulpit of Salah-al-Din al-Ayyubi stand witness to the great prestige the Holy City occupies in the heart and mind of his majesty the king and the Hashemite family. As King Husayn said yesterday, the Hashemite's association with Jerusalem "stands above the fray of political ploys and Earthly greed." Therefore, the leader made a new Hashemite pledge when he said: "We will keep our pledge and we will continue to defend the nation's rights in it so that it will return as an Arab and Islamic city in accordance with the international legitimacy."
