Cetin was replying to reporters' questions at Ankara Esenboga Airport on his return from visits to Ukraine and Moldova last night. He stressed that a forced solution will never be accepted in Cyprus. He added: The UN attitude is one of forcing one of the sides -- the Turkish Cypriot side -- to accept the package the other side accepts. A forced solution will never be accepted. In that case, there would be no solution. Cetin stressed that the fact that there exist two sides on the island must be accepted. He pointed out that Denktas' contribution in turning the Vienna talks into a forward step is an important development.
