He believed Premier Li Peng's visit to Kazakhstan would give fresh impetus to further developing traditionally friendly relations between the two countries. President Nazarbayev made the above statement when receiving a written interview by a XINHUA reporter before Premier Li Peng's visit. He said: Kazakh and Chinese peoples have been living as next- door neighbors for generations, exchanging visits with each other, and supplying each other's needs. Many common elements have brought us together. Kazakhstan has established ties with the PRC on the basis of equality, respect for independence and territorial integrity, and mutual non-interference in internal affairs. The joint statement on the foundation of Kazakh-Chinese friendly relations signed in Beijing last fall between leaders of the two countries was a document of historic significance which paved the way for long-term and steady development of bilateral ties. On economic cooperation between the two countries, Nazarbayev pointed out that there are over 150 Kazakh-Chinese joint ventures and 13 Chinese shops in Kazakhstan. He hoped the number would continue to increase. He said emphatically: It is absolutely possible for Kazakh-Chinese economic and trade relations to develop faster. We can utilize Chinese investment to process raw and semifinished materials and export finished products to China. On the domestic economic situation, Nazarbayev said: Kazakhstan has abundant mineral deposits and other natural resources and tremendous economic potential. However, the disintegration of the Soviet Union has destroyed the economic links between its republics and seriously affected the economic situation and people's lives. He pointed out: Kazakhstan is carrying out a systematic industrial structural reform to change its position as a producer of raw and semifinished materials, and to lay the foundation for modern high- technology production. He said emphatically: Kazakhstan's strategy for development is to build a market economy which will enable its economy to meet up with world standards in the shortest time possible. President Nazarbayev said: Kazakhstan relies mainly on itself to push forward economic reform. However, it will not be able to reach its expected goal if it fails to extensively attract foreign investment, or if it does not possess advanced technology and techniques and modern management methods. He said: Kazakhstan is drafting a foreign investment law to set the stage for attracting foreign investment.
