FR941021-0-00027 FR941021-0-00001 (B) The post or stud of the binding post terminal shall not fail before the screw or nut when increasing torque. The faceplate or receptacle restraining the post or stud shall not fail before the screw or nut when increasing torque. (iii) Lateral loading capacity of binding posts. A minimum of three sets of 25 terminals shall be tested with the test specimens stabilized at temperatures of ^40 ○C, 20 ○C and 71 ○C (^40 ○F, +68 ○F, and 100 ○F). The test arrangement shall include the terminals along the matrix edge at mid-span locations as well as centrally located terminals. A force measuring device, such as a dynamometer, shall be attached to the end of a binding post terminal and a 16 kg (35 lb) force applied orthogonally to the terminal axis in 4 perpendicular directions as shown in Figure 13. Permanent deformation in excess of 0.08 cm (0.03 in.) or any structural damage in either the terminal or faceplate constitutes a failure. Figure 13 is as follows: BILLING CODE 3410&hyph;15&hyph;P ␣ E:GRAPHICSER21OC94.012 BILLING CODE 3410&hyph;15&hyph;C
