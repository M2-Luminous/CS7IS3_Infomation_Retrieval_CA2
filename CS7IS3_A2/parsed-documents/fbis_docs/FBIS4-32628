They exchanged information about the situation in their countries, foreign policy initiatives, and bilateral relations. They expressed a wish to develop mutual contacts in science, culture, and tourism. They also agreed that the Czech side will grant Albania a long-term loan to purchase farming and food-processing equipment. Although economic cooperation has receded over recent years, our side regards as advantageous the fact that Czech goods have been offered to Albanian agriculture and the food-processing industry. Vaclav Klaus emphasized that such cooperation is a useful form of policy aimed at boosting exports.
