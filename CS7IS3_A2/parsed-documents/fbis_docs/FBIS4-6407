FBIS4-6407 "dreas075_a_94004" FBIS-EAS-94-075 Daily Report 16 Apr 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan JCP Book Exposes Nosaka's Link With KGB JCP Book Exposes Nosaka's Link With KGB OW1604095994 Tokyo KYODO in English 0917 GMT 16 Apr 94 OW1604095994 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, April 16 KYODO -- Sanzo Nosaka, the former leader of the Japanese Communist Party (JCP), acted as a spy for the former Soviet Union's intelligence agency ever since his return from Moscow in 1946, according to a book released Saturday [16 April] by the JCP. Nosaka, who served as the party's first secretary and then Central Committee chairman between 1955 and 1982, died last November after being expelled from the party in 1992 for his involvement in a spy scandal. The book, titled "70 Years of the Japanese Communist Party," depicts major events in the party's history since its foundation in 1922. The book says, "Nosaka had been working as a spy affiliated with the Soviet intelligence agency ever since he returned to Japan in January 1946." It also accuses former Soviet leader Joseph Stalin of having tried to control the JCP by taking advantage of Nosaka, who had climbed up the party echelons to gain its leadership. "Nosaka showed his loyalty to Stalin by helping him interfere with the Japanese Communist Party due to Nosaka's tie with the Soviet intelligence agency," the book says. It accuses Nosaka of falsely reporting to the Soviet authorities his prewar colleague Kenzo Yamamoto, another JCP member, as a Western spy, resulting in the 1939 execution by shooting of Yamamoto. In 1931, Nosaka fled the repression of the prewar Japanese Government to the Soviet Union. Yamamoto also fled to the Soviet Union in 1928 and continued his political activities in Moscow until 1939, when Nosaka wrote a letter to the Soviet authorities identifying him as a spy. The truth surrounding Yamamoto's death was exposed only in August 1992, when a Japanese news magazine reported Nosaka's letter which had been kept at the Soviet Communist Party archives in Moscow. The JCP subsequently sent an investigative mission to Moscow and stripped him of his membership.
