Blondin Beye arrived today and went to work. First, he met with the observers to take stock of the situation. Afterward, he met with the government negotiating team. Blondin Beye informed the delegations of his visit to Cote d'Ivoire--namely, the meetings with several politicians, including George Moose, U.S. under secretary of state for African affairs. Blondin Beye also met with Angolan Government officials. He also met with Jorge Valentim, the only National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] negotiator present in Lusaka. The main body of UNITA negotiators has not yet arrived, but reports say they could return to Lusaka at any time. Analysts say the talks will remain deadlocked as long as the UNITA delegation is not in Lusaka. Paradoxically, Blondin Beye is set for a meeting with the UNITA negotiating team tomorrow at 1000.
