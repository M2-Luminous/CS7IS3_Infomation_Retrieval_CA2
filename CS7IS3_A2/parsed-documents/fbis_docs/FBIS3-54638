My passionate desire is that under no circumstances do we ever discard the better things we had in the past. It seems to me that we have all the preconditions to use them, to regenerate and strengthen them on a new and fundamental basis. We are able to cooperate in a worthy fashion; each nation can take care of itself. But it would be senseless in some ways if there were no cooperation. I would say this: The great community we had before must not be lost under any circumstances. A worthy, legal basis of cooperation must be created, and this is being done within the framework of the CIS. The Commonwealth must be established as conceived at Viskuli [the Viskuli agreement which was reached at Belovezhskaya Pushcha and named after the government residence in Brest oblast where talks took place] as cooperation of the cultures, the peoples, and the economies. One must say that our mutual relations must not be guided by rulers or ideological dogma. We must join together in that popular upsurge of friendship which always existed. On behalf of the Republic of Belarus, the leadership of the Republic of Belarus, and the people of the Republic of Belarus, I would like to wish you a happy New Year, would like 1993 to be the last difficult year of reform for you, and hope that in 1994 we achieve what we are striving for, that each person can be master of his own fate. We are not alone in the process of transforming totalitarian structures into democratic ones, and if China and the Baltic countries can manage a good showing in the development of industry and the economy, I would like this to be achieved by all CIS countries. We have sufficient intellectual potential and enough patience for this, and I am convinced that 1994 will bring us new successes. I wish you a happy New Year, a happy 1994 and the years after it! I wish you happiness and joy and all the best that life offers!
