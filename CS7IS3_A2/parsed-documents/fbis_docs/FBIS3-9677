He then singled out a few significant things pertaining to the congress. [Pejanovic] The first thing is that the congress has shown that citizens of Serbian nationality who live on the territory under the control of the legitimate authorities and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army are tremendously determined to fight for a shared life. They have exhibited this determination by participating -- together with the democratic and civic options from the Croatian and Muslim nations -- in the resistance and defense of the multinational and multicultural essence of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The other thing manifested at yesterday's congress is that the adopted declaration is founded on basic political aims that are incorporated in the platform and work of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency. The declaration reaffirms two principles of this platform: The principle of ethnic equality and Bosnia-Herzegovina's unity within its internationally recognized borders, and in this context, support for solutions designed to resolve the Bosnian issue based on the concept of the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. [Colo] This solution is considered optimal because it allows local self-management, regional and cultural autonomy, and joint institutions, the most important of which is the Council of Peoples where the vital interests of each nation will be realized, stressed Pejanovic, and continued: [Pejanovic] The third thing I would like to stress is that the congress of citizens of Serb nationality was held in the spirit of efforts and demands for the establishment of peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. [Colo] Mr. Pejanovic then explained to correspondents that the Congress of the Serbian People of Bosnia-Herzegovina had proposed that deputies in the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly who are from the ranks of the Serbian people draft an amendment to the proposed Constitution of the Bosniak Muslim and Croat Federation. [Pejanovic] The amendment consists of only one word. The word Serbs should be added to the list of peoples listed in the part of the Constitution that refers to constituent peoples. [Colo] The Serbian Civic Council will draw up its program for peace initiatives and talks aimed at finding an integral solution for Bosnia-Herzegovina. One such meeting -- with Mr. Charles Redman -- has been set for Wednesday [30 March]. This council, together with progressive Muslim and Croatian forces, will contribute to the establishment of peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. We shall also request firmer international pressure in finding a political solution with the so-called third, Serbian side, in which the opinion of the Serbian Civic Council will be one of the factors involved in finding this solution, said Mirko Pejanovic, president of the Serbian Civic Council, at today's news conference.
