In the first two months alone, various kinds of taxes collected by the city reached 300 million yuan, 26.8 percent up on the same period last year. This year is the first year in which China has implemented its new taxation system. It is known that in implementing the new taxation system, the Quanzhou City government has extensively publicized the new tax laws to increase understanding of them among people in various circles. At the same time, taxation departments at all levels have also energetically conducted special inspection, especially inspections of some major taxpayers whose tax payments are in arrears, and they have fixed time limits for tax payments. As a result, the new taxation system has been operating quite effectively. At the same time, taxation departments have seriously done a good job in guiding taxpayers to calculate and pay value-added tax and other taxes. They have also taken special measures toward supply and marketing enterprises, materials enterprises, and commercial enterprises to guard against fraud. Moreover, taxation departments have concentrated their efforts on the collection and management of various kinds of local taxes to prevent tax losses.
