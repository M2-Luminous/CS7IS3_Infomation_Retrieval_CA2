British Lieutenant Colonel Simon Shadbolt, military assistant to Rose, said Bosnian forces have at some sites advanced their front-line positions against besieging Serbs by 10 metres (yards). He said Rose would ask the Bosnians to return to their original positions. Shadbolt said UNPROFRO has guaranteed the Serbs that the Moslems will not advance their lines, or mount an infantry attack, while it enforces a NATO exclusion zone that required Serb troops to pull their heavy artillery away from Sarajevo. The meeting is to be at Sarajevo airport at about noon (1100 GMT), Shadbolt said. UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) spokesman Canadian Lieutenant-Colonel Bill Aikman had said earlier Tuesday that while a ceasefire was generally holding in Sarajevo there were reports of trench-digging by Bosnian troops in attempts to advance their lines. He said violations on the Serb side consisted of sniper fire and that there had been small-arms shooting on both sides.
