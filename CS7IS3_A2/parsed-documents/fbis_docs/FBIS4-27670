FBIS4-27670 "dreas107_d_94008" FBIS-EAS-94-107 Daily Report 3 Jun 1994 South Korea PRC Official Advises Negotiations With DPRK PRC Official Advises Negotiations With DPRK SK0306075694 Seoul YONHAP in English 0727 GMT 3 Jun 94 SK0306075694 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, June 3 (YONHAP) -- China virtually expressed its opposition to UN sanctions against North Korea despite the breakdown in nuclear inspection talks, advising more dialogue in a meeting with South Korean officials Friday. Tang Jiaxuan, Chinese deputy foreign minister, was quoted as telling his South Korean counterpart Pak Kon-wu that Beijing does "understand that Seoul has to seek other methods than dialogue to deal with the North Korean nuclear issue," a Foreign Ministry official said after their three-hour meeting. "But Tang advised diplomatic negotiations no matter how difficult the situation may become," the official said. The North Korean nuclear crisis has taken a turn for the worse during Tang's visit. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) declared that it has now become impossible to measure the fuel rods from the North's nuclear reactor and thus to verify whether or not the communist state diverted plutonium, the core ingredient in making nuclear bombs. Washington immediately announced it would seek UN sanctions, and South Korean officials said the direction has now turned from diplomatic negotiations to punitive measures. Tang's remarks are the first from Beijing since this latest development. China, a permanent member of the Security Council, remains the uncertain variable as the council prepares to adopt a resolution sometime next week against North Korea. "South Korea implied that there is a limit to dialogue efforts," said the Foreign Ministry official, who declined to be named. Tang agreed with Pak that the current North Korean situation is urgent and of great concern, but the Chinese official advised further dialogue, he said. "Tang emphasized the importance of peace and stability on the Korean peninsula, the importance of a nuclear-free Korea," said the official. "He said diplomatic negotiations would be a far better option since pushing North Korea may only complicate matters."
