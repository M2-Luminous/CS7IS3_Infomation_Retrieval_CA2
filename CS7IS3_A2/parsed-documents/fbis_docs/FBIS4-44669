Launch is scheduled for 1997. On 17 January the European Commission, represented by Jean-Pierre Contzen, director of Italian Ispra's Joint Research Center (CCR), and CNES [National Center for Space Studies], represented by its director general, Jean-Daniel Levi, signed a cooperation accord that involves the European Community in realization of the "Vegetation" instrument destined for France's SPOT 4 observation satellite to be launched in mid-1997. Under the accord, the European Community will cofinance construction of the Vegetation instrument, for which Aerospatiale will be prime contractor, and as such responsible to CNES. The program is being expanded to allow for the participation of France, Belgium, Sweden, and Italy, with subcontracts for the project going to manufacturers in these countries. The Community will contribute ECU16 million (about 105 million [French] francs [Fr]), or half the estimated Fr210 million cost of the instrument. The Vegetation instrument will provide full global coverage at 1-km resolution, in the same HRVIR (visible and near infrared) spectral bands as SPOT 4's two primary cameras. "This instrument will be of great scientific interest and facilitate monitoring of natural ecosystems and continental agricultural systems," says CNES. The Community will use the instrument to support its policy in the domains of agriculture, environment, research, and international cooperation. The data will be intensively exploited by CCR's Institute for Remote Sensing Applications. This accord adds both Vegetation and SPOT itself to the European Community's stock of operational "tools."
