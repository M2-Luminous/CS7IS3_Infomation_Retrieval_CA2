In Marrakech, he attended a four-day ministerial meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) member nations to sign the final agreement of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks. Hata, a front-runner to succeed the outgoing prime minister, hinted at a possible tie-up with former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), who has expressed his readiness to run for the upcoming Diet vote for the premiership. Watanabe, head of the LDP's third largest faction, also has disclosed his readiness to form a new alliance with Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito [Clean Government Party], the two key parties in the ruling coalition. Hata told reporters at Haneda Airport, "I would like to respect his determination. He is fit to be a leader." Hata said, "I have never said whether or not I strengthened my resolution," when asked by reporters about the possibility of his candidacy for the next premiership. He also opposed a speed-before-quality Diet election for the next premier, urging sufficient discussion and preparation.
