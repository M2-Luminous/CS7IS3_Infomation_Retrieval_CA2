FR941007-0-00021 FR941007-0-00004 End of Application Period Section 506(c) of Pub. L. 103&hyph;317 states that ``(t)he provisions of these amendments to the immigration and Nationality Act shall *␣*␣* cease to have effect on October 1, 1997.'' Applications for adjustment of status under section 245(i) of the Act cannot be granted on or after that date. Prospective adjustment of status applicants who are seeking the benefits of section 245(i) of the Act must file their applications sufficiently in advance of October 1, 1997, to ensure that they can be completed before that date. Application processing times vary by location, and persons who will be seeking adjustment of status under the provisions of section 245(i) of the Act during 1997 are encouraged to file as early in the year as possible. Persons who must file after June 1997 should contact the office having jurisdiction over their place of residence for further instructions. Immediate Availability of Immigrant Visa Number All applicants for adjustment of status under section 245 of the Act must have an immediately available immigrant visa number. ``Immediately available'' for the purpose of accepting and processing the Form I&hyph;485 application filed by a preference alien is defined in 8 CFR 245.1(f) as being not later than the date shown in the current Department of State Bureau of Consular Affairs Visa Bulletin. The Department of State, however, defines ``immediately available'' as being earlier than the date shown in the current Visa Bulletin. This rule amends 8 CFR 245.1(f) to bring the adjustment of status provision into accordance with the Department of State's definition. It also changes the name of the Visa Bulletin to reflect its current title. New Restriction on Immigrant Visa Issuance Abroad Public Law 103&hyph;317 also places a new restriction on the issuance of immigrant visas abroad before October 1, 1997, which has no effect on persons seeking adjustment of status in the United States. Section 506(a) of Pub. L. 103&hyph;317 adds a new section 212(o) to the Act, which forbids immigrant visa issuance to certain prospective immigrants, including children, who have been physically present in the United States. Prospective immigrants, except certain spouses and children of legalized aliens, who were not maintaining lawful nonimmigrant status at the time of departure from the United States, will not be eligible for immigrant visa issuance within 90 days of departure from the United States. This new restriction does not apply to the spouse of a legalized alien or the unmarried child under 21 years of age of a legalized alien, if the spouse or child qualifies for and has applied for voluntary departure under the family unity program established by section 301(a) of the Immigration Act of 1990. The new section 212(o) of the Act takes effect on October 1, 1994, and ceases to have effect on October 1, 1997. The Department of State, which has jurisdiction over immigrant visa issuance at United States consulates and embassies abroad, will promulgate regulations implementing this provision of Pub. L. 103&hyph;317. Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (Crime bill), Pub. L. 103&hyph;322, was enacted on September 13, 1994. Section 130003 of the Crime Bill, entitled ``Alien Witness Cooperation and Counterterrorism Information'' adds a new section 245(i) to the Act. This provision restricts the adjustment of status of certain persons admitted to the United States under a newly established ``S'' nonimmigrant classification. Congress clearly did not intend to repeal or supersede the provisions of the Department of Commerce, Justice, State, the Judiciary and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1995, Pub. L. 103&hyph;317, by adding another section 245(i) to the Act. The Service regards the establishment of the second section 245(i) of the Act as a numbering error and will recommend that Congress enact a technical amendment to redesignate the Crime Bill's provision as section 245(j) of the Act. The Service's implementation of this rule as an interim rule, with provision for post-promulgation public comment, is based on the ``good cause'' exceptions found at 5 U.S.C. 553 (b)(3)(B), (d)(3); see Animal Legal Defense Fund v. Quigg, 932 F.2d 920 (Fed. Cir. 1991). The reasons and necessity for immediate implementation of this interim rule are as follows: Early implementation will allow persons in the United States to apply for adjustment of status to that of a lawful permanent resident as of the beginning of the statutorily established application period on October 1, 1994. These persons had been ineligible to adjust status and had been obliged to incur the expense and inconvenience of applying for an immigrant visa at a United States embassy or consulate abroad.
