The briefing provided exhaustive information on yesterday's events and the condition of their patient, Prime Minister Berov. According to Col. Milan Petrov's statement and to our great joy, things are proceeding normally. Col. Petrov said that there has been an improvement in the patient's state of health as compared with yesterday, and the doctors hoped that his situation would continue to improve more quickly during the next few days. Dr. Gerasimov was the first doctor who saw Professor Berov when he was admitted yesterday. After a medical consultation in which eminent cardiologists took part, the necessary investigations were carried out, and only then was a diagnosis made. Dr. Gerasimov agreed that the expression "cardiac crisis" that was used yesterday did not constitute a diagnosis, but merely described the state of the patient at the time of admission. The diagnosis that was announced a short time ago was a crisis of unstable stenocardia, whose effects the doctors have succeeded in bringing under control -- that is, a period of so-called cardiac ischemia. So far, the doctors declared, there is no sign that Prof. Berov has a developed infarct. The doctors said they had succeeded in controlling the stenocardia, but they made the proviso, which we understand, that every problem follows its own peculiar development. In answer to a question as to how long their patient would undergo treatment, the doctors said he would be treated for 15-30 days, depending on whether the heart attack caused any damage and how the patient's body reacts. A further question tried unsuccessfully to commit the medical team to say whether, following his recovery, Prof. Berov would be able to return to active political life, Dr. Gerasimov somewhat jokingly said: I might be able to say if the case was one of a psychic illness, which is not the case. However, as far as a heart illness is concerned, following his recovery every individual can return to the active life he was following previously. How much of a load he can put on himself is another question. However, in recent history we have examples of presidents who have had bypass operations and had other cardiac complaints. An explanation was given on another matter that had caused annoyance to the team of doctors and the Council of Ministers Press Center -- namely, the headline in a medical journal: Prime Minister Struck Down by Third Infarct. The medical team from the Government Hospital declared that, to date, Prof. Berov had suffered only one infarct, and that was in 1972. In the present case, the attack had not developed so far as to cause an infarct. The briefing continues, and we hope to have more information later.
