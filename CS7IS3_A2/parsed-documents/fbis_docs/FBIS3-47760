The current situation is very delicate as SLORC is striving to achieve national unity. It will not be necessary to elaborate on the achievements of SLORC during its term of office in improving national security, economic, social affairs, education, health, preservation of national culture, border region development, and infrastructure improvement nationwide. On the political front, there is special success in regard to national unity. There is peace and security in areas where insurgency prevailed for over 45 years since independence. Most of the country's territory is now peaceful and tranquil and we still have to strive to bring about peace and tranquility to the remaining areas, sooner or later. It is now the time for all our fraternal national people to work hand in hand to ensure our country, which we love and cherish, is fully peaceful and becomes a developed and modern nation. Currently, we are giving priority to bringing about the highest level of national unity. Therefore, I urge all national people, including the delegates and organizations, to have genuine goodwill and to put the interests of the nation ahead of one's own and one's group. The delegates at the National Convention had discussed and presented suggestions to obtain basic principles on which the fundamental principles of the state should be based in drafting the State Constitution. The delegates still have to hold discussions on details of the basic principles for each chapter to fully implement these basic principles. There may be differences of opinion or identical opinions on holding discussions and consultations. It is important not to be dissatisfied when opinions are not the same. It is important that one's view and that of others serve the interests of the nation and that it is viable. Only the views and methods which serve the basic interests of the national people at the highest level in the most practical way is desirable. Presently, various indigenous people are living together in our nation. As the indigenous people become more aware and developed, they have an increasing desire to manage their regions themselves. Therefore, we should be magnanimous in helping the indigenous people, as that is in accordance with the prescribed basic principles, to get the right to the management they deserve. [passage omitted] It is important that the structure of the state upholds the three cardinal causes [nondisintegration of the Union, nondisintegration of national unity, and the perpetuation of national sovereignty] as its essence. It is important to strive to further strengthen the Union. It is important for parts of the Union -- divisions, major regions, and states -- to jointly strive for the perpetuation of the Union; a prestigious place for the country in the community of nations; and the emergence of a modern, developed, and strong nation. It is especially important for parts of the Union to strive to ensure the interests of the Union are not violated and to contribute its welfare. The basic principles for the chapter on the head of state is to be discussed at the National Convention. The basic principles with the president as the head of state and the system of administration with the president as the chief executive have been obtained. Details concerning the qualifications of the president, who elects the president, and the president's rights and responsibilities are to be discussed at the convention. In considering the special needs of the state administrative system, it should be noted that the world communications and transportation are not like before; they are developing fast. The international political, economic, social, and military situation is changing every moment. Taking these changes into account, it has become necessary to have a fast and effective administrative machinery. The future system of administration must be modern and effective to safeguard the interests of the nation, to ensure the perpetuation of national sovereignty, the defense of the country's land, air, and maritime territory, and the prevention of violations against the country's prestige and interests. Our delegates from the Defense Services will take on the responsibility we deserve and give our assistance to the best of our ability in electing the president. This is to ensure the administrative system with the president as chief executive is fast and effective and meets the nation's defense requirement in the fast changing international situation. It has become necessary to give such assistance because we want to defend the country in a timely manner, in today's fast changing international situation that has repercussions on our nation's interests to a certain extent. While I have the opportunity, I would like to speak on the third cardinal cause -- the perpetuation of national sovereignty, which is crucial to a country. No one should attempt to undermine and weaken the country's sovereignty. We shall not tolerate the undermining of national sovereignty in any way. We shall not tolerate external threats to our national sovereignty, and we shall not tolerate threats to our national sovereignty from internal minions. Sovereignty, which belongs to the people, is the highest [power] and it should be exercised by a central body according to constitutional provisions. Therefore, it will be necessary for other organizations not to infringe upon the rights of the central body. National sovereignty belongs to all the indigenous people who have the responsibility to respectfully safeguard the sovereignty with their lives. National Convention delegates: The environment we are currently experiencing provides a very valuable lesson for our future journey. The conditions are alerting us to be vigilant. Some of those who are opposing national interests are still striving to obtain power through a short cut. They are ignoring the concrete conditions in the country marked by progress and are espousing a pessimistic outlook in making false accusations against the state. In accordance with international norms, international governmental organizations are not interfering in our internal affairs. However, some organizations under the influence of imperialists are busy interfering in the internal affairs of others and we hear about them daily. It will be irresponsible to ignore the threat from this neocolonialist group and those opposing national interests. National Convention delegates: The six objectives which we should all strive for without fail are: nondisintegration of the Union; nondisintegration of national unity; perpetuation of national sovereignty; the promotion of genuine multiparty democracy; the promotion of Lawkapala [universal] principle of justice, liberty, and equality; and the participation of the Defense Services in the leading role in future national politics. I conclude here by urging the delegates to give good suggestions and hold discussions and consultations for the emergence of a state constitution which is in accordance with these six objectives and contribute to the promotion of the essence of the 104 basic principles that we have obtained for prescribing the fundamental principles of the state.
