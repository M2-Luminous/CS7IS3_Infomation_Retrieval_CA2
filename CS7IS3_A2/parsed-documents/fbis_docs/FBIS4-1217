Addressing up to 15,000 supporters at a colourful election gathering complete with flags, badges and posters, Mr Buthelezi said his party remained the only party with support across South Africa. "My supporters stretch across the nation and the politics my party endorses has not only remained consistent and pragmatic, but has a universal appeal of which no other South African party can boast," Mr Buthelezi said. He urged people "to go for the bottom", a reference to the IFP's place at the bottom of the ballot. He accused the African National Congress and SA Communist Party [SACP] of raising expectations. "What the ANC/SACP alliance has failed to take into account are the obvious problems which flow from inflated expectations, especially when faced with the inequalities of the present and our country's restrained resources. "I am absolutely convinced that the ANC has neither the will nor the power to put right in this country what the decades of apartheid have made so terribly wrong. The ANC has specialisd in the politics of deceit. "My message to the people of South Africa is that the deep wounds in our society are as much produced by the ANC's grossly wrong responses to the needs of the people that apartheid has inflicted upon them," Mr Buthelezi said. He said the car bomb blast in central Johannesburg did not augur well for the future. He hoped it was an isolated incident. He also criticised the ANC for having shot Zulu marchers in Johannesburg on March 28, saying it would not be forgotten. He said the ANC and the National Party had become "the strangest bedfellows the history of mankind has ever seen". He said the ANC was pulling out all stops to make IFP strongholds ungovernable. "They would rather wipe the IFP off the face of this earth than face our formidable opposition in next week's elections," he said. He said there were irreconcilable differences between black political groups. He said the ANC/SACP would never represent all South Africa's blacks. For the April elections to succeed in establishing a secure and stable interim government, the prime political antagonists would have to exercise greater control over their followers. A culture of political tolerance had to be entrenched. "While the IFP recognises that both the ANC and the NP [National Party] are two major political parties in South Africa, we are equally aware that these parties are rejected by a large proportion of South Africa's electorate. "Any efforts by either of these parties to wrest control over a central party dictatorship after the elections will be the death knell for the people of South Africa." He said the IFP had rejected the notion of the ANC and NP deciding bilaterally about the future of South Africa. "The people of South Africa need the protection and strength of the IFP to secure a democratic settlement." As Mr Buthelezi finished his speech, hundreds of his supporters armed with sticks and assegais streamed out of the stadium. Police on the scene said there were no incidents.
