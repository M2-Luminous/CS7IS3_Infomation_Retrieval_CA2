The vehicle was struck by a rocket, in addition to many bursts of gunfire. This vehicle -- which fortunately was not carrying the head of state -- managed to escape. Soon afterward, more automatic gunfire was heard in many places around the capital, mainly around the RIT camp, at the Dove of Peace roundabout, on Hydrocarbon Boulevard, and on the lower side of the lagoon, near Cinema Togo. In those places, the terrorists, who were in plain clothes and driving vehicles without any distinctive signs or license plates, shot at everything that moved, sowing panic among citizens who were mostly returning home from work. Security forces countered these attacks immediately. Another group of terrorists in a Nissan Patrol-like vehicle were intercepted at the junction of Boulevard Jean-Paul II and Akeyi Street, while heading to a private presidential residence in Lome District 2, where the head of state and the prime minister were holding discussions. The attacks [word indistinct] concentrated on the RIT, (Avedougouome), and Rapid Intervention Force [FIR] camps. Outside the FIR camp a Toyota pickup vehicle was intercepted and its cargo seized. The cargo consisted of a sizable amount of arms, including rockets, defensive grenades, 7.62-caliber ammunition and propelling cartridges [as heard]. A bus carrying attackers was intercepted at (Doudogome), and its passengers were arrested and taken to the gendarmerie. Another bus, which was following [words indistinct] of their attackers was found on the Kara Boulevard with only its driver, who was seriously injured. At the Aflao customs post, a Peugeot sedan car, which was trying to force its way into Ghana, was fired upon -- the driver was killed on the spot. The attackers, who were routed around 0330, tried to withdraw to the Ghanaian border. Clashes continued until early this morning. The provisional toll is as follows: Seven security forces' elements, three civilians, and about 30 attackers were killed, while 35 terrorists were arrested. Issued in Lome on 6 January 1994. [Signed] The minister of national defense.
