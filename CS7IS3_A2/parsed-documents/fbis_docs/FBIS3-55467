Despite sustaining crushing blows in various sectors of the front in recent days, the Armenian Armed Forces are not giving up their occupationist plans, and are trying to breach the defensive positions of the Azerbaijani Army. Their efforts in this direction are being brought to naught thanks to the gallantry of our fighters; and the enemy is retreating, while sustaining enormous losses. Our brave fighters destroyed more than 200 enemy troops and more than 50 armored vehicles in fighting today. The fleeing Armenians, who were chased out of the positions they had previously occupied, are leaving behind considerable amounts of military hardware and provisions. The gallant Azerbaijani Army once again showed its strength to the enemy.
