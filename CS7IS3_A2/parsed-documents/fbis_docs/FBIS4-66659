Over to Mahfoud Mennane with the following dispatch: The proceedings were opened by the union's secretary general, Mr. Abdelhak Benhamouda, who touched on several topics, including those relating to organizational and legislative matters and to the preparations for the union's forthcoming congress. In his opening address, Mr. Benhamouda talked about several issues, including the current political and economic situation in the country and the pressures to which the union is being subjected. Regarding the economic issues, particularly those relating to the government's agreement with the IMF, the leader of the trade union expressed his dissatisfaction with this agreement, for as he put it, it will have negative repercussions on the working class in our country. He added that the trade union had not been informed beforehand about what was going on during the negotiations with the IMF. As regards the negotiations between the trade union and the government, Mr. Benhamouda said that the union had made enormous efforts to clinch some of the workers' rights. He added that what has been achieved is the minimum until the file of wages is opened. During this meeting, Mr. Benhamouda expressed the trade union's fear for the workers' future in view of the trend towards privatization. In this respect, he had this to say: [Begin Benhamouda recording] There are many Algerians who say -- even just from an economic point of view for we must talk about economic efficiency -- that if you hit the public sector now the crisis will deepen and will not be resolved. Why? Because the Algerian economy depends, for 70 percent, on the public sector. Therefore one cannot destroy or hit 70 percent to depend on the remaining 30 percent. Furthermore, these 30 percent also depend on these 70 percent. [end recording] It is worth indicating that at this very moment the proceedings are being held behind closed doors.
