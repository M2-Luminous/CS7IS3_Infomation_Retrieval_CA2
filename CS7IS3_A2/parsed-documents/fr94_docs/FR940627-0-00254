FR940627-0-00254 FR940627-0-00019 (4) Test evaluation. (i) A positive result in the in vivo SCE assay for either, or both, the lung or lymphocyte cultures indicates that under the test conditions the test substance induces reciprocal interchanges of DNA in duplicating chromosomes from lung or lymphocyte cells of the test species. (ii) Negative results indicate that under the test conditions the test substance does not induce reciprocal interchanges in lung or lymphocyte cells of the test species. (5) Test report. In addition to the reporting recommendations as specified under §§79.60 and 79.61, the following specific information shall be reported: (i) Test concentrations used, rationale for concentration selection, negative and positive controls; (ii) Toxic response data by concentration; (iii) Schedule of administration of test atmosphere, BrdU, and spindle inhibitor; (iv) Time of harvest after administration of BrdU; (v) Identity of spindle inhibitor, its concentration and timing of treatment; (vi) Details of the protocol used for cell culture and slide preparation; (vii) Criteria for scoring SCE; (viii) Replicative index, i.e., [percent 1st division+(2×percent 2nd division) + (3×percent 3rd division) metaphases]/100; and (ix) Mitotic activity, i.e., # of metaphases/1000 cells.

(a) Purpose. (1) The histopathological and biochemical techniques in this guideline are designed to develop data in animals on morphologic changes in the nervous system associated with repeated inhalation exposures to motor vehicle emissions. These tests are not intended to provide a detailed evaluation of neurotoxicity. Neuropathological evaluation should be complemented by other neurotoxicity studies, e.g. behavioral and neurophysiological studies and/or general toxicity testing, to more completely assess the neurotoxic potential of an exposure. (2) [Reserved] (b) Definition. Neurotoxicity (NTX) or a neurotoxic effect is an adverse change in the structure or function of the nervous system following exposure to a chemical substance.
