It will not happen without preliminaries and miraculously. The groundwork must be laid. That is probably why the period of absence [of the Hidden Imam] lasts so long. The groundwork must be laid. Some of the preliminaries are voluntary and some non-voluntary. The non-voluntary parts relate to the fact that human beings keep moving in certain directions and running into obstacles. Human beings who are against cruelty, against war, against poverty, against ignorance keep falling into this or that person's trap. They keep being misled by politicians and power holders; they keep being pulled in different directions and keep running into dead- ends. They must experience many dead-ends and reach a point where divine leaders and the protectors of revelation are the only ones who can save and guide humanity. They must reach a stage where they are prepared for the acceptance of the hidden imam and God's caliphate. In other words, things must reach such a pass that humanity despairs of saving itself. Things must reach that stage and they are reaching that stage. We are moving in that direction. That is one part of the groundwork: the non-voluntary preparations. The voluntary preparations: justice-seekers, worshippers of God and those who believe in this hidden imam must prepare themselves decisively. Certain movements must come into existence. Movements which oppose oppression, revolutions which oppose bullying must come into existence; revolutions which quest for God, revolutions which quest for Islam, revolutions which can make themselves heard throughout the world and declare their demands, saying: we do not want territory, we do not want water, we do not want money or power; we want justice and fairness. Revolutions must come into existence on the basis of right and justice. And they must break bullying powers, stand up to them, and make their own aims and ideals known to the world. They must lay the groundwork. These are the voluntary parts. These are the parts which impose duties. These are the parts which mean one must discard the mistaken idea that one should sit about until the hidden imam comes and sorts things out. No! The groundwork must be laid before his holiness reappears. [passage omitted]
