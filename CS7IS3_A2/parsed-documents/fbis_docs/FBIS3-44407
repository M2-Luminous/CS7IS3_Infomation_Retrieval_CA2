In his report, Comrade Guan Guangfu first reviewed the province's work over the past five years since the conclusion of the Fifth Hubei Provincial CPC Congress. He stated: Over the past five years, the broad masses of cadres and people across the province have comprehensively implemented the party's basic line, acquired an in-depth understanding of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, further emancipated the mind, made constant efforts to explore in light of actual provincial conditions new ways and means of deepening reform, expediting growth, and fulfilling such a strategic goal as making Hubei rise in central China, persistently deepened various reforms, further expanded opening up to the outside world, gradually quickened the pace of economic construction, and correspondingly improved people's livelihood. Comrade Guan Guangfu said: Over the past five years, party committees at all levels across the province have continually grasped two work aspects at the same time by taking account of the overall provincial situation as well as united and guided the broad masses of party members, cadres, and people in unremittingly forging ahead and constantly opening up new vistas. In the last five years, Hubei's average annual industrial output value and agricultural output value have maintained a 10.2 percent increase and a 4.7 percent increase respectively. As a result, we have basically attained each and every goal laid down by the Fifth Hubei Provincial CPC Congress and laid a solid foundation for speedier economic development in the future. It should be especially noted that since Comrade Deng Xiaoping gave a series of important talks during his south China tour and since the 14th CPC National Congress, Hubei has witnessed an unprecedentedly gratifying situation in reform and development. In 1992 Hubei's total gross national product recorded a 12.1 percent increase. That year also saw an accelerating economic growth across the province with per unit area yield of grain, cotton, and oil crops each hitting an all-time high and the province's total cotton output setting a new record. In 1992, Hubei's industrial production also registered faster growth coupled with increased economic efficiency. Comrade Guan Guangfu went on: It is estimated that by the end of 1993, Hubei's gross national product, total agricultural output value, and total industrial output value will have registered a 12.5 percent increase, a 5.5 percent increase, and a 17 percent increase respectively. Hubei is also expected to have raised economic efficiency by a large margin, raised financial revenue by 10.25 percent, accelerated key projects construction, increased fixed assets investment by 5.4 percent, and opened up new vistas for a fledgling export-oriented economy. Hubei will have raised export trade volume by 16 percent, made use of a total of $630 million of foreign funds, approved a new batch of over 2,200 foreign-funded enterprises, pushed ahead with township and town enterprises development at an extraordinary pace, and considerably raised the proportion of secondary and tertiary industries in comparison with the proportion of primary industry in the vast rural areas, thereby bringing about a historical takeoff. Comrade Guan Guangfu maintained: I'm convinced that Hubei will have attained each and every goal laid down by the Hubei Provincial CPC Committee at the start of 1993, including: To raise gross national product to over 100 billion yuan, to raise total industrial and agricultural output value to over 200 billion yuan, to raise financial revenue to over 10 billion yuan, and to increase income of urban and rural residents by a large margin. I'm also convinced that Hubei will have accelerated scientific, educational, cultural, public health, and other social undertaking developments by the end of this year, thereby pushing ahead with both spiritual civilization and material civilization building. Guan Guangfu concluded: By conscientiously and meticulously handling various social contradictions, we have successfully maintained political and social stability here in Hubei and continually stepped up party building amid the tide of reform and construction.
