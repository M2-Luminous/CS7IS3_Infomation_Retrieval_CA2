In a firmly worded appeal against the ban on all trade, diplomatic relations and other contacts, the pope said it hurt only the Cuban nation's poorest. Receiving the Cuban bishops for their five-yearly ad limina visit to the Vatican, the pope also cited a document written by them in September urging a national dialogue with the Cuban Government to steer the country out of its present crisis. In their document, the prelates urged a liberalisation of Cuba's politics and economy and also demanded respect for religious and civil liberties. The document was published after insistent rumours that the Cuban Government was seeking Vatican assistance to end the embargo, offering concessions to local Catholics or even permission for a papal visit in return. In June, Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina visited Rome for talks with his Vatican counterpart, Jean-Louis Tauran, but the Vatican later denied all speculation that he was pressing for Vatican aid in stopping the embargo in exchange for a visit that the Pope had said he was keen to make, but the Cuban Government had previously termed "premature." The Pope also cited a document approved by the Second Vatican Council asserting the church's right to go about its work among the peoples and to pass moral judgement on political systems as part of its mission to save souls and defend fundamental human rights. The Vatican never broke off diplomatic relations with Cuba despite difficulties with government policy. When the bishops' report was published last year, the Cuban Government accused the Vatican of "betrayal" and "counter-revolutionary action," later complaining that the church had ignored warnings against consequences should the report be made public. Speaking to the bishops today, the pope reiterated his desire to visit Cuba and reported on the increasing strength of the church there without directly mentioning the political situation.
