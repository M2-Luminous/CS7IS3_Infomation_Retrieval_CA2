FR941206-1-00067 FR941206-1-00007 The Agency proposes that MACT for contact adhesives should also be set at the same level as the MACT floor. (The Committee was not involved in selecting MACT for gluing operations.) Based upon discussions with industry, the Agency decided that an emission limitation more stringent than the MACT floor was not feasible for contact adhesives. The Agency proposes that MACT for contact adhesives used for upholstery operations (referred to here as foam adhesives) be set at a different level if the product manufactured with the foam adhesive meets flammability testing requirements of California Technical Bulletin 116, 117, or 133, BIFMA X 5.7, UFAC Flammability Testing, or any similar requirements from local, State, or Federal fire regulatory agencies. The limit of 1.0 lb VHAP/lb solids may require the use of waterborne foam adhesives. Many of the products manufactured with foam adhesives must meet standards for flammability. However, industry, including furniture manufacturers and adhesive suppliers, have stated that products manufactured with waterborne foam adhesives may fail these flammability tests. Therefore, the EPA has decided that foam adhesives used in products manufactured by existing sources that meet the flammability standards do not have to meet the limit of 1.0 lb VHAP/lb solids. For foam adhesives used in products manufactured by existing sources that do not meet the flammability standards, the EPA is proposing that MACT for existing sources be set at the MACT floor, that is, 1.0 lb VHAP/lb solids (1.0 kg VHAP/kg solids), as applied. The Agency believes that HAP emissions from foam adhesives used in products manufactured by existing sources can be reduced. In order to establish a limit for these adhesives, the EPA elected to set a limit equivalent to that of the lowest emitting solventborne foam adhesive used in quantities greater than 200 gallons per year. This adhesive has a HAP content of 1.8 lb VHAP/lb solids (1.8 kg VHAP/kg solids), as applied. Therefore, the EPA is proposing that MACT for existing sources for foam adhesives used in products that meet flammability standards be set at 1.8 lb VHAP/lb solids (1.8 kg VHAP/kg solids), as applied. Some manufacturers of contact adhesives have requested an exemption from the emission limitation for existing and new sources (1.0 kg VHAP/kg solids and 0.2 kg VHAP/kg solids, respectively), for problem applications involving nonporous substrates such as rigid plastic, metal, and rubber. According to the manufacturers, these operations require solvent-dispersed adhesives. Low VOC and HAP alternatives are not expected to be available for several more years. Manufacturers have also requested an exemption for aerosol adhesives. These adhesives are typically used by small businesses and by larger businesses for touch-up and repair. According to manufacturers, they are highly specialized systems and reformulation involves complex problems that affect not only the adhesive but the delivery system as well. Rather than allow the exemptions at this time, the Agency has decided to request comment on whether the exemptions should be allowed and any data that would support or refute the need for these exemptions. Additionally, the Agency specifically requests comments on the approach used for establishing MACT for contact adhesives for existing sources including comment on the following issues: 1. The appropriateness of excluding adhesives used in amounts less than 200 gallons per year, which the industry felt represented a de minimis usage, from calculation of the MACT floor; 2. Calculating the MACT floor based on the average of the best performing 12 percent of adhesives for a data set that is limited, 22 data points, but which the EPA believes is representative of the industry; and 3. The appropriateness of setting MACT for foam adhesives for existing sources based on a special quality required for the product (i.e., flammability). D. Selection of Format of Proposed Emission Limits 1. Finishing Operations For finishing operations, the VHAP content, expressed as pounds of VHAP emitted per pound of solids used (kg VHAP/kg solids), was determined to be the most appropriate format for the proposed standards. In selecting the format of the proposed standards, the following factors were considered:
