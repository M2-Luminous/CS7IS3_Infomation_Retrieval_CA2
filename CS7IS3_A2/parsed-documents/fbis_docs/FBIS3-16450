As is known, on 27 March, the elections of deputies to the Republic's Supreme Soviet will take place; but this will not be the only thing happening. The recently elected President of Crimea Yuriy Meshkov has made his amendments to the election campaign by signing on 10 March a decree which provides for the people of Crimea to be polled simultaneously. Yevgeniy Novikov has the details from Simferopol. [Novikov] According to the presidential decree, Crimea's citizens are to reply to three questions on 27 March: whether it is necessary to restore the 6 May 1992 Crimean Constitution which provides for the interrelations between Crimea and Ukraine to be regulated on the basis of a bilateral treaty; whether the people of Crimea are entitled to dual citizenship; and whether the Crimean president's decrees should be granted the force of law. Taking into account the Crimeans' active support for Yuriy Meshkov's policy, there is no doubt that all three questions will be answered in the affirmative and this will enable the Crimean president to take a tougher stance at the talks with Ukraine and to receive commanding powers in Crimea analogous to President Yeltsin's powers in Russia. However, the Central Electoral Commission took the liberty of disagreeing with the president's decree and adopted Special Resolution No 21. The Central Electoral Commission's resolution says that polling of Crimea's citizens is not envisaged by the law on elections and that the president, in appointing his representatives to the Central Electoral Commission, has grossly violated the Republic's Constitution and therefore must bring his decree in line with the legislation in force, that is to say, the decree should actually be abolished. Legal experts are now urgently working on resolving the conflict which has arisen. On the one hand, Meshkov was indeed too late in giving notice about the poll that was being prepared. On the other hand, the Central Electoral Commission has no legitimate grounds for instructing the president what he should do. For the time being it is also not clear whether the poll of Crimea's citizens will take place on 27 March. It is unclear what the legal consequences are of such a poll. Meanwhile, Yuriy Meshkov has signed one more decree on the dissolution of Crimea's Council of Ministers. The decree is perfectly in line with the Crimean Constitution, but runs counter to Ukraine's Constitution. Ukraine president's aid Mykola Mykhalchenko expressed the hope that Crimea's Supreme Soviet would not agree with Yuriy Meshkov's unconstitutional actions. However, Crimea's parliament did not find anything unconstitutional in the president's actions. Time will tell how events will develop further, but it is obvious that relations between Crimea and Ukraine are again beginning to worsen.
