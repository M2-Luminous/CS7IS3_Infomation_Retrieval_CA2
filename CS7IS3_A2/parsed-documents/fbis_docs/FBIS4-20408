Following founding of new China, Premier Zhou Enlai visited Burma in 1961. In 1962, the two countries redemarcated the border, thereby laying a foundation for further development of friendly relations between the two countries. The Yunnan section of the Sino-Burmese border runs for more than 1,900 kilometers without natural obstacles. The border line zigzags, border peoples living on both sides of it. In response to reform and opening to the outside world, and for effective maintenance of border security, the Yunnan border defense headquarters has decontrolled all that should be decontrolled, and controls what should be controlled. On the Burma side of the Sino-Burmese border, the situation is complex. Numerous political forces co-exist, and they frequently fight with each other. In November 1992, warfare broke out on the other side of the Sino-Burmese border. The Yunnan Border Defense Headquarters received an urgent report from the Lincang Border Defense Detachment. The border Defense Headquarters took immediate action, organizing forces to control the border situation. It captured the weapons of Burmese personnel who had entered Chinese territory, helped settle Burmese refugees, and maintained China's national honor. During this military incident, more than 20,000 Burmese border people surged into Chinese territory. More than 1,000 armed personnel of local nationality from across the border also fled into Chinese territory when they were defeated, carrying large amounts of firearms and ammunition with them. China's border defense units disarmed the more than 1,000 Burmese personnel who had entered Chinese territory following their defeat. All in all, border defense units confiscated 36 guns, 1,085 shells, 1,003 small arms of all kinds, 194 cartridge cases containing more than 30,000 rounds, and 2,987 hand grenades. In addition, border defense troops sent out search detachments every day to search for weapons and ammunition that the Burmese personnel had dispersed in key sections of the border, and urged the return of more than 20,000 refugees who had entered Chinese territory. Acting on instructions from higher authority, the border defense headquarters intervened actively in Burma, sternly pointing out that this conduct was an infringement of China's sovereignty, and explaining China's attitude about the maintenance of territorial sovereignty and the restoration of border order, forcing the other side to make an apology to us. The disarmed Burmese personnel and their families were safely sent back across the border. In order to maintain national sovereignty and honor, and to ensure border stability, the Yunnan Border Defense Headquarters strengthened patrols and guards on the national boundary. It immediately halted illegal entry into and exit from China, and it cracked down on all criminal elements who violated the law. With the intensification of reform and opening to the outside world, large numbers of traders from outside China have surged into this area, and the number of border people traveling back and forth has increased. Some border people trading post formerly located in villages far away from the frontier line have been moved to the national frontier, and the number of people entering and leaving through Chinese border exit and entry points has risen greatly. Some illegal elements who noted the complexity of the terrain along the China-Burma frontier also tried to sneak out of the country here to escape crackdowns. In order to maintain the prosperity of the border region and crack down on criminals, the Yunnan Border Defense Headquarters increased friendly cooperation with Union of Burma police organizations. Both sides held many discussions about joint crackdowns on criminal offenses, and the handling of border security issues. One bureau level cadre in Yunnan used his official position to turn over to his son more than 3 million yuan of public funds to go into business. Surprisingly, not only did this spendthrift's business fail, but he also used the public funds for eating, drinking, whoring, and gambling. Later on, he escaped to Burma with the funds remaining. The Dehong Dai-Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture Border Defense Detachment provided the Burmese with this person's physical description, photograph, and hiding place. Very soon, the Burmese police returned this person to our border authorities, both father and son falling into our legal dragnet. Through conversations, our border authorities also succeeded in obtaining the extradition from Burma of intelligence peddlers who had left China and were planning to sell Chinese military intelligence, thereby preventing a major disclosure of state secrets. Guo Tianming, the commander of the Dehong Dai-Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture Border Defense Detachment, said that "in order to escape a crackdown, some criminal elements in China devise means to sneak out of the country. The Dehong Border Detachment has succeeded in obtaining the extradition from Burma of several economic swindlers and criminals who escaped from China carrying public funds." Strong Contingent Receives a Rousing Welcome A large tree farm stands in the Yunnan border region where Wenshan and Honghe prefectures meet. One fall, a gang of criminals banded together to fell this government timber using armed force. They drove away the local forestry bureau personnel and work came to a standstill. Slogans reading "Smash the Forestry Bureau" appeared here and there. Each day more than 30 large trucks, each truck carrying more than 20 scoundrels, forcibly entered the tree farm to haul away timber in a display of swollen arrogance. At the time, the looting of state property and the destruction of state facilities also occurred elsewhere throughout the country. Consequently, the armed felling of timber in a state tree park in Yunnan gained the serious attention of State Council leaders who directed that Yunnan resolve this distant incident with all possible speed. After studying the problem, the Yunnan Provincial CPC Committee and provincial government ordered the Yunnan Border Defense Headquarters to send troops within 24 hours to designated sites. The Border Defense Headquarters urgently wired orders to the Wenshan and Honghe border detachments to deploy 300 crack troops along a line. At the same time, it ordered the Wenshan, Honghe and nearby border detachments on full combat alert. The commander of the Border Defense Headquarters who was the deputy commander in charge of this action, Zhou Rupeng, and the officers and men of the Wenshan and Honghe detachments moved upon receipt of the first alert. Nineteen hours later, blockades were in place at all entrances into the forest area, and six guard units began to publicize policy and the law at their guard locations. Within three hours, they successfully controlled all vehicle entry into the forest area, and brought to justice the marauding criminals. The lunar New Year was fast approaching, but border defense officers and men worked together with forestry bureau comrades and forestry public security cadres and policy to rectify public order in the forest area. Zhou Rupeng and more than 300 border defense officers and men spent that lunar New Year in the forest area. Provincial CPC committee secretary, Pu Chaozhu, personally drafted a congratulatory telegram to comfort the border defense officers and men. Provincial CPC committee and provincial government leaders praised the border defense headquarters as a reliable, useful, mobile, and superb corps. During July and August 1992, the Yunnan Border Defense Headquarters received orders to take part in a "tough crackdown" campaign in Pingyuan Prefecture, and it was responsible for an attack mission in combat. In order to reduce casualties, the headquarters made military deployments and conducted special combat preparedness training. Before dawn on 31 August, 20 small combat teams made up of border defense officers and men and public security cadres and police, led by border defense officers and men who were familiar with the terrain, entered designated areas under cover of darkness. At exactly 6:00 a.m., when a red signal flare went up, the 20 small teams simultaneously fell upon criminal elements rounding up a whole gang of criminals in one fell swoop. The Pingyuan street campaign had been fought very well, only three of the officers and men of the border defense units suffering injuries, and no one killed. [passage omitted] Virtually everyone knows that the Sino-Burmese border adjoins the world-renowned drug producing area, the "golden triangle." International narcotics peddlers use countless schemes to open a "China channel." Gun running and narcotic selling flow from the same source, causing a precipitous increase in the dangerousness of drug seizures. Trafficking in 50 grams of heroin is a crime punishable by death. In order to protect their lives and make a profit, drug peddlers may open fire and put up strong resistance. In 1993, Yunnan border defense troops fought 24 battles with armed drug peddling gangs, winning every time and delivering savage blows to the swollen arrogance of the drug peddling gangs. On one occasion, Gao Guanglun, the headquarters commander, personally led officers and men on the investigation of a drug smuggling case. They fought skirmishes with the criminals for more than a month, finally rounding up in one fell swoop the criminals from outside China. They captured 11 criminals and seized 30,000 grams of heroin, and HK$1.5 million and more than 400,000 renminbi in drug money. In 1993, the Yunnan Border Defense Headquarters seized more than 755 kilograms of heroin and more than 743 kilograms of opium. It also captured more than 1560 army rifles, more than 40,000 rounds of rifle ammunition, and nearly 4,000 hand grenades. In addition it confiscated more than 16,000 pornographic recordings and pictures. It also seized some smuggled gold, platinum and precious stones. It freed more than 100 women who had been kidnapped for sale abroad, and it tracked down and arrested more than 3,400 people involved in 500 cases of flight. Deep Feelings Dissolved in Ruili Jiang Reform and opening to the outside world brought unprecedented affluence to the vicinity of the border cities of Mangshi, Wanding, and Ruili. One high building after another has been built, shops and guest houses abound, and there is a dazzling array of goods. On the streets, a tide of people surges, and traffic is heavy. "We control the border through a combination of manning particular points, setting up lines, and conducting patrols through the whole area. Border public security inspection stations have set up checkpoints on the main thoroughfares in the forward border control area. They use an all-weather on-duty system, and they have instituted a general vehicle search and verification to interdict criminal elements. Border work stations have increased armed patrols, roadblocks, and ambushes along the border to control the line. Border work (inspection) stations have also increased controls at entry points and on cross-border roads to maintain the arrival and departure order. Public security posts control society along the border. They have improved public order at public places such as stations and hotels, and control over the general population, the transient population, and the temporarily domiciled population, thereby forming a complete border defense control network." This is what Yunnan Border Headquarters commander Zhou Rupeng told us. At the Simao Prefecture border line and in the triangular area where Vietnam, Laos, and Burma abut China, land and water routes are continuous, and there are numerous highways and ferries one may take to enter or leave China. These have always been places where smugglers, drug traffickers, and all sorts of criminals have sneaked in and out. Border defense detachments in these places feel that it is not enough to depend on border defense units to exercise control. We must take the approach of relying on the public to control the border. First, these detachments sent propaganda teams into village streets, fields, and hamlets along the boarder to conduct general indoctrination of the public to improve the public's consciousness about border control regulations. They used this as the first step in setting up public "border control teams headed by township and village cadres." For small roads away from villages, they sent guard teams to institute control. Thanks to these efforts, a fine situation of "three fews and three manys" emerged: the number of people leaving the country without having been inspected or registered were few, the number of people who submitted them self to border defense inspection were many; the number of foreigners entering China without permission to conduct activities was few, and the number of those entering and leaving through designated entry and exit points where they completed procedures were many; the number of people violating border control regulations were few, and the number abiding by the law and consciously supporting border controls were many. The border defense officers and men not only discharge the heavy duty of guarding the border and protecting the country, but they also regard the area they garrison like their hometown, treat the people like their father and mother, and willingly accept the task of helping the public extricate themselves from difficult circumstances, escape from poverty and become wealthy. The masses have begun to get wealthy. No longer need they worry about having sufficient food and clothing. They have also raised money for a joint border defense unit, doing all possible to help the border defense headquarters do its work well. Hence, one hears of case after case of joint police and people defense and criminals being caught. One young person who had a plan to flee from China by floating downstream on a raft was seized by the public in Guanlei Village and sent to the border defense work station. During the past several years, the public alone has caught more than 100 law breakers. Who are the most beloved people in this western Yunnan region? It is those who guard the border and defend the nation who are worthy of this name. Through their own behavior, they have built a bridge that bonds them with the flesh and blood of the people. They practice "a common destiny, breathing with, and linking heart to heart" with the people. The breaking of many large drug trafficking cases in the southwestern border region has depended on the leads that the public has provided. [passage omitted]
