Speaking to IRNA, Reyshahri said that the hajj season is the best time to set forth the problems of Muslims and to find solutions for them. That is why, he added, May 15 was announced the day for support of Bosnian Muslims. Reyshahri who is also representative of the leader, said that while the arrogant world has practically given the green light to the racist Serbs to continue their crimes, Muslims are duty-bound to support the resistance of their Muslim brethren. He blasted the international organizations especially the United Nations for their silence and negligence towards Serbs crimes. Deploring that the Serbs were massacring more Bosnian women, children and men every day due to the connivance of the U.N. and other world bodies, he said the continued arms embargo on Bosnia has made the Muslims defenceless against the criminal Serbs. He called for lifting of the arms sanctions imposed on Bosnia-Herzegovina in order to prevent continuation of the bloodshed. Reyshahri said that the U.N. insistence to continue the arms embargo only indicates the collaboration of the organization and the big powers dominating it with the Serbs. Criticising the U.N. opposition with the dispatch of peace keeping forces from Islamic countries including Iran to Bosnia, he said that "it has only one meaning and that is the support of the United Nations, the powers dominating over the international body and the person of the secretary general for the criminal Serbs." Stressing that helping the oppressed Bosnians was a religious task, he called on all Iranian and non-Iranian pilgrims to assist Muslim Bosnians as much as they could on May 15. Funds will be set up at the site of Iranian hajj caravans to collect cash donations of the pilgrims in Mecca and Medina.
