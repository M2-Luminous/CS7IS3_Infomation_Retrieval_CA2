ACTION: Final determination. SUMMARY: The Region 10 Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has determined that the Vashon-Maury Island Aquifer System is a sole or principal source of drinking water, and if contaminated, would create a significant hazard to public health. This action was taken under the authority of section 1424(e) of the Safe Drinking Water Act in response to a petition submitted to EPA by the Seattle-King County Department of Public Health on April 2, 1992. As a result of this determination, all federal financially assisted projects proposed in the designated area will be subject to EPA review to ensure that they do not create a significant hazard to public health. EFFECTIVE DATE: This determination shall be promulgated for purposes of judicial review at 1:00 p.m. Eastern time on July 19, 1994. ADDRESSES: The information upon which this determination is based is available to the public and may be inspected during normal business hours at the EPA Library, 10th Floor, Park Place Building, 1200 Sixth Avenue, Seattle, Washington 98101. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Scott E. Downey, Environmental Protection Specialist, Ground Water Section, WD&hyph;133, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 10, 1200 Sixth Avenue, Seattle, Washington 98101, 206&hyph;553&hyph;0682. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This action is being taken under the authority of section 1424(e) of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 United States Code, 300f, 300h-3(e), Public Law 93&hyph;523). The information upon which EPA is issuing this final determination has been summarized in the ``Support Document for Sole Source Aquifer Designation of the Vashon-Maury Island Aquifer System'', EPA 910/K&hyph;94&hyph;002. I. Background Section 1424(e) of the Safe Drinking Water Act states: If the Administrator determines, on his own initiative or upon petition, that an area has an aquifer which is the sole or principal drinking water source for the area and which, if contaminated, would create a significant hazard to public health, he shall publish notice of that determination in the Federal Register . After the publication of any such notice, no commitment for federal financial assistance (through a grant, contract, loan guarantee, or otherwise) may be entered into for any project which the Administrator determines may contaminate such aquifer through a recharge zone so as to create a significant hazard to public health, but a commitment for federal assistance may, if authorized under another provision of law, be entered into to plan or design the project to assure that it will not so contaminate the aquifer. Although EPA has the authority to initiate ``sole source aquifer'' designations, the Agency has a policy of acting only in response to petitions. Petitions may be submitted to EPA by any individual or organization and must address procedures and criteria outlined in EPA's ``Sole Source Aquifer Designation Petitioner Guidance'', EPA 440/6&hyph;87&hyph;003. On April 2, 1992, EPA Region 10 received a petition from the Seattle-King County Department of Public Health requesting that EPA designate Vashon-Maury Island as a sole source aquifer. The petition was developed in cooperation with the Vashon-Maury Island Ground Water Advisory Committee and the Vashon-Maury Island Water Utilities Coordinating Committee. Recognizing the value of the aquifer as a present and future source of drinking water, the petition was submitted as an additional way to protect the Island's ground water resources. EPA's initial review of the petition led to a request for additional hydrogeologic and water usage information. This information was subsequently submitted to EPA by the petitioner. On October 21, 1992, the petition was considered complete enough to undergo a more detailed technical review. The technical review was completed in April of 1994 and EPA's findings and basis for the proposed designation were documented in EPA's Support Document.
