Striking Ciskei police force members said the defence force, which now controlled Brig Gqozo's movements, was refusing to bring him to the stadium unless his safety was guaranteed. The army was unhappy with the large number of African National Congress [ANC] supporters who had occupied much of the stadium's grandstand and had been singing and dancing there since early morning. In nearby King William's Town, a Transitional Executive Council Task force was having discussion on Wednesday afternoon with South Africa's ambassador to Ciskei, Mr Piet Goosen, on a strategy for dealing with the territory now that Brig Gqozo was no longer in control. It is understood ANC Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa is also attending the meeting. The meeting at the Bisho stadium was originally scheduled to start at 7.30 AM. By midday, a steady stream of people was leaving the stadium as members of the police, prisons and defence force argued about what should happen next. At one point, the entire prisons contingent went behind the grandstand to caucus. Attempts by police spokesmen to address the crowd were shouted down by ANC supporters.
