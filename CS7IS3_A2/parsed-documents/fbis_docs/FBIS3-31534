In his talks with State Secretary at the Foreign Office Douglas Hogg, the situation in Bosnia was discussed. On his arrival in Prague, Jan Kalvoda told the Czech radio the following. [Begin Kalvoda recording] Two days ago, I was assured that the determination of Great Britain, which is an important member, is unshakable. I think that in this situation -- once a decision is made and declared, it has to be carried out. I am not really exhorting anybody to any kind of shortcut or violent solution of a situation which can be resolved by negotiations, but nowadays, all political negotiations have their content, a degree of effectiveness, and it would be very harmful to accept a principle of never using force as a means of sanction against the use of force in mutual relationships. I only confirmed that our attitude has been stated by authorized representatives of the Czech state at an international level, expressing in principle our support for the NATO decision to use bombing if the ultimatum fails, with the proviso that no rational person, nor the alliance, would consider the bombardment of Sarajevo to be a panacea for ending the tension and war in the former Yugoslavia. Certainly not. [end recording]
