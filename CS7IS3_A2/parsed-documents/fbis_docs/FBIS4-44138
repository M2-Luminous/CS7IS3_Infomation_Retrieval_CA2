The two are the members of the Democracy Party (DEP) which was banned by the Constitutional Court last week. The court in its decision also decided to strip the 13 DEP deputies from parliament membership. Shortly after the decision, the State Security Court chief prosecutor, Nusret Demiral, announced that Sadak and Yurtdas were to be detained. However, acting parliament speaker Kamer Genc said in response that the two deputies can not be detained unless the court's decision is received by parliament. Among all this controversy, the two deputies participated in a parliamentary session and asked an appointment with the president. After the meeting which was closed to the press, Sadak said they briefed the president on the problems which would emerge after the closure of DEP and the removal of their immunity for prosecution. `We conveyed to the president, the concerns about the non-representation of the southeastern people in parliament,' Sadak said.
