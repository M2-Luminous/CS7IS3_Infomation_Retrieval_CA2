FR940404-0-00029 FR940404-0-00013 (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; (2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order. It has been determined that this rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the terms of Executive Order 12866 and is therefore not subject to OMB review. Specifically, this rule will not have an annual effect on the economy in excess of $100 million, have a significant adverse impact on competition, investment, employment or innovation, or result in a major price increase. In fact, as discussed above, this action will reduce the cost of compliance with Federal requirements in this area. Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501, EPA must obtain OMB clearance for any activity that will involve collecting substantially the same information from 10 or more non-Federal respondents. This direct final rule does not create any new information requirements or contain any new information collection activities.
