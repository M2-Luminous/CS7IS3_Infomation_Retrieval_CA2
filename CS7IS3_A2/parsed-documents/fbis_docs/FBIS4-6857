FBIS4-6857 "dreas079_a_94015" FBIS-EAS-94-079 Daily Report 25 Apr 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Joint Parliament Group Formed by 130 Members Joint Parliament Group Formed by 130 Members OW2504120094 Tokyo KYODO in English 1135 GMT 25 Apr 94 OW2504120094 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, April 25 KYODO -- A 130-member joint parliamentary group was formed in the House of Representatives on Monday [25 April] to support newly elected Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. The group, called "Kaishin" (Renovation), comprises Hata's 62-member Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], the 37-member Japan New Party (JNP) led by Hata's predecessor as premier Morihiro Hosokawa, the 19-member Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), the seven-member Liberal Party and the four-member Kaikaku no Kai, party officials said. Toshio Yamaguchi, an independent member, also joined the bloc. The Liberal Party led by Koji Kakizawa and Kaikaku no Kai led by Takeo Nishioka were formed by defectors from the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). New Party Mirai (Future), another five-member LDP breakaway, did not join "Kaishin" but plans to take part in the future, a senior Shinseito official said. DSP Chairman Keigo Ouchi urged the formation of a new joint alliance, saying, "we should create a strongly united grouping to support new Prime Minister Hata." Ouchi made the call in a meeting of DSP legislators. However, new party Sakigake [Harbinger] head Masayoshi Takemura, the chief cabinet secretary in the Hosokawa cabinet, rejected the scheme. Sakigake, poised to distance itself from the dominant Shinseito-Komeito alliance in the coalition, has pledged not to take a post in the new government but voted for Hata in the prime ministerial vote in the Diet. Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the 74-member Social Democratic Party (SDP), expressed displeasure with the move toward a joint alliance, saying, "I cannot say it is good or bad. But also I cannot say `please do as you like'." DSP sources said Ouchi and Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, the chief strategist in the coalition, met secretly at the end of last week and agreed on the formation of a new joint parliamentary group. Hosokawa called for the creation of a joint parliamentary group, called "Kaikaku" (Reform), with other coalition parties in the lower house on April 8 when he announced his sudden resignation. The idea had been frozen because of criticism from Sakigake [Harbinger] and the SDP, which charged that such a proposal would lead to the formation of a large new party amalgamating the JNP, Shinseito and Komeito.
