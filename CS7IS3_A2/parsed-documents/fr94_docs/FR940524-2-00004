FR940524-2-00004 FR940524-2-00003 Forest Service Rocky Mountain Region; Crested Butte Ski Area Expansion, Grand Mesa, Uncompahgre and Gunnison National Forests, Gunnison County, CO AGENCY: Forest Service, USDA. ACTION: Supplement to Notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement; scoping date extension. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A previously published Notice of Intent (FR Vol. 59, No. 64, April 4, 1994, Pages 15702&hyph;3) announced Forest Service plans to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) on a proposal to upgrade and expand the Crested Butte Ski Area. The announcement noted a general information meeting to discuss the proposed expansion, and the associated EIS, with the public. Due to a clerical error, the notice was published after the date of the meeting, March 29, 1994 (not 1993 as indicated in the notice). Notice of the meeting was widely circulated locally, and approximately 80 people attended. As a result, the Forest Service believes the meeting adequately provided general information to the public. Other meetings will be scheduled for this purpose should the need arise. Also, the Forest Service has extended the scoping period by one month from June 1, 1994 to July 1, 1994, to insure adequate time for public input. ADDRESSES: Send written comments to Crested Butte Ski Area Analysis, U.S.D.A. Forest Service, 2250 Highway 50, Delta, Colorado 81416. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jeff Burch, Forest Planner, (303) 874&hyph;7691 or Craig Magwire, (303) 641&hyph;0471. Dated: May 17, 1994. Steve L. Marquardt, Acting Forest Supervisor.
