Employees were forced to leave the Legislative Palace by a group of armed men who did not hesitate to beat them to compel them to leave the premises. The following is a report by Jean Luckenson. [Begin Luckenson recording, in Creole] There was much tension at the office of the Senate of the Republic on Tuesday, 8 February [date as heard]. Both high level employees as well as lower-level ones were obliged to clear out, to run away because of threats by 18 January Senator Osny Eugene, the quaestor of the unofficial Senate office who was very angry and took off his jacket so he could drive employees out. He was accompanied by policemen and armed civilians who were jostling employees and who even used their weapons to hit the employees. An employee, who told us what was going on, said that the employees have nothing to do with the running battle within the Senate of the Republic. So, they will not budge an inch, they will wait for Senate President Firmin Jean-Louis. We must tell you that even the secretary general of the Senate shared the fate of the employees. [passage omitted] Sen. Osny Eugene, quaestor of the unofficial office, asserted that he had sent a press release to the radio stations asking employees to stay home. This is why he drove employees out on the morning of 8 March. The controversial 18 January senator went on to say there must be a meeting of the 26 senators so they can reach a compromise. [passage omitted] For his part, Sen. Bernard Sansaricq described what happened at the Senate office on 8 March -- when Sen. Firmin Jean-Louis, legitimate president of the Senate of the Republic, came back to his office -- as an impertinence. The president of the unofficial office stated that the situation (?is back to normal), that he will sit normally, that he has a mild temperament, but that he can become extremely violent, and that this is what explained his silence on 8 March. [passage omitted] Until 1500 this afternoon, we noted the presence of the senators of the Alliance for Parliamentary Cohesion, the controversial 18 January senators, but no National Front for Change and Democracy Parliamentary Bloc senators were present. So, sessions could not be held by the legitimate office led by Firmin Jean-Louis. We must tell you that many arrests were made by armed civilians who injured a young man with a gun before taking him away. Members of the press who were on the scene received threats from armed civilians who prevented them from coming near the scene to see the disturbances and mayhem. Jean-Luckenson for Signal FM.
