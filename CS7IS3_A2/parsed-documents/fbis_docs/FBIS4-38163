During his meeting at the Prime Ministry today with the Yemeni parliamentary delegation headed by deputy Muhammad 'Abdallah al-Kibsi, al-Hindawi said that all Jordanians want a return to national dialogue and a cease-fire so that fraternal Yemen can emerge from its crisis safe and healthy and direct its energies and resources toward progress and prosperity. The Arab nation, he said, more than ever needs its sons' energies and solidarity in a world of cooperation and blocs to achieve the interests of nations and all humanity. The acting prime minister was then briefed by the guest delegation on the current crisis in Yemen and ways of ending the infighting among the sons of the one people and returning to the unity's constitution, which was endorsed by the people, so that unified Yemen can remain an asset for the Arab nation and a factor for progress and development in it. In a statement to journalists following the meeting, al-Kibsi said: We have accepted a cease-fire and a return to dialogue within the framework of unity. He added: It is untrue that we want to impose unity by force. Rather, we support legitimacy and the Yemeni people's will and options regarding their unity and democratic policy. He pointed out that during the meeting, Jordan stressed its firm and principled position toward the Yemeni crisis and called for halting the infighting and returning to dialogue and negotiations.
