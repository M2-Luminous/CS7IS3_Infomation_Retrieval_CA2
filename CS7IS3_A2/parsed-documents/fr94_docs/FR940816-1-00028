FR940816-1-00028 FR940816-1-00007 The individual subpart 4 requirements (see section IV. above) will be waived only after considering all relevant circumstances on a case-by-case basis for serious areas where anthropogenic sources do not contribute significantly and where RACM have been implemented. Currently, the section 189(b)(3) requirement to modify the definitions of ``major source'' and ``major stationary source'' is the only serious area requirement that will not be waived. D. Waiver Policy Description Consistent with the discussion above, the EPA intends to implement its authority to grant waivers under section 188(f) in a manner described by the diagram presented in Figure 1. It is important to note that this diagram is provided for illustrative purposes only and should not be interpreted contrary to the policy as it is described in this notice. The figure presents six decision questions. A SIP submitted for a moderate nonattainment area seeking a waiver is expected to address the first three questions: 1. Can the area attain the NAAQS by the applicable statutory attainment date (December 31, 1994 for the initial nonattainment areas) after implementing RACM (including RACT) for contributing anthropogenic and nonanthropogenic sources? If the moderate area SIP demonstrates that the area can attain with RACM (including RACT) by the attainment date, then the answer to this question is ``yes'' and the waiver provisions are not applicable.
