The poll, which was conducted by the National Advisory Center [Centro Nacional de Consultoria -- CNC] in Medellin, the second largest city in the country, invited opinions on the presence of U.S. soldiers in Colombia. It showed that 73 percent of those polled flatly rejected the foreign presence, 18 percent favored it, and 9 percent did not reply. The rejection emerged in late December when a contingent of U.S. Marines arrived in the Pacific region to carry out charity works, according to the government's official report. According to the report, these foreigners are building a school, a health center, and a stretch of a road. Their arrival, however, sparked very angry comments, and several politicians even dismissed their tasks, claiming that Colombian soldiers could carry them out without foreign aid. EL COLOMBIANO reported that those polled pointed out that "they do not accept the presence of U.S. Marines along the Colombian coast. Likewise, they mistrust the government's explanations about the works that are being carried out there." When asked whether the presence of U.S. soldiers violates sovereignty, 69 percent replied yes, 20 percent replied no, and 11 percent replied they did not know. When asked whether they believe the soldiers are building schools and roads, 66 percent of those polled replied no, 10 percent replied yes, and 24 percent did not answer.
