Even before they had time to recover from the abduction of Mustafa al-Dirani, the leaders of the Hizballah lost dozens of their youngest fighters in the heart of their "security zone" in al-Biqa', under the nose of the Syrians and their antiaircraft missiles. The two latest actions reflect a new, far more aggressive, approach recently adopted by the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] against hostile elements in Lebanon with the government's approval. In light of the deadlock in the negotiations with Syria, Israel has no reason to show the restraint and passivity which have characterized the IDF's activity in Lebanon until now. In the absence of a better response, Hizballah resorted to the familiar: launching Katyusha rockets at towns in the Galilee. Judging from experience, this is not the last word. One can safely assume not only additional Katyusha volleys over the next few days but also a concentrated effort by Hizballah to attack IDF and SLA [South Lebanese Army] outposts and patrols in the security zone. There may be also be attempts to kidnap SLA and IDF soldiers. The situation may deteriorate in a way similar to the exacerbation that preceded Operation Accountability [July 1993]. The difference is that this time, the IDF is taking the initiative while the Hizballah is only reacting, to a large extent out of helplessness. Another difference is the increasing effectiveness of the IDF offensives. The IAF has attacked in Lebanon dozens of times in recent years, but only in rare cases has it managed to inflict a real blow on the terrorist organizations. Most of the benefit of these air raids lay in their deterrent effect and in their disruption of preparations for terrorist operations. Now, the fighting capabilities of the fundamentalist organization are increasingly being undermined. Judging from recent operations, the IDF has acquired some intelligence information that enables it to strike at the root of the problem; or in other words, Hizballah's fighting corps. One can also discern an improvement in the IAF's capability to carry out surprise attacks against distant targets, despite the threats along the way (Syrian antiaircraft fire). This improvement in the IDF's "long arm" enables it to refrain from striking at the civilian populace which supports Hizballah, as was the case in the past. Yesterday's IDF operation did not violate the understandings reached in the wake of Operation Accountability in July 1993. The target attacked, 'Ayn Zarzarah, was not a village but a major Hizballah training base several kilometers from the Syrian border. In any case, it does not matter whether or not Israel violated the understandings. Hizballah cannot allow itself not to retaliate against the recent attacks. The question is which form this reaction will take and how powerful it will be. It will also serve as a test for the new Israeli strategy. If the reaction is tolerable, and does not lead to a serious exacerbation, then the Israeli gamble has paid off and the recent operations have achieved their goal. But if we again find ourselves in a situation where Israel has to ask the Americans to mediate for a cease fire, with the help of Syria, then both the gamble and the new strategy have failed.
