Well-informed sources have told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that Gulf ministers will discuss with Christopher the proposed draft for a "declaration of principles" of states participating in the multilateral negotiations, which lays the foundations for the shape of political and economic cooperation between the states of the region. The United States submitted this draft to the GCC states during the meeting of the multilateral negotiations steering committee, which convened in Ottawa, Canada, in February. Under secretaries of the GCC foreign ministries met in Riyadh at the beginning of the week to discuss this draft. They reached a joint formula in this connection. The ministers will discuss this formula with Christopher when they meet with him tomorrow. AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned that some GCC states have reservations about some clauses in the proposed U.S. draft, especially those related to the pledge to establish democracy and party pluralism and encourage individual and collective freedoms. In addition to GCC Secretary General Shaykh Fahim Bin-Sultan al-Qasimi, the meeting will be attended by the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar, and the Sultanate of Oman. It will not be attended by Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad, Kuwaiti first deputy prime minister and foreign minister, who is on a tour of the Maghreb states. Kuwait will be represented at the meeting by 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dakhil, minister of state for cabinet affairs, planning minister, and acting foreign minister. The "declaration of principles" proposed for the multilaterals in the Middle East region stipulates laying down basic principles to govern relations among regional parties in the region, establishing full relations, and reinforcing regional cooperation and economic development with Israel's participation under the plan to achieve reconciliation; a just, secure, comprehensive, and lasting peace; and mutual trust among all parties in the Middle East region. Muscat recently hosted the meetings of the water committee arising from these negotiations. Qatar is scheduled to host the arms control committee meetings next Monday. Bahrain too has offered to host the environment committee meetings next fall.
