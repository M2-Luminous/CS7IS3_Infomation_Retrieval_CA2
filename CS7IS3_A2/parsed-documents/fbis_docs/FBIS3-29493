It is "very important" for economic-related ministries to craft measures that would lead to a "visible" reduction in black ink within half a year, Economic Planning Agency director general Manae Kubota told a news conference. Kubota proposed a regular monitoring of Japan's trade balance, for example on a monthly basis. She said the EPA, as part of surplus-cutting efforts, wants to formulate ways to improve access to Japanese markets and narrow the gap between domestic and overseas prices. Measures should be worked out before the finance ministers of the Group of Seven (G-7) industrial nations get together in Germany on February 26, she said.
