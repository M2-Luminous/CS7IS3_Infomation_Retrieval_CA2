In 1993, Tibet's GDP was 3.05 billion yuan, its peasants' per-capita income 521 yuan, and there was relatively rapid development in the region's agriculture, animal husbandry, industry, infrastructure, and foreign trade. Gyaincain Norbu, Tibet Autonomous Regional People's Government chairman, said at the National People's Congress session in mid-May: "1994 has been a critical year for our region in that it has seen comprehensive reforms, wholesale progress, key breakthroughs, and stepped-up efforts at creating a socialist market economic system." Regarding reforms, "efforts are under way to install a mechanism for the transfer of user's rights to land and pasture with compensation" and to encourage peasants and herdsmen to open up wasteland by "granting the operating rights to whoever opens up the land"; and manufacturing enterprises are transforming their operating mechanisms and rationalizing their business organization. Regarding opening up, Tibet has been exploiting its proximity to the border. It is improving its border ports, initiating cooperation with neighboring countries in many areas, improving the investment environment to attract more foreign and domestic investment, cooperating further with enterprises from the rest of the country to build more joint export bases, developing tourism, and so on.
