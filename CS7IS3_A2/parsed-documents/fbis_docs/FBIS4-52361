FBIS4-52361 "dreas090_l_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-090 Daily Report 7 May 1994 Philippines Military Training Accord Signed With Singapore Military Training Accord Signed With Singapore BK0805071394 Singapore THE STRAITS TIMES in English 7 May 94 p 30 BK0805071394 Singapore THE STRAITS TIMES English BFN [Text] The armed forces of Singapore and the Philippines will carry out regular joint military exercises and training. A memorandum of understanding (MOU) formalising the training arrangement, as well as co-operation between the two sides, was signed between the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and the Singapore Armed Forces [SAF] on Thursday. The signing of the MOU took place at the Department of Foreign Affairs Building in Manila between Mr. Roberto R.Romulo, the Philippine Secretary of Foreign Affairs and Mr. Tan Seng Chye, Singapore's Ambassador to the country. Anoa-Singa 2/94 will be the first exercise which will be held following this newly signed agreement. It will be conducted here from May 12-18. Under the Anoa-Singa series, regular joint land exercises will be held between the two armed forces, with the venue alternating between the countries. The first exercise under this series took place last year in the Philippines. Thursday's MOU is, however, not the SAF's first training agreement with the AFP. Under an earlier one concluded in 1979, the Republic of Singapore Air Force [RSAF] was allowed to deploy regular training detachments at the Clark Air Base. The RSAF ceased this deployment only when the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1990 made the air base inoperable. The air force agreement expired subsequently, in December 1991. The Ministry of Defence said that the signing of the new MOU affirmed the friendly relations existing between the two countries and their long-term commitment to closer defence ties and co-operation between the SAF and the AFP.
