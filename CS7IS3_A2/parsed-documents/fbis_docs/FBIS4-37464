In our first question we noted that ever since Mustafa al-Dirani's abduction [on 21 May], tension and anxiety have prevailed throughout Israel's northern settlements. Despite fear of a Hizballah retaliation or terrorist attack, things had been relatively quiet. We asked Lubrani whether yesterday's attack was the reprisal everyone had feared. [Lubrani] I think this operation should be viewed as part of our ongoing struggle in the security zone. The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldiers often travel in convoys. Although this was an especially serious attack it definitely falls within the framework of regular occurrences. Regrettably, however, we paid a heavy price this time. [Eylon] How would you define this routine, Mr. Lubrani? Prime Minister Rabin also said yesterday that there had been no exacerbation along the northern border. What are the parameters? [Lubrani] There are no clear lines. Sometimes, there is a steep rise in activity while other periods are more quiet. As you just mentioned, we recently experienced a quiet period but nothing lasts forever, there is constant activity and something happens every night. Some incidents are so low-level that they are not worth reporting, but something happens every night. [Dan] Does such a painful attack demand a retaliation on our part? [Lubrani] That is something else entirely which involves considerations unrelated to the scope of yesterday's incident. One must definitely consider taking steps following such an attack. However, as I said earlier such convoys are commonplace and often exposed to attack. This could happen again today. To my regret, this particular attack must be seen within the context of daily activity. [Dan] It appears that by using the somewhat outdated sagger missiles, the terrorists save themselves the trouble of confronting our soldiers head on. Do we have a suitable riposte for these missiles? [Lubrani] We have responded by changing our tactics in the north; however, the sagger missiles undoubtedly constitute a deadly weapon. [Dan] Mr. Lubrani, will we have to accept this kind of status quo in the near future? [Lubrani] Yes, that is my impression. It is part of our continuing struggle until conditions are ripe for reaching security arrangements with Lebanon. [Dan] Thank you, Uri Lubrani.
