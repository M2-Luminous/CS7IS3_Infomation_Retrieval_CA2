President's Deputies Will Each Get a Chamber"] [Text] Presidential representatives in the federation components, who seem to have become wearied with longing for the attention of journalists who are currently more interested in the doings of local governors and speakers, have decided to issue a reminder that they are there. During a conference of the president's representatives in the regions of Siberia and the Urals that ended late in the evening in Kurgan on Tuesday, the "sovereign's men" decided to take into their own hands the implementation of the Treaty on Social Accord in the regions. As their rivals in the shape of local bodies of power are growing stronger, the struggle of the president's representatives to contain the inferiority complex that they are developing takes on paramount importance. Therefore the idea born in the depths of the president's staff to organize public chambers was taken up with considerable enthusiasm. This involves setting up regional analogues of the Public Chamber under the president of Russia, where the main regional political forces would be uniting under the warm wings of the presidential deputies. Assessing the creation of such public chambers as a correct step which also makes it possible to implement in the regions the provisions of the Treaty on Social Accord, the presidential representatives from 11 krays and oblasts elaborated their own proposals regarding the functioning of the public chambers. In the first place, they think, the chambers should not be put there by order, one can only recommend that they be created. To have some weight, members of the chambers ought to have the right to speak in regional legislative bodies, and to participate in agreeing on presidential edicts before they have become signed. Nor did the president's representatives forget about the material problems of public chambers, asking Boris Yeltsin to arrange for financing them. However, the optimistic statements from the conference podium slightly diverged from the skeptical utterances in the lobby. Some of its participants think that any positive effect from creating the chambers is rather doubtful because they would be joined mainly by minority parties with no serious power base. Besides, the very existence of presidential representatives in the regions has not been formalized by law, hence the public chambers to be created under them would have no secure legal status.
