How does Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] view these changes? [Ghawshah] Permit me to state that what is being described as the peace train is a mere falsehood. What has really happened is that the Zionist enemy has managed to sign an agreement in the form of a "principled accord." This accord does not include a clause mandating its implementation and that implementation has been postponed. In lieu of this accord, the Zionist regime has practiced extortion on the Palestinians, the Arabs, and the countries of the world. It wants the Arabs to lift economic embargoes on Israel and to normalize relations. It demands economic assistance from Western countries. Therefore, what has happened up to now is not peace but a complete lie. On the other hand, the accord has been evaluated and it has been proven to everyone that the elements of weakness and discord are greater than those for attaining power and prosperity. [Khamehyar] As you have stated, we also concur that the accord is one of surrender and compromise. What is your concept of peace? [Ghawshah] This accord is one-sided and the rights of one of the sides has not been taken into consideration. The Palestinian side signed the accord when it did not have any freedom of action. It can be said that the accord was dictated to it and it was forced to accept it. [passage omitted] [Khamehyar] In view of the people's opposition to the Gaza-Jericho accord, what program do you have to defuse such opposition? [Ghawshah] Following the reports on such an accord, the Palestinians were engulfed by a wave of astonishment. However, they soon recovered and the nation woke up to the treacherous nature of the plot and began to oppose it. On 13 September armed operations, especially martyrdom-seeking operations, proliferated among the combatant Palestinian youth. In addition, many supporters of the Fatah movement also joined the fray in opposing the mounting suppression of the Palestinian revolutionaries by the Zionist soldiers and security forces. In the past three days anti-Zionist operations have risen noticeably; in just one day one of the mujahidin was martyred and 80 others were wounded. Therefore, it can be said that the people's opposition to the Gaza-Jericho accord has proliferated remarkably. However, with regard to the 10 Palestinian factions, their current activities in the occupied areas are more in the fields of publications and politics rather than operations. Outside the occupied areas, no serious measure has been taken to create solidarity and political coordination. Nevertheless, all these groups should not be viewed in the same light as those, such as Hamas, that have never stopped their activities and do not wait for any unified or concerted decisions by the 10 factions. They continue their jihad and strategic struggle. [passage omitted] [Khamehyar] 'Arafat is now seeking to mitigate the intense opposition of the various Palestinian groups to the Gaza-Jericho accord, and it is for this purpose that he met leader of the Muslim Brotherhood Mustafa Mashhur in Egypt and requested his mediation between you and him. The head of the Palestinian delegation to Madrid, Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, also played the same role. How does Hamas view these efforts? [Ghawshah] These are political tactics that the beleaguered 'Arafat resorts to constantly. The aware Islamic movements never fall prey to these deceptions. After signing the Gaza-Jericho accord on 20 August 1993, 'Arafat officially recognized the Zionist enemy and went to Yemen. He requested that the president arrange a meeting between himself and Hamas, after which a Yemeni faction tried to mediate but Hamas rejected the overtures and announced that it would not meet 'Arafat. [passage omitted] Unfortunately, our Muslim Egyptian brothers met 'Arafat. Perhaps this meeting was arranged under certain circumstances that were imposed or merely conformed to the nature of the Egyptian regime. [sentence as published]. It is also possible that the Egyptian regime created the conditions for such a meeting. It is well known that Hamas officially conveyed its displeasure about this meeting to the Muslim Brotherhood. We told them that such a meeting was not necessary and that 'Arafat should not be given the opportunity to benefit from the support and cover of Islamists. [passage omitted] [Khamehyar] The second Islamic Peoples' Conference is being convened in Khartoum because of the efforts of Hasan al-Turabi and some reports say that 'Arafat will participate. In view of the fact that the Sudanese have not adopted a clear stance on the 'Arafat-Rabin compromise, what is the Hamas position on this conference, especially on Hasan al-Turabi? [Ghawshah] Allow me to speak clearly on this subject. Hamas was invited to participate in this conference. We were the founding members of this congress in April 1991, and I remember that the Islamic Republic of Iran was also a founding member. Hamas assessed the invitation in light of Sudan's political posture. There was a difference of opinion in the Hamas political bureau. One was that the conference should be boycotted because the Sudanese Government had tacitly supported the accord. In addition, the Sudanese Foreign Minister, as well as the director of the political desk at the Sudanese Foreign Ministry, had declared their support of the 'Arafat-Rabin compromise. Similarly, the Sudanese representative to the Arab League had supported the compromise. Al-Turabi statements have been conflicting. On the one hand he directly supported 'Arafat, but on the other he criticized many of the clauses in the accord. It was on this basis that some of the Hamas members opposed our participation in the Sudan conference. Another group [in Hamas] believed that for the sake of expediency, after obtaining the actual stance of the Sudanese, we should participate in the conference, and a message was sent to Hasan al-Turabi by Hamas. The other point is that Hasan al-Turabi assured us that the issue of the Gaza-Jericho accord would not be on the conference's agenda and that this issue would be delegated to the participating teams. It was on this basis that the Hamas political bureau decided to participate in this conference and to condemn the Gaza-Jericho accord at the Islamic Peoples' Conference in Sudan. We also agreed that if 'Arafat planned to participate we would boycott the conference. [passage omitted] [Khamehyar] Will you participate in the autonomous elections scheduled for next year? What is your opinion on Shim'on Peres' remarks that if Hamas gains votes in the next elections they will be annulled? [Ghawshah] These offensive remarks are a trait of the filthy and strategic propaganda of the Zionists. The PLO is also seeking to propound similar premises to deceive Hamas so that it can be dragged into the elections. The Hamas position is as follows: First, as all are aware, the agreement on Gaza and Jericho has been signed for limited autonomy. It is possible that in the future it would include the West Bank and Gaza. Hamas rejects the Gaza-Jericho autonomy accord. It basically rejects the mechanism [preceding word in English] of autonomy since the elections are part of this mechanism for the implementation of autonomy. No movement can tolerate its principles being trampled underfoot and accept this mechanism. It is for this reason that Hamas has officially declared its opposition to the elections and has asked the people to boycott them, but not with violence. This is the final stance of Hamas, which has been adopted especially on the elections for autonomy, after extensive discussions among the movement's leaders. [Khamehyar] It is feared that if the opponents of this compromise continue their course of action and support the intifadah, they will be hounded and suppressed. How do you see the future? [Ghawshah] When one carries the banner of the jihad, he does not fear anything and has considered the consequences. He knows what price he will pay for his lawful obligations. [passage omitted] We are aware that the United States is seeking to scorch the roots of Hamas. It is exerting pressure on Saudi Arabia to prevent the Saudi people's zakat [alms] from reaching Hamas. It has also asked Jordan to pressure Hamas and prevent its political and propaganda activities on Jordanian soil. It is also clear that the United States is pressuring Syria to limit the activities of the 10 factions. We are confident that the noble countries and governments will not succumb to such pressure and blackmail and that the Muslim nations will continue to support the struggling Islamic movements of Palestine. [Khamehyar] In your interview with the Beirut newspaper AL-DIYAR, you announced that a conference would be convened with the extensive participation of Islamic groups and factions so that a strategic stance for combating this plot could be adopted. In view of the fact that a conference like this was convened last year, what are your expectations of this kind of conference? [Ghawshah] When I was interviewed by AL-DIYAR newspaper, I was very aware that, in cooperation with the 10 Palestinian factions, Hamas would be able to establish a national and Islamic coalition for counteracting the Gaza-Jericho accord. It was suggested that the conference should be held in Yemen or Syria, but it was postponed after some of the groups reviewed their decisions. We are optimistic that we can eliminate the obstacles in the near future and that, under the aegis of our common denominators, we will be able to attain complete cohesion and coordination. I believe that this conference will be extremely important. In this manner, we will be able to prove to the world that the Palestinian nation is alive and can elect the leadership it wants. [Khamehyar] Last week, King Husayn presented the Jordanian parliament with a plan to normalize relations with Israel, and the deputies unanimously supported this plan. If this plan is approved, will your position in Jordan be endangered? [Ghawshah] Perhaps a majority of the deputies who were recently elected to the parliament agree with this plan, but one must await the outcome of the debates over the qualifications of these deputies. Don't forget that there is intense opposition to the normalization of relations with the Zionist regime among the people and the parliament of that country. Half of the people in Jordan are Palestinians, and recent polls prove that most of the people are opposed to the Gaza-Jericho accord. We are aware that the Jordanian regime has accepted this accord because of pressure from the United States. The Jordanians initially declared their opposition to the accord. But when Clinton's message, which mentioned economic pressure, reached the hands of the Jordanian officials, Jordan agreed to accept the accord. Let us not forget that the Gaza-Jericho accord also threatens the interests of Jordan, which has been referred to as the substitute homeland for Palestine and as the ultimate homeland of the Palestinians, and the people are very aware of these threats. What is your opinion of the recent letters and guidance that Hamas leader Shaykh Ahmad Yasin sent from prison? He has agreed to participate in the legislative body that will be established after the elections. What is your appraisal of the matter? [Ghawshah] We have received three letters from Shaykh Ahmad Yasin that were sent from prison. In the first letter, he gave the details of his meeting with Israeli legislator Talab al-Sani' [name as published]. In the second, he listed guidance for the Hamas forces and combatants. The third letter--which has generated a great deal of controversy--dealt with the current situation, the Gaza-Jericho accord, the PLO, and the fate of the Palestine issue. In this letter, Shaykh Yasin stressed that the Gaza-Jericho accord is an accord of degradation and surrender and that the PLO has destroyed the hopes and aspirations of the Palestinian nation. He refers to the so-called legislative body and accepts participation in elections. It is for this reason that this letter has plunged us into doubt and ambivalence. Everyone is aware that Ahmad Yasin rejects autonomy and that he is paralyzed and cannot write letters. He needs another person to write what he dictates. The Hamas councils are currently investigating the letters to establish their authenticity.
