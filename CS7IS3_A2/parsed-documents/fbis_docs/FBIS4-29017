FBIS4-29017 "dreas115_d_94011" FBIS-EAS-94-115 Daily Report 15 Jun 1994 South Korea KYODO Cited on IAEA Inspection in DPRK KYODO Cited on IAEA Inspection in DPRK SK1506100894 Seoul KBS-1 Radio Network in Korean 0900 GMT 15 Jun 94 SK1506100894 Seoul KBS-1 Radio Network Korean BFN [Text] KYODO News Agency reported on 15 June from New York that regardless of the official notification to the United States on its withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], North Korea is continuing to recognize nuclear inspection activities, such as the work to measure and regulate inspection machines by the two inspectors dispatched from the IAEA. Quoting a U.S. Government official, KYODO News Agency reported that North Korea had hinted that it would expel the inspectors when it declared its withdrawal from the IAEA, but it seems that North Korea allowed inspection activities by the IAEA inspectors to avoid strong measures against the North by the international community, such as the strengthening of economic sanctions by the UN Security Council. This official also said it is important that the inspectors carry out activities, not that they are still in North Korea. He hinted that the content of the sanction resolution against the North will be influenced if the inspectors are expelled. He also said that as long as North Korea allows the inspectors to continue inspection activities, sanctions by the UN Security Council will not be strengthened abruptly. In particular, he said that the withdrawal from the IAEA and the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] by North Korea are significantly different, and emphasized that it is necessary for North Korea to implement the requirements of the NPT. Thus, he did not attach much importance to the fact that North Korea withdrew from the IAEA.
