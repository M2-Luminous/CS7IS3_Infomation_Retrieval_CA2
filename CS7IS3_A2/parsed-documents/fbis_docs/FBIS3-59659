Reportedly, it can be used as the light source for projection equipment, and in the stepper (successive movement type reduction projection equipment) by which 64 Mbit semiconductors and beyond will be mass produced. So far, Toshiba has been successful in heightening the output up to a maximum of 8 watts, and has raised the exposure efficiency, which has been a weak point with excimer lasers, by increasing the number of pulses that can be irradiated per second by about 50%. Currently, ultraviolet light is used for the light source of steppers which mass produce 16 Mbit DRAMS. However, because ultra fine circuit patterns are required when entering the next generation of semiconductors, progress is being made in the development of light sources using excimer lasers and X-rays which put out ultraviolet light with even shorter wavelengths. Because excimer lasers put out ultraviolet light, already existing production processes can be used, and the equipment can be made compact. These lasers are hopeful candidates for the next generation light sources, but they have been found to have problems in terms of mass production because of the output of the laser, the frequency that is irradiated, and the deterioration of equipment. Toshiba's new equipment incorporates a resonator which combines a mirror and an element that narrows the wavelength by making a narrow band region, and thus the output of the laser has been heightened to about twice that of conventional units while preserving the quality. Additionally, the exposure time can be shortened by being able to irradiate at a maximum frequency of 600 times per second. Moreover, a means using a prism was adopted to put only one part of the laser output in the resonator, and this delays the deterioration of the element within the resonator. As a result, the longevity of the element that makes the narrow band region can be extended 10 times or more, the frequency and cost of replacement are reduced, and the operational efficiency of the stepper can be improved. The device has a compact size with a width of 150 cm, a height 160 cm, and a depth of 50 cm. The device developed is effective as a light source for steppers with a design specification of from 0.35 &mgr;m to 0.15 &mgr;m for use in 1 Gbit DRAMs.
