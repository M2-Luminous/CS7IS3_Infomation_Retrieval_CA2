Akayev recognized that the main motives for emigration were socio-political. In particular, the introduction of Kirghiz as the state language had pushed Russians out of many professional spheres. He also did not deny cases of discrimination in the entrepreneurial sphere and displays of everyday nationalism. In Akayev's view, the outflow of experts from the Republic is causing irreparable damage to the republic's economy. Whereas in 1990 Russians accounted for more than 21 percent of the population, in four years their number has decreased to 17 percent.
