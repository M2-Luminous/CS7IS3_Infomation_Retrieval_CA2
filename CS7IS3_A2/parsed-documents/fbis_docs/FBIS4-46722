It is clear to everyone that the foreign army had to withdraw unconditionally and without any reservations. Yet in concrete politics, the Latvians had to accommodate themselves to the realities and to make concessions to Russia. Unlike in Lithuania's case, from where the Russian army was withdrawn without any treaty, and the only legal document was the withdrawal schedule, Latvia was forced to sign a treaty. Moreover, it will have to assume obligations in accordance with the protocol on social guarantees to the retired Russian military personnel, who had become particularly fond of Latvia. It is not by accident that the Latvians, who yearn for the quickest possible disappearance of the former empire's legacy from their land, are now experiencing a moral, psychological injury, even a humiliation, as they are compelled to take care also of the uninvited intruders. Even after the army's withdrawal by the end of August, a malignant ulcer will remain for five and a half years on Latvia's land -- the Russian-controlled radar station at Skrunda. Could Latvia have avoided the concessions, relying only on "justice and law?" Hardly. Envious of the Lithuanians, the Latvians themselves recognize that they had missed the best time to seek the army's withdrawal, because Russia's political attitudes toward the Baltic countries have undergone a distinct change during the last year, with the strengthening of the imperial and nationalistic tendencies. By the way, they might become a serious obstacle to the ratification of this treaty in the State Duma. There is no shortage of people there who want the Russian soldiers never to leave the so-called "near abroad" or wish them to remain there at least symbolically, so that in the future they can stage a full return. Latvia's concessions (Russia has practically made no concessions) may become a bad precedent for the negotiations between Estonia and Russia. Estonia is facing the same pressing problems as Latvia (they differ only in their proportions). Therefore Estonians can hardly congratulate the Latvians, who have left them behind in the negotiations with Russia. The tone of the latter toward Estonia is becoming more and more severe; Russia's representatives are stating categorically that the remaining military units will not be withdrawn unless a treaty is signed and Estonia obligates itself to provide social guarantees for retired military personnel. It goes without saying that all these problems and the new strategy in the relations with Russia had to be a subject of discussions yesterday at Jurmala, where a meeting of the presidents of the three Baltic countries took place. The unusual thing about this meeting was its confidential character, with even the closest advisers absent. Until now, the policies of the Baltic countries were being coordinated publicly; therefore, the emergence of confidentiality indicates the existence of certain problems, which are to be resolved in a closed circle. The Russian army was withdrawn from Lithuania one year earlier than it will be evacuated from Latvia. As we rejoice about that fact, we rarely pose to ourselves a natural question -- why? Obviously, it did not happen because the Kremlin is especially fond of the Lithuanians and has less love to spare for the Latvians and the Estonians. J. Paleckis, the President's adviser on international questions, mentioned to LIETUVOS RYTAS several factors that "contributed to an earlier withdrawal." First, Lithuania and Russia had signed a time-table for withdrawal already in the fall of 1992. However, Lithuania refused to sign a prepared treaty, which made the chairman of the Supreme Council, V. Landsbergis, feel that he was cheated. (Subsequently, the forces of the opposition in Lithuania asserted unanimously that there was no need whatsoever for such a treaty.) Second, the international opinion, and in particular that of the West, supported the just demands of the Baltic countries (but this was equally applicable to Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia). Third, Lithuania's moderate position and the search for dialogue, without responding to the psychological warfare that was initiated by Russia. And fourth, as in sports, there was no shortage of luck. Otherwise, the Russian army might have remained symbolically, at least. A more astute individual would probably not be satisfied with such reasoning. The factors mentioned above might appear as only the external (and smaller) tip of the iceberg, protruding above the water line. Time may reveal much more complex processes that took place behind the scenes of negotiations for the army's withdrawal, in the corridors of the Kremlin, the Russian Ministry of Defense, the General Staff, and the Western capitals. It is obvious already that the emphatically good relations between the former minister of national defense, A. Butkevicius, and the Russian military leadership also contributed significantly to Lithuania's success. The scandal, which was caused when certain circumstances of the purchase of weapons for the Lithuanian army came to light, indicates that these relations were also based on mutual material advantage. It appears that the Latvians and the Estonians did not have such clever ministers and businessmen. Perhaps this is why a foreign army still remains in their countries?
