FR941125-0-00005 FR941125-0-00003 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Under the current OCC minimum capital requirements (leverage ratio) and the risk-based capital guidelines set forth at 12 CFR part 3 appendix A, section 1(c)(7), a major component of Tier 1 capital is common stockholders' equity. Common stockholders' equity currently includes: (1) common stock, (2) common stock surplus, (3) undivided profits, (4) capital reserves, (5) adjustments for the cumulative effect of foreign currency translation, and (6) net unrealized losses on noncurrent marketable equity securities. The net unrealized losses are those recorded under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 12, ``Accounting for Certain Marketable Securities'' (FAS 12). FAS 115 In May 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FAS 115. This statement superseded FAS 12. FAS 115 required that all securities be grouped into one of three classifications: held-to-maturity, trading, or available-for-sale. Most significantly, FAS 115 established net unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale securities as a new component of common stockholders' equity. FAS 115 defines available-for-sale securities as those securities that a bank does not have the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity, and does not intend to trade actively as part of its trading account. FAS 115 increases the number of securities that banks must account for at market value. Consequently, numerous securities previously reported by banks at amortized cost will now be reported at their market value. In August 1993, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) announced the adoption of FAS 115 for regulatory reporting purposes, effective January 1, 1994. Accordingly, all national banks follow FAS 115 for reporting purposes. Proposal On April 18, 1994, the OCC proposed to adopt FAS 115 for regulatory capital purposes (59 FR 18328, April 18, 1994). The other Federal banking agencies published similar proposals to adopt FAS 115 for regulatory capital purposes. See 58 FR 68563 (December 28, 1993) (Federal Reserve Board); 58 FR 68781 (December 29, 1993) (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation); 59 FR 32143 (June 22, 1994) (Office of Thrift Supervision). The OCC issued the proposal to promote greater consistency of regulatory capital rules with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). At the same time, the OCC wanted to understand the industry sentiment regarding the costs and benefits of adopting FAS 115, and to determine banks' assessment of their ability to manage the potential volatility in regulatory capital.
