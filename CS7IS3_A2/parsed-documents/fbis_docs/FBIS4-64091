In addition to the fact that it was the longest in the entire history of the present corps of deputies (with intermissions it lasted about five months) it adopted very important decisions. Our correspondent talks about the results of the session's work with Mechyslaw Hryb, chairman of the Belarusian Parliament. [Gulyayev] The start of this year was marked by the aggravation of the situation in the republic. As a result the 13th session of the Supreme Soviet dismissed its chairman, Stanislav Shushkevich, and elected you. Forecasts for the development of events at the time were very unreassuring. Various political forces demanded the dissolution of the Supreme Soviet as being unable to make the decisions the republic needed. But then suddenly the same Supreme Soviet adopted the republic's constitution and a whole series of very important documents. What happened? [Hryb] What should have happened. The chairman of the Supreme Soviet, elected to the post through the will of the majority of deputies, set himself against that majority. In this situation there could be no systematic, consistent work. It is absolutely natural that the majority decided to relieve him of his post. But after the replacement of the leadership we managed to set up normal, consistent work. As a result of which documents were adopted that were truly fateful for the republic -- primarily the Republic of Belarus Constitution. The state's system was defined as a presidential republic and we managed to single out the priority of citizens' rights over the state. All this is extraordinarily important! Let's think about it: After the collapse of the former structures Belarus was left in fact without a power. The grassroots did not obey the upper echelons, the upper echelons paid no attention to the grassroots, mostly resolving their own problems. But now that there is a new constitution and a law has been adopted on the presidential elections and their date has been set -- at any rate we can now see the path along which we must travel. We will elect the head of state and accept his oath and approve the makeup of the government.... That is the process of creating an effective power has begun. Without losing control of the country. [Gulyayev] Mechyslaw Ivanovich, can one say today that understanding has finally been reached between the branches of power? After all no effectiveness will be achieved otherwise.... [Hryb] I think I can boldly assert that there has been consolidation. The main thing is that we have common ideas of the paths for Belarus' development and a common orientation toward the East. Moreover, the Supreme Soviet has given the government the powers it has always sought. Moreover, the Supreme Soviet intends to render real aid to the government in resolving the most diverse questions. For instance, there was an opinion that the parliamentarians should not be involved with the economy. We broke with that tradition and recently adopted a presidium decree on backing up the sowing campaign. Perhaps this decree has not worked completely but our peasants were provided with fuel and seeds this year.... And virtually all apart from mineral fertilizers were supplied in the necessary quantity. The presidium has now examined the question of housing cooperative construction. The construction workers do not have the funds to finish what they have begun, nor do people have the funds to pay for what has been constructed. But we have found ways of resolving this problem. That is the situation is as follows: We are trying to address the problem, not to avoid it. At a time when the former Supreme Soviet leadership was saying: The economy is not our business. But after all, people do not care who helps them live better -- it is just important to help! And in that sense we are cooperating and are prepared to continue to cooperate with the executive power. But of course as long as the government does not avoid its powers or exceed them.... [Gulyayev] You said you are united with the government in your orientation toward the East. Here you cannot avoid the popular question of the ruble zone.... [Hryb] In principle I approve this agreement, only I propose changing the formulation of some articles. Including the fifth and eights -- changing them so that it is not necessary to make changes to our constitution which has only just been born. The Supreme Soviet may not make such changes and there is no need for it. I talked with Boris Yeltsin and Viktor Chernomyrdin at the conference of heads of state. They agree that it is possible to elaborate a text acceptable to both sides. But as a whole, I repeat, I approve and support this very good and in my view sensible step which apart from anything else should help to stabilize the situation in the republic. [Gulyayev] But today it is also influenced by the election campaign.... [Hryb] Yes, 19 initiative groups from 19 contenders have already been registered. I do not know whether many of them will collect the necessary number of votes to register as a candidate. But I think that we will get into the Guinness Book of Records for the number of contenders for the top state post. And a serious struggle is already under way. Among the candidates there will probably be people who will not use the most civilized methods. At any rate attempts to set one category of the population on another already exist. And the situation could undoubtedly be aggravated. Although in our view there are no prerequisites for events to assume an uncontrollable nature. In conclusion allow me to wish your readers the very best. May those who have not yet completed it carry out the sowing campaign successfully. So that later there is something to harvest from the fields -- in Belarus and in Russia, wherever the farmer puts seed into the ground. And, most important, I wish you stability in your life! So that the peasant can finally do his noble job in peace.
