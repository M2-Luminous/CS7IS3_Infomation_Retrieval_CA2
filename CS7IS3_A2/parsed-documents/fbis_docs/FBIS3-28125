Japan is expected to import as much as two million tons of rice, including supplies from the United States and Thailand, to make up for a shortage resulting from the worst postwar harvest in 1993. A major rice wholesaler in Yokohama said Thai rice will be sold at 300 to 320 yen per kilogram, about half the price of domestic rice. Californian rice will sell for about 408 yen per kilogram. The government is expected to start delivering Californian rice to wholesalers around February 10. Yamatane Corp., a leading rice wholesaler, said it will sell imported rice without blending it with domestic rice, giving consumers a chance to taste a variety of rice.
