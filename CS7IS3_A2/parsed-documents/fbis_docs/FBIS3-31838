The UNHCR is also planning to reestablish its permanent office in the city, after moving it to Medjugorje last year when fighting between HVO [Croatian Defense Council] Croat forces and the Moslem-led Bosnian government army made the place too dangerous, UNHCR spokesman Ron Redmond told AFP. The office, staffed by five foreigners and about 20 local people, should be set up in the Croat-controlled west of Mostar, and "we would hope to have access to the east," said Redmond. The eastern Moslem enclave has been under constant Croat fire for the last 10 months and the UNHCR's information chief Sylvana Foa recently described the situation there as "worse than Sarajevo ... 55,000 people live there like rats, without water, electricity or sanitation," she said. In Rome, the foreign ministry announced Thursday that the first humanitarian aid convoy since the weekend's Sarajevo ceasefire had arrived at Mostar. Four trucks, escorted by the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR), arrived Wednesday with some 30 tonnes of food, clothing and medicine, it said. Redmond said the ceasefire, due to take effect Friday noon (1100 GMT), was "a good sign" which could "change a lot for the drivers who risk their lives under the shelling and snipers (...) allow setting up a water purification unit taken there last week and be of great help for the mobile hospital." According to UNPROFOR, about 48 people died from Croat shelling during the week of February 11 to 19 alone.
