As you complete your third week in office, what do you think the main challenge for your government will be? [Calderon Sol] The main challenge I face is national reconstruction -- the reconstruction of the country. After overcoming the violence and destruction of the war, we must now move into the phase of rebuilding the nation. This does not only include the material reconstruction effort, but also the moral and spiritual reconstruction. We must affirm the state of law, guarantee justice, and ensure the authority of the law. We must seek mutual respect among all people. We have just been through 12 long years of institutionalized violence in this country, and therefore our efforts must be directed at changing the people's ideas, conceptions, and attitudes toward effective law enforcement. This is an enormous task, but we are sure we will be successful in rebuilding El Salvador, both physically and morally. [Zabludovsky] You promised to fulfill the peace agreements to the letter. Now that there is a new timetable, how do you expect to deal with the situation? [Calderon Sol] President Cristiani wanted to clear his desk, as he put it, before he left office, and therefore he rescheduled the agreements in order to have specific dates for what was still pending. The new timetable is very specific, and I will comply with it to the letter. It is my political determination to complete the peace process. The peace agreements are truly a national commitment, and I am willing to meet that commitment faithfully. The rescheduling will make it easier to comply within the new deadlines. We have said time and time again that we will fulfill the peace agreements, because they ensure the social peace and political stability that we long for in El Salvador. [Zabludovsky] The civil war caused thousands of deaths and brought destruction and bitterness. What do you think needs to be done in El Salvador to prevent another civil war? [Calderon Sol] Our civil war had so very much to do with the international situation. Our war became an international affair. Please remember that El Salvador, as was true for the rest of Central America, lived the end of the Cold War and the East-West struggle. Remember that El Salvador became a bastion of Cuban aggression in Central America. This is a tangible, clear, and undeniable fact demonstrated by the shipments of weapons -- thousands of tons of them -- that flowed into Central America during the bipolar Cold War. Thank goodness all this is over now. This, of course, does not mean there were no other problems. There are problems even now, and there will always be problems, such as poverty, for example. Poverty is worse now than in the past, because the war brought more poverty with it. Today's challenge is to rebuild, produce, and develop the nation while promoting human advancement. That is what lies ahead. Now that the war is behind us and the pain is gone, let us make El Salvador that country we all dream and hope for. [Zabludovsky] Would you like to add anything more, Mr. President? [Calderon Sol] Mr. Zabludovsky, it is a real pleasure to chat with you, especially knowing that thousands of Salvadorans are watching your program, and not only in Mexico -- that wonderful country of yours -- but also in the United States, Canada, and so many other countries in which this prestigious program is broadcast. It is truly a pleasure to address the thousands of Salvadorans who live abroad and work day and night to provide for their families and send a little something home to build a better future for El Salvador. Soon all of these families will be reunited. Let me say this to the thousands Salvadorans living away from the fatherland: We are working to allow you to come home to a new El Salvador. Let me also say that you have a government and a president who think about you all of the time, hoping for the reunification of the Salvadoran family.
