FR941004-1-00082 FR941004-1-00018 Paragraph (a)(3) clarifies that some requirements in §1357 apply only to States, some apply only to Indian tribes, and some apply to both as specified. Overall, paragraph (a) is based on section 432 of the Act (subpart 2) which requires States and eligible Indian tribes to submit a five-year plan for family preservation and family support services. It is also based on section 422 of the Act (subpart 1) which requires a State plan for child welfare services. We elected to consolidate the planning and reporting requirements for the two title IV&hyph;B programs for several reasons. Child welfare services and family preservation and family support services are both a part of the child and family services continuum; both programs are administered by the same agency and address common problems of the same population of children and families. In addition, focus group participants urged us to consolidate planning, application requirements, and program reporting, where possible. Currently under subpart 1, States and Indian tribes may submit their child welfare services plan at one, two, or three year intervals. Combining the planning and reporting requirements for subparts 1 and 2 will reduce the number of plans and, consequently, the administrative burden. More importantly, one comprehensive plan will assist both States and Indian tribes to plan for and make more effective use of resources and develop a more integrated, coordinated, and family-focused service system. We considered requiring States to consolidate three additional programs in the CFSP_the Independent Living Program (ILP) under title IV&hyph;E, section 477; and the two child abuse and neglect formula grant programs under the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA): Part I (Basic State grants) and Part II (Medical Neglect/Disabled Infants State grants) (sections 107(a) and 107(g) of CAPTA). However, although the ILP and the CAPTA programs are both a part of the State's child and family services continuum, and their inclusion in the CFSP would reinforce and strengthen the comprehensiveness and usefulness of the CFSP, the current statutory and administrative requirements in these three programs are barriers to consolidation at this point. We may propose the inclusion of additional programs in the CFSP at a future date. Instead, paragraph (a)(2) proposes to require that the State's CFSP must contain the same descriptive services information on the ILP and the two CAPTA formula grant programs as on other child and family services. (See 45 CFR 1357.15(n)) We believe that the inclusion of this information will facilitate ongoing coordination, consultation, and joint planning efforts among these programs and assist States to move toward a more comprehensive service delivery system. In addition, representatives of the ILP and CAPTA programs will be involved in the development and implementation of the CFSP, e.g., the consultation, and other processes leading to the development of goals and objectives and the required description of services in the plan. (See paragraph (l) of this section.) Although there are barriers to requiring the ILP in the plan, there is nothing to prohibit a State from including in the CFSP the information needed to receive annual ILP funding. Section 477 of the Act requires that the annual ILP application be submitted prior to February 1. As long as this date is met, States may submit the required program and fiscal information and assurances either in the CFSP or by the statutory due date. For example, States could submit information for the FY 1996 ILP application either as a part of the FY 1995 CFSP (due June 30, 1995) or by January 31, 1996. If a State elects to consolidate the ILP application information into the CFSP, funding for the independent living program will not be withheld in the event that a State's CFSP is not approved for reasons unrelated to the ILP program. States and Indian tribes may, and are encouraged to, include additional child and family services programs in the CFSP, at their option. (See 45 CFR 100.12.) Section 1357.15(b)␣Eligibility for Funds Paragraph (b) specifies the eligibility requirements for receipt of funds under title IV&hyph;B, subparts 1 and 2. Paragraph (b)(1) requires that, in order to receive FY 1995 title IV&hyph;B funding, States and Indian tribes must submit for approval a five-year Child and Family Services Plan (CFSP). In order to receive funding in subsequent years, States and Indian tribes must submit for approval an Annual Progress and Services Report that meets the statutory and regulatory requirements of title IV&hyph;B, subparts 1 and 2. Assuming that Congress appropriates the necessary funds, FY 1995 funds will be available when the CFSP has been submitted and is approved; FY 1996 funds will be available in FY 1996 based on the projected FY 1996 services information included in the CFSP. FY 1997 funds will be available in FY 1997 based on the Annual Progress and Services Report due to ACF June 30, 1996.
