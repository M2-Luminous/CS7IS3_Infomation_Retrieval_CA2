There was artillery fire at approximately 1300 local (1930 GMT) near the garrison of the 31st Military Zone, which, according to reports that have been neither confirmed nor denied by the Army, has been attacked by rebels. A caravan of the "All Rights For All" Organizations Network tried to advance toward Tenejapa, and when the military prevented their advance in the place known as La Garita, explosions were heard in the bush. In the morning, another caravan of the Network tried to go to Ocosingo, Altamirano, and Oxchuc, where there have been clashes between guerrilla and regular forces, but the soldiers prohibited the trip. In both cases, personnel in charge of the road blocks said traffic was not allowed through because rebel groups are in the area and the Army wants to be able to guarantee safety and tranquillity before opening the roads. Human rights groups and the media have protested the fact that for four days there have been road blocks on the access routes to the conflict area, on the road to Comitan, on the road from Palenque to Ocosingo, and on other roads where there is supposedly a rebel presence. Some reporters believe the authorities have "cordoned off the media" while they carry out a "clean-up operation at the combat sites," because so far the effects of the bombing and shelling by the military over the last four days is still unknown. Saturday was apparently a calm day as no shelling or rocket explosions were heard, nor were there reports of clashes between the Armed Forces and the Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN), which declared war on the Army on 1 January.
