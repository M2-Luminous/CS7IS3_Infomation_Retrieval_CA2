Regulatory areas and districts are defined at §672.2. 2. Pollock is apportioned to three statistical areas in the combined Western/Central Regulatory Area (Table 3), each of which is further divided into equal quarterly allowances. In the Eastern Regulatory Area, pollock is not divided into quarterly allowances. 3. Pacific cod is allocated 90 percent to the inshore, and 10 percent to the offshore component. Component allowances are shown in Table 4. 4. ``Deep water flatfish'' means Dover sole and Greenland turbot. Rex sole is a separate target species beginning with the 1994 fishing year. 5. ``Shallow water flatfish'' means flatfish not including ``deep water flatfish,'' flathead sole, rex sole, or arrowtooth flounder. 6. Sablefish is allocated to trawl and hook-and-line gears (Table 2). 7. ``Pacific ocean perch'' means Sebastes alutus . 8. ``Shortraker/rougheye rockfish'' means Sebastes borealis (shortraker) and S. aleutianus (rougheye). 9. ``Other rockfish'' in the Western and Central Regulatory Areas and in the West Yakutat District means slope rockfish and demersal shelf rockfish. The category ``other rockfish'' in the Southeast Outside District means Slope rockfish. 10. ``Slope rockfish'' means Sebastes aurora (aurora), S. melanostomus (blackgill), S. paucispinis (bocaccio), S. goodei (chilipepper), S. crameri (darkblotch), S. elongatus (greenstriped), S. variegates (harlequin), S. wilsoni (pygmy), S. proriger (redstripe), S. zacentrus (sharpchin), S. jordani (shortbelly), S. brevispinis (silvergrey), S. diploproa (splitnose), S. saxicola (stripetail), S. miniatus (vermilion), and S. reedi (yellowmouth). 11. ``Demersal shelf rockfish'' means Sebastes pinniger (canary), S. nebulosus (china), S. caurinus (copper), S. maliger (quillback), S. babcocki (redbanded), S. helvomaculatus (rosethorn), S. nigrocinctus (tiger), and S. ruberrimus (yelloweye). 12. ``Northern rockfish'' means Sebastes polyspinis . 13. ``Pelagic shelf rockfish'' means Sebastes melanops (black), S. mystinus (blue), S. ciliatus (dusky), S. entomelas (widow), and S. flavidus (yellowtail). 14. Atka mackerel is a separate target species beginning in 1994. ``Other species'' means sculpins, sharks, skates, eulachon, smelts, capelin, squid, and octopus. The TAC for ``other species'' equals 5 percent of the TACs of target species. 15. N/A means not applicable. 16. The total ABC is the sum of the ABCs for target species.
