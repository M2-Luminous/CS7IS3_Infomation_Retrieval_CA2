Endara issued a decree stating that the charges against Diaz Herrera were for acts of subversion and opposition to the military dictatorship of former General Manuel Antonio Noriega, acts which, "far from being dishonorable under the current democracy," should be described as "meritorious." Diaz Herrera, who was pardoned along with seven other persons, including his nephew Zoroel, had been sentenced by a Panamanian court on 22 December 1987 to five years in prison. The former chief of staff of the defunct Defense Forces left for Venezuela following a pardon issued on 24 December 1987 by former President Eric Arturo Delvalle. After living in Caracas for a time, Diaz Herrera moved to Argentina, where he currently resides.
