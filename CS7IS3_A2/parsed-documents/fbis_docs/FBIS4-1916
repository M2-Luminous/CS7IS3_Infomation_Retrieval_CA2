This year, losses incurred by enterprises in Chongqing have shown a tendency to increase further. The Federation of Trade Unions in Chongqing is trying to stabilize the feelings of workers in enterprises that are operating in the red, and is organizing workers to increase production and carry out self-salvation in order to free the enterprises from the mire of business losses. Chongqing is one of the six largest old industrial bases in China. As its industrial structure was not adjusted across the board for a long time, the state-owned enterprises there failed to achieve satisfactory economic results, and an increasing number of such enterprises incurred business losses. According to the data offered by the department concerned in the city, in January this year, 58.96 percent of the state-owned enterprises in Chongqing incurred losses, and the proportion increased to 66.94 percent in February, with total losses in the city amounting to 140 million yuan. The industrial economy there once again faced the danger of decline. This year, Chongqing put forward the guideline of "combining assistance with elimination, taking both radical and stopgap measures, enlivening assets, and making breakthroughs in various fields" so as to change the loss-incurring situation. It planned to make a breakthrough by reforming the property rights system. Zhang Xuanyuan, chairman of the city's federation of trade unions, said at a recent meeting on halting business losses that trade unions in the city should take an active part in the work of transforming the enterprise operation system, and should sign joint-guarantee contracts with the enterprise management and the government departments concerned in order to perform their duties in the course of halting business losses. Zhang Xuanyuan said: The trade unions should serve the purpose of raising the enterprises' competitive power in the market by means of organizing various types of labor emulation and encouraging them to raise rationalization proposals. They should help promote technological progress in the enterprises through structural adjustment, and should carry out activities of supporting the poor by means of science and technology. Zhang Xuanyuan stressed, in particular, that the trade unions must organize workers to carry out self-salvation through increased production, thus reducing the burdens on enterprises and freeing enterprises from their predicament as soon as possible.
