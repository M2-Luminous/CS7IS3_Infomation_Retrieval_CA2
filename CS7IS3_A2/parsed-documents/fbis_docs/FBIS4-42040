The aim of the exercises is to hold command and staff training in the Republic's Army. It should be added that the government's resolution on the progress of the armed forces reform was published in the local press today. The resolution notes that the military units have not sufficiently mastered combat in the mountains and that different kinds of armed forces do not interact well. The storage of armaments also has problems. The government suggested that the Defense Ministry should elaborate a program of state measures on strengthening defense, implementation of the reform of the armed forces in the coming two years and retaining officers in the army, and sumbit this program for the government's consideration.
