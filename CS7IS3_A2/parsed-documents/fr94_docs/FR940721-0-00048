FR940721-0-00048 FR940721-0-00014 (3) The country of origin of the equipment (treating the U.S. and Canada together); (4) For equipment that may be used in an engine or transmission, the country of origin of the equipment (separating the U.S. and Canada). A supplier of engines and transmissions is, in addition to the above requirements, required to provide, at the request of the vehicle manufacturer, the country of origin for each engine or transmission it supplies to the manufacturer, determined as follows: The country in which the greatest percentage, by value (using the total cost of equipment to the engine or transmission supplier, while excluding the cost of final assembly labor), was added to the engine or transmission. Both outside and allied suppliers that directly supply equipment to vehicle manufacturers are required to provide the specified information directly to the vehicle manufacturers, in the form of a certification. Outside suppliers that directly supply to allied suppliers are required to provide the specified information and certification directly to the allied suppliers. Suppliers are also required to maintain records of the information used to compile the information provided to the manufacturers and outside suppliers. The requirements apply only to suppliers which supply directly to the vehicle manufacturer or to an allied supplier. No requirements are imposed on suppliers earlier in the chain, e.g. , a company which supplies an item of equipment to an outside supplier which then supplies it to a vehicle manufacturer. C. Dealers of Passenger Motor Vehicles Dealers are required to maintain the label on each vehicle until the vehicle is sold to a consumer. D. First Year Requirements For model year 1995 vehicles and model year 1996 vehicles which are offered for sale to ultimate purchasers before June 1, 1995, manufacturers and suppliers may, instead of following the detailed calculation procedures set forth in this new regulation, use procedures that they expect, in good faith, to yield similar results. IV. Agency Rationale and Response to Comments A. Major Issues Concerning Information on the Label In this section of the preamble, NHTSA presents its analysis of the major issues and comments concerning the information on the label, including, but not limited to, ones relating to what information is provided on the label and the wording of the label, how manufacturers must calculate the specified information, and how suppliers are to make the necessary determinations concerning the origin of the equipment they supply. For ease of comparison with the proposed regulation, the discussion of issues is generally organized according to the sections of the proposed regulation to which they relate. The agency notes that in some cases the cited sections are relevant not only to the major issues concerning the information on the label, but also to other issues. The other issues are discussed elsewhere in the preamble. 1. Definitions (Section 583.4) The definitions section prescribes the meaning of terms and concepts which are used throughout the content labeling regulation. As discussed below, some of the terms and concepts have a significant effect on the information to be provided on the label, and some of the proposed definitions were controversial with many commenters. a. Carline. Section 210(b) specifies that U.S./Canadian parts content and major sources of foreign parts content (items one and two on the label) are determined on a ``carline'' basis, instead of for each individual vehicle. Section 210(f) defines carline as meaning a name denoting a group of vehicles which has a degree of commonality in construction (e.g., body, chassis), and not considering any level of decor or opulence and not generally distinguished by such characteristics as roof line, number of doors, seats, or windows, except for light duty trucks. That section also provides that light duty trucks are considered to be different carlines than passenger cars. NHTSA addressed a number of issues in the NPRM concerning whether the meaning of carline should be further clarified by regulation. One significant issue was whether carline should encompass vehicles assembled in different countries. At present, there are a number of vehicle models that are assembled in the U.S. and/or Canada and in other countries. The agency tentatively concluded that country of final assembly should not be considered in making carline determinations, since section 210 specifies that carline determinations are to be made based on degree of commonality in construction. The agency noted that determining carlines on the basis of country of assembly appears inconsistent with this statutory definition since identical cars, i.e. , ones with total commonality in construction, could be placed in different carlines. NHTSA also noted that such a result might result in consumer confusion. For example, if a consumer ordered a car identical to one for which he or she had taken a test drive, the consumer would find it very odd if the car he or she received had a label indicating that it was in a different carline. NHTSA recognized, however, that additional subdivision of carlines by country of manufacture would result in content labeling information that is more representative of the individually labeled vehicles. The agency requested comments on a possible requirement for manufacturers to include additional information on the label for carlines assembled in more than one country, such as a statement of the U.S./Canadian parts content and major foreign sources of that portion of the carline produced in a given country. NHTSA also requested comments on the possibility of differentiating carlines by engine type, whether light trucks should be separated into different carlines depending on whether they are 2-wheel drive or 4-wheel drive, and on whether any other distinctions should be specified for making carline determinations. NHTSA received numerous comments concerning the definition of carline. In the discussion which follows, the agency will first address comments concerning the issue of whether ``carline'' should encompass vehicles assembled in different countries, and the related issue of a possible requirement for manufacturers to include additional information on the label for carlines assembled in more than one country. The agency will then discuss other issues related to the definition of carline.
