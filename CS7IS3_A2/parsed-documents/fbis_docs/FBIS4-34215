Alarcon said the meeting -- requested by the United States and scheduled for December in Miami, Florida -- is "a source of concern" because there have been no consultations to establish a date, agenda, and possible resolutions for the meeting. This failure to establish the content of the meeting "deserves the deepest thought," said Alarcon, who was a member of the Cuban delegation to the Fourth Ibero-American Summit of Heads of State and Government, which ended yesterday in Cartagena de Indias. The former Cuban foreign minister said the U.S. Government talks "of a new system of relations regarding security, which would not be based on troops and military bases," and also of having "good intentions where trade is concerned." "The fact that Cuba and Haiti will not attend the hemispheric meeting will not undermine its merits, if something like this is accomplished," he said. However, "if this is not the case, there might be cause for even greater concern." The president of the Cuban National Assembly of the Peoples Government told reporters he has reservations because the summons to the meeting comes "from the place that has summoned the countries of the region that have hidden agendas." In my opinion the presence of U.S. OAS Ambassador Harriet Babbit at the Fourth Ibero-American Summit was disadvantageous because the forum has thus far abstained from granting observer status to third country governments. "Babbit is involved in the organization of the Miami Summit for purposes that may differ from the original plan," he said. Alarcon explained that due to this situation Cuban President Fidel Castro expressed in his speech at the Fourth Ibero-American Summit on Tuesday, "certain ideas which we believe Latin America should discuss" at the Miami meeting. Castro denied that Cuba will oppose the Summit of the Americas, adding that "we are pleased that our neighboring countries of Latin America and the Caribbean can firmly and vigorously defend our peoples' interest at that meeting." The Cuban leader remains in Cartagena de Indias -- a port on Colombia's Caribbean coast, 1,200 km north of Bogota -- where he plans to hold bilateral meetings on Thursday with other regional leaders.
