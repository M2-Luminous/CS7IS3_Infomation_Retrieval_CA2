New Delhi believes that nuclear nonproliferation must be universal, comprehensive and nondiscriminatory. The sources said the prime minister had categorically stated this position in his recent address to the Army commanders conference. They were reacting to press reports that the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] leader, Mr. Atal Behari Vajpayee, expressed the view that the prime minister's observations over the issue needs clarification. The sources said Mr. Narasimha Rao in his speech made it clear that any attempt to restrict India's nuclear option will be unacceptable and unrealistic in view of Pakistan having acquired nuclear weapon capability. There is also proliferation of such weapons recently.
