It is believed that this meeting of the foreign ministers of China and the United States will produce results in improving bilateral relations and alleviating some contradictions between the two countries. In Washington, talking about his visit to Asia, U.S. Secretary of State Christopher said that in September last year, President Bill Clinton had instructed him to develop relations with China in a broader way. In November, while attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, the Chinese President Jiang Zemin met with Clinton in Seattle. Since then "Sino-U.S. relations have entered a new stage." These remarks indicate that the United States is paying great attention to Secretary of State Christopher's visit to China. Since the summer of 1989, relations between China and the United States have been at a low ebb. It was not until November last year, when the top leaders of the two countries met after an absence of nearly five years, that relations between the two countries began to develop toward a new direction. Although there are still contradictions between China and the United States, such as the U.S. deficit in bilateral trade, China's human rights situation, and disputes over intellectual property rights, as noted by the United States, with the exception of the human rights issue, on which China maintains its own position and all the more opposes U.S. linkage of human rights with granting most-favored-nation [MFN] trading status to China, the other two problems are easy to solve, and, moreover, are being resolved. Both Sides at Odds With Each Other on Human Rights Issue As such, the crux of the failure of Sino-U.S. relations to further improve lies in the human rights issue. When leaving Beijing for home on 2 March, Assistant Secretary of State John Shattuck, who had finished a two-day visit to China, said that China had made some progress in improving its human rights. However, further progress on human rights was needed if it wanted Clinton to extend its MFN status in June. Obviously, this means continuing to bring pressure to bear on China. On this issue, a Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman reiterated China's position yesterday: Opposing U.S. linkage of the human rights issue with MFN status. However, the purpose of Shattuck's visit to Beijing was to make arrangements for Christopher's visit to China. At meetings with many top-level Chinese officials, including Vice Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu, Shattuck stressed that the Clinton administration hoped to strengthen Sino-U.S. relations. However, on the MFN renewal issue, China must make improvements. He clearly remarked: "This is the bottom line for the U.S. Government." It can thus be seen that whether or not this deadlock can be broken or what form it assumes depends on the current Beijing talks between the foreign ministers of the two countries. Seeking a Point of Compromise in the Deadlock On the one hand, under pressure from Congress, the Clinton administration has strongly demanded China to respond on the human rights issue so that he can justify himself on the issue, and, on the other hand, he also faces strong pressure from American manufacturing, business, and economic circles, which oppose the use of political means to compel China to submit. If China and the United States fall out with each other, Chinese retaliation against the United States will also be detrimental to its economy. It must be pointed out that the U.S. economy has entered a new stage of stable growth from recovery. U.S. economic strategy puts stress on Asia. The vast market of China is precisely what the United States desires most. It is obvious that since the Sino-U.S. summit in November last year, Clinton has decided to develop economic relations with China and Southeast Asia. In terms of the international political situation, for the United States and China to maintain friendly relations will benefit the economic and political stability of the two countries, Asia, and the world at large. In fact, China has been continuously improving its human rights. This has been acknowledged by many officials from the United States and Europe who have visited China. It must be said that it would be conducive to both sides and feasible for the foreign ministers of the two countries to seek a long-term solution to the MFN issue in one move by proceeding on the basis of their long-term and immediate interests.
