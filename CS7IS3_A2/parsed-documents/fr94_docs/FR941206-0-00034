ACTION: Interim final rule. SUMMARY: The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (``PBGC'') is issuing an interim final rule that will enable it to refer past-due, legally enforceable debts to the Internal Revenue Service to be offset against federal tax refunds. The PBGC believes that adoption of this rule will enhance its debt collection ability. The procedures in this rule assure that PBGC regulations meet the requirements for participation in the federal tax refund offset program. DATES: This rule is effective January 5, 1995. Comments must be received on or before February 6, 1995. ADDRESSES: Comments may be mailed to the Office of the General Counsel, Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, 1200 K Street, NW., Washington, DC 20005&hyph;4026, or hand-delivered to Suite 340 at the above address between 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday.

(These are not toll-free numbers). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (``PBGC'') administers the pension plan termination insurance program under Title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (``ERISA'') (29 U.S.C. 1301 et seq. ). In conjunction with the pension plan termination insurance program, persons (including organizations and entities) incur various types of debts to the PBGC. The PBGC uses various methods to collect its debts. As part of an effort to enhance its debt collection ability, on November 30, 1994, the PBGC published a final rule adding to its regulations a new ``Debt Collection'' part (29 CFR part 2609) that included administrative offset procedures in subpart B and reserved subpart C for tax refund offset procedures (59 FR 61272; effective December 30, 1994). The PBGC has not previously participated in the tax refund offset program of the Internal Revenue Service (``IRS''). Because the PBGC believes that such participation will enhance its debt collection ability, the PBGC now is amending part 2609 to include the anticipated subpart C procedures and adding, in subpart A, a general section (ยง2609.1) and several definitions (ยง2609.2). The PBGC also is amending two provisions of part 2606 of its regulations (29 CFR part 2606, Rules of Administrative Review of Agency Decisions), and it is reserving subpart D of part 2609 for salary offset procedures. The Federal Tax Refund Offset Program The federal tax refund offset program is authorized by section 3720A of subchapter II (Claims of the United States), chapter 37 of title 31 of the United States Code (31 U.S.C. 3720A). Section 3720A directs any federal agency that is owed a past-due, legally enforceable debt to notify the Secretary of the Treasury at least once a year of the amount of any such debt. Before doing so, an agency must meet requirements specified in subsection (b) of section 3720A or prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury to ensure that the debt is past-due and legally enforceable and that the agency has made reasonable efforts (pursuant to regulations) to obtain payment. It also must comply with the notice, minimum debt, and fee requirements in Treasury regulations issued pursuant to subsection (d) of section 3720A. Upon receiving notice that a named person owes an agency a past-due, legally enforceable debt, the Secretary of the Treasury is to determine whether any amounts are payable to that person as a refund and, if so, to reduce the refund by the amount of the debt and pay the amount of the reduction to the agency (subsection (c) of section 3720A).
