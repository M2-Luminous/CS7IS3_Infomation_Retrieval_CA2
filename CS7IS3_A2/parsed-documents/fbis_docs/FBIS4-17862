It consists of 19 paratroopers, three armored personnel carriers, two Ural motor vehicles and a radio station. The statement was made to INTERFAX on Tuesday by the commander of the Russian Airborne Troops, General Yevgeny Podkolzin. According to him, British General Michael Rose, the commander of the UN peace-keeping force in Bosnia-Herzegovina, asked for the redeployment of the Russian unit. The airlift of paratroopers was made to enforce the peace-keeping contingent in the area of Gorazde. Earlier other peace-keepers units, including a Ukrainian company, were deployed in the region. Podkolzin believes that the airlift of Russian paratroopers will affect beneficially the situation in the region, as well as Bosnian Serb units. He also said that the Russian diplomacy will only benefit from the presence of Russian troops in Gorazde. The commander said that the rotation of the Russian peace-keeping contingent in the former Yugoslavia will end on April 29. As many as 600, out of the 1500 Russian contingent, will be replaced by fresh forces. Podkolsin said that most soldiers and sergeants who had served for six months in line with the contract, acquired cars in the former Yugoslavia. They received 6,000 dollars for their peace-keeping work and most have decided to return to Russia behind the wheel of their own car.
