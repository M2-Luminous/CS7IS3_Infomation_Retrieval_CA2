The increase in their numbers is astonishing. These almost 10,000 kinds of publications are important weapons in fostering socialist spiritual civilization. They are busily providing readers with spiritual food and are greatly affecting all of society. Facing this unprecedented situation, what are the main guiding principles of the State Press and Publications Administration in its management over publications? [Liang] There is a need to change two concepts in publications management at present. First, attention should be switched from increasing the quantity to improving the quality. As Comrade Ding Guangen [chief of the Propaganda Department] has pointed out: Macromanagement over propaganda and culture should be strengthened, with attention paid to providing guidance, controlling the total amount, improving the composition, and producing better results. This is also an important task of the State Press and Publications Administration. Of course, we can discuss whether these almost 10,000 kinds are adequate or not. As a matter of fact, they will increase in the future. The most urgent problem at present, however, is to review their quality, whether their composition is rational or not, and how their results are. For a time in the past, the department in charge focused its attention on running new publications and did not care much about problems emerging in publications. As a result, a situation arose in which "new publications were increasing" and "the bad coexisted with the good." This situation must be changed. The existing publications should be managed and run well before running new publications. At least, there should be basically no approval for new publications in the near future. Second, tough criteria should be set for management. There are two criteria in press and publications management. One is the minimum criterion, which means that a publication must meet publication standards, its contents must not violate state law, and its publication procedures must not go against publication regulations. Some of the publications that have met this criterion are neither good nor bad; others are borderline cases; still others are like certain industrial enterprises -- consuming much, but producing low economic results. It will not do to maintain our management at this level. The other criterior is the maximum, which requires publications to be first-rate in all aspects. Requiring every issue of a publication to be problem-free may be a little excessive, but this can be achieved if efforts are made. This criterion is determined by the particularity of publications. For example, management over material products is like filling a bamboo basket with bricks; it does not matter if the basket is woven tightly, or a little loosely. Management over spiritual products is like filling a pail with water, allowing no leakage. Let us compare management over material products to repairing a highway; if there is a hole on the highway, a car can still skirt it. Management over spiritual products is like repairing an aqueduct; if there is a breach in one of the dikes, the aqueduct will leak. This high criterion is for the sake of the people, the reader, and the next generation. A manager should be very careful, as careful as walking on a thin ice; on the other hand, he should be brave and firm, and try to achieve the best results. [Zhou] On publications' quality criteria, what specific management requirements do you have in mind? [Liang] Whether or not a publication is run well depends, generally speaking, on whether or not it can fulfill the main task set by General Secretary Jiang Zemin for current propaganda and ideological work. This main task is to hold firm to the fundamental principle of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, to arm the people with scientific theory, to guide the people with correct public opinion, to create good images with a noble spirit for the people, and to encourage the people with fine works. There are six primary aspects of quality in terms of what can be seen in the layout (there is also personnel quality and operational situation relating to the layout): 1. Political quality -- Unquestionably, the first demand on newspapers and publications is a correct and firm political orientation. On the one hand, this is because newspapers and publications are spiritual food, and rotten food should not be given to others; as mass media, newspapers and publications should not mislead the country by providing wrong guidance. On the other hand, newspapers and publications have a commercial nature, and publishers frequently overlook social effects out of commercial motives. The political quality of newspapers and publications is sometimes like a boat sailing against the current: A slight absence of mind could weaken their political quality. 2. Information quality -- As we are focusing on economic construction and on developing the socialist market economy, we should particularly stress the importance of information. This is the main function of newspapers and publications in serving the four modernizations. For periodicals, information quality alone is not adequate, there also should be academic quality. 3. Cultural quality -- Newspapers and publications fall into the category of culture. Their cultural quality has a direct impact on readers' sentiments. 4. Publishing quality -- This refers to the quality of editing, proofreading, composition, printing, and binding. 5. Advertising quality -- The development of the socialist market economy has brought about the great development of the advertising business. Publishing advertisements has become another main function of newspapers and publications in serving society. In particular, advertisements have occupied large spaces in newspapers. Whether an advertisement is true or false, poorly or beautifully printed, directly affects the newspaper's quality. 6. Circulation quality -- All the functions of newspapers and publications finally manifest themselves when they reach the reader. No matter how much a newspaper contains, it must have a certain quantity. Under the socialist market economy structure, in which efficiency and results are valued highly, the amount in circulation should be taken as the basic factor in assessing the quality of newspapers and publications and as a necessary assessment criterion. For newspapers and publications in open circulation, none of these six aspects of quality are dispensable. [Zhou] What is the management policy to ensure the fulfillment of these requirements? [Liang] First, we should control the quantity and improve the quality, with the focus on two procedures -- one being an approval procedure and the other being a routine management procedure. 1. "Three principles" on management over approval. This year three principles on approval have been implemented: Basically no approval is granted; approval is granted after an adjustment; and approval is decided on improvement in management. After a large increase in newspapers and publications over the last few years, they basically have coped with economic construction and the people's cultural needs. Therefore, approval for new newspapers and publications basically has stopped this year. If provinces and units wish to run new newspapers and publications, they should reduce the original newspapers and publications. The number of new newspapers and publications to be approved depends on the number of old newspapers and publications reduced. No approval will be granted to new newspapers and publications if the old newspapers and publications are not reduced, the purpose being to promote the good and eliminate the bad. In addition, management quality will be taken into account; no approval will be granted if management does not improve. This will be taken as a condition so as to improve management. 2. "Three measures" for daily management. Daily management gradually should take on a procedural nature and should proceed in a scientific way, with the aim of establishing a normal and effective mechanism. First, we should pay attention to assessment. An annual assessment of newspapers and publications will be carried out so as to make them meet minimum criteria. After an assessment, bad-quality newspapers and publications with a low circulation must be eliminated resolutely. Second, we should pay attention to appraising the good so that the good will meet the maximum criteria. This was begun many years ago, and the results were very good. In a region and a department, there is a need to establish several influential newspapers and publications to promote the rest. Third, we should pay attention to grading. After fulling the first and second measures, scientific grading gradually will be introduced to all newspapers and publications to form a rational management mechanism. After grading, different management will be exercised over advertisements, distribution, operations, and position titles. The grades of newspapers and publications will be adjusted according to the annual assessment and appraisal, forming a normal, self-restrictive, and stimulative mechanism. To summarize, there are two transformations, six criteria, three principles, and three measures. In the past, our main efforts were devoted to increasing the number of newspapers and publications. Now efforts should be switched to improving quality. This is a difficult change, but we are confident of carrying out this task.
