The ambitious plan, called "The Golden Bridge" project, was put forward last July by Hu Qili, Minister of Electronics Industry, and is now a national priority. According to experts from the ministry, the massive project would set up a nationwide channel devoted to making economic information available to the public. This information network would cover all provinces and autonomous regions, 500 main cities, 12,000 large enterprises, and some key projects such as the Three Gorges dam and the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant. Experts say the network would transmit data, voices, images and faxes by way of fibre-optic cable, satellites, microwave transmissions and programme-controlled and mobile telecommunications. In addition, financial networks would accommodate the demands of foreign trade, customs and banking. Such a project could greatly strengthen the government's macrocontrol over the economy and bolster the development of information services, experts say. The first stage of the project is called "Golden Customs;" the second stage, the "Golden Card." "Golden Customs" would link all customs and foreign trade enterprises electronically, with the intention of creating a paperless trade. Experts say the project would ensure accurate and timely statistics on the country's foreign trade and would help check malpractices regarding licenses, quotas, settlement of foreign exchanges, and taxes. The aim of "Golden Card" is to replace cash with electronic money -- credit cards. China, with nearly 1.2 billion people, has issued only 4 million credit cards. In the United States, on the other hand, more than 1 billion credit cards are used by a population of 260 million. In other words, the average American has nearly four credit cards. "Golden Card" would spread the use of credit cards throughout the major urban areas within 10 years. The "Three Golden" projects would open massive opportunities for the electronics industry, said Minister Hu Qili. Electronics enterprises would have to provide large quantities of hardware and software for the projects, Hu said. The ministry would also actively co-operate with foreign companies to inject capital and advanced technology into the projects, said Qu Weizhi, Vice-Minister of Electronics Industry. But Qu stressed that the projects would follow a unified standard. Local authorities are prohibited from negotiating with foreign companies to import products and technology of varying standards. The overall design for the Golden Bridge project will be worked out this year, Hu said. Satellite stations for Golden Customs will be linked together during the first half of the year. Some cities will be selected to test the Golden Card project this year. The likely candidates include Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Dalian, Qingdao, Guangzhou.
