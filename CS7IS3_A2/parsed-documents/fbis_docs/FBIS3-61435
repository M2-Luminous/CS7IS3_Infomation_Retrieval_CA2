A model is made of optically active epoxy materials heated in a thermostatted chamber until they become highly elastic and then set into rotation. During the rotation process, the model cools slowly to room temperature. After the model has cooled, the deformations and optical anisotropy induced in it by centrifugal forces are fixed (in other words ``frozen''). The model is cut into thin plates (sections) that are in turn illuminated with polarized light in a polariscope. The stresses and strains in the sections are then determined on the basis of the patterns of the interference bands. The stresses and strains measured in the model are then recalculated for a full-scale structure based on dimensionality and similarity methods. The use of three-dimensional models has several advantages: They are easily machined and glued, and they make it possible to measure stresses in internal areas of rotors that cannot be measured by stress gauges or brittle coatings. In cases of stresses induced by a combination of centrifugal forces and the pressure of liquid on the rotor's wall, the model is filled with glycerin or silicon, and the calculations are based on two sets of measurements -- one when the model is filled with liquid and one when the model is empty. A series of formulas for measuring the stresses and strains on and in rotors is presented, and use of the proposed method and formulas is illustrated by way of the example of a model of the impeller of a high-speed pump.
