"We are capable of fighting this war and winning it if that is the option," Colonel Frank Mugambage of the rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) told reporters after the one-day talks broke up with an agreement to meet again at an unspecified date. The mainly Tutsi RPF is demanding an end to massacres of Tutsis in territory held by the Hutu-led government. Up to half a million people have been hacked, bludgeoned, burned or machine-gunned to death since the April 6 death of president Juvenal Habyarimana in an alleged rocket attack on his plane pitched the small central African country into frenzied ethnic bloodletting. Mugambage, the RPF's deputy commander, and Brigadier General Marcel Gatsinzi, the army's number two man, promised to cooperate with the UN in resuming the evacuation of civilians trapped behind battle lines, and distributing food to millions of Rwandans threatened by starvation. Evacuations were suspended Monday because of heavy fighting in Kigali and the failure of the two sides to guarantee security. "The ceasefire was briefly addressed, but the evacuation of civilians and the safety of displaced persons was discussed at length," UN military spokesman Major Jean-Guy Plante said. "We have definitely made progress on the safety of our evacuation procedures and we plan to resume evacuations on Friday," he said. Deputy UN force commander Brigadier Henry Anyidoho, who chaired talks between the two sides Monday and Thursday, said the main obstacles to agreement on a ceasefire were rebel demands for an end to massacres in government-held territory and an end to pro- government radio broadcasts inciting violence. "Our aim was to go into ceasefire talks but then these obstacles came up," Anyidoho told a news conference after the talks ended. Gatsinzi said he would convey the rebel conditions to the government. [passage omitted] UN troops have rescued hundreds of Tutsis and Hutu opposition supporters stranded behind government lines in Kigali's Mille Collines hotel, and Hutus holed up in rebel territory in the Amahoro Stadium. Kigali has become a ghost town as almost all its 500,000 inhabitants have fled southwards in a perilous search for safety. The estimated 40,000 who remain rarely venture out into streets littered with spent shells. Dogs feed on dismembered bodies from recent massacres in some neighbourhoods. The mainly Tutsi rebels have surrounded one of the army's last strongholds in the embattled capital, Camp Kigali, which they are shelling relentlessly. They are also closing in on the seat of the self-proclaimed all-Hutu interim government at Gitarama, 40 kiLometres (25 miles) southwest of the capital. "The government has pulled most its big guns out of Kigali and put them in Gitarama," said a UN military observer who visited the town Wednesday. With an estimated 20,000 fighters, the rebels are still heavily outnumbered by an army of well over 30,000 men despite a wave of desertions in the past two weeks. But the government's bedraggled, beer-swilling soldiers are demoralised and taking a pounding from rebel artillery, UN military sources said. UN commander General Romeo Dallaire meanwhile expressed frustration that there was still no sign of a promised new 5,500- strong UN force, leaving his 470 men powerless to end killings at a displaced people's camp at the southern monastery of Kabgayi. A military reconnaissance team arrived here Thursday from Canada, which has pledged 300 soldiers, as Deputy Defence Minister Robert Fowler flew out after a two-day fact-finding visit.
