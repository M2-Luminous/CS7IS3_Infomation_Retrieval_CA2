Other automakers are likely to follow suit in an apparent effort to break an impasse in trade talks between Japan and the United States, the sources added. Japan's 11 auto makers pledged to buy U.S. auto parts worth 19 billion dollars in fiscal 1994 as part of efforts to reduce Japan's huge trade surplus when then U.S. President Gerge Bush visited Tokyo in 1992. Earlier in the day, Toyota Chairman Shoichiro Toyoda showed a positive stance on setting a voluntary target for imports of U.S. auto parts. Toyoda suggested at a news conference that the Japanese side could propose the voluntary target on condition that the U.S. does not take a retaliatory measure if Japanese automakers fail to realize such an objective. Toyoda said the auto manufacturers of Japan and the U.S. are on good terms, adding it is better to set a voluntary target than to damage the relations between them. The economic relations between Japan and the U.S. have been strained since February 11 when Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton failed to reach agreement on a U.S. demand for setting numerical targets to gauge the openness of Japanese markets to American products. The bilateral trade negotiations have centered on four fields -- autos and auto parts, medical equipment, telecommunications products and insurance services. On Wednesday, Clinton indicated that he will soon revive the super 301 provision of the 1988 omnibus trade act, which would allow for retaliatory measures against countries deemed to be engaging in unfair trade practices. Toyoda has been named new chairman of the Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren) to replace Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of Tokyo Electric Power Co.
