A senior Gaza Strip officer said yesterday that the troops have been instructed to intensify their patrols on the Gaza bypass road and the road to the Qatif Bloc, in order to prevent terrorist attacks. "This is the period that precedes our departure," the officer explained, "and it is a sensitive period." The officer revealed that the evacuation of equipment and buildings from the Strip would start in the coming days. "Bases and buildings will not be handed over to the Palestinians, except for a few buildings that will be used by their police force. A special committee will coordinate the transfer of buildings." This is how the evacuation will be carried out: First the IDF will pull out of areas controlled by Fatah, namely the PLO, and the areas will come under Palestinian command. This process will continue until only the "hottest" locations, such as the Jabalyah refugee camp, remain under IDF control. The latter will be evacuated after Fatah is firmly established in most of the Gaza Strip. The first sites to be evacuated will be evidently Rafah and Dayr al-Balah in southern Strip.
