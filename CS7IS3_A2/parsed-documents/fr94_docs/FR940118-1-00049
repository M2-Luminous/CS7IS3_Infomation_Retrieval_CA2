FR940118-1-00049 FR940118-1-00008 (a)(1) There has been some confusion concerning the number of inflation medium cartridges which should be provided with the hybrid PFD at the time of sale. This paragraph has been changed to indicate that when hybrid PFD's with a manual or automatic inflation mechanism are provided with one inflation medium cartridge loaded into the inflation mechanism only two spare cartridges need to be included. When hybrid PFD's are sold without an inflation medium cartridge loaded into the inflation mechanism they must be provided with at least three cartridges. This paragraph will also be renumbered to be consistent with standard Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) format. (a)(2) Another area of misunderstanding has been the number of water sensitive elements to be provided at the time of sale. To clarify the required number of water sensitive elements to be provided the paragraph has been changed. When hybrid PFD's with an automatic inflation mechanism are provided with one water sensitive element loaded into the inflation mechanism only two spare water sensitive elements need to be provided. When hybrid PFD's are sold without a water sensitive element loaded into the inflation mechanism they must be provided with at least three water sensitive elements. This paragraph will also be renumbered to be consistent with standard CFR format. Section 160.077&hyph;31␣Recreational Hybrid PFD (c) The required marking text for recreational hybrid PFD's will be changed to be consistent with revisions to Type, discussed under §160.077&hyph;7(a) of this section and buoyancy changes, covered under `` Changes to improve reliability '', §160.077&hyph;19(b)(6). Section 160.077&hyph;31␣Commercial Hybrid PFD (d) The required marking text for commercial hybrid PFD's will be changed to be consistent with revisions to Type, discussed under `` Changes to make use of hybrids more attractive '', §160.077&hyph;7(a) and buoyancy changes, covered under `` Changes to improve reliability '', §160.077&hyph;21(c)(3). Section 160.077&hyph;31␣All PFD's (e)(5) The requirement for marking generic identification of the inherently buoyant material is of little value to the hybrid PFD user. Therefore, the marking requirement for generic identification of the inherently buoyant material will be deleted. Section 160.077&hyph;31␣Foam (g)(1) The space allotted to this paragraph is greater than the importance of the information provided. The text will be revised to better balance the information provided on the label by shortening the marking requirement for flotation material buoyancy. The statement ``As explained in the owner's manual, test at least once annually for buoyancy loss.'' is proposed to follow the minimum buoyant force statement in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section. Section 160.077&hyph;31␣Type Equivalence (h) Because hybrid PFD's marked as Type I, II, or III will be tested as such, the Type Equivalence marking requirement will be changed to be applicable to Type V hybrids only. Section 160.077&hyph;31␣Approved Use (j)(1) This paragraph will be amended to show that Type I commercial hybrid PFD's meet carriage requirements without restriction. Type V commercial hybrid PFD's remain ``Required to Be Worn.'' (j)(4) This paragraph will be added to allow manufacturers the option of leaving the approved use unspecified on the label if authorized to do so by the Commandant, U.S. Coast Guard. Section 160.077&hyph;31␣Size Ranges (1) This paragraph will be added to specify the exact text to be used when providing PFD size information on labels for approved hybrid PFD's. Section 160.077&hyph;33␣Approval Procedures (a)(3)(vi) The proposed changes to the Scope and Types discussed in §§160.077&hyph;1(d) and 160.077&hyph;7(a) of this section, authorize hybrid PFD's to be approved in various Types and size ranges. To be consistent with these changes, this paragraph will be added to require manufacturers to provide the size range of the intended wearers when applying for USCG approval of a hybrid PFD.
