FR940505-1-00013 FR940505-1-00006 Regulatory Evaluation This proposed regulation involves a foreign affairs function of the United States, and therefore, Executive Order 12866 does not apply. This proposed regulation has also been evaluated under the Department of Transportation's Regulatory Policies and Procedures and the proposed regulation is not considered significant under those procedures and its economic impact is expected to be so minimal that a full economic evaluation is not warranted. Regulatory Flexibility Act Determination The Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation certifies that this proposed regulation, if adopted, would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The St. Lawrence Seaway Tariff of Tolls relates to the activities of commercial users of the Seaway, the vast majority of whom are foreign vessel operators. Therefore, any resulting costs will be borne mostly by foreign vessels. Environmental Impact This proposed regulation does not require an environmental impact statement under the National Environmental Policy Act (49 U.S.C. 4321, et seq. ) because it is not a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of human environment. Federalism The Corporation has analyzed this proposal under the principles and criteria in Executive Order 12612 and has determined that this proposal does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
