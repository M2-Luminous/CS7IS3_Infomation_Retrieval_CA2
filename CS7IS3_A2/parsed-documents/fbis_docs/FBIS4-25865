Import restrictions on a host of farm products, including turkey meat, whole duck and 16 types of fruit, including apples, peaches and apricots, will be removed, as will area restrictions, according to Council of Agriculture (COA) officials. The tariff concessions will be finalized by an interministerial GATT strategy task force on Thursday [15 June]. The task force originally was to have met later this month, but moved the meeting up "because time is pressing." Taiwan is expected to submit a list of its market-opening moves before a GATT special working party convenes its sixth meeting screening Taiwan's application for GATT membership in late July. The task force will also discuss Taiwan's opening up to rice imports, the officials added. In liberalizing its rice market, Taiwan will not insist on adopting the "Korean formula," which will allow rice imports of up to 4 percent of domestic consumption within 10 years, but will sacrifice some of its own agricultural production to foreign imports. It is likely that Taiwan will take a road midway between the Korean and Japanese formulas. The Japanese formula stipulates that the country will open 4 percent to 8 percent of its market to foreign rice in six years, but without opening up its market to other agricultural products. Meanwhile, Taiwan officials will hold other tariff-reduction negotiations with more GATT member countries in early July before the GATT special working party meets. The Taiwan delegation, to be headed by Vice Economics Minister Sheu Ke-sheng and Board of Foreign Trade Director-General Y.C. Huang, will hold bilateral tariff and nontariff negotiations at Geneva with officials from Mexico, Argentina, Hong Kong, Singapore, New Zealand, Australia, and most European countries. Taiwan is also scheduled to hold its third round of trade negotiations with the united tstates in mid-July. A ministry official said that if the United States finds Taiwan's offer to slash tariffs, remove area restrictions and open up the service market satisfactory, it would go a long way toward solidifying Taiwan's GATT entry.
