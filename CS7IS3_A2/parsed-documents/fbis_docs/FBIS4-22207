Thus, from the very birth of aviation, the problem of flight safety assumed paramount importance for those who tried to conquer the skies. It was, after all, not enough to rise into the air; just as important was the ability to land safely without injury either to self or flying machine. This was the goal towards which inventors, designers, and pilots worked -- all those who were fascinated by the idea of "wings." And as history confirms, as aviation engineering and science developed and piloting skills were mastered, the probability of accidents during flights fell hundreds of times, and it became much safer to rise into the air. Still, even with our modern aviation equipment, highly perfected means for ensuring the safety of flights, and thoroughly equipped airfields, tragic accidents, or flight incidents as aviators call them, or even catastrophes, do happen, unfortunately. Consequently, flight safety remains and will probably continue to remain perhaps the most important concern of aviators, and especially of military aviators. To some extent, objective circumstances have made this problem even more acute for the Air Force of Ukraine. Some of these reasons were discussed at the conference on flight safety recently held by the 14th Air Army. To begin with, it was noted that the shortage of fuel and lubricants, spare parts, and funds has caused the intensity of flight training to decrease substantially, and the expertise of pilots in the principal categories of training, especially in difficult weather conditions [SUM] and at night, to drop. The expertise of the flight operations groups (HKP) has decreased for the same reason. A significant number of specialists have been discharged into the reserves. They have been replaced by new people who lack sufficient experience in flight operations and control. Objective difficulties in obtaining spare parts and machinery for communications equipment and for the electronic support of flights and for airfield equipment are reducing the reliability with which these function; and this, too, has a negative impact on flight safety. Aviators are also plagued by other problems with respect to material-technical supply. However, despite everything, last year the 14th Air Army had no serious flight incidents -- at least, there were no catastrophes. There is no point in discussing at length how they managed this. The most important thing, after all, is to hope that disasters continue to pass by the aviators this year as well. Relying on God alone is hardly enough; concrete steps need to be taken to ensure flight safety. One such measure was the conference we have already mentioned. The goal of the conference was to prevent the level of flight safety from dropping in our difficult times by having experienced pilots and other specialists prepare specific recommendations on the basis of a detailed analysis of flight incidents and their causes. Sad though it may be, in matters pertaining to preventing accidents, aviators learn from their mistakes and the mistakes of others. And, as we know, it is better to learn from the mistakes of others. Hence, in their collectives, they analyze each accident, catastrophe, and the causes of each in considerable detail. This was also done at the conference. A detailed analysis of the flight safety record of the formation's units during the last five years was conducted. There were four flight incidents in the air army during this period -- one catastrophe, one accident, and two incidents in which planes were damaged. Four men died, an MI-24 helicopter and a MIG-29 were lost, and two other planes were damaged: an AN-12 and a MIG-29. A few other tragic air accidents occurred in the units that were recently added to the 14th Air Army. As we can see, there is plenty of negative experience here from which to learn. What are the main causes of accidents and catastrophes? The results of the investigations conducted in the case of each accident confirm that the leading causes are pilot errors resulting from an inadequate level of professional training on the part of fliers. Moreover, the majority of accidents involved young specialists who held the post of airman or senior airman. In addition to the leading causes of flight incidents, the other subjects considered included shortcomings in the organization and ensuring [zabezpechennya] of flights and in the performance of personnel in the flight operations groups, who were responsible to some degree for the negative outcome in each specific case. Here is what happened in each specific instance. Senior Lt. Airman V. Burskyy, flying at a low altitude in an assigned area, after performing a 360-degree banked turn, decided to change the sweep angle of the wing. As a result, he turned his attention away from his altitude and the wing of his plane caught the tops of the trees. The result was a crash. On 16 May 1991, Senior Airman Lt. I. Halchenkov was flying a MIG-29. His mission was to carry out an air "battle" with a low-altitude slow-flying air target. The pilot found himself in an emergency after completing his fourth attack. At a height of a little over a kilometer, he failed to pay careful attention to the indicators on his instrument panel and lost lateral control. The pilot became confused and, persuaded that the airplane was not responding to the control stick, he ejected. The plane crashed into the ground... The most typical accident caused by shortcomings in the organization and flight operations control occurred on 24 January 1989. The crew of a MI-24 helicopter led by Capt. S. Roztorhuyev was performing an uncomplicated flight exercise. One minute and 40 seconds after takeoff, at an altitude of 220 meters, the helicopter, banking to the right and increasing its angle of descent, hit the ground and burned. The direct cause of the catastrophe was the loss by the commander of the crew of his sense of direction as he suddenly found himself in the clouds, because he had insufficient training to fly in such conditions. In addition, he had turned away his attention to visually search for a second helicopter flying alongside. But the principal cause was a series of serious violations and shortcomings in the organization and control of flights, which, unfortunately, became evident only during the investigation following the crash. Capt. S. Roztorhuyev came to the regiment from Afghanistan and did not begin to fly until three months later. Such a long gap is inadmissible. The number of actual flights required to restore lost piloting skills before being put into active service had been cut in half. Before the day of the catastrophe, the pilot had not refreshed his training to operate a helicopter at night or in difficult weather conditions. As a specialist third class, he had virtually no experience in this kind of flying. Moreover, the commander of the regiment had scheduled flights in normal weather conditions, whereas by then the conditions were in fact difficult and growing worse. The flight operations officer on the landing ground, Maj. P. Zhreleyev, lacking adequate professional training, did not apply safety measures in the zone for which he was responsible in time. When the situation in the air became an emergency, he lost his head and gave no command. The sad conclusion drawn from the above -- a chain of violations of flight regulations and negligence in the performance of their jobs by a number of people in responsible posts. What conclusions can be drawn from the examples cited above? First and foremost, there must be a scrupulous and very concrete approach in full compliance with all regulations to allowing a pilot to fly, depending on weather conditions, the difficulty of the flight mission, and the level of the pilot's training and experience. This must be implemented on the basis of accepted standards outlined in existing regulations. In connection with a rather marked tendency towards a decline in the professional level of flight personnel for reasons cited above and the lack of opportunities for conducting the necessary number of flights, much more attention must be devoted to the ground training of the air soldiers. This training should include theoretical studies, as well as training in the cabins of airplanes and helicopters, and such. The flight simulators, which often stood idle in the past, should also be used to full capacity. The specialists in the aviation-engineering service must triple their level of care to prevent the possibility of flights being undertaken in winged machines that are in a state of disrepair. Particular attention should be paid to those airplanes and helicopters that are reaching the end of their service life or require repairs. You cannot, after all, fix a breakdown in the air. Just as much diligence, a responsible attitude to their jobs, and reliable care for equipment and how it performs are required of all specialists in airfield, weather, and medical services, flight operations groups, and others. Obviously, the best way to improve flight safety is to supply all the necessary fuel and lubricants and spare parts needed for conducting the full schedule of flights on regular aviation equipment. This, however, is something that we can only wish for. Our present reality is somewhat different. And it requires that we do everything possible, and even the impossible, to ensure that the number of landings equals the number of takeoffs by the airplanes and helicopters of the Air Force of Ukraine.
