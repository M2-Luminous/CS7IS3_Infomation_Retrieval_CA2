Defense Minister Francois Leotard has now given more details on the French Army's equipment. The priority will be the modernization of weapons, nuclear and nonnuclear weapons. Francois Leotard was interviewed by Frederique Barrere: [Begin Leotard recording] Modernizing our forces means, of course, keeping our nuclear dissuasion for ever. The law provides 130 billion francs to preserve and renew our nuclear capacity. So, we have decided to continue our efforts as far as the M5 missile is concerned. It will start to be used in the year 2010, not in 2005. We will continue the program concerning four SSBNs of the new generation. The basic weapons we need are taken in due consideration: Leclerc tanks, the Tigre helicopter, the nuclear aircraft carrier Charles De Gaulle -- which will be operational by mid-1999 with its flotilla of naval version Rafale interceptor- planes . The Air Force will also have Mirage 2000D; as you know the first planes of this kind are being used in Bosnia-Herzegovina now. Lastly, in line with our crisis-management strategy, we will start a program for long-range precision weapons which should be completed by 2001. [end recording]
