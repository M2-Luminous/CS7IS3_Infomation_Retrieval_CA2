Acting principal resident magistrate Mr Philip Musonda fined Johannes Molife Masire, 42, because he wanted him to reform since he was a first offender. Masire's womanfriend Esther Makawala, 32, businesswoman of Lilanda township was acquitted after the State withdrew the case against her. According to facts, Drug Enforcement Commission officers (DEC) searched Nakawala's house where they found 76 tablets of Mandrax hidden under a refrigerator and another 93 tablets were found in his car. The officers also found 5.3 grammes of cannabis worth K530. In mitigation Masire's defence lawyer Mr Nigel Mofya said he was a first offender who required counselling on the dangers of drugs. Mr Musonda warned Masire to refrain from dealing in drugs. If he came to court again for a similar offence he risked a 10-year prison sentence. The vehicle and the refrigerator were forfeited to the State. In the same court, a hearing in which Lusaka businessman Webster Mwenso and two traders have pleaded not guilty to having Mandrax was adjourned for trial to January 6 because the DEC prosecutor Mr Lufwendo Saboi was in Livingstone. Mwenso, 53, of Roma, is charged with Andreas Paraskepolous, 43 and Joannides Axiotis, 39, for having 1,149 grammes of Mandrax on April 27. Paraskepolous and Axiotis' application for temporary release of their passports was granted but they had to pay K100,000 each as surety. Their defence lawyer Mr Victor Kamanga said his clients intended to travel out of Zambia during the adjournment. [passage omitted]
