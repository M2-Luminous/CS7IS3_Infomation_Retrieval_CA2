What made you do it? [Shakhray] Yes, we voted for the amnesty, but unfortunately it did not turn out to be quite so easy to explain our position in the mass media. Alas, in the period of the election campaign we encountered the concept of "democratic censorship".... So I am grateful to the very popular TRUD for the opportunity to express my view on this matter. So, I believe that we voted absolutely correctly. And it was not a sudden decision on our part. We had been committed to it for quite a long time, since the founding congress of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord, since 17 October 1993. The essence of our position is that we regard the events of 3-4 October in Moscow as an episode of civil war. And the responsibility for it is borne equally by all branches of federal power. They failed to reach agreement, they failed to prevent the loss of 150 lives. Civil conflicts like this cannot be assessed by means of juridical rulings and court verdicts. You cannot be the judge at your own trial. The logic of civil confrontations knows only one way out: the quest for civil reconciliation. Everyone must show repentance to the relatives of those who died, create humane conditions for those who survived, and try in future to minimize the negative consequences of the conflict. That is what must be done. And that is what we were guided by when we voted for the amnesty. But that is not all. TRUD readers should know that at the same time we voted for the memorandum on accord and for the decree on disbanding the parliamentary commission to investigate the events of 3-4 October. [Lepskiy] Were the possible consequences of the amnesty studied beforehand? [Shakhray] Of course. This was a political decision, and in politics you have to know how to "calculate" how a situation will develop many moves ahead. We predicted that two main trends would emerge after the amnesty. First, the possibility of closer cooperation between the president and the State Duma. We were working on the basis that the majority in the Duma will fulfill its election promises with the help of the amnesty, and that the "Lefortovo" politicians will be at liberty. But at the same time in the Russian political theater's 1994 season they only have the opportunity to be spectators, since all the roles have already been assigned. Neither Zyuganov nor Rybkin is going to give up his place and his influence to Khasbulatov, Rutskoy, or anyone else. So, like it or not, the interests of the Duma leaders and the interests of the president temporarily coincided: The freed men are restricted in their opportunities to engage in effective political activity. Second, we were working on the basis that the political climate in society is today determined by three groups (or elites): the Moscow, the regional, and the sector group. In the sector group, the leading role is played by the military-industrial and oil-and-gas complexes. The sector and regional elites have recently been cooperating actively and coming together as a counterweight to the Moscow elite. The latter, preparing for a new division of powers, has concentrated more than 70 percent of Russia's banking capital in its hands. And now the country's political climate will be determined by how relations develop between these groups -- peacefully or otherwise. These "mainsprings" and "levers" will control all political events of any importance in the near future. Prior to the amnesty the mood was such that in April-May there would have been a round of acute political struggle, and the victim would have been Viktor Chernomyrdin's government. The political figures who have come out of jail have "tangled" the threads of these plans. Thus society has won a respite for a few months, and the May crisis will most likely not take place. Heaven knows, we should use this respite to achieve accord and peace. [Lepskiy] When you talk about peace and accord, are you thinking only of the possible events in Moscow? [Shakhray] Not only. Take, for instance, another consequence of the amnesty -- Khasbulatov's return to Chechnya. Things could hardly get any worse in Chechnya. And if Khasbulatov sees with his own eyes how people are living, what a disastrous situation the Chechen people are in, then I do not think it is impossible that he will help promote the negotiations process and the normalization of relations between Chechnya and Russia. [Lepskiy] So how do things stand as regards the drafting of a memorandum or pact on civil accord? [Shakhray] Well, strictly speaking, the Duma has already adopted a memorandum on accord. It is another matter that the president has set the problem of drafting another document -- a pact (let us call it that) on civil peace. I very much wish to hope that this will not be an alternative to the document already adopted by the Duma. If it is an alternative, we will soon find ourselves with... a war between pacts on civil peace. [Lepskiy] As I understand it, the president wants this document to be signed by people from the "risk group" -- those who have come out of Lefortovo and other old hands at organizing dangerous May Day parades.... [Shakhray] I am in favor of the document being signed by representatives of all the really active political forces without exception. Including the people who have come out of Lefortovo. [Lepskiy] The whole question is, is such a compromise really possible? Does your personal experience of work in the Duma persuade you that compromise is possible? [Shakhray] Unlike the former Supreme Soviet, the State Duma is quite well structured politically -- there are factions representing the parties. And -- a very important point -- no one faction has a sufficient majority of votes to push through its own version of a legislative decision. For a decision to be adopted, whether you like it or not, you have to seek a general consensus. So the Duma council has arisen -- something in the nature of a permanent conciliation commission. This is a very important component in the future machinery of accord. I hope you and I will live to see the day when this machinery will operate smoothly everywhere. In any case, at the moment I can only say that given the will and a sense of responsibility, social peace can be achieved.
