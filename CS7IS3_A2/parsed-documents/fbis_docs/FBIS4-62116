A meeting of the sides' parliamentary commissions is to take place in Kishinev on 12 May. They will discuss the draft law on the legal status of the Gagauz settlements. Today, it was discussed at a closed sitting of the commission of the Gagauz Parliament, which was attended by its president, Stepan Topal. The draft law grants the Gagauz people broad self-government within a single Moldavia. According to Komrat (Gagauz capital) sources, disagreements appeared between the sides yesterday. They relate to the articles of the draft law, which define the status of the Gagauz rayons, their administration, and the division of powers between the republic's central leadership and local bodies. Komrat's spokesmen proposed that changes should be made to the draft law, which envisages setting up the "Gagauz-eri" national and territorial entity in southern Moldavia. They insist on adopting their own constitution and are against the proposed procedure for appointing judges and heads of power bodies, which provides for their appointment by collegiums of the relevant Moldavian ministries. Kishinev disagrees with this. Despite this, it looks as if the sides have managed to draw up compromise decisions, which will be discussed at tomorrow's meeting.
