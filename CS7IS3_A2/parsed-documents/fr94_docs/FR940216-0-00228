FR940216-0-00228 FR940216-0-00010 (7) Conduct a quality assurance sampling and testing program to be carried out at the facilities of each oxygenate blender who blends any RBOB produced or imported by the refiner or importer with any oxygenate, to determine whether the reformulated gasoline which has been produced through blending complies with the applicable standards, using the methodology specified in ยง80.46 for this determination. (i) The sampling and testing program shall be conducted as follows: (A) All samples shall be collected subsequent to the addition of oxygenate, and either: ( 1 ) Prior combining the resulting gasoline with any other gasoline; or ( 2 ) In the case of truck splash blending, subsequent to the delivery of the gasoline to a retail outlet or wholesale purchaser-consumer facility provided that the three most recent deliveries to the retail outlet or wholesale purchaser facility were of gasoline produced using that refiner's or importer's RBOB, and provided that any discrepancy found through the retail outlet or wholesale purchaser facility sampling is followed-up with measures reasonably designed to discover the cause of the discrepancy; and (B) Sampling and testing shall be at one of the following rates: ( 1 ) In the case of RBOB which is blended with oxygenate in a gasoline storage tank, a rate of not less than one sample for every 400,000 barrels of RBOB produced or imported by that refiner or importer that is blended by that blender, or one sample every month, whichever is more frequent; or ( 2 ) In the case of RBOB which is blended with oxygenate in gasoline delivery trucks through the use of computer-controlled in-line blending equipment, a rate of not less than one sample for every 200,000 barrels of RBOB produced or imported by that refiner or importer that is blended by that blender, or one sample every three months, whichever is more frequent; or ( 3 ) In the case of RBOB which is blended with oxygenate in gasoline delivery trucks without the use of computer-controlled in-line blending equipment, a rate of not less than one sample for each 50,000 barrels of RBOB produced or imported by that refiner or importer which is blended, or one sample per month, whichever is more frequent; (ii) In the event the test results for any sample indicate the gasoline does not comply with applicable standards (within the ranges specified in ยง80.70(b)(2)(i)), the refiner or importer shall: (A) Immediately take steps to stop the sale of the gasoline that was sampled; (B) Take steps which are reasonably calculated to determine the cause of the noncompliance and to prevent future instances of noncompliance; (C) Increase the rate of sampling and testing to one of the following rates: ( 1 ) In the case of RBOB which is blended with oxygenate in a gasoline storage tank, a rate of not less than one sample for every 200,000 barrels of RBOB produced or imported by that refiner or importer that is blended by that blender, or one sample every two weeks, whichever is more frequent; or ( 2 ) In the case of RBOB which is blended with oxygenate in gasoline delivery trucks through the use of computer-controlled in-line blending equipment, a rate of not less than one sample for every 100,000 barrels of RBOB produced or imported by that refiner or importer that is blended by that blender, or one sample every two months, whichever is more frequent; or ( 3 ) In the case of RBOB which is blended with oxygenate in gasoline delivery trucks without the use of computer-controlled in-line blending equipment, a rate of not less than one sample for each 25,000 barrels of RBOB produced or imported by that refiner or importer which is blended, or one sample every two weeks, whichever is more frequent; (D) Continue the increased frequency of sampling and testing until the results of ten consecutive samples and tests indicate the gasoline complies with applicable standards, at which time the sampling and testing may be conducted at the original frequency; (iii) This quality assurance program is in addition to any quality assurance requirements carried out by other parties; (8) A refiner or importer of RBOB may, in lieu of the contractual and quality assurance requirements specified in paragraphs (a) (6) and (7) of this section, base its compliance calculations on the following assumptions: (i) In the case of RBOB designated for any-oxygenate, assume that ethanol will be added; (ii) In the case of RBOB designated for ether-only, assume that MTBE will be added; and (iii) In the case of any-oxygenate and ether-only designated RBOB, assume that the volume of oxygenate added will be such that the resulting reformulated gasoline will have an oxygen content of 2.0 weight percent; (9) Any refiner or importer who does not meet the contractual and quality assurance requirements specified in paragraphs (a) (6) and (7) of this section, and who does not designate its RBOB as ether-only or any-oxygenate, shall base its compliance calculations on the assumption that 4.0 volume percent ethanol is added to the RBOB; and
