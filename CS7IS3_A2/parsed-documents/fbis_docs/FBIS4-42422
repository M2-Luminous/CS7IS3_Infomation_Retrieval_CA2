[Delcroix] That will be a very serious problem because Dehaene is far more than the engine of the government. He is also its bodywork. I see two possibilities. Either we finish gracefully and the elections are advanced to early 1995--I am not radically opposed to that--or we find a new prime minister and succeed in updating the government program. We cannot continue for another year as we are doing now. Public opinion, which must be considered, would not accept that. In any case I want to do so, because I can thank public opinion for a great deal. Without the public's support, I would perhaps not have succeeded in abolishing national service. [Goossens] What would be the main points of that new government program? [Delcroix] The emphasis must be on the security problem and fighting crime. Then there are immigration policies. A time must come when we have the courage to say that the country is saturated. We must put a figure on that. Then we must also take adequate measures against the illegal immigrants. I do not think that we must reintroduce borders, but we must organize something, and also take measures for combating drugs. In my view, the Army can and must play a role here. It could be deployed in this area. In the community field, I support more homogenous packages of powers. I also feel that the federal state should be more than a skeleton. It must also have substance; otherwise it cannot survive. [Goossens] The Flemish Bloc will take pleasure in many points in your program. [Delcroix] I am not a fan of the Flemish Bloc, and I do not call for it to be brought into the government. However, I think it is wrong to isolate it. It is bringing up problems that have been neglected by the other parties, including the immigration problem. [Goossens] Are the Flemish Liberal Democrats an ideal coalition partner for you? [Delcroix] That is not self-evident. Much will depend on how the electoral campaign is conducted, and just like everyone else they will have to make compromises after the elections. I belong to the right wing of the Christian People's Party (CVP), and that makes me unacceptable for some positions in the eyes of the French-speaking Socialist Party. This does not bother me, however, nor does it bother me that in the CVP there are people who have a far greater interest in the welfare sector than the business world. We are a true people's party.
