This was discussed broadly at a meeting held at the Cabinet of Ministers which was chaired by Azerbaijan's prime minister, Surat Huseynov, on 5 October. At this meeting, which was attended by leading workers in the republic's banking, financial and tax organizations, the situation in the finance and credit system was analyzed from all sides. The discussion about the budget shortfall, shortcomings in the collection of taxes and the low level of banking technology was broached uncomfortably. It was noted that a number of institutions openly avoid paying taxes, checks are not accepted by the cashiers at commercial stores, and there is no supervision over fully transferring to the budget taxes on income attained. In the opinion of those who spoke at the meeting, there is an urgent need for changes in the tax law, in preparing tax prognoses, and in defining types of additional taxes. The situation in the economy requires that domestic debit and credit obligations be met rapidly. There can be no satisfaction in the fact that these debts amount to some 200 billion rubles. The speakers also touched on the issue of taking relevant measures to use the state's expenditures more effectively. It was noted that the most important production sectors have to be restructured and that investment financing means must be used correctly. The strengthening of the state's control over currency transactions was made a priority at the meeting. It was noted that import-export activity by banks was not supervised adequately and that the employment of personnel with no experience in the banking system had led to a lagging behind in many sectors. Prime Minister Surat Huseynov, in summing up the meeting's results, talked about concrete duties connected with the subjects discussed.
