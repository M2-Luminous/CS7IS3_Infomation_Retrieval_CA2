"The normalization of Sino-French relations will make our participation in the metro work easier," said Jean-Michel Kuntzer, Vice President of Sofretu's Asia & Oceania Company, at the signing ceremony. Kuntzer, who is on his 25th trip to Guangzhou in connection with the project, also said that his company has been working on the project with the Guangzhou side for more than seven years. "We have a good relationship with the municipal government and local engineers," Kuntzer added. According to the $5 million-plus contract, Sofretu will send 200 subway experts to Guangzhou to provide technical and engineering consultancy for the most difficult part of the Phase 1 project in Guangzhou subway. In the meantime, Chinese engineers will be sent to study at Sofretu's headquarters -- the Paris Metro Company. The Huangsha-Tianhe section, which extends eight-kilometres through the city's busiest area, will be built through shield tunneling, an underground construction method that meets international standards. In addition to its business here, Sofretu is involved in the renovation of the Beijing Metro network, which was built more than 20 years ago. And for more than two years, it has been doing research with the Shanghai government on the city's transportation network. "As China plans to build light railways in more than 20 cities, we are hoping to enlarge our business here," said Kuntzer.
