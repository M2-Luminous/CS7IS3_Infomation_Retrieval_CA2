According to UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali, the international community must show that it is serious about Bosnia. [passage omitted] This afternoon in the Lower House, Defense Minister Ter Beek will argue on the basis of Butrus-Ghali's letter that the launch of air strikes to neutralize Serbian artillery positions around Srebenica and Zepa is not on the agenda. Asked for his reaction to the letter, Ter Beek said through a spokesman on Monday [31 January] that attacking Serbian positions would be too great a risk for UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] units already present in Bosnia. Various groups have argued this point in previous debates. Limited air support will only be used when resistance is such that the battalion's ability to carry out its mission is jeopardized or if it needs to defend itself.
