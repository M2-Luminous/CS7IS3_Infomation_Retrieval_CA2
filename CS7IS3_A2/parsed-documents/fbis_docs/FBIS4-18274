Solana said that during their meeting they covered the international situation and more specifically the situation in Bosnia and the EU [European Union] enlargement process. Solana underlined that the Spanish Government is very concerned with the reconstruction process in Bosnia. Solana briefed Christopher about the EU enlargement process and added that the recent agreement concerning minority voting rights is a balanced compromise that allows the defense of Spain's interests. Furthermore, Solana -- who is traveling on to Egypt and Lebanon next week -- said that the latest events in the Middle East meant that the peace process was going to go through a difficult phase. Solana and Christopher also discussed various Latin American issues. In his statements to the press in Washington, Solana said that the Spanish Government is awaiting an official announcement from the Algerian Government about its apparent decision to extend its territorial waters to 53 miles and to increase pressure on foreign boats fishing illegally in its waters. The Spanish foreign minister underlined that there is no actual or specific Algerian document saying what this means and that he would rather not comment until an official declaration from the Algerian Government was available. Then, he added, we will give an appropriate answer. Meanwhile, Vincente Albero, the Spanish agriculture, fisheries, and food minister, said that although the government was awaiting more information about the measure, it had told the European Commission about Algeria's decision to extend its territorial waters toward the Spanish coast.
