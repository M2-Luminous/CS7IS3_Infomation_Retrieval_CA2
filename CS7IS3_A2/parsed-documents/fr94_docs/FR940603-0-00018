FR940603-0-00018 FR940603-0-00010 By letter dated April 12, 1994 (Administrative Record No. KS&hyph;580), the Fish and Wildlife Service responded that it had no comment. Comments were also solicited from various State agencies but none elected to comment. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Concurrence Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(ii), concurrence was solicited from the EPA for those aspects of the proposed amendment that relate to air or water quality standards promulgated under the authority of the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act. By letter dated November 2, 1993 (Administrative Record No. KS&hyph;571), the EPA regional office in Kansas City, Kansas responded that it did not have any comments regarding the proposed revisions. State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) and Advisory Council on Historic Preservation Comments (ACHP) 30 CFR 732.17(h)(4) requires that all amendments that may have an effect on historic properties be provided to the SHPO and ACHP for comment. Comments were solicited from these offices. No comments were received from either SHPO or ACHP. V. Director's Decision Based on the above findings, the Director is approving the proposed amendment submitted by Kansas on September 14, 1993, as modified on March 9, and March 10, 1994, with two exceptions. The Director is not approving proposed rules K.A.R. 47&hyph;6&hyph;2(d) and (d)(3), Permit revisions, as discussed in finding No. 5 and K.A.R. 47&hyph;9&hyph;1(f)(2), Special permanent program performance standards_operations on prime farmlands_applicability, as discussed in finding No. 7. Except as noted above, the Director is approving the Kansas regulations with the provision that they be fully promulgated in identical form to the rules submitted to and reviewed by OSM and the public. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR part 916 codifying decisions concerning the Kansas program are being amended to implement this decision. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State program amendment process and to encourage States to bring their programs into conformity with the Federal standards without undue delay. Consistency of State and Federal standards is required by SMCRA. VI. Effect of Director's Decision Section 503 of SMCRA provides that a State may not exercise jurisdiction under SMCRA unless the State program is approved by the Secretary. Similarly, 30 CFR 732.17(a) requires that any alteration of an approved State program be submitted to OSM for review as a program amendment. Thus, any changes to the State program are not enforceable until approved by OSM. The Federal regulations at 732.17(g) prohibit any unilateral changes to approved State programs. In the oversight of the Kansas program, the Director will recognize only the statutes, regulations, and other materials approved by OSM, together with any consistent implementing policies, directives, and other materials, and will require the enforcement by Kansas of only such provisions. VII. Procedural Determinations Compliance With Executive Order 12778 The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section. However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1253 and 12550) and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other requirements of 30 CFR parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.
