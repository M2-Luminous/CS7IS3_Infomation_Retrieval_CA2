The source was commenting on the Syrian-U.S. summit being held in Geneva between Presidents Bill Clinton and Hafiz al-Asad. The source referred to the progress on certain tracks of the Arab-Israeli peace process, noting that there has been important progress on the Palestinian-Israeli track and progress on the Israeli-Jordanian track. He pointed out that the Syrian track has failed to make progress and has reached a stalemate, which threatens the peace efforts. A peace without Syria would be a "lame" peace, because an important party to the conflict would not have resolved its problems with Israel. The source said that the peace-loving parties pin great hopes on the Syrian-U.S. summit reaching positive results and generating momentum in the Syrian-Israeli negotiations. He said that the United States has always emphasized its interest in the success of its peaceful initiatives so that the Middle Eastern countries can devote their efforts to promoting their economies. He stressed that there is hope that both Syria and Israel will emerge from the vicious cycle and spell out their real intentions so that peace may be achieved in the region.
