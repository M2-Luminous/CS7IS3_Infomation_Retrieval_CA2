This is another step taken by the government to streamline its structure. The dismissal of the two bureaus does not mean an emergence of another two departments to replace them. According to the reform program, the government has decided to set up two offices with only 20 staff each to carry out trade management and some administrative functions. The two bureaus had a combined employment of 330. The two bureaus were set up around 1960 to take charge of the production, sales and supply of non-staple foodstuffs. Shanghai has established a market mechanism with the government exercising macro-economic control while markets determine prices. Also, cooperatives and individuals are occupying a greater portion of the market. All these have made some of the functions of government departments obsolete. The closing of the two bureaus is a test in streamlining Shanghai's government structure. According to a high ranking official, the mode of management of enterprises is changing. The state administration of enterprises has turned to an indirect way. More decision making power will be given to enterprises. Since non-staple foodstuffs and aquatic products remain highly sensitive to market fluctuations, these commodities still need close government supervision. The newly established Shanghai non-staple foodstuffs and aquatic products offices will help to control their production and sales, keep reserves of sensitive goods, and make better use of production and sales funds.
