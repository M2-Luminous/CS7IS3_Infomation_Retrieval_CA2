FR940118-0-00028 FR940118-0-00009 40 CFR Part 52 [MT9&hyph;1&hyph;6134 & MT13&hyph;1&hyph;6133; FRL&hyph;4807&hyph;5] Clean Air Act Approval and Promulgation of PM 10 Implementation Plan for Montana AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: In this action, EPA approves the State implementation plan (SIP) submitted by the State of Montana to achieve attainment of the National ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM 10 ). The SIP was submitted by Montana to satisfy certain Federal requirements for an approvable moderate nonattainment area PM 10 SIP for Missoula. In this final rule, EPA also approves the Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program, except several rules regarding emergency procedures, permitting, open burning, wood-waste burners, new source performance standards, hazardous air pollutant standards, and variances. EPA will propose separate action on these rules when the State fulfills its related commitments. One commitment has been fulfilled (see the This Action section of this document for more information). If the State fails to fulfill the remainder of its commitments, EPA will take appropriate action. Further, EPA is declining to take action on Missoula's odor provisions. EFFECTIVE DATE: This rule will become effective on February 17, 1994. ADDRESSES: Copies of the State's submittal and other information are available for inspection during normal business hours at the following locations: Environmental Protection Agency, Region VIII, Air Programs Branch, 999 18th Street, Suite 500, Denver, Colorado 80202&hyph;2405; Montana Department of Health and Environmental Sciences, Air Quality Bureau, Cogswell Building, Helena, Montana 59620&hyph;0901; and Mr. Jerry Kurtzweg, ANR&hyph;443, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460.

Background The Missoula, Montana area was designated nonattainment for PM 10 and classified as moderate under sections 107(d)(4)(B) and 188(a) of the Clean Air Act, upon enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. 1 See 56 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991); 40 CFR 81.327 (Missoula and vicinity). The air quality planning requirements for moderate PM 10 nonattainment areas are set out in subparts 1 and 4 of part D, title I of the Act. 1 The 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act made significant changes to the air quality planning requirements for areas that do not meet (or that significantly contribute to ambient air quality in a nearby area that does not meet) the PM 10 National Ambient Air Quality Standards (see Public Law No. 101-549, 104 Stat. 2399). References herein are to the Clean Air Act, as amended (``the Act''), 42 U.S.C. 7401, et seq . EPA has issued a ``General Preamble'' describing its preliminary views on how EPA intends to review SIPs and SIP revisions submitted under title I of the Act, including those State submittals containing moderate PM 10 nonattainment area SIP requirements (see generally 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) and 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992)). Because EPA is describing its interpretations here only in broad terms, the reader should refer to the General Preamble for a more detailed discussion of the interpretations of title I advanced in this final action and the supporting rationale. Those States containing initial moderate PM 10 nonattainment areas (i.e., those areas designated nonattainment for PM 10 under section 107(d)(4)(B) of the Act) were required to submit, among other things, the following provisions by November 15, 1991: 1. Provisions to assure that reasonably available control measures (RACM) (including such reductions in emissions from existing sources in the area as may be obtained through the adoption, at a minimum, of reasonably available control technology (RACT)) shall be implemented no later than December 10, 1993; 2. Either a demonstration (including air quality modelling) that the plan will provide for attainment as expeditiously as practicable but no later than December 31, 1994, or a demonstration that attainment by that date is impracticable; 3. Quantitative milestones which are to be achieved every 3 years and which demonstrate reasonable further progress (RFP) toward attainment by December 31, 1994; and 4. Provisions to assure that the control requirements applicable to major stationary sources of PM 10 also apply to major stationary sources of PM 10 precursors except where the Administrator determines that such sources do not contribute significantly to PM 10 levels which exceed the NAAQS in the area. See sections 172(c), 188, and 189 of the Act. Some provisions are due at a later date. States with initial moderate PM 10 nonattainment areas were required to submit a permit program for the construction and operation of new and modified major stationary sources of PM 10 by June 30, 1992 (see section 189(a)). Such States also must submit contingency measures by November 15, 1993 that become effective without further action by the State or EPA, upon a determination by EPA that the area has failed to achieve RFP or to attain the PM 10 NAAQS by the applicable statutory deadline. See section 172(c)(9) and 57 FR 13543&hyph;13544. On September 15, 1993, EPA announced its proposed approval of the Missoula, Montana moderate nonattainment area PM 10 SIP, including parts of the Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program, as meeting those moderate nonattainment area PM 10 SIP requirements due on November 15, 1991 (58 FR 48339&hyph;48343). In that proposed rulemaking action and related Technical Support Document (TSD), EPA described in detail its interpretations of title I and its rationale for proposing to approve the Missoula moderate nonattainment area PM 10 SIP, taking into consideration the specific factual issues presented. EPA requested public comments on all aspects of the proposal (please reference 58 FR 48343), and comments from the State of Montana and Stone Container Corporation were received during the comment period, which ended on October 15, 1993. (For further discussion of these public comments, please see below and the Addendum to the TSD for EPA's proposed rulemaking action on this SIP.) This final action on the Missoula moderate nonattainment area PM 10 SIP, and portions of the Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program, is unchanged from the September 15, 1993 proposed approval action, except for two typographical errors noted by EPA. First, in the table describing sources, controls, emission reductions, and effective dates, the effective date for the Louisiana-Pacific permit modification should have been listed as March 20, 1992 instead of January 23, 1992, as indicated. Second, under the Enforceability Issues section, the final modification date for Stone Container Corporation's air quality permit #2589-M should have been January 23, 1992 instead of November 25, 1992, as indicated. The discussion herein provides only a broad overview of the proposed action EPA is now finalizing. The public is referred to the September 15, 1993 proposed rule for a more in-depth discussion of the action now being finalized. II. Response to Comments EPA did not receive any adverse public comments regarding its September 15, 1993 proposed approval of the Missoula moderate nonattainment area PM 10 SIP (58 FR 48339&hyph;48343). However, the State of Montana submitted comments for clarification purposes, and Stone Container Corporation submitted comments to express general support for EPA's action. Comments were as follows. In a letter dated September 24, 1993 from Jeff Chaffee, Montana Department of Health and Environmental Sciences, to Amy Platt, EPA, and through verbal communications, the State indicated that since submitting the original moderate nonattainment area PM 10 SIP for Missoula, it discovered a minor arithmetic error in its 24-hour attainment and maintenance demonstrations, as well as an error in the way it had addressed background concentrations in both the 24-hour and annual attainment and maintenance demonstrations. The background concentrations, i.e., naturally occurring PM 10 concentrations that cannot be controlled, had not been subtracted from the 24-hour and annual design values before apportioning the credits derived from the outlined control measures. The State has corrected these calculations, and with the adjustments, the 24-hour and annual attainment values (i.e., ambient PM 10 air quality levels achieved by 1995 2 ) are as follows: 143.8 μg/m 3 and 44.7 μg/m 3 , respectively. (Before these adjustments, the 24-hour and annual attainment values were 142.1 μg/m 3 and 45.3 μg/m 3 , respectively.) The adjusted 24-hour and annual maintenance values (i.e., ambient PM 10 air quality levels maintained through January 1, 1998) are 147.0 μg/m 3 and 45.5 μg/m 3 , respectively. (Before these adjustments, the 24-hour and annual maintenance values were 145.2 μg/m 3 and 46.2 μg/m 3 , respectively.) 2 The Clean Air Act calls for attainment by December 31, 1994. Section 188(c)(1). EPA interprets the State's demonstration as providing for attainment by January 1, 1995. EPA is approving the State's demonstration on the basis of the de minimis differential between the two dates. Since these corrected calculations are based on properly handling the background concentration and since the adjusted values still adequately demonstrate attainment and maintenance of the PM 10 NAAQS and do not represent major changes to those considered in EPA's proposed action, EPA is proceeding with its approval of this SIP. There is no need to adopt additional control measures based on these adjusted calculations. Comments were also received in an October 11, 1993 letter from Larry Weeks, Stone Container Corporation, to Amy Platt, EPA. The comments were not adverse and expressed general support for EPA's action on the Missoula PM 10 SIP. However, several of Stone Container's comments indicate a misunderstanding of EPA's intended action on this SIP and need further explanation. First, EPA did not propose to approve the odor control rules contained in the SIP submittal and Stone Container communicated its support but referenced ``Montana's odor control rules.'' EPA's action regarding odor regulations applies specifically to the Missoula City-County regulation (Chapter IX, Subchapter 14, Rule 1427) contained in the SIP submittal. Second, Stone Container submitted comments suggesting it viewed the reduction in allowable PM 10 emissions from its No. 5 recovery boiler as voluntary reductions. Stone Container's recovery boilers were identified by chemical mass balance receptor modelling to contribute 8.1% of the PM 10 ambient concentrations in Missoula. The SIP submittal demonstrated that Stone Container is contributing to the PM 10 nonattainment problem in the Missoula and vicinity nonattainment area and that reductions in allowable emissions from recovery boiler No. 5 are part of an enforceable permit that are necessary to demonstrate expeditious attainment of the PM 10 NAAQS in the area. EPA agrees with the State's judgement that the reduction in allowable emissions from recovery boiler No. 5 is necessary to ensure expeditious attainment of the PM 10 NAAQS in the area. EPA's final approval of this limitation means that it will become part of the federally enforceable implementation plan. See, e.g., sections 113 and 302(q) of the Act. Next, Stone Container commented that because EPA proposed to approve the control requirement exclusion for major stationary sources of PM 10 precursors authorized by section 189(e) of the Act, it would not make sense for the SIP to include contingency measures that would call for limitations on industrial sources. Contingency measures for moderate PM 10 nonattainment areas are due to EPA no later than November 15, 1993 and were not submitted by the State as part of the SIP revisions being addressed in this action. Thus, this comment is misplaced and does not address a matter within the scope of the September 15, 1993 proposed action on the SIP submittals for the Missoula area. For clarification purposes, EPA simply notes that EPA's finding that major sources of PM 10 precursors do not contribute significantly to PM 10 levels in excess of the NAAQS in Missoula addresses PM 10 precursors only. Note that this finding is based on the current character of the area including, for example, the existing mix of sources in the area. It is possible, therefore, that future growth could change the significance of precursors in the area. Stone Container has been shown to be currently contributing to primary PM 10 emissions in Missoula. Finally, since Stone Container has been shown to contribute to the PM 10 ambient concentrations in Missoula, contingency measures that include limitations on its emissions could be sought by the State. Although Stone Container is located outside the nonattainment area, it is still a contributing source (approximately 8% of the PM 10 ambient concentrations in Missoula). Therefore, it may be necessary and reasonable to include emission reductions at Stone Container as part of the contingency measures for Missoula. EPA will reserve judgement on the adequacy of any contingency measures submitted by the State until such time as EPA receives a contingency measure submittal and provides public notice and opportunity for public comment on its adequacy. This Action Section 110(k) of the Act sets out provisions governing EPA's review of SIP submittals (see 57 FR 13565&hyph;13566). The Governor of Montana submitted the Missoula PM 10 SIP with a letter dated June 4, 1992, and requested that EPA take action on the June 4, 1992 submittal together with the August 20, 1991 submittal of the Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program. The submittals taken together were intended to satisfy those moderate nonattainment area PM 10 SIP requirements due for Missoula on November 15, 1991. As described in EPA's proposed action on this SIP (58 FR 48339&hyph;48343, September 15, 1993), the Missoula moderate nonattainment area PM 10 plan includes, among other things, a comprehensive and accurate emissions inventory, control measures that satisfy the RACM requirement, a demonstration (including air quality modelling) that attainment of the PM 10 NAAQS will be achieved by January 1, 1995 (see footnote #2), provisions for meeting the November 15, 1994 quantitative milestone and reasonable further progress, and enforceability documentation. Further, EPA proposed to determine that major sources of precursors of PM 10 do not contribute significantly to PM 10 levels in excess of the NAAQS in Missoula. 3 Please refer to EPA's notice of proposed rulemaking (58 FR 48339) and the TSD for that action for a more detailed discussion of these elements of the Missoula plan. 3 The consequences of this finding are to exclude these sources from the applicability of PM 10 nonattainment area control requirements. Note that EPA's finding is based on the current character of the area including, for example, the existing mix of sources in the area. It is possible, therefore, that future growth could change the significance of precursors in the area. In this final rulemaking, EPA announces its approval of those elements of the Missoula, Montana moderate nonattainment area PM 10 SIP that were due on November 15, 1991, and submitted on August 20, 1991 and June 4, 1992. In this final action, EPA is also announcing its approval of the Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program regulations (which were submitted on August 20, 1991 and June 4, 1992) except for the following provisions: Chapter IX&hyph;Subchapter 4, Emergency Procedures; Subchapter 11, Permit, Construction & Operation of Air Contaminant Sources; Subchapter 13, Open Burning; Subchapter 14, Rule 1407, Wood-Waste Burners, Rule 1423, Standard of Performance for New Stationary Sources (NSPS), Rule 1424, Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs), and Rule 1427, Control of Odors in Ambient Air; and Chapter X, Variances. EPA described the deficiencies associated with these rules in its notice of proposed rulemaking and the TSD for that action. EPA finds that the State of Montana's PM 10 SIP for the Missoula moderate nonattainment area meets the Reasonably Available Control Measures (RACM), including Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT), requirement. Five sources/source categories were identified as contributing to the PM 10 nonattainment problem in Missoula and, therefore, were targeted for control in the SIP. The State has demonstrated that by applying control measures to area sources (re-entrained road dust, residential wood combustion, prescribed burning, and motor vehicle exhaust), as well as reducing allowable emissions through air quality permit modifications for Louisiana-Pacific and Stone Container, Missoula will be in attainment by January 1, 1995 (see footnote #2). It does not appear that applying further control measures to these sources would expedite attainment. EPA views the following measures as reasonable, enforceable, and responsible for significant PM 10 emissions reductions in Missoula: (a) Missoula County Rule 1401(7), which sets sanding and chip sealing standards and street sweeping and flushing requirements; (b) Missoula County Rule 1401(9), which establishes liquid de-icer requirements; (c) industry permit modifications made to reduce allowable PM 10 emissions from Stone Container Corporation's recovery boiler No. 5 and Louisiana-Pacific Corporation's particle board dryers; and (d) the Federal tailpipe standards, which provide an ongoing benefit due to fleet turnover. Further, although no credit was claimed in the SIP, EPA is approving the following measures to make them federally enforceable and to further strengthen the SIP. The measures provide additional PM 10 air quality protection. These measures are: (a) Missoula County Rule 1428, which sets standards for the regulation for solid fuel burning devices; and (b) Missoula County Rule 1310(3), which sets standards for the regulation of prescribed wildland open burning. A more detailed discussion of the individual source contributions, their associated control measures (including available control technology) and an explanation of why certain available control measures were not implemented, can be found in the TSD accompanying EPA's proposed approval of the Missoula moderate PM 10 nonattainment area SIP (58 FR 48339&hyph;48343). EPA has reviewed the State's documentation and concluded that it adequately justifies the control measures to be implemented. The implementation of Montana's PM 10 nonattainment plan for Missoula will result in the attainment of the PM 10 NAAQS by January 1, 1995 (see footnote #2). By this notice EPA is approving the Missoula PM 10 moderate nonattainment area plan's control measures as satisfying the RACM, including RACT, requirement. As noted, EPA did not propose approval, nor is EPA taking final action, on some portions of the Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program regulations. To address EPA-identified deficiencies in the Missoula and statewide SIP, the State committed to complete additional tasks to correct these deficiencies (except the concerns EPA raised regarding the variance provisions). A more detailed explanation of the State's commitments can be found in EPA's September 15, 1993 proposed approval of the Missoula moderate nonattainment area PM 10 SIP (58 FR 48339&hyph;48343) and the TSD for that action). Since none of the rules associated with these commitments has an impact on the attainment demonstration, credited control strategies in the Missoula PM 10 SIP, or other Federal Clean Air Act SIP requirements for the Missoula moderate PM 10 nonattainment area due to EPA on November 15, 1991, EPA will take separate action, as appropriate, when such commitments are fulfilled by the State, and also will address the variances chapter at that time. Further, EPA is declining to take action on Chapter IX, Subchapter 14: Rule 1427, Control of Odors in Ambient Air. These odor provisions do not have a reasonable connection to the NAAQS-related air quality goals of the Clean Air Act. The State has fulfilled one commitment to revise its NSPS and NESHAPs regulations to incorporate all Federal requirements promulgated through July 1, 1992. In a March 9, 1993 submittal, the State satisfied this commitment, and EPA will announce its action on these revisions in a separate notice. Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for a revision to any SIP. Each request for a revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors, and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. Final Action This document announces EPA's final action on the action proposed at 58 FR 48339. As noted elsewhere in this final action, EPA received no adverse public comments on the proposed action. As a direct result, the Regional Administrator has reclassified this action from Table 1 to Table 3 under the processing procedures established at 54 FR 2214, January 19, 1989. Regulatory Process Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600, et seq. , EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Clean Air Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the Clean Air Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The Clean Air Act forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds. Union Electric Co. v. U.S. E.P.A. , 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2). Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by March 21, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be file, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2).) Executive Order (EO) 12866 This action has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225). On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. USEPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.
