The two governments have scheduled at least two rounds of framework negotiations at deputy ministerial level prior to the summit meeting between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton on February 11. So far, neither Tokyo nor Washington has raised the possibility of a ministerial meeting. But Kantor told a news conference Wednesday that "there will be probably discussions at the ministerial level" following the deputies' meetings. Meanwhile, Japanese officials reported progress on framework talks on financial services held in Washington Wednesday. A Japanese official who took part in the negotiations said he expects an interim report on financial services to be completed by the time the first deputies' meeting takes place in Washington on January 24. The official warned, however, that conclusion of an interim report does not mean that the two sides have settled their differences on substantive issues, since the document contains primarily a wish list of market access issues that both sides want to be addressed. According to the framework accord concluded last July, the two countries have until July this year to complete negotiations on financial services.
