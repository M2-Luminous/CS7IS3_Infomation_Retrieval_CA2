The documents, which were submitted by the Cabinet of Ministers to parliament, expanded and defined this thesis specifically. As for the state administrative structures, it is planned to bring them to the level that existed on 1 January 1992. This means that the central ministries and departments must drop 4,200 persons (30 percent), and regional administrative organs--21,500 (19 percent). In the context of ministries and departments--according to the structures of regional executive authority--the picture is as follows. More than all the others there will be cuts in the staffs of local organs of the main auditing administration--4,100 persons. After this come the Ministry of Statistics--3,000 persons, Ministry of Justice--more than 800 persons, Ministry of Finance--more than 700 persons, State Property Fund--600 persons. There will be a relatively smaller cut--400 persons--in the organizations of the Antimonopoly Committee, but this figure constitutes exactly half of those who work here. The structures of the State Committee for the Protection of Consumer Rights Affairs will be cut by 158 workers (out of 790). It is impossible, however, to say whether this is good or bad. According to the idea, this department should be strong and capable of coming to the defense of consumers. The latter, unfortunately, do not feel this at all. Similarly, it is also planned to cut organs of local and regional self-government to the level of 1 January 1992. These structures are supported by local budget resources, and the state does not lose on them. But money is money, and it should be spent economically. Therefore the staffs of the self-government institutions of authority will have to be cut by 17,400 persons. At the same time, some organizations will grow. For example, local tax inspection offices will increase by 12,000, customs--by 5,500, courts--by 1,100, and procuracies--by 927 persons. It is obvious that the current staffs are bloated, and that they have to be cut. But this process should not proceed mechanically.
