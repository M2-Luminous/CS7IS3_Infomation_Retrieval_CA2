As he was leaving the premier's official residence, Paye described his talk with Hosokawa as "interesting and friendly." He also told KYODO News Service, "He (Hosokawa) told me about his intent to go on with a program of reform, which is very important for the further success of Japan."

On Tuesday, Paye is to have talks with the chief of the Science and Technology Agency, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii, Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno and leaders of the Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren).
