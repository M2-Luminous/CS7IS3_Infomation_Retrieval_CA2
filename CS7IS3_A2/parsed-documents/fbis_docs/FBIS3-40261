Instead of the planned 81 trillion zlotys [Z], the deficit was "just" Z43.8 trillion. So in the final analysis, it was even lower than predictions made two months before the end of 1993, when there was talk that it would be Z53 trillion. Still, results of the final Treasury note auctions for 1993 sent a clear message: The deficit must have been even lower, and that in spite of the fact that revenues proved higher than expected by more than Z25 trillion. Today, as work on the 1994 budget continues, Sejm deputies who are members of different Sejm commissions are suggesting an increase in expenditures by an additional Z20 trillion compared to what the government had proposed. This must be supplemented by the Agricultural Commission's proposals to increase agricultural expenditures by -- according to preliminary calculations -- Z10 trillion. As a result, the parliament -- while adopting the 1994 budget law -- will have two options: either to approve exactly what the government proposed (with possible shifts in expenditure amounts between different sectors), or to enact higher expenditures. The latter solution would require another decision: Are we in favor of increasing budget revenues, the budget deficit, or the money supply? Before decisions are made, it is worth taking a look at how much room there is for maneuvering, if at all. The Council of Ministers asked itself a similar question slightly over a month ago. As a result of a three-day debate, the government managed to come up with just Z2 trillion of additional revenue; and that was not from taxes since the finance minister had already done everything possible in that area by proposing amendments in tax laws which resulted in a total of Z25 trillion of additional revenue. Sejm deputies are currently hoping for revenue from taxes to be imposed on stock-market derived income, which was not planned in the government's budget draft. But one will not be able to extract more than Z3 trillion out of that source, and it could be much less than that. Nobody in the Sejm talks about increasing the budget deficit anymore, which was a suggestion made so often in previous years. Last year's problems with finding the money to finance the planned deficit proved more of a lesson than even the finance minister's very lengthy and persuasive speeches. Today, pressure is directed somewhere else -- at the Polish National Bank. Sejm deputies are demanding an increase in the money supply by Z14 trillion, whereas the bank's representatives oppose the idea. There are fears that such a measure could become just another lesson in economics.
