Yeltsin's press service said the Russian leader had invited Kravchuk to Friday's summit after reaching an "agreement in principle on certain important issues of shared interest, including nuclear weapons." A presidential spokesman declined to elaborate on the agreement, but Clinton has previously said that he would only meet with Kravchuk after an accord had been finalized on the dismantling of Ukraine's nuclear arsenal. Yeltsin's spokesman would only say that discussions were under way concerning several documents that the three leaders would be signing during their meeting in Moscow. [passage omitted]
