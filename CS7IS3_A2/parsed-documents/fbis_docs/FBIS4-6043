The case was brought by a Seoul National University (SNU) teaching assistant, identified only as Miss U, against her professor known as Mr. Sin, seeking 50 million won (about 62,000 U.S. dollars) in compensation for mental anguish due to sexual harassment. Presiding Judge Pak Chang-u of the court's panel No. 18 ruled, after nearly six months of hearings, that the defendant must pay 30 million won to the plaintiff. The judge decided that although the defendant claimed the plaintiff took action to gain revenge for her dismissal as a teaching assistant last August, her anguish caused by the defendant's sexual harassment, such as unnecessary physical contact, "is recognized in view of the witnesses of the plaintiff and her colleagues and other evidence." The historic ruling is expected to spur many women suffering sexual harassment to take action at the risk of disclosing their secret problems. In the court struggle, the defendant was supported by women's organizations and the SNU student government, which put up posters on campus last August charging Professor Sin with frequent sexual harassment -- trying to embrace Miss U from behind and rubbing her shoulders, for example. The women's organizations and the student government also formed a joint committee to draft measures against sexual harassment. Professor Sin filed a countersuit charging Miss U with libel, claiming she brought the case merely to take revenge for her dismissal. After four court hearings over nearly half a year, the verdict at last went in favor of the plaintiff. The joint committee welcomed the ruling, calling it historic in that it has set a favorable precedent for women subjected to sexual harassment. But it noted that the ruling overlooked sexual discrimination and disadvantages in employment, thus failing to recognize sexual harassment as a social problem. A poll of 458 working women conducted by the joint committee last November showed 87 percent of the respondents had experienced sexual harassment. Only 17.5 percent said they had taken action against their tormentors, including demanding an apology. Miss U's lawyer, Yi Chong-kol, said the ruling greatly increases the possibility that women will win sexual harassment cases in the future.
