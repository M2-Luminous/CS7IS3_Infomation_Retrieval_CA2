This was stated during a news conference by Abraham Maciques, president of Cubanacan's Board of Shareholders. Maciques said that in 1995 the island's tourism facilities will be able to accommodate 1 million tourists and secure $1 billion for the country. He recalled that last year Cuba received 640,000 visitors, according to preliminary reports. These visitors brought in between $720 million and $740 million to the Cuban economy, which has been enduring an adverse international situation since the end of the 1980's. Of this total, Maciques said, Cubanacan brought in 240,000 tourists and more than $195 million, approximately 40 percent more than the 1992 figures. He said: The corporation envisages bringing approximately 250,000 tourists in 1994, mostly from Canada, Germany, Spain, Italy, Netherlands, and Argentina, without forgetting nascent markets such as Great Britain and France. He said Cubanacan is ready to plan bigger promotions for the next few years because the quality of what it offers has been steadily improving and this has earned the trust of tourist agents and foreign partners. This also helps entice tourists to return. Polls conducted by Cubanacan among guests point to a 4.6 level of satisfaction on a five-point scale. Currently, Cubanacan S.A. operates 48 hotels with a total of 7,200 rooms. Fifteen of these hotels function under the mixed enterprise or mixed management arrangement. This year, with the opening of the hotels Las Americas, in the Varadero beach resort; Las Brisas, in the northeastern province of Holguin; and Cohiba and El Viejo y El Mar, in Havana; Cubanacan S.A.'s room availability will increase to 8,400. With regard to mixed investments, Maciques said that by the year 2000, they will have 8,000 rooms (more than 3,000 in Cayo Coco alone) operating mostly in working tourist centers. Development demands participation in joint investments. Cubanacan S.A. resources are to be used only on highly profitable enterprises, and both types of investments must take place in sites where infrastructure of already available (roads, electricity). Regarding supplemental hotel services, Maciques reported on a plan to restore some installations and to open new ones that will offer typical entrees at moderate prices. He mentioned, as an example, El Aljibe, a Havana restaurant that specializes in chicken, an experience that will be implemented throughout the country because of its demonstrated efficiency. Referring to the new structure adopted at the beginning of this year by Cubanacan, Maciques said this is part of a process of improvements by means of which each of the previous managers (18) opened independent companies. He stated: None can be unprofitable, and all are suitable for serving not only our corporation's tourists but also anyone requesting our services. According to Maciques, the new organization will guarantee more efficiency and quality control, reduce intermediate structures, and grant more authority to rank and file employees. Maciques also praised the opening of accounting offices and the signing of foreign venture contracts for the administration of construction projects, something without precedent in Cuba. The first agreement of this type was signed between a Spanish group and the Union of Caribbean Construction Enterprises to complete the hotel Las Americas, in Varadero, with a reduction of costs and improved quality. The same concepts will apply for constructing the Coco-Miel Hotel, in Cayo Coco. This type of agreement allows the island to acquire up-to-date technology and important construction know-how.
