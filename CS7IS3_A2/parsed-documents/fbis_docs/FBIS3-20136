FBIS3-20136 "drweu059_o_94004" FBIS-WEU-94-059 Document Type:Daily Report 26 Mar 1994 CYPRUS Denktas Opposes `Any Changes' in CBM's TA2603175994 Nicosia Bayrak Radio in Turkish 1530 GMT 26 Mar 94 TA2603175994 Nicosia Bayrak Radio Language: Turkish Article Type:BFN [Text] President Rauf Denktas has reiterated that he is opposed to any changes in the confidence-building measures [CBM's] that favor the Greek Cypriots. We will not accept the addition of new elements to the CBM's just to satisfy the Greek Cypriots, he stressed, adding that the Turkish Cypriots expect the promises made in the first parameters to be brought to life. The negotiations can continue only with this understanding, he added. In a statement to TAK [Turkish Cypriot News Agency] on the latest political developments, President Denktas pointed out that Greek Cypriot propagandists and sympathizers began to mislead the world about the CBM's. The aim, he stressed, is to influence the UN Security Council to pass an anti-Turkish Cypriot resolution. Denktas said: The Greek Cypriots try to make it look as if we got the close to 20 changes we asked for and now have the gall to insist on a couple of remaining points. This is not true. The president stressed that the Turkish Cypriots expect the parameters cited in the UN secretary general's reports and affirmed by the experts' reports to be maintained, and the rights and powers promised to the Turkish Cypriot side be brought to life. He said: The Turkish Cypriot side is opposed to any changes in the CBM's in favor of the Greek Cypriots. We will not agree to the addition of new elements to the CBM's just to satisfy the Greek Cypriots. Denktas explained that while the Turkish Cypriots were waiting for the advantages cited in the first parameters to be brought to life, they were told that the Greek Cypriot side does not agree to this or that point or that they cannot be forced to accept this or that point. In this way, he said, no efforts were made to bring to life the rights of the Turkish Cypriots. Denktas charged that even such proposals as allowing the Turkish Cypriots to work in Maras [Varosha] went up in smoke. He added: If the promises made in the first parameters are properly assessed, it will become clear that the Turkish Cypriots were not given 20 additional rights, as is being alleged. Denktas said that the negotiations can continue only with this understanding. It is not we who are creating difficulties in the negotiations, he said, but those who keep on changing the CBM's to favor the Greek Cypriots.
