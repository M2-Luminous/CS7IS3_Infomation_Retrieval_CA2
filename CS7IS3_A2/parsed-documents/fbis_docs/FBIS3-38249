The party has made big gains among the middle classes so it is, for the first time, level pegging with the Conservatives among this group of voters. The latest MORI poll for The Times underlines how Labour has advanced strongly since the late summer, largely at the expense of the Liberal Democrats. Labour now stands at 48 per cent, compared with 42 per cent last August, while the Liberal Democrats have slipped from 25 to 20 per cent. The Tories are on 28 per cent, the same level, plus or minus one point, they have been on since the Newbury by-election nine months ago. It is striking that the party's rating has not shifted over the past month, despite the headlines about the personal lives of some Tory ministers and MPs, the row over back to basics and the recent arguments about tax increases. This suggests that Tory support has probably bottomed out and is now down to a hard core. That can be read as either some comfort for the Tories that their position is not deteriorating, or worrying that there is no sign of any pick-up -- especially since this is the same level of support that Labour had at its low point during Michael Foot's leadership. The Labour advance has been most striking among the middle classes, now two-fifths of the electorate. Tory support in the middle classes has fallen steadily since the late 1970s, even though its national share of the vote has declined only slightly. Even when the Conservatives were in serious trouble in the middle of previous parliaments, the party was still well ahead of Labour among these voters. In the late summer of 1990, when Labour was last at 48 per cent nationally, it trailed the Tories among the middle classes by 32 to 49 per cent. At the 1992 election, the Tories were ahead of Labour among the middle classes by 54 to 22 per cent. Now, the two parties are level at 37 per cent. Labour remains well ahead of the Tories among working class voters. This shift in the middle classes is particularly serious for the Conservatives since it threatens their heartlands in the South of England. The latest poll shows that Labour has moved into the lead in the South, including Greater London. The party now has 39 per cent support, ahead of the Tories on 31 per cent and the Liberal Democrats on 28 per cent. Both the opposition parties have advanced at the Tories' expense in the South since the general election -- Labour doing well in the South East and the Liberal Democrats in the South West. This means that a sizeable number of Conservative marginal seats are under threat. Also worrying for the Tories is that Labour has moved well ahead among the elderly. It now has the support of 50 per cent of pensioners. There is no sign of any recovery in the ratings of either the Government or John Major. Just 13 per cent are satisfied with the way the Government is running the country, with 80 per cent dissatisfied, the same as last month. A mere 21 per cent are satisfied with the way Mr Major is doing his job as Prime Minister, with 71 per cent dissatisfied. This is only just above the low points touched last summer. Only just over a half even of the reduced number of Tory supporters are satisfied with Mr Major's performance. Even though Labour has strengthened its position over the past month, John Smith is still not making much impact with voters as Labour leader. Exactly the same number are satisifed as dissatisfied with the way he is doing his job as Labour leader, following three months when his rating has been positive. Paddy Ashdown's rating as Leader of the Liberal Democrats remains favourable, though it has slipped steadily since the autumn.
