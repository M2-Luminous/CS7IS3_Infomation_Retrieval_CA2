The delegation was headed by Kostantin Zatulin, president of this house's committee for cooperation with fellow nationals. Our Andjelko Perincic was among the reporters who attended one part of this meeting. [Perincic] At the start, Zatulin said that the deputies to Russia's Duma are concerned about the situation in the area of the former Yugoslavia, so at their last session they voted for a decision to urgently send their delegation to our region where they could talk about how the warring parties view solutions to the crisis. He also told his hosts that his delegation has already visited Knin, Belgrade, and Vukovar. They will visit Pale, too, he said. He cited the official titles of these unrecognized state entities such as the Srpska republic and the even more self-styled republic of Serb Krajina. In his reply Assembly President Stipe Mesic explained in detail the history and causes of the collapse of the Versailles Yugoslavia and the breakdown of the socialist federation which Tito had taken to the threshold of a confederal state, especially by the constitution of 20 years ago. The conflict, instigated by Serbia in pursuit of its territorial ambitions, with weaponry belonging to the common federation of the past, can only be resolved by using force, by meeting force with greater force, as the aggressor does not want negotiations, Mesic said. It is also of essential importance for the world to restore the fundamental principles of the inviolability of borders. He also criticized the Greater Serbia theory -- according to which all Serbians should live in a single state -- by raising the following counterquestion: What would happen if the same demands were to be raised by Russians, Hungarians, Germans, and other peoples? He also added that there would have been no war had the world thwarted Serbian aggression by greater force before Vukovar. The head of Russia's lower house of parliament first demanded that the meeting should continue without the presence of the press, so reporters were forced to leave the talks following these demands.
