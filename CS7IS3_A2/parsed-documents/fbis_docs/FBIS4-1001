FBIS4-1001 "drafr075_c_94010" FBIS-AFR-94-075 Daily Report 15 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Electoral Commission Announces Counting Procedures Electoral Commission Announces Counting Procedures MB1504185194 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1838 GMT 15 Apr 94 MB1504185194 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Statement issued by the IEC on the SAPA PR Wire Service on 15 Apr] [Text] Counting of votes for both national and provincial ballots is scheduled to begin at 06h00 on Friday 29 April at between 800 and 1000 counting centres around the country, each of which will serve a number of voting stations. Counting centre officials will communicate the results from their centre to the provincial or sub-provincial offices of the IEC [Independent Electoral Commission]. They will also announce the results--stressing that these are provisional--to the local media and other interested parties outside the counting centre. Batch tallies of results will then be forwarded by these offices to the IEC's Johannesburg headquarters, and from there to the IEC's media and communications centre at Gallagher Estate, Midrand, and to the SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] at Auckland Park. Running totals for the national assembly--in total and by province--and for the provincial legislatures--by province--will be released by the IEC at Gallagher Estate every hour, but with a disclaimer that these are unofficial and provisional. This is because of possible data errors, recounts and adjustments resulting from objections by registered parties or the IEC monitoring directorate. Results will be broken down into total votes counted, total votes counted per party, total spoilt ballot papers, total disputed but counted ballots, and total disputed not counted ballots. After the last of the results have been determined and certified, the decision will be made by the IEC on whether or not the election can be certified as having been substantially free and fair. If this is deemed so, the IEC will announce the final results, firstly by province, and ending with the result of the national assembly ballot. Official tallies per party will be announced, as will the number of seats per party. Parties will be announced in the order in which they appear on the ballot paper, and, while the names of individuals to fill the seats will not be announced, these will be made available.
