FR941207-0-00019 FR941207-0-00002 Twelve commenters were in favor of replacing the annual reconciliation report with the last monthly performance report with year-to-date totals, and two commenters were opposed. Those in favor stated that this proposal is a positive step toward reducing paperwork, while those opposed stated it would increase paperwork because distributing agencies would be required to certify the accuracy of the performance reports. In its review of this proposal and the comments received, the Department believes this proposal will serve to reduce paperwork. Under the current regulations for annual reconciliation, processors must total donated food receipts, transfer information, sales activity, and ending inventory balance from the individual performance reports. Under the proposed rule, it would not be necessary for processors to go through previous performance reports and compute these figures, since this information will be tallied cumulatively each month. Additionally, submitting performance reports with year-to-date totals will eliminate the need for distributing agencies to compile data from the individual quarterly reports to ensure that the annual reconciliation report figures are accurate. The final performance report for the contract year, including a summary sheet of year-to-date inventory totals, will replace the annual reconciliation report formerly required in the final rule. One commenter expressed concern that the time frames for submitting the performance reports with year-to-date totals to FCS are the same time frames currently required for submission of the quarterly inventory reports. That commenter indicated that if there were errors in the report, there would not be sufficient time for the processor to make the corrections and return the report to the distributing agency in order for the distributing agency to submit it to the FCS Regional Office on time. The Department believes that since most performance reports are computer-generated, and the calculation of the year-to-date totals would be performed by a formula placed into the computer program, there would be very few errors made. Furthermore, the Department believes that it is better to handle any errors that might be discovered on performance reports on a case-by-case basis. Distributing agencies will be required to certify that the inventory information contained in the final performance report is accurate, just as they are required to do under section 250.30(n)(4) of the current rule for the annual reconciliation report. The time frames for submission of the performance reports, as discussed earlier in this preamble, will remain the same as in the proposed rule and are clearly spelled out in the final rule under section 250.30(m)(1). As discussed earlier in this preamble under Refund Applications/Performance Reports, section 250.30(m)(1) of the proposed rule stated that processors are not required to submit performance reports for those months in which no sales were made and those months where processors had no inventory. As previously discussed, this provision is not included in the final rule. Therefore, the provisions in sections 250.30(n)(3) and 250.30(o)(1) of the proposed State processing regulation, which would provide that when a processor does not submit a monthly performance or inventory report for the last month of a Federal fiscal quarter, the distributing agency must forward to the FCS Regional Office the last monthly performance report received from the processor for that quarter, are not included in this final rule. This final rule adopts sections 250.30(m)(1), 250.30(n) (3) and (4), and 250.30(o)(1) of the proposed State processing regulations without change, except as previously noted. FCS plans to develop a prototype performance report format which will be easily adaptable for processors to incorporate into existing inventory reporting programs. This section of the proposed rule did not affect the NCP Program.
