Deploring the insufficiency of UNPROFOR resources, the general called for the creation of a "rapid reaction force" as the solution to the crisis in former Yugoslavia and spoke out against what earlier this month he described as the "humiliations" inflicted on UN personnel in Bosnia-Hercegovina. His comments echoed criticisms by Geneva peace mediator Thorvald Stoltenberg in Budapest of the "abyss between (UN) political ambitions and reality" in former Yugoslavia, in which the UN passed resolutions promising to send peacekeepers to former Yugoslavia but failed to provide the necessary funding. "If they (UN officials in New York) consulted responsible military leaders more systematically, maybe we could set up a useful dialogue," Cot told Croatian media. Even this would not be enough because of the "inertia of the system," he said. The solution, in the French general's view, was the creation of a "rapid reaction force that we could send into the field within a few hours or a few days...in regions of potential crisis." Cot again protested at what on January 1 he described as the "constant humiliation" of UN personnel in former Yugoslavia, notably Bosnia-Herzegovina. The UN forces were drawn from "armies which have a certain sense of dignity, so that you can't deal with them in the field in any old way," he said. He stressed that the UNPROFOR mandate in Bosnia was purely humanitarian: "We have no mandate for interposing ourselves between the combatants. Our means are already insufficient for distributing humanitarian aid, and we must not disperse our efforts in other missions, except in the safe areas," he said. Cot commended the outgoing commander of UNPROFOR in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Belgian General Francis Briquemont, who on Wednesday [5 January] said he was leaving his job earlier than expected because he was exhausted by the conflict. Briquement had "given so much, it was difficult to give more, and when you give so much you wear yourself out a little," Cot said. "I understand and respect his decision to take up the command in his own army that he left to come here. Let people not look for reasons.... which are totally false," he said, in reference to reports that Briquement had been recalled by Brussels following his outspoken criticisms of UN impotence in the Bosnian conflict.
