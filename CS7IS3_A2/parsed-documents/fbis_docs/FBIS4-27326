FBIS4-27326 "dreas105__a94007" FBIS-EAS-94-105-A Daily Report 29 May 1994 ANNEX Japan Plan for Radioactive Waste Disposal Agreed With Moscow Plan for Radioactive Waste Disposal Agreed With Moscow OW3005023694 Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 29 May 94 Morning Edition p 1 -- FOR OOFFICIAL USE ONLY OW3005023694 Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] Both the Japanese and Russian Governments, which have been discussing measures to prevent Moscow from resuming dumping of radioactive waste into the sea, have agreed to dispose of radioactive waste by constructing small facilities which float on the water. The design is currently being worked out. Construction is expected to begin this summer and be finished early next year. Since the Russian Government has pledged "not to resume dumping into waters earlier than the facilities are completed," radioactive waste dumping into the Sea of Japan will be avoided for the time being if the plan proceeds smoothly. Russia has asked Japan to help construct such facilities. The two governments have been coordinating details of the plan. The facilities will be constructed in a harbor in the suburbs of Vladivostok, and they are capable of storing approximately 800 tons of radioactive waste. Three tanks -- for storing, processing, and solidifying radioactive waste -- will be installed on a ship, and the waste will be put in drums. Construction costs are expected to reach $20 or $30 million and will be covered by Japan's $100-million program for assisting the denuclearization of the former Soviet Union. This plan is regarded as an emergency measure to prevent dumping of radioactive waste into the sea.
