FR941202-1-00003 FR941202-1-00002 FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 12 CFR Part 226 [Regulation Z; Docket No. R&hyph;0858] Truth in Lending AGENCY: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Board is publishing for comment proposed amendments to Regulation Z (Truth in Lending). The amendments implement recent changes made to the Truth in Lending Act by the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994. The law imposes new disclosure requirements and substantive limitations on mortgages bearing high rates or fees. The amendments would provide greater protections to consumers entering into high-rate, high-fee mortgages. The law also imposes new disclosure requirements to assist consumers in comparing the cost of reverse mortgage transactions, which provide periodic payments to primarily elderly homeowners and rely principally on the home's value for repayment. DATES: Comments must be received on or before January 18, 1995. ADDRESSES: Comments should refer to Docket No. R&hyph;0858, and may be mailed to William W. Wiles, Secretary, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 20th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC 20551. Comments also may be delivered to Room B&hyph;2222 of the Eccles Building between 8:45 a.m. and 5:15 p.m. weekdays, or to the guard station in the Eccles Building courtyard on 20th Street, N.W. (between Constitution Avenue and C Street) at any time. Comments may be inspected in Room MP&hyph;500 of the Martin Building between 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. weekdays, except as provided in 12 CFR 261.8 of the Board's rules regarding the availability of information. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jane Ahrens, Senior Attorney, or Kyung Cho-Miller or Sheilah Goodman, Staff Attorneys, Division of Consumer and Community Affairs, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, at (202) 452&hyph;3667 or 452&hyph;2412; for the hearing impaired only, Dorothea Thompson, Telecommunications Device for the Deaf, at (202) 452&hyph;3544. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background The purpose of the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) is to promote the informed use of consumer credit by requiring disclosures about its terms and cost. The act requires creditors to disclose credit terms and the cost of credit as an annual percentage rate (APR). The act requires additional disclosures for loans secured by a consumer's home, and permits consumers to cancel certain transactions that involve their principal dwelling. Limitations are imposed on some credit line plans secured by a consumer's principal dwelling. The act is implemented by the Board's Regulation Z (12 CFR part 226). II. Proposed Regulatory Provisions The Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act of 1994 (Equity Protection Act), contained in the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994 (Community Development Act), Pub. L. 103&hyph;325, 108 Stat. 2160, amends the Truth in Lending Act (TILA). Section 152 of the Equity Protection Act adds a new section 129 dealing with high-rate, high-fee mortgages. Section 154 adds a new section 138 dealing with reverse mortgage transactions. The Equity Protection Act was enacted in September 1994, and directs the Board to issue final regulations within 180 days. It provides that the statutory provisions and rules adopted by the Board shall apply on the October 1 following six months after the final regulation is issued. The Board is proposing regulations for comment, and expects to adopt final implementing regulations in March 1995. Compliance with the law would be mandatory by October 1, 1995. Section 156 of the Equity Protection Act states that the final rule governs all high-rate, high-fee mortgage transactions consummated after the mandatory effective date. The Board believes that the same compliance rule would apply to reverse mortgage transactions consummated after the mandatory effective date. III. Section-By-Section Analysis Section 226.2_Definitions and Rules of Construction 2(a) Definitions 2(a)(17) Creditor Section 152(c) of the Equity Protection Act states the number of high-rate, high-fee mortgage transactions a lender may make before becoming a creditor for purposes of the TILA. The proposed regulation parallels the statute. The regulation provides that persons making occasional home-secured loans_less than five during a calendar year_are not subject to the act. The proposed regulation provides that a creditor includes a person originating two or more high-rate, high-fee mortgage loans, or one or more such mortgage loans through a mortgage broker during any 12-month period. Thus, for example, a person originating one high-rate, high-fee mortgage that soon thereafter enters into two home-secured loans, one of which was a high-rate, high-fee loan, would be required to comply with TILA for both transactions. Subpart B_Open-End Credit Section 226.5b_Requirements for Home Equity Plans 5b(f) Limitations on Home Equity Plans The TILA allows creditors to terminate open-end plans and demand repayment in narrowly drawn circumstances such as when the consumer fails to make payments or takes actions that affect the creditor's security. Section 154(c) of the Equity Protection Act excludes reverse mortgage transactions from these substantive limitations. The legislative history states that the amendment is intended to codify the Board's interpretation regarding a creditor's ability to accelerate an open-end reverse mortgage loan in accordance with the credit contract. The proposed amendment reflects that intent. Subpart C_Closed-end Credit Section 226.23_Right of Rescission 23(a) Consumer's Right to Rescind Section 152(b) of the Equity Protection Act provides that high-rate, high-fee mortgage disclosures are ``material'' for purposes of the TILA. Proposed amendments to footnote 48 implement the change. The effect is to give consumers the right to rescind a high-rate, high-fee mortgage if a creditor fails to furnish the disclosures set forth in proposed ยง226.32(c) or provides for a prohibited credit term set forth in proposed ยง226.32(d).
