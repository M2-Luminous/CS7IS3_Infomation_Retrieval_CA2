The 13 economics professors of the Scientific Advisory Council are "no longer up to date on the current work," spokesman Veit Steinle said in Bonn on Thursday [10 February]. This regards the financing concept and capital resources of the operating companies. The Advisory Council has called the financing concept incomplete and the estimated cost of 8.9 billion marks, indicated by the Transport Ministry, unrealistic. The spokesman said that Germany has not had the best of experiences in the transport sector. Putting into practice future-oriented technologies has become a crucial problem for Germany as a business location. The willingness of German Railways head Heinz Duerr to use the Transrapid is a clear sign of courage and risktaking. This does, however, not exclude sober evaluations, the spokesman said.
