Defense Minister Datuk Sri Najib Tun Razak said it was rather disheartening to learn that the United States had formally informed Japan that it was opposed to the ASEAN proposal of the EAEC. He said it was rather surprising since the concept ideally promotes market-driven open regionalism and supports regional economic cooperation. He said this when opening the two-day fifth U.S.-Malaysia colloquium jointly organized by ISIS [Institute of Strategic and International Studies] Malaysia and the Asia Foundation in Washington. Datuk Sri Najib, in his opening remarks, said that he was aware of the domestic public opinion in the U.S. and even Congressional opposition to such an initiative, especially when it does not include the U.S. U.S. Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Winston Lord, who was present at the gathering, said that the U.S. had given its initial response on the EAEC proposal to its ASEAN friends as well as Japan.
