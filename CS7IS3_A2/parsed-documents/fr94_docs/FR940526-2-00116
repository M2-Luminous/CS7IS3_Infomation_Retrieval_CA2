FR940526-2-00116 FR940526-2-00063 6.3␣Miscellaneous Expense Data Collection Procedures Medical care items were surveyed consistent with the approach used in the Goods & Services component. For quality-control purposes, Runzheimer used its in-house research staff to conduct much of this survey. The following medical-care items were priced in each allowance area and in the Washington, D.C., area: •Nonprescription pain reliever. •Prescription drugs. •Vision check. •Dental service. •Doctor visit. •Hospital room. •Health insurance. Runzheimer computed a Medical Care subcategory price index for each item in each allowance area by comparing each local average price with the Washington, D.C., area average prices. These indexes were combined using weights derived from the CES to compute a Medical Care subcategory index for each allowance area. 6.4␣Miscellaneous Expense Survey Results Appendix 12 contains the results of Runzheimer's data collection and index calculations. As the appendix shows, the relative costs of the majority of the items in the Miscellaneous Component are based on surveyed prices. Therefore, the Miscellaneous Component index reflects living-cost differences among areas. The cost of only two items_life insurance/pensions and contributions_does not differ among areas. Although these two items together have a significant weight, one should keep in mind that the Miscellaneous Component has the smallest weight of the four components. Section 2.2 describes how the Miscellaneous Expense component indexes are combined with the other component indexes to derive the final index for each area.
