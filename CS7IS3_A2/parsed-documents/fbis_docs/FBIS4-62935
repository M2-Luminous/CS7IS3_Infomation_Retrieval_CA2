[Symonenko] Basically yes, because we received 86 legislative seats. However, there are other statistics. More than 10 million voters supported the bloc of leftist forces -- communists, socialists, and peasants -- which is, you should admit, a large figure. Still, we are not euphoric. At the same time, I would like to refute claims that Communists brought pensioners into parliament. The average age of the Communist deputies is 45. Only one is 60 years old. For the most part, however, these are mature, able-bodied, dynamic, and educated people, with vast life experience, who are ready to tackle important state issues. All of them know what the communist idea of old communists was all about and what they should come up with today. [Halchenko] With what intentions will you, as communist deputies, participate in sessions of the newly elected Ukrainian Supreme Council? [Symonenko] We understand very well that very serious and hard work awaits us in the Supreme Council. One needs to do a lot of things which the old parliament failed to do. It stands to reason that everything will depend on how constructive the deputies' work will be. This is why we, the Communists, actively participated in the preparations, and have focused our efforts on resolving certain issues before the session formally begins. From the very beginning, we want to show that instead of idle chatter, the Supreme Council should engage in constructive work and search for optimal solutions for emerging from the crisis, with due regard for differences of the regions, social groups, and everything affecting each voter, each of us. We also understand that people who voted for our representatives wanted to recover the social protection guarantees they had when real communists were in power. This makes us feel especially responsible. However, we realize very well that it is extremely hard to resolve all the problems that face us. We count on constructive work with all political forces and representatives of various industries in the Supreme Council. We will seek to find understanding of problems and a correct way out of the situation that has taken shape. [Halchenko] Still, are you going to raise political issues or will you focus on resolving state and economic issues? [Symonenko] We see adoption of a new Ukrainian constitution as the main political issue today. We will do our best to encourage citizens to actively discuss the constitution and advise the deputies as to what political system or, say, national symbols our state should have. People should be consulted on all important issues. This is a question of a long-term perspective. Today, we should be guided by the current Constitution, with all its changes and amendments, and work on a new one. We believe that economic problems need to be tackled from the very first session of the Supreme Council. After all, without an economy, no one can even talk about Ukraine's independence and sovereignty. Incidentally, this is something that Ukrainian President L. Kravchuk has repeatedly emphasized. I am sure there are millions of unemployed in our country right now. Every effort must be made to boost production. Taxation policies should be urgently brought in line with the interests of manufacturers. The financial and credit system needs to be revised, especially interest rates of the banks. The state should reassume one of its major functions -- managing the country's economic activities. We are for restoration of links with Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and other republics of the former Soviet Union. Only here we can find the market. It is no use to look for it in the West, and one should stop fooling the people in this regard. The Supreme Council should make a decision on entering the CIS. No associate membership will ever save us -- we will not be treated as an equal partner. If the people support privatization, laws should also be revised. If privatization, a change of ownership forms, does not encourage production, one should find out why. We, the Communists, are often criticized for our alleged opposition to privatization. But we simply cannot approve of this wild privatization. Many people buy out property through dummy fronts, lining their pockets and cashing in on the national wealth. Others are ready to sacrifice all of Ukraine. Instead of canceling privatization, we should see who has what goals, what legislation was approved, and why it prevents the staff of a privatized enterprise from becoming its real owner. [Halchenko] What is your attitude toward market reforms? [Symonenko] There are neither market relations nor the market itself in our country. It is a different thing, however, that some want to pull out their "idee fixe" -- to enter a formation of a new social quality. Our position is: transition to the market is a lengthy process. Under the slogans of demonopolization and privatization, we want to implement the theoretical goal pursued by the market -- manufacturing competitive products. There is no market in its pure definition in any country of the world. State policies are everywhere. They are used as guidelines for crafting a certain program that is financed by the state and regulates those processes. In our country, everything was farmed out to a certain circle of wheelers and dealers. [Halchenko] Will you uphold statehood of this country or will you press for a return to the Soviet Union? Many of our readers, Ukrainian citizens, are worried about this. [Symonenko] In our program, we have written: everything should be done to make Ukraine prosper and develop. We see this as our objective, because we realize that even though all Soviet peoples formally achieved some political and economic independence after the Soviet Union's breakup, life has become worse. This is why we stand for a union of equal states. We understand that this, too, is a lengthy process. At the initial stage, we will uphold the principles of economic and defense unions. And the process itself is the people's will. Communists call upon peoples of the former Union to live in peace, accord, friendship, and equal material conditions, so that they help each other and preserve familial relations, as they did in the past. [Halchenko] What do you think about the Socialist Party? Will your two parties remain united in tackling key issues for the country? [Symonenko] We have no disagreements with the Socialists. All efforts to drive a wedge between us are in vain. This is an attempt to split the entire leftist bloc. I am deeply convinced that it will not succeed. [Halchenko] What about the "Center" group? [Symonenko] I have already felt the intention of setting up two directions, which is a condition for setting up two centers -- one of L. Kuchma and other of the Supreme Council leadership. The Interregional Bloc for Reforms comes up with its own program. Not everyone supports it. We are for a situation where the parliament works in spite of all blocs and groups. Of course, there are questions on which we cannot compromise. This is an issue of land issue. During examination of this issue, we will say that the land is the people's property and can by no means be sold or purchased. This is a fundamental issue. We will reject opposite approaches. While some propose wild capitalization today, we say: there should be national state property. Private property is working property. If you can sew or produce something, go ahead. [Halchenko] In other words, you are for different forms of property? [Symonenko] Yes. But private property should only be working property. The current private property is all distorted. Governing structures and their heads are currently being bribed and degraded. Hence comes the corruption, and this entire vertical chain of command works not for the Ukrainian people, but to line their own pockets. This is why not only we, but also all working people protest against these kinds of commercial activities. We say it straightforward: a parasitical group has appeared that is making capital. We stand against this kind of commercialization of our state. [Halchenko] Are communist deputies going to raise a question of revising any economic laws -- on privatization, for example? [Symonenko] You cannot do everything in one fell swoop. If the fly-wheel is wound up, its huge momentum cannot be stopped right away. This is why everything needs to be examined, and only then can one make a decision. The stalling of a number of laws can only worsen the paralysis. Our main goal is that all reforms must be reexamined with due consideration of the interests of all people, and not of the 10-15 percent who are pleased with those laws. We will comply with the Constitution, which provides for setting up parliamentary commissions. We will join them and meet with the electorate, working teams, and consult with experts; and only after that, we will propose revision of specific legal acts. None of us will rattle the saber, as some try to make it out. We will clearly and resolutely carry out policies legally, in the interests of all people.
