He said the supply of the boosters will continue, while the technology will not be handed over. Shokhin pointed out that India was buying missile technologies rather that cryogenic boosters themselves. The contract stipulated that Russia was to supply two boosters each worth about $6 million to India. The first booster was to be delivered in 1995. After the contract is amended, the contract's value earlier estimated at $220 million may be slashed by over 80%, according to the Russian Space Agency. The new terms will be formulated in a stricter accordance with the requirements of the Missile Technology Control Regime. Russia signed a memorandum on its intention to observe its provisions in Washington on September 2 this year. The memorandum demands the necessary amendments should be made to the contracts running counter to the regime before January 1, 1994.
