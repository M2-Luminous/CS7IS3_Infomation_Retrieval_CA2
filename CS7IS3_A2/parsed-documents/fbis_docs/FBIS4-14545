However, a stabilization of production and the declining living standards is already noticeable. The government managed to curb inflation in late 1993 -- the key problem of the developing crisis. Therefore, I dare maintain that it is high time to begin the restoration and restructuring of the Lithuanian economy. It is very important to strengthen economic entities and orient them toward production, create dynamic businesses, and an efficient stratum of owners in this stage. Currently, important processes are going on in the country's economy. The creation of small- and medium-sized enterprises has gathered momentum, and they will undoubtedly have an important place in Lithuania's economy. However, it would be incorrect to think that the chaotic emergence of small and medium-sized businesses alone will make the country's priority industries competitive on the world market. Therefore, first of all, the government must make its choice, one way or another, concerning the "Program for Industrial Restructuring and Changing Specialization of Large Enterprises," which the Industry and Trade Ministry somehow managed to draft. One must immediately say, however, that this long-awaited program is only a compilation of theoretical statements. The program lacks a clear-cut expression. It is restricted to inarticulate theoretical postulates and propaganda. I suppose that this program must be promptly specified so as to make clear the development of which industries and enterprises will attract foreign investments, and which of them will be subject to protectionism, if you like. We must decide which strategy to follow, although the ways of its implementation may run counter to the interests of separate social groups. Speaking about other development programs for separate industries, which are being prepared or which have already been adopted, it must be noted that all of them are being drafted idly, as if fearing their execution and, which is even worse, the responsibility of their ruination. Judging by the conclusions of the preliminary analysis, one can claim that the coordination of the aforementioned programs is insufficient and the resources necessary for their implementation are not balanced. I fully agree with the prime minister's idea expressed in a radio program on 2 March, when he said that ministries must pass from the direct management of enterprises over to the creation of conditions for their activities. They must primarily support exporting enterprises. Finally, programs are necessary for ministries themselves to understand clearly what and how they are doing. I would like to mention the "National Program for the Development of Transportation in the Republic of Lithuania" adopted by the government as a positive example. Although I cannot agree with all of its principles, this program at least clearly outlines the position of the ministry and the government on this issue. [passage omitted] Speaking about the recently more heated debates on the tax system, I must say that Lithuania has accomplished much in restructuring its legal system. The laws on the incomes of physical persons, general and individual excise duties, customs duties, and market-places have been adopted. However, normative documents on taxes are constantly upgraded and amended, which evokes rightful reprimands for the lack of stability. The most prominent example of irresponsible decisions is the law on the VAT, adopted in late December 1993. Although the law has not yet come into force, its authors and the government are already proposing to amend it. Meanwhile, the same remarks were made when discussing this draft law. The current key issue in this sphere is the draft law on the principles of the tax system and the coordination of all tax laws. The package of tax laws is closely linked with investment, which is the essential factor for economic development. Privileges for duties on imported resources and export products should be one of the key factors for promoting exports and foreign investments. The policy of loans, guarantees, restrictions, tariffs, and, certainly, national currency should serve this purpose. The current perceptible tendency is to increase taxes, although the latter must be collected more efficiently from those who do not pay them at all or conceal part of their incomes. The current most important tasks in economic reform are the following: -- To immediately conclude the preparation of, correct, and adopt development and restructuring programs for all industries; to organize the activities of the Executive Branch strictly in line with these programs; -- To set up the State Property Agency; the Seimas [parliament] has already submitted its draft resolution on this issue; -- To discuss the draft law on stock companies in the Seimas as an emergency issue; -- To form a socially oriented market (by way of upgrading the tax system, the law on bankruptcies, and so on); -- To speed up privatization for investment coupons and immediately pass over to a qualitatively new stage in privatization; -- To act more energetically in attracting foreign investments; to establish the Foreign Investment Agency and the banking system to this end; -- To speed up the creation of the legal basis for taxes and other related issues; to adopt the law on the principles of the tax system in the first place; -- To normalize the economic and financial situation in industry, regulate inflation, and support social groups that are its greatest victims; -- To upgrade the structure of management and seek its greater efficiency; -- To make key production competitive on the Western market; -- To ensure the preservation of people's residential environment while restructuring industry; -- To resolve crime problems that are having a negative effect on economic reform and halting foreign investments; -- To prepare a program for the provision of resources (particularly in the energy system) by projecting their alternative sources; -- To work out a program for the development of tourism; -- To create a common Baltic market, remove customs houses between the Baltic states, and facilitate the movement of labor, capital, and goods among them.
