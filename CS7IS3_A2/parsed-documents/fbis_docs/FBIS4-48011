(Louis Sombe) has been picked up by the security forces, and the man suspected of being behind his fall is a supporter of Cameroon's ruling party, the CPDM [Cameroon People's Democratic Movement], as Victor Apie Ngome reports in this telex from Yaounde: (Louis Sombe), the controversial secretary general of Cameroon's Confederation of Trade Unions, was arrested in his office this morning together with his son and four other people. Mr. (Sombe) was having an early briefing session with some of his staff, when, after a manner that has become customary in Cameroon, policemen armed with tear gas canisters, truncheons, and submachine guns stormed the premises and whisked him away in a white Peugeot car toward unknown destination. His son and the other four people were driven off in a different direction. It appears that the union's president, Etame Ndedi, recently ordered (Sombe)'s dismissal, saying that the union had found him guilty of indiscipline, but Mr. (Sombe) ignored the order, saying that Mr. Etame Ndedi's so-called disciplinary committee had no power to sack him. Mr. Ntame Ndedi also hinted that Mr. (Sombe)'s financial records were not straight. Union sources say Mr. Ntame Ndedi had always complained that Mr. (Sombe)'s salary was too high and that he was living in luxury. Most union staff boycotted this morning's swearing in of the union's new secretary general, in solidarity with Mr. (Sombe), who is still widely respected as the workers' real representative. Many people have been expecting this arrest to happen and they believe that Mr. (Sombe)'s sacking has been masterminded by the government, in order to stop him leading a general strike in June. Mr. (Sombe) joined the massive strikes that paralyzed the civil service last December, thereby falling out with Mr. Ntame Ndedi, who is a member of the central committee of the ruling CPDM party, and who was against December's strike.
