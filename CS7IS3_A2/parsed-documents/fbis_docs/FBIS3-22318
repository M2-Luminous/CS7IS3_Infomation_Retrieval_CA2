According to Bhabha Atomic Research Centre director A.N. Prasad, aging could create two problems, namely, reduction in plant availability and--more importantly--safety. According to estimates 160 to 170 plants of different designs would have reached a service life of 25 years or more by the turn of the century. About 60 of them would be more than 30 years old. In addition, a very large number of research reactors would have to be decommissioned, having reached the end of their service life by that time. Most of these reactors were built when safety standards were still being evolved and regulatory requirements were much less stringent than now besides, the standards were set with the available data on performance statistics of the systems in relation to environmental factors. Mr. Prasad said operating experience of nearly 6,000 reactor years gained by the world nuclear community indicated that aging affected all plant systems, support systems, components and structures in varying degrees and heightened the risk to public health and safety unless controlled. Mr. Prasad said the problem of aging and related issues came into focus in the first ever international symposium of the international atomic energy agency in Vienna in 1987. Since then work in the field had been intensive as well as extensive. Studies led to identification of degradation of mechanisms such as corrosion, irradiation-assisted stress corrosion cracking, fatigues, wear due to flow-induced vibrations and embrittlement due to aging. Various laboratories had undertaken detailed studies of factors contributing to such degradation. In nuclear facilities other than power plants, such as heavy water plants, fuel fabrication plants, spent fuel reprocessing plants and high level waste vitrification plants, though the problem of aging was no less important, concerted efforts were not as intense. However, safety requirements in these facilities varied considerably. For instance, there was no serious risk of spread of radioactivity from heavy water plants or uranium fuel fabrication plants. While reprocessing and vitrification plants carried a large inventory of fissile materials and highly radioactive fission products, the operations involved relatively passive and slow systems. They do not experience high pressures and temperatures like power reactors, but their equipment operate under harsh and ambient conditions, particularly in the presence of highly corrosive chemicals and high radiation fields. However, their number was too small to generate adequate experience in the field. Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited managing director S.K. Chatterjee says the enormous cost of adding new capacity and lack of clearance for new sites for atomic stations had forced planners to consider extending operation of existing plants. This should be an important element in any nation's strategy to meet its growing power needs. Mr. Chatterjee said the prestigious Tarapur Atomic Power Station (TAPS), which completes 25 years in April, has not run its normal full course of design life and was now being readied to operate for 40 full-power years. However, studies indicated that there was ample margin in ductility of pressure vessels for operation up to 40 full-power years. In the light of stoppage of fuel supply from abroad and the embargo on supply of critical spares. TAPS was proposed to be run with indigenous Mixed Oxide Fuel (MOX) being developed along with enriched uranium. Apart from in-house development of spares, Indian industries were also being tapped for spares. While the Electronic Corporation of India has developed neutron detectors, the department of atomic energy has developed feedwater spargers of modified design and this has been fabricated by the industry. Mr. Chatterjee said in order to tackle the problem of aging, components were categorised as critical or otherwise depending upon their potential to cause spread of radiation within and outside the plant if they failed. New techniques were being evolved to inspect components, particularly those with accessibility problems and high radiation environment. New plants were proposed to be designed to enable easy replacement of such components. In the case of reactor vessels which undergo neutron bombardment, measures such as their situ annealing were being initiated to improve their ductility. Other measures contemplated included reducing the number of assemblies needed for the core. Mr. Chatterjee said the carbon steel and shields of Rajasthan Atomic Power Station-I (RAPS-I) and Madras Atomic Power Station-I (MAPS-I) were also likely to face the problem of enbrittlement. However, switchover to coolant channels of zirc-niobium alloy and stainless steel windshields had reduced chances of the problem arising in MAPS-2 and Kaiga in Karnataka. In the case of spent fuel reprocessing plants, aging led to steady deterioration of solvent extraction columns due to displacement of nozzle plates. There was also fouling and choking of the process piping due to insoluble generated. Besides, there was opaqueness of radiation shielding windows vital for remote operation and maintenance due to deterioration of oil, gaskets and plants by radiation. The experience gained in the operation of the first plant at Trombay to separate plutonium in the spent fuel discharged by cirus. The research reactor gave insight to Indian scientists into a number of problems of great significance to long-term operations of such plants.
