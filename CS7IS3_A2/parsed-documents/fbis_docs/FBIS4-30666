"Laotians should go home on a voluntary basis," said National Security Council deputy secretary-general Khachatphai Burutphat, "but some may not volunteer to go home and we may have to send them back in an orderly return program as Hong Kong has done with Vietnamese boat people." Mr. Khachatphai's remarks, made at the end of a two-day meeting which sought to speed up the repatriation of Laotians still encamped in Thailand, referred to the bilateral agreement between Hong Kong and Vietnam for the "orderly return" of boat people with no prospects of resettlement in the West. The meeting also drew senior officials from Laos and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The UNHCR's Thailand representative, Ruprecht von Arnim, said both Thailand and Laos agreed the repatriation process could continue for another year. The agreement conforms with the Comprehensive Plan of Action (CPA) which calls for solutions by the end of 1995 to the problem of Vietnamese and Laotians still encamped in this region. But Thailand still insists on closing its last camp for Laotians at Ban Na Pa in Nakhon Phanom by the end of this year. "We must emphasise the closure of the camp rather than the extension of the repatriation period," said Mr. Khachatphai. "There are many ways to persuade the remaining refugees to return on a voluntary basis." Thailand reportedly put the accent on the provision of training as part of its proposal to accelerate the repatriation process. The Thai proposal calls for returnees be put in a kind of half-way house in Laos pending full reintegration into the country. The Laotian side led by Don Somvolachit of the Foreign Ministry's Department of Europe and America Affairs, proposed two new settlement sites for the returnees in the central provinces of Khammouane and Bolikhamsai. The UNHCR will inspect the sites and draw up a financial plan for the projects, said Mr. von Arnim. As part of the effort to speed up repatriation, he said the meeting discussed deterrents and incentives. The UNHCR raised the possibility of halving the allowances granted to returnees -- now set at 2,000 baht per person -- if they return after 30 September. Laos said it would give those arriving before that date carpentry tools and housing items.
