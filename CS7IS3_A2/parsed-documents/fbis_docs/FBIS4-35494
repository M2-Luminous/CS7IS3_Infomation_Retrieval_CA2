FBIS4-35494 "drnes105_r_94003" FBIS-NES-94-105 Daily Report 27 May 1994 SOUTH ASIA India Papers Condemn U.S. Diplomat's Remarks on Missile Papers Condemn U.S. Diplomat's Remarks on Missile Wisner Said To `Create Critics' BK3105133594 Delhi THE HINDUSTAN TIMES in English 27 May 94 p 13 BK3105133594 Delhi THE HINDUSTAN TIMES English BFN [Editorial: "Deploying Prithvi"] [Text] True to promise, US Ambassador-designate Frank Wisner has warned India against deploying the Prithvi missiles despite his lack of knowledge as to whether the weapon is configured to carry a nuclear warhead. The easy inference is that it is neither nuclear capability and a tested delivery system nor the violation of the arbitrary Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), the norms of which do not cover the Prithvi, which bothers Washington. What clearly does is India's demonstrable military superiority over Pakistan. All strategic experts have averred that the Prithvi does not really threaten China, for it cannot reach a significant target beyond the buffer territory of Tibet. So it must be concluded that the short-range missile may be deployed only to threaten Pakistan. The warning that Mr Wisner, a Pentagon policy expert, has issued is transparently aimed at assuring Pakistan whose President, Mr Farooq Leghari, is in Washington apparently to work out the details of a Pakistan agreement to cap its nuclear programme. The queer aspect of the episode is that Mr Wisner is consciously using the run-up before taking over as ambassador in New Delhi to create critics rather than friends. He must have the full assurance of the State Department that he would be none the worse for the handicap run. The US opposition against the deployment of the Prithvi, first articulated by Senator [as published] Lee Hamilton before Mr Narasimha Rao set out for Washington and now by Mr Wisner when the Prime Minister is back in India makes it clear that this short-range missile is at the moment on top of the US agenda for India. This can create complications for Mr Narasimha Rao, who pledged in Parliament that the Prithvi would be user-tested after the few days postponement he ordered not to cause an irritation before his US visit. The expected date, May 23, has passed off without the test. But the Army, defence scientists and district officials of Balasore in Orissa are all waiting in readiness, with the hope that the exercise will take place before May is out. Mr Rao may go ahead with the trial, because the Americans have not objected to this (the opposition is to the Prithvi's deployment). But suspicions about accommodating America's "friendly persuasions" will continue unless the Government makes a public announcement that it has actually deployed the missiles. The postponement of the Prithvi trial was probably seen by the US as capping the programme. What it perhaps expects now is a roll-back, which is exactly the opposite of the weapon's deployment. The Agni, being still an experiment, is the lesser evil of India's missile programme that the US wishes to curb. The myth of US arm-twisting will not be blasted by presenting an Indian arm intact. If there is need for complete transparency, it is in diplomatic exchanges between New Delhi and Washington. Even whispers would send out eloquent messages in a regime of quiet diplomacy.
