Bapela proposed the plan yesterday at a meeting attended by more than 200 SDU members. The meeting was seeking ways and means of reintegrating members of the SDUs into society. Also present were MEC [Member of the Executive Committee] for Safety and Security Jesse Duarte and Education MEC Mary Metcalf. Bapela said the levy would fall under a general services charge to help reinstate "a culture of payment". The campaign is centred on creating jobs for the unemployed members of the defence units and to send them back to school should they so wish. Speaking yesterday at Katlehong's Las Vegas hall, Metcalf told members of SDUs on the East Rand that those who had the responsibility of defending the community should be afforded the chance to learn. The plan for education rested on two pillars: what to do with those who wanted to go back to school or those who thought it unlikely they would go back. The education plan would comprise four phases: - A go-back-to-school programme for those between the ages of 13 and 18; - A programme for the 19-to-25-year-olds willing to go to school and to integrate those unwilling to return to school into the police force or reservists; - An illiteracy-combating programme which would also involve life-skills training; and - Psychological and counselling support for those plagued by many years of war in the area. Mr Nazir Carrim of the PWV legislature's education desk said support had been received from Dr Saths Cooper of the Family Institute, Lloyd Vogelman of Wits University and other experts. For those between the ages of 13 and 18, a school re-orientation programme will begin next month and run until December with the idea of integrating them into normal schools at the beginning of next year. In a frank admission, Duarte said it was true that some SDU members had been involved in criminal activities. She said the time for action, and not rhetoric, had come. She also said police had expressed a willingness to take people into their reservist force, but communities had to agree on who would be allowed in. Those who were involved in criminal activities would be left out. Duarte also said they had consulted with industry on the East Rand about job creation. Most industries had expressed concern at the high level of violence and it was important for the area to achieve stability before investment in the area could be expected. Housing MEC Mr Dan Mofokeng has identified a development plan in Germiston, she said. The project could create employment for some SDU members. Duarte also announced that Housing Minister Mr Joe Slovo had approved PWV premier Mr Tokyo Sexwale's plan to build 150,000 low-cost houses in the next 12 months.
