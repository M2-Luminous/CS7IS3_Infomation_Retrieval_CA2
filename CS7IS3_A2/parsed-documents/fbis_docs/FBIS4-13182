But even by my standards I believe that a lot of time has passed, and that it has been wasted, and that the approach to peace has not been characterized by the required determination by all parties to the conflict, and all involved in trying to get it to achieve its objectives are sponsoring these efforts; that all this has with the passage of time caused a psychological setback so that the overwhelming majority of people in this region who showed great optimism and enthusiasm for peace have had their hopes dampened with the passage of time. As far as I am concerned, it is a time for all to reassess and to move deliberately and seriously to achieve the desired results. No more time can be wasted. As for violence, we abhor and condemn it wherever it occurs. This is the history of Jordan, which has suffered as a result of violence and which has stood time and again squarely in the face of violence as it affected innocent people anywhere in the world. This does not change or waver. But violence in the recent times is most disturbing and distressing and the zenith of violence was the tragedy that occurred in Hebron on a Friday morning and in the mosque. Beyond that, there have been actions and reactions and our hearts go out to the victims and to the families of the victims, wherever they be and whoever they are. But in regard to that dimension as well, I feel that the Government of Israel should admit, or have the courage to admit, that it has, and it bears, a responsibility in terms of violence that has been growing in the occupied territories and in the region. On the other hand, I feel very, very strongly that the unfortunate target of the Hebron massacre or any other act that has followed is the peace process, is the hope for a different region were people can live under conditions which had been denied us over a very, very long period of time, in fact, which we haven't known throughout our lives. If this is the case, then something has to be done about it, and there has to be the realization that such acts are carried out to drive us away from the goal of attaining and achieving a just, honorable, durable peace in the region. On an internal Jordanian matter -- before the prime minister of Israel and the foreign minister of Israel made their statements -- we, on the highest level of authority in this country, have been looking at developments in the region and had decided to reemphasize our unwavering position adopted after deep discussion at the Rabat summit in 1974 recognizing and nominating the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of the people of Palestine in response to a Palestinian wish and Arab wish, with which we agreed. And ever since then we have tried to our utmost to realize this position in terms in every action that we have taken, including providing the umbrella for the joint delegation, in other words, the Jordanian-Palestinian delegation, to go to Madrid, the Palestinians being the representatives of the Palestinian people regarding their rights on their legitimate soil -- and despite the surprise of Oslo we had to adhere, as we always do to our policy and perspective, and we emphasize the need to support the PLO. And, more concretely, we ratified the Jordanian-Israeli agenda following the ratification of the Israeli-Palestinian agreement in Washington in support of the Palestinians and their right to act in terms of the interests of the Palestinian people on Palestinian soil, and to move to resolve our own problems. So, this is the background. As far as we are concerned on this land, the territories of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, we do not recognize or accept to cooperate with anybody representing or professing to represent our Palestinian brethren except the Palestine Liberation Organization, the sole legitimate representative of the people of Palestine, through its recognized organs and representatives here in Jordan. Any other group is illegal in terms of any actions it takes or position it feels or claims to represent. And I call upon all Jordanians to realize this fact, and to adhere to this consistent policy that has been that of the government and the kingdom over so many years. [Unidentified reporter] What is the legal status of the Hamas presence in Jordan, and are you planning to take any action against them to ensure that the PLO remains the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinians? [Husayn] There is no legal status. [Reporter] I mean [Hamas leaders] Mr. Nazzal and Mr. Ghawshah... [Husayn,interrupting] I think that if they chose to behave as Jordanians, then that's fine, they will be amongst the other Jordanians, members of this family. If they choose otherwise, then they will have to answer for that, but there is no legal status. [Reporter] Your Majesty, it was the first time that since the beginning of the peace process that Jordan links its continuation of its participation in the peace process to a condition, which is in this case the lifting of the blockade of al-'Aqabah. Now, can we deduce from here that in view of these pressures it is becoming, and due to the declining enthusiasms for the peace process, Jordan feels that the price of continuing the peace process--in view of these pressures--is becoming too high, and that Jordan at one point, due to public opinion pressure, or due to economic pressure, reconsider its role in the peace process, or its participation to begin with? [Husayn] Nothing could be further from the truth. I think others should review their positions regarding the peace process. Jordan has not backed away, nor has Jordan showed any reluctance to serious dialogue and negotiations towards achieving the resolution of all our standing problems as outlined in the Jordanian-Israeli agenda leading to the desired peace and peace treaty as a crowning achievement of resolving these problems. We have been ready. We don't see anybody responding to that yet. So we hope that not only on this track but on every track we will see movement so that the final result is a comprehensive peace that we all seek for this entire region. Regarding al-'Aqabah, we feel that there was a deliberate policy to pick out Jordan from all the neighbors of Iraq following the tragedy of the Gulf and to treat it in a manner that is unacceptable. We've tried to correct this by every means possible over the years, but things have reached the point where we would like to know what is this policy and what is its objective and who is behind this policy. Is it the Security Council? Is it one single nation? Is it the coalition of countries of the Gulf war? We find it deeply humiliating and we find that one of the obvious objectives is to tarnish the credibility of Jordan. We accepted Security Council resolutions as they affect Iraq and we implemented them and we are implementing them. But the integrity and credibility of this country is something that we can't bargain over. And in fact these recent accusations of Jordan and Jordan's involvement with terror, contrary to everything else known about this country, may unfortunately, whether intentionally or otherwise, fall in the same stream. Regarding the Gulf crisis, our position was honorable and was one of concern regarding all in this region, and then eagerness to try to resolve the terrible mistake by Arab means and within the context of the Arab family. Unfortunately, we were unable to do nothing that would have brought us close to our targets, we were unable to succeed with either side in terms of the powers that stood facing each other until the disaster occurred. We are unhappy about the conditions of the people of Iraq. We are really concerned with them. As far as the policies of the government and the leadership of Iraq, we have nothing to do with their policies and unfortunately the last time I was able to discuss policies with the leadership in Iraq was the time I visited Baghdad before the war, and I came back brokenhearted because I met failure there, as I had met it with the coalition and with the other parties to the terrible tragedy that has occurred there. We have accepted the Security Council resolutions. We have implemented them. We are implementing them to the best of our ability. So what is the sense of continuing this situation as far as al-'Aqabah is concerned? We would like to know what is happening and we would like to have assurances that we are close to the end of this situation before we are able to determine exactly where we go from here. But as far as the peace process is concerned, we are very interested in it. In fact, we did more to get it to move in the first place than any. And here, I'd like to point out that we did not go as a government alone. We had, to the best of our ability, a debate in this country through a meeting that was attended by all elected bodies in this country and representative bodies looked at our options and decided to go. We did not go there because of any pressure. We do not succumb to pressure, from any quarter. We go... [pauses] whatever we do in this world, driven by our conscience and our sense of responsibility towards our people and the people in this region and the future of all.
