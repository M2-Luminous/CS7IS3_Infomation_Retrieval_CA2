The constitutional bill of the Slovak opposition to hold early elections in November did not get the necessary three-fifths (90) of the votes in parliament today. The opposition does, however, have a chance to push through a resolution on referendum as a simple majority of the votes in the 150-member parliament is required for it to be approved. The opposition has not yet come up with such a suggestion. "The resolution would be a way out of the current crisis and then the question what to do with the privatization law and a vote of no confidence in parliament could be discussed. These things should be decided by all parties on the highest level," Miklosko said. "The prospects for the dismissal of the cabinet of Premier Vladimir Meciar have become very complicated," he said. "It is one thing to dismiss the government and another to compose a new one," Miklosko said alluding to the stand of the Hungarian minority coalition. The coalition of the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement (MKDH) and the Egyutteles movement made it clear that it would support a new cabinet provided the opposition promised in a written form to meet the Hungarian minority demands. Therefore votes of the 14 Hungarian deputies could prove to become decisive under the current stalemate distribution of forces between the coalition and the opposition. "The position of Hungarian deputies is very problematic and we therefore do not have enough votes to compose a new government by ourselves," Miklosko said. Referring to the intention of the governing Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) to start collecting 350,000 signatures on Monday [21 February] to call a referendum on holding parliamentary elections in June, Miklosko said that "it was an absolutely unrealistic plan." "I regard it as an unambiguous attempt to exert pressure. To call elections in June is unrealistic," Miklosko said, adding that if a resolution binding the president to call a referendum is passed by parliament it would become impossible to call two referendums on early elections.
