This idea has undergone a marked evolution in Meshkov himself in recent weeks -- from abrasive statements about secession from Ukraine to prudence, a phased approach, and reasonableness in everything concerning the peninsula' future. In this regard some people are already talking about Yuriy Meshkov's repudiation of basic points in his manifesto -- the Crimea's return to the ruble zone, the granting of the right of dual citizenship to the republic's citizens, and the lifting of the moratorium on a referendum on the status of Crimea. Some people regard this as a move away from the fundamental line of rapprochment with Russia and a tentative move toward Ukraine. But these unduly categorical and overstraightforward judgments do not match up to reality. He is not repudiating his manifesto and its basic points. Meshkov is simply acting as a level-headed, prudent politician occupying a centrist position rather than swinging in one or the other directon. "I am not an advocate of conflict between the Crimea and Ukraine," Meshkov told journalists recently. "I am an advocate of maintaining and developing our prevailing links with Russia and other CIS countries. The process of acquiring autonomy is not something you accomplish in a day. It is a long process of negotiation. Moreover, Crimea's autonomy has to be supported by the people of the peninsula in a referendum." The stance of the Crimea's first president on military questions is as follows: In addition to Black Sea Fleet units, a considerable number of Ukrainian ground troops are stationed in the Crimea; in this regard the Crimea will as an autonomous republic propose to Russia and Ukraine the demilitarization of the Crimea, with its defense secured as part of the Commonwealth's collective security system. According to Meshkov, it is essential to maintain in the Crimea on a treaty basis only the Russian Black Sea Fleet base, border subunits, and the air defense system. Citizens of the peninsula should perform their military service exclusively in the Crimea, with service outside the Crimea solely on a contract basis. While in the future compulsory military service is to be abolished. Crimea does not need its own army apart from a small republic guard. As far as Sevastopol is concerned, Meshkov's opinion is that it forms an inalienable part of the Crimea and should remain the Russian Black Sea Fleet's main base.
