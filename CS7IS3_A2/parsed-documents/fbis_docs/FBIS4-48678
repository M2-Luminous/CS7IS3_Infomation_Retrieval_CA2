The spokesman said the bullet, which had been fired by a light weapon, had left a hole in one of the plane's wings. The incident was not discovered until the plane was inspected on its arrival back in Nairobi. The spokesman said the bullet must have been fired either when the plane was landing at Kigali or taking off. It was not known when the UN Assistance Mission to Rwanda would resume its relief flights to Rwanda. The spokesman said the military would be consulting engineers to decide what needed to be done to make the Hercules safe. With a shaky truce more or less holding, a UN special envoy flew into Kigali Tuesday to discuss the deployment of 5,500 troops the United Nations hopes to muster, in a bid to protect civilians and safeguard relief convoys. Meanwhile relief workers reported Tuesday that thousands of Rwandans were fleeing Kigali before the expected rebel takeover of the capital, which they fear will usher in reprisals for the massacres of Tutsis. Up to half a million people have been butchered in ethnic bloodletting since April.
