The Chinese Government is likely to launch its own campaign to promote the special administrative region (SAR) passports for local people before 1997, while "ignoring" a British request for help in seeking visa-free treatment for holders of British National Overseas (BNO) passports. China's SAR passport plan will be discussed at a two-day Preliminary Working Committee sub-group meeting starting in Beijing this morning. A discussion paper has been compiled by the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office and distributed to members of the sub-group on law and order, who arrived in Beijing yesterday. A source said the Chinese Government was almost certain to reject an earlier request by Britain to help lobby other countries for visa-free arrangements for holders of the BNO passports after 1997. "The BNO passport is entirely a matter for the British Government. It has nothing to do with the Chinese Government. Also, it might not be appropriate for China to lobby on behalf of the countries who issued the document," the source said. The source said that Beijing would expect SAR passports to be more acceptable than BNO passports to the people of Hong Kong after 1997. "I don't see why the Chinese Government should give a hand to the British side to lobby other countries over the BNO passports. "The Chinese Government is confident that the SAR passports will be accepted widely given that visa-free arrangements are mutually beneficial. So long as Hong Kong is still an international city people from all over the world will expect to continue to have exemption from visas when entering Hong Kong. If they want that they will also have to exempt visas for holders of the SAR passports," the source said. The source maintained that the British Government might suffer if it decided not to give visa-free treatment to SAR passport holders. "If they do so, the Chinese Government can make similar requirements for British nationals when entering Hong Kong after 1997," he said. Speaking in Beijing, the Hong Kong co-convenor of the law and order sub-group, Rita Fan Hsu Lai-tai, said the promotion work for the SAR passports should be launched as early as possible to secure a visa-free deal for its holders. She said preparations for issuing SAR passports could be made before 1997 but stressed that the document would only become valid after formal endorsement by the SAR government. Mrs Fan said it would be difficult for China to make a commitment that holders of the British-issued BNO would have entry to the SAR, which was part of China.
