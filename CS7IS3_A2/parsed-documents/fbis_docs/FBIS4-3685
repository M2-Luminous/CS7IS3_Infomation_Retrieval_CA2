In two and half hours of formal talks here this morning, the two leaders agreed to pace up work to turn previously-reached agreements into a legal form and, meanwhile, continue friendly negotiations on the remaining issues, according to a Chinese spokesman. With sincerity from both sides, the two leaders are confident that the border issue "will be successfully resolved in not too long a time," the spokesman said. Li said that an early agreement on the border issue will be of great significance to the enhancement of Sino-Kyrgyz relations. He also hoped to see the common border become "a bond of peace and friendship as well as a bridge towards the promotion of economic prosperity." Akayev, voicing agreement with Li's remarks, said Kyrgyzstan hopes to solve the border problem left over from history at an early date. China and Kyrgyzstan share more than 1,000 kilometers of common border. Kyrgyzstan fully understands that an early settlement of the border issue will be of great importance to the promotion of mutual trust and friendship between the two countries, the president said. He described Li's visit as "of historic significance to the further promotion of Kyrgyz-Chinese relations." What's more, China's clear-cut principles for developing friendly relations with Central Asian nations, which Premier Li stated in the Uzbek capital of Tashkent, are of great significance to peace and stability in the whole Central Asian region, including Kyrgyzstan, he said. As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, China plays a special positive role in international affairs, he noted, adding that Kyrgyzstan will learn from China's experiences, including those in handling international relations. He hoped that the two countries would maintain consultations and cooperation in international organizations. Li said China is ready to work for the constant growth of its traditional friendship with Kyrgyzstan. Akayev asked Li to convey his invitation for President Jiang Zemin to visit Kyrgyzstan, saying the augment of his country's overall cooperation with China is "in the paramount national interests of Kyrgyzstan" and represents a priority in its foreign policy. Akayev agreed with Li's proposal for building up a new silk road, saying Kyrgyzstan will work towards the establishment of such a path of cooperation and friendship. "Kyrgyzstan will always see China as a friendly neighbor and a reliable partner of Central Asian nations," the spokesman quoted Akayev as saying. Akayev, in evaluating the momentum of bilateral trade and economic cooperation, said China has become an important trade partner of Kyrgyzstan. He expected to see bilateral trade and economic cooperation raised to a new high. He also invited Chinese enterprises to invest in Kyrgyzstan. A high-level delegation of Chinese entrepreneurs is traveling with Premier Li throughout the tour of Central Asia. Kyrgyzstan has set up joint ventures with China's Xinjiang Autonomous Region with positive results, he said, adding that vast potentials exist in this regard. Li agreed that China and Kyrgyzstan should expand cooperation in trade, economic, scientific, technological, cultural and other fields. While bilateral trade has seen considerable growth in the past few years, this has been primarily achieved within border trade, Li said. "I agree that bilateral economic trade cooperation should be expanded on the basis of equality and mutual benefit." He said that the Chinese Government adopts a positive attitude towards Chinese enterprises' investment in kirghizstan. On regional issues, Li said China supports the maintenance of central Asian nations' friendly relations with each other and with Russia. Akayev said that the central Asian nations' relations with Russia are "historically formed over the years and it is very important to maintain a good relationship with each other." During the talks, the two leaders also had an in-depth exchange of views on other regional issues.
