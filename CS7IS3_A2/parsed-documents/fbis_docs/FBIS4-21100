[prefecture], April 4 KYODO -- Police said Monday [4 April] they have arrested a man from Singapore on suspicion of smuggling psychotropic drugs with a market value of 20 million yen into Japan. Loh Seng Chow, 39, a machinist, arrived at Tokyo's Narita airport from Bangkok on March 16 without his luggage, which had been mistakenly left behind. During a routine check of Loh's unaccompanied luggage, which arrived on another flight 20 minutes later, customs officials found almost 20,000 tablets packed into vinyl bags, hidden in the hood of a jumper. Loh was apprehended soon afterward at a nearby hotel for allegedly violating the Narcotic Control Law, police said. It is the biggest haul of psychotropic drugs ever confiscated at Narita and the second highest amount nationwide. Loh told investigators he received the drugs from a female he met by chance in Bangkok who promised to pay 50,000 yen for the successful delivery of the drugs to Japan. Depending on the dosage, psychotropic or mind-expanding drugs produce a wide range of effects including hallucinations and altered sensations. Abuse has become widespread in Japan, especially among young people. With this latest case, the overall amount of psychotropic drugs confiscated this year comes to about 45,000 tablets, more than the entire amount of drugs recovered for the whole of last year.
