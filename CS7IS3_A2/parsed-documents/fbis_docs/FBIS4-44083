[passage omitted] Jean-Luc Dehaene made a statement after the Corfu summit. He remains a candidate and (?takes note of) the British veto. Here is his statement recorded by our special correspondent in Corfu: [Begin Dehaene recording] I can see that Great Britain opposed my election, not for personal or national reasons, but for reasons of principles. In order not to make the work of the German presidency more difficult, I will not make any more statements about the issue of the presidency until the German presidency organizes the special summit. I am disappointed for Europe today. However, I am calm about the whole situation. Indeed, I did not put myself up as a candidate. At the request of some colleagues, I was and I remain available, if necessary, if a consensus is reached. However, I am not desperate. As I have said on several occasions over the last few days, the results of the European elections in Belgium, and especially in Flanders, have reinforced my desire as prime minister to achieve all of the government's program. I am convinced that it will transpire at the end of my mandate that I will get the support of voters to devote myself and commit myself to many more years at the service of Belgium and Europe.
