Pascal Amani Kouadio was at the airport yesterday and reports the following: [Begin recording] [Kouadio] The prime minister arrived at Port-Bouet airport at 2100 on board the presidential plane from Ouagadougou, where he attended the UEMOA summit. He was welcomed at the airport by government officials. The prime minister spoke about the Ouagadougou summit: [Duncan] The Ouagadougou meeting examined three issues: first, the devaluation; second, UEMOA; and third, the West African Economic Community [CEAO]. Concerning the devaluation, two months after this measure it was needful for the heads of state and the governments of the UEMOA area to review issues relating to this measure, to find out about the various measures being taken by each state regarding the devaluation, to find out how negotiations with the Bretton Woods institutions, the IMF, and the World Bank are progressing, and how our cooperation with France on this matter is proceeding. On this matter, I can say that generally things are progressing well. With the exception of only one state, all arrangements with the Bretton Woods institutions will be finalized by the end of this month. It is important to stress this. I would also like to state that inflation has been relatively well controlled and in line with projections. Nevertheless, the heads of state present at the meeting expressed the desire for a number of actions to be carried out. First, communication must be intensified among the populations to explain the devaluation better and to indicate -- and this is important -- that it is an opportunity for our countries to forge ahead. We would like to underline here that this is the final devaluation. There is no question of a second devaluation, because no indicators point to this. It is important to state this and I believe all the heads of state and participants, including the Bretton Woods institutions and certainly France, have taken good note of this. Also, the backup measures announced during the signing of the various agreements are proceeding on schedule in all the states. It was therefore agreed to have regular meetings of this kind so that UEMOA partners can coordinate their actions. It was also decided to hold a meeting at the latest in June with members of the Bank of Central African States, so that all the members of the franc zone countries can coordinate their positions. It is also important to stress that trade in goods and services within the UEMOA must be developed, and this permits me to go to the second point, which is the issue of the UEMOA. As you are aware, the UEMOA agreement was signed at Dakar on 11 January, but due to the devaluation the signing of the UEMOA agreement was somewhat relegated to the background. At the Ouagadougou meeting, the heads of state have, so to say, very much insisted on the need to proceed with integration, and it was therefore advocated that all the member states, except one -- for reasons peculiar to this state -- ratify the UEMOA agreement by 30 April. With regard to the state concerned, because of internal reasons that ratification is expected to take place before 30 June, so that we can have a basic legal instrument which would permit us to forge ahead toward integration. This is an important chance we can seize, and as we have made considerable progress on West African issues, we intend to move quickly to reinforce solidarity within the UEMOA member states. The last issue examined concerned the West African Economic Community. It was difficult for two economic bodies to coexist in the area. The CEAO heads of state conference has therefore decided to dissolve the CEAO and has instructed the council of ministers to see to the liquidation of this body and take measures to settle issues relating to its personnel.
