Yegorov, Cancer Research Institute at the Tomsk Scientific Center of Russia's Academy of Medical Sciences and Institute of Computer-Aided Control and Radio Engineering Systems, Tomsk; UDC 614.71/.73-07] [Abstract] The shortcomings of the existing environmental pollution monitoring systems and the inadequacy of the data interpolation procedures whereby the contamination levels are assessed objectively only at the sampling spots prompted the development of new methodological approaches to identifying territories with different man-caused atmospheric air pollution levels on the basis of terrestrial monitoring and remote sensing data obtained from space using such revealing traits as dust and aerosol fraction discharges which accompany air pollution. The aerospace information is received from a regional center in the form of photographs taken simultaneously within three spectral bands (0.8-0.9, 0.6-0.7, and 0.5-0.6 ï¿½m) by a Kosmos satellite with a medium resolution multispectral scanner. The pictures are digitized at 256 brightness level and subsequently processed as numerical matrices. The conclusion is drawn that the optical contrast level of aerial and space video images of the territory correlates with the atmospheric contamination index (IZA) thus reflecting the man-caused air pollution and making it possible to use it as the atmospheric purity criterion. The principal advantages of the method are the reliability, data representation form, and the possibility of identifying the pollution source within the abnormal optical contrast zone as well as the convenience of assessing the pollution dynamics by comparing the pictures taken within a certain period, thus obviating systematic ground-level monitoring in order to determine the toxic substance concentration and analyze the near-surface concentration fields.
