"For the first time men's life expectancy has dropped below pension age, deformed children are being born, and Russians are on the threshold of irreversible changes beyond which the collapse of the state and the death of the peoples are possible," Zlotnikova wrote in her letter to Yeltsin. Less than 0.6 percent of the expenditure section of the budget, or 0.15 percent of the gross domestic product, is earmarked for ecological programs. That has never happened in a single civilized or even not very civilized country, although the troubled and in places catastrophic nature of the ecological situation is obliging people to increase financing for environmental conservation at least to some extent. According to some figures, the ecological damage throughout the country in 1993 totaled 15 trillion rubles, and this year it is forecast at 43 trillion, which is over 40 times the expenditure envisaged on ecology in the budget.
