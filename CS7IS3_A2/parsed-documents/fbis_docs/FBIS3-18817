Quizzed on Italian radio as to the findings of Commission Chairman Ugo Pecchioli, Mancino said: "I did not keep silent. When the (embezzled) funds were returned thanks to the work of a magistrate, I considered it a correct operation, and there is no obligation to report a correct operation. Subsequently, no one informed me when a judicial inquiry began. I read it in the papers like the Rt. Honourable Pecchioli, so we were in the same position". Mancino also reiterated the view that even if he had known of the probe and informed the Commission, he would have exposed himself to charges of breaking judicial secrecy. "If I had known of the preventive detention measures and had spoken to the Secret Service Commission, notwithstanding the fact that that Commission is bound to secrecy and in particular to state secrecy, no one would have spared me the accusation of violating a judicial secret," he said. In a separate issue related to the Sisde probe, Electoral Reform Minister Leopoldo Elia today rejected the contention that President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro should step down after the March 27-28 elections to defend himself from charges of pocketing Sisde cheques like other interior ministers before and after him. Elia stressed that the much-debated statement from Rome prosecutors on Thursday [3 March] had cleared Scalfaro of all imputations against him, "just as it would have done for a normal citizen." He also pointed out that the Italian Constitution "lays down a much stronger bond of continuity for the president than for government or Parliament." Scalfaro's term of office is due to end in 1999. Some political forces, notably the Northern League, have indicated they will press for his resignation if they win the elections.
