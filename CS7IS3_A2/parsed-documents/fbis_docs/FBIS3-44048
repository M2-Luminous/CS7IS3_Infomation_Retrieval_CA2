It were gymslips, heckling, and corn on the cob for President FW de Klerk on his "beer bus, balloons bonanza" election trip through Western Transvaal on Friday [21 January]. In Rustenburg, taking a presidential stroll down the street, he was heckled by African National Congress [ANC] supporters. But at the Dwarsfontein farm near Ventersdorp, he strolled down a dirt road hand-in-hand with black children, and later enjoyed sizzling hot cob on the corn prepared while he had been making his speech. At Rustenburg, Mr de Klerk dropped into the National Party [NP] offices, situated near a gym, where he had a quick work-out. Slender bimbos capable of dethroning many an international beauty queen leisurely bided their time in the narrow Rustenburg Street where the gym is situated, giving passersby the lazy eye treatment. Later that evening, Mr de Klerk addressed a banquet attended by both black and white guests at the Eben Marais Hall. Shouts of "Viva, NP, Viva" reverberated through the hall, the white guests casually adapting themselves to the changed political circumstances. Anyone shouting "viva" a few years ago was likely to become the object of intense security police scrutiny. En route to Rustenburg, Mr de Klerk hopped aboard the media bus for an impromptu chat with the press, maize fields flashing past in the bus window behind him. Despite laudatory efforts by his election team to lay on additional telephone lines to remote farms, and accommodating the press in each possible way, television crew members complained of being pumped in the ribs by police tough treatment specialists as they dogged Mr de Klerk's footsteps. A financial newspaper reporter who coined the "balloon bonanza" description for the road show initially worried that more stones were thrown in Fochville than there were balloons, but his description was validated at the banquet on Friday night where helium-filled balloons bobbed above the diners. Amid this festive decor on Friday night, Mr de Klerk warned Conservative Party [CP] supporters against being led over the edge to violence and crime. The CP had had numerous chances to prove its support, he said, but lost the 1983 referendum, the 1987 election, the 1989 election and the 1992 referendum. On Saturday he will be in Vryburg -- one of the few certainties in South African politics.
