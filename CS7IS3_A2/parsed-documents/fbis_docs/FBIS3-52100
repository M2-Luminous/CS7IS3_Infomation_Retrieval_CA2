This criticism indeed has nothing whatsoever to do with the recent crisis. In this crisis, all the Palestinian people stand by the negotiating delegation and the Palestinian leadership to establish the Palestinian rights. [Al-Dimirdash] The crisis Dr. Sha'th is talking about is represented in the pressure the Israeli side is putting on the PLO to accept Cairo proposals. Are there new bases for resuming negotiations this time? [Sha'th] Our constant and basic commitment is to the Declaration of Principles signed in Washington on 13 September. There is no specific document called the Cairo document. We worked out a document in Norway that outlined the points of agreement and disagreement. There is no similar document developed in Cairo. There were minutes dictated by Minister Peres. The next day, we received a document totally different from those minutes. We sent a correction and later sent Palestinian ideas. [Al-Dimirdash] What is the PLO's stand on Rabin's hardline statements today, in which he implied that negotiations might not be resumed if the Palestinians do not accept the draft agreement? [Sha'th] We do not accept ultimatums. If the Israelis halt negotiations, we will go back to the two sponsors who signed the agreement that should have been implemented on a specific date. The Israelis have shown no commitment until now. We do not want to escalate the situation. But we reject the Israeli escalation and want real negotiations that lead to an acceptable agreement.
