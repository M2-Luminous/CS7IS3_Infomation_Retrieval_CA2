I say important meeting because the businessmen from the Netherlands are accompanied by a trade mission from 22 companies, which will study at first hand the possibilities of investing in the construction of waterworks and port facilities, in the textile industry, and in food products. Also present are representatives from important financial banks and legal assistance. According to the chairman of the Dutch party, Wuliam Want Waut [identified by caption], the objective is to activate this group after years of regrettable immobility. [Begin Wuliam Want Waut recording, in English with superimposed translation into Spanish] The only problem is that they need time. This is a characteristic of the Dutch. They need time to study things in depth. However, we expect very good results from this visit. [end recording] The Netherlands is an important trading partner for Cuba, one whose exchange value over the past three years exceeded $50 million; they have, in Cuba, such prestigious companies as Castrol, and they trade in areas as vital as nickel. Indeed, thanks to the work of this bilateral group, a Dutch bank extended credit to Cuba's nickel and sugar industries, although Cuban representative (Ariel Maso) says there are other fields, too. This group will be making bilateral contacts until Friday [25 March], when the individual and collective results of the negotiations will be learned. Businessmen from both countries can rely on a market that is needful and almost virgin and, in addition, has the corresponding financing -- apparently all the links to allow the economy to benefit. [Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish at 0000 GMT on 22 March says in a similar report: "Some 20 businessmen make up the Netherlands trade mission which today began exchanges aimed at identifying the host's new interests that might be attractive to the visitors. Marta Camacho, secretary general of the Chamber of Commerce of the Republic of Cuba, welcomed the delegation, which is headed by (Juan F. Stor), former Netherlands ambassador to Havana. "The meeting is being held at the Comorodo Hotel and will last until next Friday [25 March]. "The Dutch mission is made up mainly of representatives of firms involved in waterworks and port facility construction, the agricultural industry, providers of food products, the textile industry, banking institutions, and the legal assistance field."]
