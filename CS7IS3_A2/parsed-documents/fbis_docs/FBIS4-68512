Although representatives of the Stolichnyy declined to either confirm or deny this information (saying that they had no official confirmation from the Netherlands Bank), there are no grounds for doubting its reliability. Thus, the Stolichnyy has become the first Russian commercial bank to receive permission to open a branch in Western Europe. The history of founding a Stolichnyy bank branch in Amsterdam goes back over two years and was rife with unexpected twists and turns. At first, its opening had been projected for back in February 26th of last year. At the time, however, the Central Bank of the Netherlands refused to grant Stolichnyy the required permission, stating that it did not have a new license from the Bank of Russia (Stolichnyy had received its license in 1989 from the then still existing USSR Gosbank.). Despite turning in all the documents on time, the procedures for the bank's reregistration for a new license at the Central Bank (CB) took eight months instead of the usual three and were completed only in October of last year. Reasons for the delay are still not clear. According to the official version, the CB prolonged the reregistration because it conducted a supplementary verification of the Russian bank's activities. However, according to information given to KOMMERSANT-DAILY, the CB's decision for a necessary "supplementary verification" was preceded by a visit to the Bank of Russia by Ministry of Internal Affairs employees, who voiced their disinterest in a quick reregistration of the Stolichnyy bank, expressly because of the bank's desire to open a branch in Holland (attempts by controlling organs of the government to limit the possible flow of Russian capital abroad by every means is well known). To summarize, the Stolichnyy bank received permission from the CB of Russia to open a bank branch only in December of last year, but the Bank of the Netherlands provided the necessary permit only now. In any case, in the Stolichnyy Bank itself, where correspondent for KOMMERSANT-DAILY obtained this information from unofficial sources, no one would comment on this issue, stating that in the absence of an official notice from De Nederlandshe Bank N.V., they could neither confirm nor deny the information. Nevertheless, representatives of the bank announced that inasmuch as the Netherlands Bank has no formal reasons for further delaying the granting of permission to the Stolichnyy Bank, it is very plausible that this actually occurred. Thus, it would be hardly premature to conclude that the first (not counting the former Soviet banks abroad) full-fledged branch of a Russian commercial bank in Western Europe will be the bank branch of the Stolichnyy in Amsterdam. The bank has already put in over one million dollars to create this branch, but these expenditures will have to pay for themselves very quickly. For example, the bank is counting on attracting clients by giving preferential rates for service in its Dutch branch, which in part will allow Russian capital to be returned to its own economy. In addition, the branch bank will be a Dutch juridical person. This means that the doors of unified Europe will be open to it, and more and more banks can spin off from it to other countries. [Boxed item] At present the network of full-fledged branches of Russian commercial banks abroad consists of a branch of the Inkombank on Cyprus, the Cyprus branch of the Vneshtorgbank, and the branch of the Russian Commercial Bank in Zurich, as well as former Soviet banks abroad. With regard to foreign representatives, many Russian banks have them, for example, Tokobank and the Industriya-Servis (both on Cyprus), Inkombank (in Switzerland), the Eskado Bank (in Sweden), and the St. Petersburg Bank (in the USA).
