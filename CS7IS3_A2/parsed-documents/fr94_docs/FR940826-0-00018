As of June 14, 1994, the Committee reports that of the 1994&hyph;95 Native spearmint oil salable quantity of 897,388 pounds, 78,787 pounds remained available for handling. Handlers have indicated, however, that demand may approximate 200,000 pounds of Native spearmint oil for the remainder of this marketing year. This level of demand was not anticipated by the Committee when it made its initial recommendation for the establishment of a salable quantity and allotment percentage for Native spearmint oil for the 1994&hyph;95 marketing year. The recommended salable quantity of 1,092,577 pounds of Native spearmint oil (an increase of 195,189 pounds), combined with the actual June 1, 1994, carry-in of 21,125 pounds, results in a revised 1994&hyph;95 available supply of 1,113,702 pounds. This available supply is approximately 30,000 pounds higher than the annual average of sales for the past five years. The Committee anticipates that foreseeable demand will be adequately met with the recommended increase.
