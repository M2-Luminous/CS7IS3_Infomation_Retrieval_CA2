President Lech Walesa, on the other hand, wants the chief of staff to be directly subject to him, as the head of the Armed Forces. [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Ministers explained that they were unable to make another decision because the president has agreed with the ruling coalition that there could be no changes in the structure of power before the adoption of the new constitution. [National Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk] Today, the committee decided to indicate to the Council of Ministers the second option--that is, that option in which the chief of the General Staff remains subject to the national defense minister. That is the option that has been in place hitherto. [Walesa] This is still under discussion. I will be speaking, I will be demonstrating, that the first option is the better one. And I think we will find a compromise. [Correspondent] During the deliberations today, the government Defense Affairs Committee created an interministerial crisis team that will permanently observe all threats to the security of the state. The National Defense Ministry deems one of the greatest dangers to be the presence of a large number of Russian forces in the Kaliningrad District. Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk said today that he had obtained a promise from Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev of a significant reduction of forces in this district. [Kolodziejczyk] As a final figure, there are to be altogether 25,000 soldiers and sailors stationed in this region--a clear, far-reaching reduction of the present state of affairs, which is about 200,000. If this stated intention is sincere, the problem ceases to exist. [Correspondent] According to the National Defense Ministry, Poland has no strategic reserves in the case of war. [Kolodziejczyk] The mobilization reserves are significantly reduced. We are eating them away by virtue of the miserliness of the budget. [Correspondent] The Defense Ministry claims that the Polish Army, in wishing to measure up to the armament levels of the NATO states, will have to spend $2.5 billion [word indistinct] up until the year 2010. The Defense Ministry feels that, during this period, it is appropriate to exploit the favorable international circumstances and prepare for eventual threats. [end recording]
