FBIS4-15858 "drsov070_o_94001" FBIS-SOV-94-070 Daily Report 11 Apr 1994 Uzbekistan Karimov Bans Russian Bank Notes Karimov Bans Russian Bank Notes LD1104185994 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1556 GMT 11 Apr 94 LD1104185994 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [Text] Uzbekistan's President Islam Karimov has withdrawn Russian banknotes from circulation and banned their acceptance as payment as of 15 April. The decree he signed on Monday aims at better money circulation and greater purchasing power of the sum-coupon, the national currency. In the meantime, anyone, regardless of what he or she owns, will be able to sell goods or provide services for hard currency, provided they have cash registers. As of 15 April, the exchange rate of the sum-coupon to foreign currencies will be fixed at the end of regular republican currency auctions. So far, this rate has been modelled on data from Russia's Central Bank. In line with the decree, a chain of currency exchanges will be set up across the Republic, and individuals will be allowed to trade money by a central bank license. All enterprises, private and state-owned alike, will have to sell to the Central Bank 30 percent of their currency revenues, of which 10 percent must be purchased by the Finance Ministry for the Republic's monetary fund and 5 percent by the government of Karakalpakia (an autonomy within Uzbekistan) and by regional administrations for their local monetary funds. As of 1 May, accounts with enterprises in former USSR republics will be settled exclusively on a clearing basis or in hard currency. Currently in Tashkent one ruble trades to 10-11 sum-coupons and one dollar to 20,000-22,000 sum-coupons.
