Robaina participated in a meeting held as part of the First International Conference on High Performance (CIAR) that began in Havana on 28 March and which is scheduled to end tomorrow. Upon concluding the presentation of a paper on the importance of Cuban sports delegations and other international political issues, Colombian delegate Alex Villa asked Robaina his opinion about President Gaviria's election as OAS secretary general. Robaina emphasized that "Gaviria's election is quite stimulating because, in the past, that organization has been used as an instrument by some, and the Colombian president can help keep it from being manipulated." The head of Cuban diplomacy described Gaviria as a wise and capable politician and very interested in Latin American integration, which could prompt the OAS to become an advocate for the continent's poorest sectors. The foreign minister indicated that Cuba finds nothing inappropriate about returning to the OAS, but emphasized that it is necessary to wait for an invitation because the island was expelled and therefore has no reason to knock on any doors. Robaina also noted the Colombian president's political courage in being the primary advocate of reestablishing diplomatic relations between Colombia and Cuba, which is a "sign of the winds of Latin American integration that are blowing in these times." Referring to reports of an alleged Colombian guerrilla summit in Havana, Robaina said some ill-intentioned person had attempted to sabotage relations between the countries, but truth fortunately prevailed and time has proven us right.
