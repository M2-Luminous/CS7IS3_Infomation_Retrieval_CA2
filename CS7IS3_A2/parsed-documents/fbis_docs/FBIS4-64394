According to the editorial, the United States had to act to stop losing prestige after its repeated threats and warnings to Bosnian Serbs were not followed by action. This time, President Clinton seems determined to defend the people in the so-called security zones. While some U.S. officials believe that there are no vital American interests in Bosnia that would justify the use of force, others judge that the credibility of the United States is at stake, the editorial continues. Doubtless, most Americans agree with the first group, the editorial contends, because they fail to perceive the U.S. interest in Bosnia. However, the U.S. public does not like its presidents to be defied, be it President Carter in the Iran hostage issue or President Clinton by the Gorazde Serbs, the editorial concludes. Loss of French Influence Seen According to Philippe Marcovici's editorial in the 13 April Paris daily LE QUOTIDIEN DE PARIS, when Minister of Foreign Affairs Alain Juppe asked on 12 April that Europe assume the presidency of an international peace conference on Bosnia on an equal footing with the United States and Russia, he was in fact admitting that the European Union (EU)--and consequently France--no longer plays the principal role in settling the conflict. This is despite the fact that most initiatives on Bosnia to date have come from France, which is not seeking to "use force as an end in itself" but only as the means to a settlement, Marcovici writes. While it is still too early to know whether France's policy will be successful, its disadvantages are already clear, Marcovici continues. Even with its European partners, France lacks the means to implement it and Paris had to resort to NATO--in other words, to the United States. Since Washington's first concern is to "handle Russia delicately," this country has been able to become an actor on the Bosnian scene. This return to the "classic East-West dialogue naturally occurred to the detriment of Europe, and of France in particular, which for the past three years has borne the heaviest burden in the former Yugoslavia," Marcovici writes, noting that a "cruel paradox" has emerged. With no ground forces in Bosnia, the United States has taken the political lead, while France, whose soldiers are dying there, is losing the initiative. French Policy Criticized In the 14-20 April Paris weekly LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR, Jacques Julliard's "Chronicle" criticizes the "strange perseverance" of French diplomacy, which almost never departs from one characteristic scenario. In a first phase, he writes, France behaves like a mighty power and multiplies diplomatic initiatives without prior consultation with its partners. It then realizes that it lacks the means to implement these initiatives, at which time the United States imposes its own solution "to the anger of our diplomats, who reluctantly fall into line," Julliard remarks. In the end, France--"which accumulates ambiguities and succeeds in quarreling with everyone"--must accept the final settlement while "cursing the ingratitude of the peoples concerned and the arrogance of the Americans." This is now occurring in Bosnia, notably in Sarajevo, where France, which gave so much of itself, has had to give in to Washington's initiatives, Julliard concludes.
