Smajl Terzic reports from the press center: [Terzic] In the last 14 days, 160 Chetniks have been killed and twice as many put out of action. Fierce attacks took place today in the Filipovici region, Komin, Obli Kamen, and Kriz, where the enemy fired over 800 82-mm shells. The reasons for this are revenge and the withdrawal of damaged tanks and an armored personnel carrier. [passage omitted]
