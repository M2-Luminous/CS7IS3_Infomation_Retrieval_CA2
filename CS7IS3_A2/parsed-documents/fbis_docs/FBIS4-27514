The Mozambican Committee for Friendship With the People of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in a statement May 20 said the Japanese reactionaries have perpetrated a vicious anti-Chongnyon campaign, while scheming to hurl their Armed Forces into the Korean peninsula by drawing up a "security emergency legislative arrangement", but they are greatly mistaken. The Japanese reactionaries must correctly understand the socialist Korea, the statement stressed, and added: If they do not stop at once their reckless anti-DPRK, anti-Chongnyon campaign, they will bump into curses and condemnations from the Korean people and the world people. The Nepal-Korea Friendship Association in a statement May 20 said the police search of the Osaka prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon by the Japanese authorities was part of their political intrigues to suppress Chongnyon and a crude violation of the democratic national rights of the Korean citizens in Japan. The Nigeria-DPRK Friendship Association in a statement May 17 strongly urged the Japanese authorities to renounce the hostile policy towards the DPRK and stop at once the suppression of Chongnyon and apologize for it.
