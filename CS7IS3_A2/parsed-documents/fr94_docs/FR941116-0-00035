FR941116-0-00035 FR941116-0-00006 Additionally, the FAA has revised paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of the final rule to specify certain Kaiser Roylyn part-numbered valves as ones that incorporate the ``donut'' configuration and are, therefore, subject to the requirements of that paragraph. ``Taco'' Valves One commenter requests that the Kaiser Electroprecision ``taco'' valve be deleted from proposed paragraph (b)(2)(iii), which would require that it be leak checked at intervals of 200 flight hours. The commenter suggests that it be included in paragraph (b)(2)(iv), instead, since that paragraph addresses similar double-door types of valves and requires their inspection at intervals of 400 flight hours. The FAA concurs with this request and has revised the final rule accordingly. This change leaves only the ``donut'' valve in the category of valves [addressed by paragraph (b)(2)(iii)] requiring leak checks at the 200-flight hour interval. The FAA considers this appropriate, since the ``donut'' valve clearly has been the valve associated with the greatest number of problems relative to ``blue ice.'' Visual Inspections To Detect Leakage Several commenters request that paragraph (b)(4) be revised to allow flight crew to perform the visual inspections to detect leakage. These commenters state that, since this inspection involves only a visual examination, trained maintenance personnel should not be made to accomplish it. The FAA does not concur with the commenters' request. While flight crews are authorized to perform walk-around inspections of the airplane, in accordance with FAR 91.7(b) [14 CFR 91.7(b)], ``Civil aircraft airworthiness,'' there is no requirement for the flight crew to record the results of that inspection. The FAA considers that certified maintenance personnel are best suited to perform this inspection due to their specific skills, training, and experience with reporting procedures. Flush/Fill Line Cap Installation Several commenters request that the proposed rule be revised to delete paragraph (d), which would require the installation of a cap on the flush/fill lines for forward, aft, and executive lavatories. One commenter states that the caps on the service panel are a secondary sealing system, and that the toilet check valve is the primary seal preventing fluid from flowing back down this line. Other commenters also request that the requirements for periodic leak testing of the cap be deleted. Additionally, one commenter believes that installation of a cap on the flush/fill line will cause problems because, in their experience, if the caps are installed, the residual flush/fill fluid trapped inside the line will freeze by the time it reaches the next destination; the frozen line and installed cap must be thawed out prior to servicing of the lavatory, which can create a delay in normal operations. This commenter and others suggest that, as an alternative to the installation of a cap and a leak test, the proposed rule should be revised to require periodic replacement of the seal in the toilet tank anti-siphon (check) valve. The commenters point out that this valve, when maintained, effectively prevents the toilet fluid from being siphoned out through the flush/fill line, thereby making the cap unnecessary. The FAA does not concur with the requests to delete the requirement for installation of a cap on the flush/fill line, but does concur that certain alternative procedures may be provided. The FAA has received a report of a Boeing Model 727 series airplane that experienced an in-flight shutdown of the number 3 engine due to the ingestion of ``blue ice'' caused by leakage from the flush/fill line. Investigation revealed that approximately one in four of the toilet tank anti-siphon (check) valves in the affected operator's fleet was found to leak within a three-month period. The FAA has concluded that the anti-siphon (check) valve alone does not appear to have sufficient integrity and reliability to prevent leakage from the flush/fill line. However, the FAA does acknowledge that, because the flush/fill line does not normally have water in it and a leak test of the flush/fill line cap is impractical in many circumstances, it is sufficient to replace the seals in the toilet tank anti-siphon valve and the cap, and perform a leak check of the toilet tank anti-siphon (check) valve. Paragraphs (a)(5) and (b)(3) of the final rule have been revised to provide for this alternative procedure. Several commenters request that proposed paragraph (d) be revised to delete the requirement that installation of the cap must be accomplished only in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 727&hyph;38&hyph;0021, dated July 30, 1992. That service bulletin specifies the installation of a particular lever-lock cap; however, the commenters request that other FAA-approved lever-lock caps also be permitted to be used. (In their comments, certain commenters provided design and service history data on another such lever-lock cap.) The FAA agrees that other FAA-approved lever-lock caps are acceptable in this installation, and has revised the final rule to specify this. One commenter requests that any FAA approved cap, as opposed to only lever/lock caps, be considered sufficient for the installation required by proposed paragraph (d). The FAA does not concur, since the commenter provided no design or service history data for any other particular cap. However, under the provisions of paragraph (f) of the final rule, this commenter may elect to provide such data in a request for an alternative method of compliance with the rule. One commenter considers that installation of a cap without a provision for a heating element will cause ice to form in the line at the cap. This commenter has experienced this problem on airplanes in its fleet that are equipped with a lever-lock cap. This freezing problem has been further exacerbated when service personnel have damaged the caps or flush/fill line by trying to remove the ice with a tool (such as a screw driver). The commenter suggests that the rule should require installation of a heating element to prevent freezing in or on the flush/fill line, and points out that Boeing Service Bulletin 727&hyph;38&hyph;0021, which is referenced in proposed paragraph (d) for the cap installation procedures, does not call for installation of any heating element. The FAA agrees that one way to prevent freezing in the subject area may be to install an FAA-approved heating element. It is also possible to avoid the freezing problem by allowing the fluid to drain out of the flush/fill line after servicing the tank. Since frozen flush/fill lines are avoidable without a heating element, provided proper servicing is done, the FAA does not consider a specific requirement to install a heating element to be warranted. Terminating Action One commenter requests that installation of an in-line drain valve per Boeing Specification S417T105 be considered terminating action for the required leak checks. As justification for this request, the commenter provided data indicating that, out of several million flight hours of airplanes equipped with this particular valve, there have been very few incidents of leakage. The FAA does not concur with the commenter's request. Based on the available data to date relative to all valves, the FAA has determined that periodic leak testing of valves, as well as the replacement of valve seals, is warranted in order to ensure that the valves do not start to leak. Because of this, the FAA does not consider that there is currently a ``terminating action'' for these necessary requirements. Terminology Changes One commenter requests that the wording of the proposed rule be revised by changing the term ``operating torque'' to ``operation'' in all procedures relative to inspections of the valve handle for the in-line drain valves. This commenter points out that the actuation of neither the in-line drain valve nor the service panel drain valve is a rotational movement at the service panel. The FAA concurs and has revised the terminology of the final rule accordingly.
