At its Beijing residence yesterday afternoon, the Fujian NPC delegation held a conscientious discussion of Premier Li Peng's government work report. It was chaired by Fujian NPC delegation leader Yuan Qitong. The Fujian deputies to the NPC session spoke one after another in the discussion. Jia Qinglin, secretary of the provincial party committee and governor, delivered a key-note speech in which he stated: The key to implementing the central principles by taking into account and showing concern for overall national interests lies in cultivating a new train of thought; learning and mastering dialectics; as well as emancipating our minds and seeking truth from facts in a down-to-earth manner. Reform, development, and stability -- Jia noted -- are interrelated with and are complementary to each other. In seeking development, we should take actual local conditions into consideration. In furthering reform, we should make every possible effort to solve various contradictions. In addition, we should firmly grasp the two aspects -- reform and stability -- simulteneously. Jia Qinglin further expounded on this issue in light of the realities in Fujian, saying: Since last year, Fujian has enjoyed sound and rapid national economic growth, but also has undertaken more arduous reform tasks. In his government work report, Premier Li Peng emphatically called for rapidly building a socialist market economy structure, this being an issue of great significance to deepening reform, promoting development, and maintaining stability. In the years to come, we should always place reform high on the agenda and resolutely adhere to the following train of thought in the course of reform: Orienting production to market demands; conducting comprehensive reform experiments in a down-to-earth manner; learning and mastering international practices; integrating the domestic and international markets; and making the domestic and international markets complement each other. Jia Qinglin stressed: By grasping opportunities, we mean grasping opportunities for reform. By promoting development, we mean making reform promote development. By maintaining stability, we mean seizing appropriate opportunities for reform and deepening reform in an appropriate way. Practice already has borne out that deepening reform and building a socialist market economy structure are the the only way out for Fujian. It is both necessary and possible for Fujian to move ahead earlier than others with respect to building a new socialist market economy structure. This year, we are going to embark on a series of pioneeringly deep-going reforms on an unprecedentedly large scale. Thus leaders at all levels across the province should make redoubled efforts to deepen reform, promote development, maintain social stability, and rapidly build a socialist market economy structure. Huang Changxi, vice chairman of the NPC's Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee and vice chairman of the Fujian Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee; Xiamen Deputy Mayor Hong Yongshi; Fujian Mayor Jin Nengchou; Xiamen University Professor Wang Qiaoru; and others; also spoke one after the other during the discussion.
