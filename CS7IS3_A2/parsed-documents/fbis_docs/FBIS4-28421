The International Committee of Jurists for Democracy and Human Rights in South Korea in a statement on June 2 said their anti-Chongnyon campaign contradicts the universally accepted provisions on human rights and it is a wanton violation of the Vienna declaration Japan signed officially. It called on all the democratic figures and human rights organizations across the world to launch vigorous activities urging the Japanese authorities to promptly stop the suppression of Chongnyon. The Malian Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee in a statement June 1 said the suppression of Japan-resident Koreans by the Japanese authorities is an undisguised act of disturbing peace in the Northeast Asian region. It urged the Japanese prime minister to exercise his influence to promptly stop all acts which may cause distrust between the Japanese and Korean peoples. The Nepali Intellectuals Forum sent a letter to the chairman of the National Public Safety Commission of Japan on June 3. Noting that the suppression of Chongnyon by the Japanese police is obviously part of the hostile policy towards the DPRK, it demanded that the Japanese authorities stop the gross abuses of human rights at once and ensure human rights and safety of the Koreans in Japan.
