This method may also be used to prepare recording media for optical information carriers. Systems where the metal is included in the hydrocarbon matrix are particularly promising. The precipitation processes and the properties of the resulting polymer films are affected by such parameters as pressure, flow rate of the organo-metallic compound, temperature of the substrate, and energy characteristics of the low temperature plasma, which depend greatly on the type of discharge. In the present work a study was made of the processes for preparing thin films by dissociation of tetramethyl Sn in a high frequency discharge and in a direct current discharge. Differences in the Raman spectra of the tetramethyl Sn in the liquid and film states were established, and precipitation conditions were determined under which the resulting films have maximum sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio for use as recording media for optical recording of information.
