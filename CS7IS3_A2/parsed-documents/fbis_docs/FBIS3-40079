What is it that politicians are seeking? What kind of politician are you? Answer: Politicians may be divided into two types: One type enjoys power, the other seeks satisfaction in the realization of self. From childhood, I have aspired to be an historic figure, and I have always said that if I only knew while alive that my name would go down in history, I would be very happy indeed! This is the meaning of life that is more important than anything else. A man who enjoys power must attend to things personally, but I don't attend to everything personally, and I don't get myself involved in everything. In fact, I am too impatient to be a very good administrator; I am not good at coordinating, compromising, and I hate details. I see power as a tool to help realize a sense of self. To realize my sense of self, I don't mind hard work and sacrifice at all. That is the exact opposite of those who enjoy power, for they like to attend to things themselves with their power; a very good example is that of the first emperor of the Ch'in: He studied official documents till all hours of the night, personally got involved in all things, and had to make every decision. Question: Which type of politician do you think fit Mao Tse-tung, and do you admire him? What kind of politicians do you most admire? Answer: Mao was between the two types; he enjoyed power so much that he could not face the fact of being deprived of it; that was Mao in his old age. I greatly admire de Gaulle, he is the politician I most respect and admire. He was a war hero in World War II, and occupied a position none would dare challenge; yet, when he found he could not do anything useful, he resigned and retired to the countryside for 12 years. Was there any opportunity for him to stage a comeback? The political situation at the time appeared to rule that out. However, when the French military supported de Gaulle's return to deal with the Algerian revolt, the first thing he did upon assumption of power was to announce that France would let Algeria go through direct negotiations. This truly was something that not anyone could accomplish. When de Gaulle returned to power, he ameliorated the historical animosity between France and Germany, promoted the European common market, made future plans not only for France but also for Europe and established a foundation for the continuing future development of Europe; that was true leadership. In 1968, with France paralyzed by a series of national demonstrations and strikes, he went on television and in a short statement announced that general elections would be held within a month, and that immediately put an end to all demonstrations; this grave crisis was resolved by his one television address. The elections resulted in a major victory for de Gaulle, but despite the victory he made plans to step down for he knew that his era was ending. Issues of administrative reform and the student had to be addressed, but these trifling matters did not interest de Gaulle and he passed them on to others to deal with. At the time I was in England; the democratic politics of England was also of the traditional, old-line type, and their legislators had first class educational background, oratory skills and training, but they were no match for de Gaulle when it came to handling major issues from a broad perspective. Question: What kind of historical figure do you want to be? Answer: There is no need to talk about that now, for it's too early to do so. I consider life like painting a picture, one naturally knows what one wants to paint when one picks up a brush. De Gaulle certainly knew [his objectives of] European unity and a strong France before he proceeded to work toward those ends. But what about opportunities? These are the external conditions. Whether one has an opportunity depends on the kind of environment in which one finds himself. When I was young, I was very pessimistic, moody and depressed, thinking that I would not have an opportunity in my lifetime. Taiwan is too small a place, and even if one had talent and ability, one could hardly influence the world [from Taiwan]; I felt I was born into the wrong era. But now I no longer think this way; it is very clear to me that a politician does have enough room to exercise power. Question: How do you see Taiwan today? Answer: So long as I live, it is quite possible that Taiwan will develop world-class influence; there is no doubt, the question is only what one does to bring that about. The space Taiwan occupies is really not that small, therefore a Taiwan leader should allow Taiwan to develop its world-class influence in the same way as de Gaulle deliberated on how to establish a strong and powerful France and launch a new European era in the midst of turmoil and instability. Question: How many years will it take to influence the whole world? Answer: I have just said, if I were the president now, I would immediately proceed to create that kind of era. Frankly speaking, if I had the opportunity to be Taiwan's leader today, I would not waste one minute or one second. Only a person without ability would waste any time, and if at this point in life I don't know what should be done, I would be in a total mess! Question: How do you see the Party Program on Taiwan Independence? Is it a reflection of the anti-Kuomintang [KMT] sentiments or is it a national goal? If the DPP came to power, would it change the national flag or the country's name? Answer: Objectively speaking, Taiwan is an independent country; I hope we ourselves at least recognize that fact, but as to how foreigners see it, it becomes a question of tactics. Taiwan was originally an independent sovereign country, and all we did was to announce that fact. Now you ask whether the country's name and flag should be changed, actually these are small matters, and questions of tactics are also small matters. If China is displeased, are we not supposed to do anything? Why do we say we must make changes? Are we supposed to wait for the day when China does not care before we make any changes? Naturally we hope to make changes, but if changing the country's name would create great difficulties, then we can wait a while; as the Chinese Communists themselves often say, we too can wait 60 years. Waiting a while is not a difficult thing to do. Question: In the course of the opposition movement, when the Chung-li incident or the Mei-li Island incident occurred, you happened to be away. Did you anticipate these things and therefore leave [Taiwan]? Answer: In the Chung-li Incident, what could I have done if I were here, participate in the demonstrations? Direct the demonstrations? That is really laughable. Frankly speaking, the historical meaning of the Chung-li incident is the use of people's power to block the fabrication of ballots. If you expect me to oppose the Chung-li incident, that would be impossible. Undoubtedly, I had a share of the responsibility in that incident! No, not responsibility, it was my pleasure to see these type of things happen, where people use their power to oppose the [opposition's] brute force in the elections. If the elections could be held with fabricated ballots, the elections would be fraudulent. Under such circumstances, you cannot expect me to be in control, that cannot be done; but to turn that around, if you expect me to carry on further agitation at the scene, that also would not be right, would it? I was not present when the Mei-li Island incident occurred, because no one knew it was going to happen; and if no one expected it, how could I have been present? I left Taiwan two months before the incident, and I did not leave with the expectation that it would take place. As to the charge that I have paid too small a price, that naturally is difficult to refute. I have not spent time in prison, and did not seriously consider serving any prison sentence. But perhaps I should say I did not avoid prison, nor was I afraid of it. Is any further explanation necessary for what I have done in my life so far? Are there disasters more unpredictable than the Chung-li incident? I would not say however that I dare not take a stand for fear of this type of disaster. Question: Have you assessed the situation to determine how it can be used to your advantage? Answer: For one engaged in politics, one naturally makes his moves in the context of major trends. It's true I threw myself into one such major trend. When I returned in 1986, I brought with me the pressure to organize a party along with homecoming. I turned homecoming into a major movement which was likely to succeed objectively speaking. However, if other people insisted on twisting the facts, no matter how you explain them, it would be to no avail; if you have accomplished nothing in life, people would certainly not talk about you, but if you aim to achieve great things, why should you care what others say about you? For example, up to this point of my life, I can say I am [speaking in English]: Very proud of myself. In all my life, my goal is like de Gaulle's; in painting a picture of my life, I am an idealist in search of ideals in life. I am perhaps too self-confident, and therefore do not let small matters bother me; when other people vilify me over small matters, I care not at all. We all know what is beauty; like a great painter, one knows what and how to paint, and one would not bother about or argue over trifles. I have often said that I am not a person concerned with the superficial, but where it concerns the ultimate gains and losses in life, I do indeed care; my hope is to become a person with a place in history and I care about the major achievements in my life but not all the minor, superficial things. The biggest difference between me and others is that I am not concerned about details. Frankly, I don't care at all to be on the banquet circuit. I am like that: Other people consider this business [of banqueting] to be indispensable, but I don't care about it at all! I don't care about society's reaction, I do care about myself, [my place] in history and whether I can accomplish [my] great historic mission. Question: You said you are not a particularly good administrator, but whether as Governor or President in the future, isn't administrative ability a prerequisite? Answer: It's true I don't care for details, but as my one and a half years as the T'aoyuan County magistrate demonstrated, I didn't do badly on that score. A political leader cannot simply rely on thinking big, on ideals, for ability is also important. You can say that I am bored by administrative responsibilities, but that does not mean that I don't know how to administer. There are no truly able political leaders who don't know about administration; it is because they know it too well to involve themselves personally that they select the right persons for the jobs with themselves holding the key. Question: If you became governor, would you then go on the banquet circuit? Answer: Society says this is not a good thing! It is not that I care, or that I love banqueting, it's just that I don't care for such things. Question: Some people say that you are like Li Hsiao-lung [2621 1420 7893], winning is what counts, the means utilized are not important? Answer: It's the exact opposite. It is not that people like me do not choose their tactics, they do. Because we have too much faith [in others] that we do need to choose tactics. I am much smarter than you on that score, it's like what Mencius said: "Even if one can rule the empire by killing one innocent person, one should not do it." It is because I have too many choices, that's why we choose our tactics; only people in a terrible fix do not choose their tactics, because they don't have the option to so choose. Question: What kind of blueprint do you have for Taiwan? Answer: I have one important concept; namely, Taiwan is the world's newest emerging people. A newly emerging people have two special characteristics: They know a great deal and they are full of vitality. There are historical reasons for this. In the early days, because East-West cultural exchanges took place through the Gansu corridor, the Mongols knew a great deal. As a nomadic people, they were full of vitality, and from all this they developed their special ability and skills. The Manchus were able to develop special ability by learning horsemanship from the Mongols, Han culture from the Chinese who migrated beyond the Great Wall, Western culture through the seafaring Chinese pirates and trade and commerce through nomadic herding. In the 20th century, the Japanese did the same thing: They knew a lot more than the Westerners, and they were more vigorous than the latter. Today, among the world's newest emerging peoples, it is the Taiwanese who know a great deal and who have the greatest vitality. Ten years ago, I had already focused on this issue. I was the first one to do so, and it is the source of my sense of self-confidence. I was moody and depressed when I was young, thinking that even if the presidency of Taiwan was offered to me, what could I do? I dwelled on that proposition during my college years, and became very pessimistic. Today, our mission is how to enable this newly emerging people and country to develop and fulfill their historic mission; people say I am a ultra-nationalist, that's not so, for it is our historic duty. That's why with regard to the mainland policy, I am not like the majority in the DPP, it's the exact opposite: I am not afraid to make concessions. I consider it [the mainland policy] a Western expedition: When Taiwan businessmen invest on the mainland, that's the beginning of Western expedition; it is an unstoppable historic trend and we are bound to succeed for we cannot fail. Through China's massive market and manpower, Taiwan will achieve a position of preeminence in the 21st century in the same way the Mongols and Manchus did in their days, and will fulfill its historic destiny. The second stage will not be easy to handle, it will require correct policy as well as leadership. We have seen how the Mongols and Manchus failed, will we repeat their mistakes? As leader, one has the responsibility of absolutely not letting 10 or 20 years pass [without doing what must be done]. Perhaps one should put it this way, will your achievement be that of just another economic power? The historic mission of Taiwan, in my view, is to establish a more rational relationship between production and distribution, for this is the flaw in economies of the Western nations including Japan. Nevertheless, in summing up, what we hope to build is a societal system. Perhaps our historic mission is that history will let Taiwan rise up and leave something behind for mankind. The meaning of Taiwan's place in history, therefore, is to establish and leave behind a more rational and more perfect economic system that will benefit all mankind. This is the framework of my thinking and the mission of my life. That is why I do not really care to be a county executive, the provincial governor or even the president, for my hope is to have an opportunity to accomplish the above mission, for otherwise being president of the State of Taiwan would have no meaning.
