Only regulated and fair competition can "prevent a new subsidy race," Rexrodt said during the handover to Lufthansa of a new Airbus model. Regarding recent complications involving the German-U.S. air traffic agreement, Rexrodt stated forcefully that "the United States also has to accept that its indirect support of air traffic is now open to question. Equality of opportunity in the skies has to apply worldwide." Rexrodt backed the further expansion of air traffic in Germany. It is "extremely damaging" for Germany "that it is not possible to build a runway today without encountering resistance." Germany has to develop its airports if it wants to avoid being cut off from international traffic routes in the future. At the international level, Rexrodt called for fair "market entry opportunities" and a stop to "protectionism disguised as environmental protection." [passage omitted]
