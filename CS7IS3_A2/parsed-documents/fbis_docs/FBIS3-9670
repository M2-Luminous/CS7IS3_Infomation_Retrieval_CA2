Serbian repression has concentrated on certain communes, where there have been repeated raids. In Mirofc near Podujeve, the police also fired guns, while soldiers in addition to the police were involved in raids in the commune of Viti. Besides these daily raids, press-ganging into the army continues, and call-up papers are being distributed. In the commune of Gjakove alone, 500 call-up notices have been delivered. Kosova Democratic Alliance [LDK] activists are subject to continuous repression, and the police also entered the LDK's premises in Kodra e Trimave [Vranjevac]. We Have Our Stands The harassment of writers and intellectuals also continued last week, as in the case of Shaip Beqiri, who was sentenced to 60 days' imprisonment. Reshat Nurboja, chairman of the Republican Party, was also arrested. The police also entered the premises of the Kosova Information Center in order to exert pressure against this very important institution. Torture beyond all measure is also continuing in prison, such as in Dubrave near Istog and in Mitrovice. Dr. Ibrahim Rugova went on to welcome the statement by Denmark's UN military representative, who said that there can be no successful talks without the Albanians of Kosova and Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM], or without all the Albanians of the former Yugoslavia. President Rugova also welcomed the visit to Albania of Willy Claes, who, besides bilateral issues, also broached the question of Kosova. The Kosova question is increasingly being put forward as a problem requiring a solution. Willy Claes had earlier said that the 1974 Constitution [of the SFRJ, defining Kosovo as an autonomous province of Serbia] would no longer satisfy Kosova. Bujar Bukoshi visited the United States this week. This is an important visit as part of the regular contacts that we have with the United States, President Rugova stressed. Dr. Rugova again requested that Kosova be taken under the protection of the UN Security Council. President Rugova then replied to journalists' questions. The first question stated that there seem to have been reports during Willy Claes's visit to Albania that the West is ready to start talks to ensure the maximum autonomy for Kosova and asked what this meant? President Rugova said that there had been various proposals, but it is not a question of the West's position. As president of Kosova, I am obliged to act on the decisions of the referendum for an independent and neutral Kosova. We have asked for Kosova to be first put under a protectorate. The next question was whether Claes had gone to Albania to persuade Sali Berisha to accept an autonomous status for Kosova. Dr. Rugova again said that this was journalistic speculation, while we have our own standpoint. It is a question of well intentioned proposals and not conditions or premises for talks. We Have Asked for a U.S. Initiative on Kosova Replying to whether Serbian-Albanian talks are expected to begin and whether a starting point for such talks exists, President Rugova emphasized that this is journalistic talk. There are no starting points for talks: The starting points are the two sides. The rules of discussion demand that they should take place without starting points and conditions. We are sufficiently strong in our position to start talks with the Serbian side without conditions. Asked to comment on the Croat-Serb talks, he said that we welcome these talks, if they can reach an understanding. Meanwhile, asked to connent on the stand of the Yugoslav Government on stationing CSCE observers in Kosova, Dr. Rugova said that we have no particular comment. It is a matter of stubbornly defending positions that in fact do themselves harm. Asked whether a special U.S. representative, such as Redman, will be appointed for Kosova, Dr. Rugova emphasized that we had asked for a U.S. initiative on Kosova. Redman is a representative for the entire territory of former Yugoslavia. It remains to be seen whether or not a special representative for Kosova will be appointed. Another question was whether Rugova had informed the UN High Commission for Refugees about the expulsion of refugees from Germany and the question of Albanians under siege in Sarajevo. In this connection, Rugova stressed that we have informed the Commission's office in Prishtina, and it will no doubt do something. Asked about the secret meeting of the interior ministers of several Western countries about refugees and the demand to open the Macedonian-[The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] Kosova border, Dr. Rugova said that it is a question of greater, freer, and more normal traffic across this border. We have asked for the refugees to be returned via Prishtina airport, an idea that is being considered. The measures being taken by the German authorities are not directed against the Albanians or anybody else, but at reducing the number of refugees in the country, which is much greater that in many other countries of the world. The German authorities will decide after examining the application of every refugee. The idea of using Skopje airport arose because it is the shortest route. Asked how many refugees will be returned, Rugova said that it is a matter of several thousand.
