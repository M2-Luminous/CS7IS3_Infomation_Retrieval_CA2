"The reason Vladimir Volfovich [Zhirinovskiy] knows so much about who is whose agent and who is not is because he was the KGB's paid informant and had access to secret documents," Mr. Lukin said. "As for me, indeed -- sooner or later one has to own up, after all -- I sometimes do hand important information over to the U.S. secret services. For instance, recently I passed accurate information about the state of Vladimir Volfovich's health. So now the CIA knows for sure what all others can only guess."
