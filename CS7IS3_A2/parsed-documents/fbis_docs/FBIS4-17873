After the virtual collapse of the talks Ministers Grachev and Radetskyy publicly exchanged caustic remarks: In a statement on Ukrainian television Gen. Vitaliy Radetskyy bitingly "nicknamed" Pavel Grachev "pan general." Already standing on the steps of the "ministerial" Tu-154, Gen. Grachev in turn told the Ukrainian officers seeing him off his opinion of the reception given him and the entire Russian delegation on Ukrainian soil. The crux of Minister Grachev's statement boiled down to this: Of course, Ukraine is still a very young state, but this certainly does not excuse the way foreign delegations are received here (Grachev had in mind the Russian Defense Ministry delegation). Pavel Grachev went on to insert a sentence about the Ukrainian side's lack of concepts of diplomatic etiquette and said that he would not have been at all surprised if, instead of leaving for Moscow, Ukrainian special-purpose troops had arrested the Russian delegation right at the airport and clapped him -- the Russian Federation minister of defense -- in handcuffs! The persons accompanying Grachev were evidently not the only ones to appreciate the general's joke, for by a "strange" coincidence the Ukrainian air traffic controllers (the Russian delegation was flying from the "Belbek" military airfield of the Ukrainian Air Defense Forces) prohibited Grachev's aircraft from taking off. From 1600 through 1740 hours -- for almost two hours -- Ukraine did not grant the Russian delegation the right to leave Ukrainian soil. It all ended in Pavel Grachev, now beside himself, issuing a personal order to the commander of his Tu-154: "To hell with them, we're taking off!..." The airliner with the Russian delegation on board took off from "Belbek" without permission from the Ukrainian air traffic controllers. Incidentally, according to recent data, at the time of the Russian-Ukrainian talks in Sevastopol Admiral Eduard Baltin, commander of the Black Sea Fleet, took no part in them because he was on the "sick list" with a heart attack. The Black Sea Fleet leadership was represented by Vice Admiral Vitaliy Larionov, deputy commander of the Black Sea Fleet. The Ukrainian side greeted the Russian delegation more than strangely: A military subunit of the Ukrainian Air Defense Forces stationed on Cape Khersones, in full combat gear, rehearsed...the defense of the approaches to Khersones against attack by units of the Russian Black Sea Fleet! At the same time, on the roof of Sevastopol dolphinarium, servicemen of the Ukrainian Navy's marines had ostentatiously set up a post for round-the-clock observation of the Black Sea Fleet Marines brigade (based in "Kazachya" Bay, within the limits of Sevastopol). Observation is still being carried out using special facilities: night-vision devices and the latest communications equipment. Ukrainian servicemen do not conceal their animosity toward the target of observation. Directly after the Russian Federation Defense Ministry delegation left Sevastopol, the Ukrainian side put very strong pressure on senior officers of the Black Sea Fleet Marines brigade (from "Kazachya" Bay) to make them switch to the Ukrainian side and take the Ukrainian oath. They even telephoned certain Russian officers of the Black Sea Fleet at home, agitating for Ukraine. In their official zeal the "agitators" -- Ukrainian Navy officers Captain First Rank Yevgeniy Ivanov and Lieutenant Colonel Aleksey Murashev -- went so far in their "agitation" that they even disavowed a statement by their own President Kravchuk and explained to the Russian sailors that Sevastopol will no longer be a base of the Russian Black Sea Fleet! There then followed, naturally, promises of high official salaries and ranks in the Ukrainian Armed Forces right up to those of a general. And all this just for switching the Black Sea Fleet Marines brigade in Sevastopol to the Ukrainian oath and command.
