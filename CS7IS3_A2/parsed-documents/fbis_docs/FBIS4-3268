As expected, the task force has recommended that presidential elections be carried out by popular vote rather than by the vote of the National Assembly, as has been done in the past. It also recommended that the immunity from prosecution that legislators enjoy in speaking during legislative sessions be cut back. The draft proposals were reached after 52 rounds of discussions among ranking party officials and legal scholars. The KMT will formally introduce the changes at the coming session of the National Assembly after they are approved by the party's policy-making Central Standing Committee at a special meeting Monday. Other key changes the ruling party will propose include electing a speaker and vice speaker at the National Assembly, extending the tenure of legislators from three years to four, adjusting the premier's right to co-sign laws promulgated and mandates issued by the president, and changing the official name of the "Shanpao" people to "aborigines."
