During the just-ended annual ministerial meeting in Paris, the world's 25 major industrial countries clarified their resolve to transform an entity that serves merely as a think tank for the rich nations' club into more of a bridge with newly emerging economies. "An open, creative and dynamic OECD can help enlarge the community of free and prosperous nations throughout the world," U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said during the two-day session which ended Wednesday [8 June]. "The opportunity is there," Christopher said in a speech that won instant applause from foreign and trade ministers from the 25 countries. This year's ministerial meeting, the 33rd of its kind since 1973, took up "the role of the Paris-based OECD in an evolving world" as one of the three key topics. Christopher's sense of urgency in charting a new course for the OECD was echoed in a joint communique issued at the end of the Paris gathering, which proposed reinforcing links with nonmember countries, especially Asian and former communist bloc countries, for their eventual integration into the global economic system. The OECD said in the communique that the group should "build up contact, dialogue and cooperation" with nonmembers which it says are "gaining relevance in the world economy and are basing their development on market principles, pluralist democracy and respect for human rights, as the OECD countries have long done." The communique underscored the need for the OECD to extend its links, especially to newly emerging economies like China and South Korea and former communist bloc nations struggling to shift to a market-oriented economy, such as Poland and Hungary. The OECD supported South Korea's bid to join the body in 1996, noting the country is taking part in a number of activities "on the same footing as member countries." The OECD also said it will deepen policy dialogue with China, which was described in the communique as "a leading player in the world economy." After the close of the ministerial meeting, the OECD signed a cooperation pact with Russia, aimed at smoothing its shift to a market economy through an increased flow of assistance from the OECD. Russia's integration with the West could be "the best investment we can make in our security and in the security of all the peoples of Europe," Christopher said. The communique's emphasis on deepening ties with nonmembers came after the OECD club opened its door to Mexico as the 25th member a few weeks ago for the first time in more than two decades. The OECD, created in 1961 as a replacement for the organization for European Economic Cooperation (OEEC), has served as a catalyst for reconstruction of war-devastated Europe under the Marshall Plan concept. "With European countries as core members, the OECD has often been described as a rich man's club," Akira Hirata, a researcher at the OECD Development Center, said. Hirata said the function of the OECD has thus been limited to policy coordination only among advanced nations, leaving the task of promoting dialogue with nonmembers to suborgans like the Development Assistance Committee (DAC). "But such a cozy state of relations within the club has changed in recent years," he said, citing the demise of the Soviet Union and the collapse of the communist bloc. "Ties with nonmember countries have gradually played a bigger role," Hirata said, ascribing the trend to Asian countries' explosive economic growth to "levels that cannot be negligible under the global economic management." The OECD may justify increased links with nonmembers by saying it could economically benefit from ties with countries having huge growth potential, Hirata said. Asia, for example, was termed "the growth center in the world economy" by the 1994 Japanese white paper on economic cooperation. "There is also an argument that leaving developing countries unattended would only help boost a flow of illegal immigrants to advanced countries, eventually heightening social and political instability there," Hirata said. Some OECD ministers like Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring cautioned against the OECD's adopting too quick an approach to developing countries like China, however. Spring cited China's poor human rights record as an example. Leon Brittan, the trade chief of the European Union (EU), said, "we must not so widen our membership that our work becomes shallow." Mexico's admission met criticism from some OECD countries which claimed Mexican industries are not advanced enough to be eligible for the OECD club.
