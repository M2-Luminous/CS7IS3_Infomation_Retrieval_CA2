As for the numerical targets, the policy proposal criticized it as "something that promotes government-led managed trade." The policy proposal warned that if Japan accepts numerical targets, it would bring economic and political losses to Japan. The policy proposal pointed out that "if the Japanese Government leads efforts to increase Japan's imports, Japan would face unreasonable trade demands from the United States. If Japan failed to meet the numerical targets, it would run into U.S. sanctions." The policy proposal also pointed out: "If Japan rejects the U.S. demand for setting numerical targets, it would be highly praised for protecting free trade, an asset of the entire world." Meanwhile, the policy proposal stressed that the Japanese Government should expand opportunities for foreign access to the Japanese market, and address price differentials between Japan and other nations by relaxing bureaucratic regulations and rigorously enforcing the Antimonopoly Law. The policy proposal also urged the Japanese Government to work out plans for their promotion and announce the plans at home and abroad.
