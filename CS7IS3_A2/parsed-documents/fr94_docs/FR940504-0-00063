FR940504-0-00063 FR940504-0-00015 Classification This rule has been determined to be ``not significant'' for purposes of E.O. 12866. The Assistant Administrator determined that this rule will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities for purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The Council prepared a regulatory impact review (RIR) and an initial regulatory flexibility analysis (IRFA) that are incorporated in the Amendment document and may be obtained from the Council (see ADDRESSES ). A summary of the RIR/IRFA was published on February 2, 1994 (59 FR 4897). No public comments were received relating to small entities and no changes were made in the initial document. Therefore, the document will now serve as a final regulatory flexibility analysis (FRFA). The AA determined that this rule must be effective no later than May 1, 1994, when coastwide ocean salmon fishing seasons are scheduled to open. Therefore, it is impracticable and contrary to the public interest to delay for 30 days the effective date of this final rule, and the agency finds good cause to waive the delayed effectiveness provision (5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3)) of the Administrative Procedure Act. List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 661 Fisheries, Fishing, Indians, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Dated: April 29, 1994. Rolland A. Schmitten, Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, National Marine Fisheries Service. For the reasons set out in the preamble, 50 CFR part 661 is amended as follows: PART 661_OCEAN SALMON FISHERIES OFF THE COASTS OF WASHINGTON, OREGON, AND CALIFORNIA 1. The authority citation for part 661 continues to read as follows: Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq . 2. In the appendix to part 661, in section II.B., three new sentences are added to the end of paragraph 2(b)(i), and a new paragraph 2(b)(v) is added to read as follows: Appendix * * * * * II. Annual Changes to Management Specifications * * * * * B. Procedures for Establishing and Adjusting Annual Management Measures. * * * * * 2. Allocation of ocean harvest levels. * * * * * (b) Coho south of Cape Falcon. (i) *␣*␣* The recreational allowable ocean harvest will be distributed between the two major recreational subareas when the recreational allocation is equal to or less than 167,000 fish, in accordance with paragraph 2(b)(v) of this appendix. At OCN spawning escapements of 28 or fewer adults per mile, the allocation provisions of paragraph 2(b) of this appendix do not apply. Fisheries will be established that will provide only the minimum incidental harvest of OCN coho necessary to prosecute other fisheries, and that under no circumstances will cause irreparable harm to the OCN stock. * * * * * (v) When the recreational allocation is at 167,000 fish or less, the total recreational allowable ocean harvest of coho will be divided between two major subareas with independent impact quotas. The initial allocation will be 70 percent from Cape Falcon to Humbug Mountain and 30 percent south of Humbug Mountain. Coho transfers between the two impact quotas may be permitted on a one-for-one basis, if chinook constraints preclude access to coho. Horse Mountain to Point Arena will be managed for an impact guideline of 3 percent of the south of Cape Falcon recreational allocation. The recreational coho fishery between Humbug Mountain and Point Arena may be closed when it is projected that the harvest impact between Humbug Mountain and Point Arena, combined with the projected harvest impact that will be taken south of Point Arena to the end of the season, equals the impact quota for south of Humbug Mountain. The recreational fishery for coho salmon south of Point Arena will not close upon attainment of the south of Humbug Mountain impact quota. * * * * * 3. In the appendix to part 661, in section IV.A., the table ``Summary of Specific Management Goals for Stocks in the Salmon Management Unit'' is amended by revising the entry for Columbia River and Oregon Coastal Coho and its footnote 4 to read as follows:
