The author steeped himself in the situation in Anhui Province, bringing to light various erroneous understandings of macroeconomic agricultural policy that reveal the crux of China's agricultural problems. It is hoped that this report will arouse more discussion. From mid-April until the end of June, we conducted an on-site survey in rural Anhui on behalf of the Ministry of Agriculture. In the course of this survey, we strove to analyze completely and systematically the classic problems of a classic large agricultural province like Anhui with a view to arriving at some correct policy conclusions for solving various deepseated incongruities and problems. 1. Current Status of Agricultural Production Anhui Province has plentiful agricultural resources. It is a major area for the production of agricultural products such as grain, cotton, edible oil, hemp, and hogs. During 14 years of reform, its agricultural production has developed fairly rapidly, increasing by an average 6.4 percent each year between 1979 and 1990. Following an especially severe flood in 1991, the goal set by the provincial CPC committee and the provincial government of "recovering in one year from one year of disaster" was substantially attained in agricultural production during 1992. Outputs of most agricultural products revived to normal levels. The guiding thought for agricultural production throughout the province for 1993 is to emphasize a market orientation. While ensuring steady increase in the production of grain, cotton, and edible oil, major efforts are being made to change the structure of agriculture, active developing readily salable products, and promoting "two high and one premium" [high yield, high returns, and premium quality] agriculture. The structure of farming throughout the province is to be diversified in 1993. This includes a slight reduction from 1992 of the 88 million mu sown to grain, substantial cutbacks in the area planted to cotton and oil-bearing crops, and an expansion of the tuber, corn, soybean, peanut, sesame seed, melon, fruit, and vegetable growing areas. The main problems in Anhui's agricultural production today are as follows: 1. Accompanying the high speed growth of the national economy has been a widening of the gap between the speed of development of industry and agriculture. Agricultural and rural resources, including money, land, and large amounts of manpower have flowed into nonagricultural pursuits, into cities, and into coastal areas of the country. Thus, efforts to warm up and stabilize Anhui's agriculture are doomed to failure. During 1992, 1.5 billion yuan flowed out of Anhui Province's industrial and commercial system into developed coastal areas. Money from 50 percent of agricultural unit bank accounts in the provincial Bank of Agriculture flowed into other banks or financial institutions. More than 23 million yuan from the Bank of Agriculture Business Office in Hefei left. During 1992, 195 different development zones were built throughout the province. These reduced the cultivate land area by more than 300,000 mu. This was the greatest decrease in the cultivated land area since 1987. During the winter of 1992 and the spring of 1993, approximately 5 million members of the rural work force (approximately 20 percent of the total) left to work elsewhere, most of them going to Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai. A survey of 16 counties and cities shows that 115,300 peasant households gave up the farming of 346,600 mu of land. Unless this overly rapid shift is brought under control, another shortage of farm products is extremely likely to occur. 2. Expansion of demand for intermediate investment drives a rise in prices of agricultural means of production. At the same time, however, the prices at which peasants sell their products have not risen greatly; thus, the price scissors has widened further. Between January and May 1993, prices of agricultural means of production throughout the province rose 12.5 percent over the same period in 1992. However, the price that peasants received for major farm products such as grain remained basically flat, except for rapeseed, which enjoyed brisk sales and the price of which rose approximately 15 percent over 1992. Despite the adoption in 1993 of several policies to nurture agriculture, peasants continue to report that they lose money farming. They are extremely unhappy particularly about failure to control rises in prices of means of production like chemical fertilizer and diesel fuel. In addition, provincial departments concerned report that because of the anticipated increase in diesel fuel prices, the provincial petroleum company is unable to buy from east China companies sufficient quantities of diesel fuel for agriculture at the parity price. Between January and April, only 37,800 tons of parity price diesel fuel was obtained. This is only 28.8 of annual plan. As of 15 June, only 5.5 percent of the entire year's parity price oil had been provided. 3. The bumper summer grain harvest in 1993 does not demonstrate a warming of agriculture. This is because the main reason for the increase in summer grain production was a 2.5 percent increase over 1992 in the area sown to grain. Second, heaven helped out; weather conditions were better than in the previous year. The weather during the late stage of the growing season was particularly fine. It played a decisive role in the heading of the wheat and the bumper harvest. However, the peasants actually invested less. Provincial supply and market cooperative sales of chemical fertilizer, agricultural pesticides, and agricultural plastic were down 4.4, 27.5, and 21.3 percent from the previous year. Retail sales of agricultural means of production for the province as a whole for the first four months of the year increased only 2.3 percent over the same period in 1992. After deduction for price increases, sales volume showed a further decline. Comparison of sales during the period January through May with the same period in 1992 shows an 18.7 drop in chemical fertilizer sales, a 1.6 percent decline in agricultural pesticide sales, and a 42.5 percent fall in sales of agricultural plastics. In addition, a survey of the spring planting preparations of 7,750 households in 31 counties all over the province shows purchases of chemical fertilizer, seeds, agricultural pesticides, agricultural plastic, and diesel fuel as running at between 43.1 to 67.4 percent of the same period in 1992. The situation reported by provincial agricultural survey teams also shows an actual decline in expenditures for agricultural production among peasant expenditures for the first quarter of 1993. It is noteworthy that the direct reason for the reduced peasant investment is not a shortage of supply, but mostly a rise in prices of the means of production. In addition, as a result of natural disasters in Anhui during the past two years, peasant income has declined. Some peasant families have no money to spend. They may want to invest, but they cannot pay. Their spirit is willing, but their flesh is weak. 4. Investment in agricultural infrastructure is insufficient; reserve strength is lacking for steady growth of agriculture. Expenditures for agriculture in the provincial Seventh Five-Year Plan fiscal budget (including expenditures to support agricultural production, payments for agricultural, forestry, and water conservation projects and investment in capital construction, and expenditures to assist undeveloped areas) amount to only approximately 10 percent of total government expenditures. As a result of major natural catastrophes in 1991, government investment in agriculture rose to 13.7 percent, but in 1992, it returned to the lowest point since implementation of the Seventh Five-Year Plan at only 9.06 percent. It is expected that no increase will occur during the next two years because of limited financial resources. Basically, the 1992 level can only be maintained. Furthermore, the percentage of fiscal budget that prefectures and counties apply to agricultural production shows a basic trend toward decline except in major disaster years. 2. Policy Climate Not Favorable to a Large Agricultural Province (1) Contributions of a Large Agricultural Province Anhui Province was the place in China in which rural reform began. Following the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Party Central Committee, it was the peasants in Anhui Province who first demolished the shackles of the old system to take the lead in implementation of the family output-related contract responsibility system, which raised the curtain on China's surging rural reform. During the past 14 years of reform, profound changes have taken place in the good earth along the Chang Jiang and the Huai Jiang. Anhui Province's economy and undertakings have developed by leaps and bounds. The main national economic statistical indicators show a speed of economic development in Anhui that cannot be considered slow. During the decade of the sixth and seventh 5-year plans, annual increase in Anhui Province's GNP, national income, social gross output value, gross output value of industry and agriculture, and gross output value of agriculture were all greater, in varying degrees, than the national average. (See Figure 1) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1.

During 1992. 46.2 percent of the province's revenues derived from the agricultural sector. This was 11.5 percentage points higher than the national average. Anhui ranks seventh among China's provinces, autonomous regions and directly administered municipalities in the percentage of revenues derived from agriculture after Tibet (63.6%), Hainan (60.0%), Guangxi (52.1%), Jiangxi (49.6%), Inner Mongolia (46.6%), and Hunan (46.4%). The province's township and village population in 1992 accounted for 82.1 percent of the total. Urbanization was 8.47 percentage points lower than the national average. Anhui Province is one of the country's main agricultural production regions, and it is also one of the small number of provinces having the potential for great agricultural development. Anhui Province's output of major agricultural products holds an important position nationally. In 1990, Anhui ranked seventh among the country's 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and directly administered municipalities in gross output of grain, seventh in gross output of cotton, fourth in gross output of oil-bearing crops, second in output of hemp, tenth in gross output of meat, and tenth in net purchases of agricultural and sideline products. Each year Anhui Province ships large quantities of agricultural and sideline products to other provinces, making an enormous contribution to the economic development of east China and the country as a whole. In 1978, Anhui was still a net recipient of grain shipments, but implementation of the household output-related contracting system released agriculture's potential. Grain output increased year after year. During the so-called period of limbo in grain production elsewhere in the country during the 1980s, Anhui's grain production continued to grow year by year. In 1978, the province's grain output totaled 29.65 billion jin. In 1979, it broke the 30 billion jin mark; in 1983, it broke the 40 billion jin mark; and in 1990, it broke the 50 billion jin mark at 50.4 billion jin, advancing three steps in 12 years. The provinces rate of increase in grain output was 1.4 times that of the country as a whole. In 1979, Anhui Province became a net shipper of grain, the amount shipped increasing from the very earliest several hundred million jin and a few billion jin to more than 6 billion jin during the 1980s. Between 1985 and 1990, the province's grain system alone shipped an average of 5.55 billion jin of grain each year. After deducting two-thirds of the 50 billion jin per year of grain that the province produces for the peasants' personal use, plus 17 billion jin of commodity grain, and 6.7 billion jin for grain system fixed procurement for the province, and the portion that the grain system sells in other provinces (this portion amounting to 25 percent of the amount of grain sold within the province), for a total of approximately 9 billion jin of grain, in most years the province can ship more than 8 billion jin of grain to other provinces. Anhui Province is currently only one of seven net grain shipping provinces. In 1990, per capita grain production was 445 kilograms, or 55 kilograms higher than the national average of 390 kilograms. In some new grain producing areas such as Chuzhou City, per capita grain output amounts to more than 882 kilograms. This is one of the areas in the country having fairly high elasticity in grain supply. (2) Contrast Between Contribution and Income Although Anhui Province's growth rate during all of the 1980s cannot be considered low, this is only in terms of gross output value and gross output indicators. If national economic net output value and the main income indicators are examined, the quality of Anhui Province's economic development has to be greatly discounted. Likewise, growth rates for Anhui Province's local government revenues, the average wages of staff members and workers, and peasant per capita net income during the decade of the sixth and seventh five-year plans were also lower than the national average. (See Table 2). ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 2. Average Annual Speed of Increase in Main Income Indicators in Anh-| |ui Province and Comparison With the National Average From 1980-1990 () | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Anhui Province (A)|National Average (|A-B | | | |B) | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Local Government |10.06 |11.81 |-1.75 | |Revenue | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Local Government |13.66 |11.03 |+2.63 | |Expenditures | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Average Wages |10.34 |10.88 |-0.54 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Peasant Per Capit-|11.30 |12.65 |-1.35 | |a Net Income | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Note: All figured at current prices | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Table 1 shows that despite a national income growth rate in Anhui Province that was slightly higher than the national average for a decade, this was the lowest growth rate among all the output indicators, and it was also the indicator that exceeded the national average least (See Table 1). Naturally, this fairly low increase in the net output value rate is connected with the economic structure. The contributions to national income of the development of basic industries and raw and processed materials industries are far from those of processing industries, in addition to which Anhui happens to be a large agricultural province, a large raw and processed materials province, and a large basic industries province. Comparison of Table 1 and Table 2 also shows Anhui Province's rate of increase in the gross output value of agriculture and grain output to be 1.09 and 2.29 percentage points higher than for the country as a whole, yet the rate of increase in both local government revenues and peasant per capita income are 1.75 and 1.35 percentage points lower than for the country as a whole. These two pieces of data show that government revenues and peasant income have not increased in step with the development of agriculture and the increase in grain production. Anhui's ranking in the country for peasant per capita net income and per capita government revenue also clearly shows the province is in the predicament of being a "large agricultural province and a fiscally poor province," and that its peasants "increase output but do not increase income." In 1978, peasant per capita net income in Anhui Province ranked fourteenth in the country, and fifth among the seven provinces and directly administered cities of east China (ahead of Shandong and Jiangxi). The super normal growth of agriculture during the initial period of rural reform stimulated a sharp rise in peasant income, peasant per capita income in Anhui Province zooming to eighth place in the county, an all time high. Later on, for various reasons, its ranking decreased year by year, reaching twenty-first place in 1990, and last among the seven counties and directly administered municipalities of east China. In 1991, when the province sustained a flood of more than once in 100 years proportions, peasant per capita net income fell to thirtieth place among the country's 30 provinces, directly administered municipalities, and autonomous regions. Despite the rebounding increase of 1992, it stilled ranked only twenty-seventh in the country, just above Shaanxi, Guizhou, and Gansu. A look at its income indicator shows that in 1990 Anhui ranked twenty-fourth in the country in per capita national income and national income accumulation. Its city and countryside residents' consumption level ranked twenty-sixth; per capita wages of staff members and workers in state-owned and collectively owned enterprises ranked twenty-seventh; per capita fiscal revenues and expenditures ranked twenty-ninth, and by 1992, average per capita government revenue stood at only 95 yuan for twenty-ninth place in the country, or above Tibet alone. Per capita government expenditures stood at 100 yuan for last place in the country. In the course of this Anhui survey, some old cadres who are extremely well informed about Anhui told us emotionally that the people of Anhui are outstanding and the land is fruitful. It is also a well endowed region that lacks nothing, so why did economic development end up in this predicament? The gap between Anhui and developed provinces is becoming wider and wider, money is flowing away, and talented people are leaving. It is really hard to bear! We also heard people say that on a television station contest about knowledge of the country, the master of ceremonies asked: Which province in the country ranks last in economic strength? The contestant replied: Anhui! The master of ceremonies said: Exactly right. Add 10 points! How out of keeping this income ranking and heartfelt anxiety of the people is with Anhui's contribution to the whole country as a major agricultural province, and Anhui's place in the country in output of major agricultural products! (2) Relationship of the Government, Finance and Banking, Enterprises, and the Peasants to Grain Production Agriculture is an industry that produces high social and ecological benefits, but low economic returns. From the cadres at the top to the peasants at the bottom in Anhui Province, all have quietly made a contribution to ensure agriculture's steady growth and ensure completion of the political task of providing grain effectively. However, we can see from the analysis that follows that under the existing system the development of agriculture and the promotion of grain production resulted in government, finance and banking, grain businesses, and the peasants shouldering a heavy burden. Objectively, this became a detrimental factor limiting the economic development of the whole province. 1. Fiscal weakness became fiscal subsistence. The disparity between government receipts and expenditures in Anhui Province is fairly glaring. Despite the numerous measures adopted in recent years to increase revenues and reduce expenditures, the problem of inability to make ends meet has become increasingly serious. As of the end of 1992, the provincial government deficit stood at 1.178 billion. Governments at all levels in the province have a hard time coping. More than 70 percent of the province's 72 counties (or cities) show a deficit. More than half receive subsidies, and only by milking special purpose funds can they get by. Because of straitened financial circumstances, government spending is increasingly in disarray, meaning the frequently talked about eating at the expense of building. Reportedly more than 80 percent of all government expenditures in the province are for people. Limited financial resources are used on supporting people, but the percent spent on increasing production is less than 20 percent. Each year only about 1 billion yuan is spent on production. Not only is this amount lower than the between 2 and 3 billion yuan that Jiangsu, Shandong, and Fujian spend, but it is even lower than the 1.4 billion yuan than Jiangxi spends. Investment in increasing production is grossly inadequate, and conversely this inadequacy limits economic development. Not only this, but economic backwardness means limited employment opportunities. Each year the province has to provide for between 30,000 and 40,000 military personnel returning to civilian life and university graduates. In the end, they can only be thrust into administrative units. This single requirement eats up more than half of the annual increase in financial resources. In every county that we visited in the course of this survey, it was common to find that cadres at the primary county and township levels had not been paid for several months. Fiscal hardship and destitution is directly related to Anhui's being a large agricultural province. No more fiscal revenues can be obtained from the agricultural tax, the agriculture and forest special products tax, the cigarette tax, and other agricultural products processing taxes; thus, revenue sources are limited. This means that fiscal revenues are unable to keep pace with the growth of agricultural product processing. Furthermore, in order to maintain essential investment in agriculture, each year something must be squeezed from limited financial resources for investment in agriculture from which there can be virtually no direct return. In addition, so long as the price scissors exists between industrial and agricultural products, Anhui stands to lose more than several hundred million yuan on the shipment of large quantities of agricultural products out of the province in exchange for large shipments of industrial goods into the province. In addition, the government must heavily subsidize grain. Statistics show 7.4 billion yuan spent for government grain subsidies between 1980 and 1991, 2.6 billion yuan or 35 percent of it coming from local governments. During the past three years, the charging off of grain business losses has increased greatly, amounting to 2.647 billion yuan as of the end of 1992. This has become a glaring problem bedeviling both the government and grain businesses. As a key grain producing province, Anhui's grain output increased year after year, but not only have local treasuries obtained no benefit from this increase, but their burdens have increased. Analysis of data from Shouxian, one of the highest output provinces in the country, shows a relationship between grain production and fiscal revenues. Between 1978 and 1984, there was a direct relationship; between 1985 and 1989 there was a weak relationship, and after 1990 there has been a negative relationship. This further intensifies the vicious cycle of subsistence finance. 2. The low operating efficiency of the Bank of Agriculture has turned it into a "procurement bank." As was said above, a serious credit gap exists in the Anhui provincial banking system. Demand for money is much greater than supply. Take just the provincial Bank of Agriculture system, for example, in which the level of savings is less than the national average but the scale of lending steadily increases thereby steadily widening the credit gap. In 1980, the provincial Bank of Agriculture (not including credit cooperatives) had a credit gap of 1.18 billion yuan. By 1992, the credit gap had widened to 10.1 billion yuan, and by the end of April 1993, because of further decline in savings, the credit gap further widened to 10.4 billion yuan. Faced with enormous money supply and demand pressures, the Bank of Agriculture's funds are used entirely for agriculture, particularly for meeting the rigid policy requirement of providing funds for state procurement of agricultural products. This is manifested in a fairly large percentage of the Bank of Agriculture's credit being for operating funds, and a fairly small percentage being for production. Operating funds loans account for two-thirds of the Anhui Provincial Bank of Agriculture's loans each year. Only one-third are loans for production. At the end of 1992, 65.6 percent of outstanding loans were operating funds loans, 49.9 percent of them loans to grain businesses. Production loans (including agricultural credit and township and town enterprise credit) accounted for only 33.6 percent. This ratio is just the opposite of developed coastal provinces (such as Jiangsu Province). In 1993, Bank of Agriculture credit plans increased 1.98 billion yuan, 1.1 billion yuan or approximately 55 percent of which was an increase in agricultural products and by-products procurement credit. Consequently, comrades in the provincial Bank of Agriculture laughingly term themselves the "Procurement Bank." The province's 1993 goal of realizing a township and town enterprise output value of 80 billion yuan will require an additional 6 billion yuan investment in fixed assets, but 1.9 billion yuan of this is unavailable. Pressures on the Bank of Agriculture are very great from all side, but the Bank of Agriculture system has long since shown itself to have more difficulties than it can handle. An even more serious problem is that the high percentage of credit extended for policy reasons (more than 70 percent of it), plus system and management problems create an increasingly serious burden on the limited funds of the Anhui Provincial Bank of Agriculture in the form of a siphoning off of funds. As of the end of 1992, irregular loans accounted for 9.38 billion yuan of the 24.97 billion of the credit balance of the Bank of Agriculture system throughout the province (including credit cooperatives). This was 37.6 percent of the loan balance! Of the irregular loans, 48 percent were overdue loans, 46 percent were stagnant loans, and 6 percent were bad debts. Moreover, of the irregular loans, the irregular loans of just grain businesses totaled 3.7 billion yuan, or 56.2 percent of the 6.58 billion yuan in loans extended to them. This was 39.5 percent of all irregular loans. Such a large siphoning off of money not only intensifies the already very acute funds shortage, but also increases the banks burdens immeasurably making it difficult for them to cope. 3. Grain businesses are mired in a predicament; they have become major losers. As the main grain and edible oil procurement and marketing channels in a large agricultural province, Anhui's state-owned grain system's fate is closely link to the production and marketing of grain. They reflect in a concentrated way all the conflicts in the existing grain procurement and marketing system. The golden age of Anhui Province's grain system began in 1983 when losses began to be turned into profits (thanks to fixed subsidy contracting), and it lasted until 1989. During this period profits were maintained year after year, the peak year being 1989 when profits amounted to 128 million yuan. However, beginning in 1990, the province's grain system once again incurred severe losses. Losses for that year reached 980 million yuan (657 million yuan more than total profits for the previous seven years). Thereafter, losses amounted to 1.15 billion yuan in 1991, and 110 million yuan in 1992. For the period January through May 1993, losses were 250 million yuan. After subtracting the treasury-subsidized portion, the province's grain system losses pending totaled 2.57 billion yuan. In 1993, Anhui Province ranked fifth after Hubei, Hunan, Heilongjiang, and Jilin provinces among the country's 30 provinces, directly administered municipalities, and autonomous regions in the size of losses. By the end of 1992, losses on account advanced to 2.647 billion yuan. Additionally, at least one-tenth of the grain currently in storage is over age and has mildewed. This means even greater potential losses. Faced with such enormous book losses, the provincial grain sector concludes from an audit that 92.8 percent of them are losses resulting from loans made for policy reasons. The remaining 7.2 percent are losses on loans made for business reasons, but the treasury has yet to accept this accounting. The main reason for grain businesses' book losses since 1990 are: grain price distortions, the more grain procured the greater the losses; a sharp change in grain supply and demand, negotiated price grain being purchased at a high price and sold at a low one; the high cost of building granaries, and of storing and transporting grain; tremendous rise in bank interest rates; the sale at parity prices of grain purchased for storage at a higher than the parity price, failure to recover grain loaned to the people, and the increased cost of rescuing grain from granaries in low-lying areas during flood years; failure to recover funds paid to peasants in advance for grain, and government failure to pay subsidies owing, etc. The severe debt burdens of grain businesses not only make it hard for them to function as the main channels for grain sales but also produces three-way bickering that draws in public finance and holds the banks hostage. This produces an uproar in the macroeconomic regulation and control system that causes losses in development of the entire economy. Ultimately, it is the peasants who must bear this "cross." 4. Structural changes occur slowly, the peasants increasing production without increasing their earnings. For the above reasons, it is difficult to allocate all of Anhui Province's resources for effective structural reforms. Unlike at the beginning of reform, even though the province's economy has undergone a certain amount of change, it still lags greatly behind the average level for the country as a whole. Comparison of 1990 with 1978 shows a 3.1 percentage point decline in the agricultural portion of Anhui Province's social gross output value, and a respective 4.5, 2.0, and 0.5 percentage rise in the industry, construction, and transportation portion (with an extraordinary 3.9 percentage point decline in the commercial portion). However, a lateral comparison shows the agricultural portion as 10.2 percentage points higher than the average level for the country as a whole, and the industry, construction, transportation, and commercial portions to be a respective 8.0, 0.6, 0.8, and 0.9 percentage points lower than the average for the country as a whole. Anhui still clearly exhibits the backward economic structure of a large agricultural province. The internal make-up of agriculture, in particular, has changed only extremely slowly during the past decade. Its structural change value is 7.8 percentage points lower than for the country as a whole (See Table 3) (Footnote: "Structural change value" is an indicator showing the extent of structural change. It consists of the difference between the various occupations making up agriculture [e.g. farming, forestry, etc.] for the reporting period and the various occupations making up agriculture for the base period, the differences in these structural ratios then being added up to produce an aggregate absolute value). Even more astounding is that the structure of agriculture in Chuzhou City, which this survey covered, has seen virtually no change in more than 10 years. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |Table 3.

Analysis of peasant earnings in Anhui Province shows two marked characteristics: First, the lion's share of total earnings comes from agriculture, and the lion's share of income from agriculture comes from grain farming. Furthermore, this income make-up has changed but little over the years (See Table 4). Since the percentage of income coming from other than agriculture has always been small, this is one of the reasons for the slow growth of peasant earnings. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 4.

Comparison of peasant per capita net income in Anhui Province with the country as a whole shows 1985 as the year when the difference was least at only 5.20 yuan. Thereafter, the gap widened with each passing year until 1990 when per capita peasant income in Anhui was 147.10 yuan behind the average for the country as a whole. Furthermore, the difference was greatest in two years during this period: 27.10 yuan in 1984, and 61.30 yuan in 1990. As is well known, these two years happened to be the ones when "difficulty selling grain" occurred everywhere. In addition, Anhui's peasants suffer greatly from the price scissors. The peasants call the price scissors "the fire tongs," whose effect on them is truly more real than for the peasants in developed provinces. Most of the peasant households we surveyed reported no improvement in there lives in recent years. They had no assets, and peasant households everywhere owed debts. In moderately economically developed Jiashan County, for example, peasant indebtedness is 210.50 yuan per capita or about 1,000 yuan per family. Most peasant households have to go into debt in order to farm and live. Thus, we have depicted the various aspects of Anhui's economic development as it relates to grain in terms of public finance, finance and banking, grain businesses, and peasant income. Now the problem is just how the economic development of a large agricultural province such as Anhui ended up in this destitute predicament. To attribute Anhui's backwardness and difference from the country as a whole solely to historical factors, or to blame it on the truly grievous losses from the great flood of 1991 is not convincing, we believe. This can neither explain why neighboring provinces are in a better position nor explain the 1990 data that is constantly quoted in this report. The fact is that there is no lack of provinces like Anhui. Without except, other large agricultural provinces such as Jilin, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi face the same difficulties and problems that Anhui faces. This demonstrates that even though the importance of agriculture to the national economy is constantly reiterated, a different logic operates in real life, namely that those who develop agriculture and develop grain production are the ones who suffer! This logic is manifested not only in the peasants "increasing production without increasing income," but is also exhibited in local public finance, finance and banking, and businesses, thereby seriously limiting the optimum allocation of resources through the entire economy. Close study leads to the conclusion that this is a major institutional reason why the economic development of all large agricultural provinces becomes mired in straitened circumstances. The reason we have taken great pains to detail the various examples in Anhui Province that illustrate this point is not only concern about the inevitable results of the foregoing logic, but also because we want to point out that this logic is inevitably attributable to a certain policy environment. In this sense, we feel that Anhui provides is a classic example. We can use this classic example to examine the formulation of macroeconomic agricultural policies and analyze the reasons why policies are not diligently carried out. 3. Reasons Why Central Government Policies Are Not Carried Out The only way for Anhui Province to get out of its economic predicament lies in more rapid readjustment of its industrial structure, However, in overall terms, how to maintain steady growth of agriculture while changing the economic structure is a strategic issue that must be conscientiously addressed. Thus, one basic principle in drawing up macroeconomic policy should be to do whatever helps different jurisdictions make the most of their own resources potential and economic strengths, creating a policy climate that is consistent with this. Otherwise, policies will be detrimental to economic development and detrimental as well to the coordination of overall strategy. Therefore, the problems with existing policies and how to adjust and solve them was also an issue the pros and cons of which we repeatedly examined in connection with whether policies were or were not implemented during this survey. One point about which we had a strong feeling during this survey was that a marked difference exists between central government policy goals and Anhui Province's own policy goals on the issue of developing agriculture. Proceeding from the needs of overall national economic development, the central authorities more greatly require that large agricultural provinces like Anhui provide more agricultural products in order to support structural changes in the economy as a whole. However, proceeding from the reality of its own economic backwardness, Anhui Province strongly demands that changes in the industrial structure be intensified to narrow the gap between Anhui and developed provinces. It has less interest in developing agriculture to satisfy needs outside the province. In explaining the reasons for these different policy choices, one cannot simply fall back on the usual reason of a conflict between what benefits the country as a whole and what benefits one part of it. The fact is that, to a very large extent, Anhui Province's choice is based on the realization that it is the policy climate that is responsible for an agricultural province getting the worst of things. Thus, the essence of the matter is that actual economic policies do not reflect the importance of agriculture. The differences between the central government and local government policy goals are actually a reflection of this real conflict. The problem is that if agriculture cannot really obtain the protection it should have, public finance, finance and banking, business enterprises and the peasants not only gaining no benefit but actually suffering losses, who has any interest in developing agriculture? The pointedness of this question, given the policy climate, lies in various interest groups not only having no interest in developing agriculture but, insofar as they act rationally, inevitably coming to regard agriculture as a burden to be gotten rid of! This is also the most basic reason why a series of plans, policies, and specific measures that the central authorities have framed have either not been implemented or have been distorted in implementation. Specifically, the understanding of the situation we gained from this survey suggests reasons at many levels and in many regards for the failure to implement agricultural policies. In a nutshell, they are mostly problems in the following several regards: 1. The detrimental effect of the macroeconomic economic climate. Agriculture is not an isolated system. It is closely related to the overall operation of the national economy. Consequently, implementation of agricultural policies frequently depends on more than just efforts within the agricultural system. The external climate is also an important, and sometimes a decisive, factor. Since 1992, the national economy has entered a new period of high speed growth in which industry has seen high speed growth, but in which large amounts of rural economic resources such as money, land, and manpower have been lost, investment demand has expanded dramatically, the price scissors has widened further, and agricultural labor opportunity costs have risen. This has been accompanied by turmoil in finance and banking and in the commodity circulation order, and the surfacing of various social contradictions that lay latent in rural villages, all of which created enormous pressures on the steady development of agriculture. Without a cooling of the external economic climate under these circumstances, it will be very difficult to put in place a series of new policies of the central government regarding agriculture and rural villages. No matter the effort made, only half the results will be obtained. For example, raising of the "two funds" will be difficult, procurement funds will be diverted to unauthorized purposes, and reduced peasant burdens will increase again, etc. The problems will show up in rural villages, but there roots are in the external environment. Therefore, limiting the implementation of policies solely to agricultural and rural villages will not work. The proportional relationship between industry and agriculture must be fundamentally altered to create a minimum normal economic order. This is the only way to get the basic conditions needed for the implementation of agricultural and rural policies. 2. Skewed orientation of policy formulation. Some of the policies being inaugurated today not only do not protect the interests of agriculture and the peasants, but are detrimental to them. This shows up mostly in the formulation of some reform measures that are clearly motivated by public finance's desire to get rid of burdens. An example is the new grain production and marketing policy, which substitutes charges not included in the price for the former "three link-ups." This was a move in the right direction, but the situation that ensued suggests that the basis for figuring the price difference was far too low. The peasants had to find more money to pay for the same quantities of chemical fertilizer and diesel fuel. An even more glaring example is the "weaning" of public finance from technical service organizations. Since both institutional reform and delegation of the "three authorities" stubbornly and arbitrarily emphasized "weaning" and streamlining, Anhui Province's grassroots level agricultural technology sector was dealt a mortal blow, which forced agricultural departments to operate some business entities having nothing to do with their function. This meant that every day agricultural technology personnel had to rush around to make a living, which produced a "five reductions" situation of less organizational support, personnel, operating funds, facilities, and services. It even resulted in inability to perform regularly the most basic tasks of providing early insect warnings and livestock and poultry inoculations. The spread of agricultural techniques takes a long time, yet it is indispensable to progress in agricultural technology. In addition, given the current level of development of peasant households in which "service for payment" generally applies only to specialized households and to some areas and links in agricultural production, mindless insistence on "weaning" and "service for payment" not only leads to taking benefits from the peasants, but also is bound to have serious consequences for the development of agriculture. Thus, it is very necessary to examine closely similar so-called reform measures today, clearly understand and set forth the relationship between building of a market economic system and protecting agriculture, resolutely correcting some erroneous ways of doing things and deviations. 3. Some policies are inoperable. The original intention in drawing up some policies is good, but because of failure to integrate policies, failure to take the total situation into account, and failure to investigate situations in detail, their operability is poor; they cannot be implemented. Just a few examples are provided here: - The grain floor price system. Although announced two years ago, neither the central government nor provincial governments have yet set up a grain risk fund system for the grain floor price system. Consequently a grain floor price simply cannot be put into effect. Thus, in the absence of a source of price differential subsidies, the more grain that grain businesses buy, the greater their losses. They must either pay the peasants less or limit procurement. Not only are the interests of grain-growing peasant hurt, but confidence in policies is undermined. - Ceiling price for means of livelihood. This is limited only to ex-factory prices and not to market prices, in addition to which supply and marketing cooperative's private ownership reform practice of "renting out the shell, and selling the meat" [zu kezi, mai rangzi] has increased the difficulty of policing ceiling prices, the ceiling price policy existing in name only. - The "two funds" policy. The original intention of this policy was to support peasant grain and cotton production, but returns from this policy far from offset the cost of and losses from its operation. Both grain and supply enterprises have no interest in its diligent enforcement. - Procurement funds specialized household control. This generally applies only to the first issuance. Once procurement funds have begun to circular, two problems are encountered at once. One is that when money withdrawn from circulation on sales made for the purpose of regulating the market is settled among the various specialized banks, it is frequently garnished instead of being returned to specialized households. Second, grassroots operating units must divide up the money taken out of circulation among multiple People's Bank outlets at a higher level. The links are numerous and procedures are complicated. Some of these kinds of operating problems can be improved in practice, but in some cases revisions are needed, more thoroughgoing reform measures taken. 4. Some policies are changed shortly after they are announced rendering their implementation impossible. During the survey, comrades at the grassroots level reported this situation in many regards. For example, the central authorities have already clearly announced a change in the method of linking grain sales to the provision of three kinds of goods in 1993, charges not included in prices to be paid to the peasants in cash. But recently, the province received a notice from the central government informing it that the portion of the differential price for fertilizer for which the central government bears responsibility will not be paid for in cash but with goods. It permits local governments themselves to decide whether to supply goods or cash for their portion. The reason given is that imported chemical fertilizer is accumulating in inventory. Local government comrades are very unhappy about the offhand way in which policies come out in the morning only to be changed by nightfall. Repeated changes of announced policies leaves implementers with the problem of how to provide an explanation to the peasants. Another matter is the issuance of rubber checks. During 1988 and 1989, for example, the State Council authorized the China National Cereals, Oil, and Foodstuffs Import and Export Corporation to regulate special purpose grain, which permitted Anhui Province to purchase nearly 1.3 billion jin of trade grain. It was initially agreed to pay a .022 yuan per jin storage fee for all grain not shipped after half a year. However, to date, less than 200 million jin of grain has been shipped and not a cent has been paid for storage fees. Provincial grain departments must spent an additional more than 25 million yuan each year in storage fees. In 1991 and 1992, the state also decided to apply a concessionary policy for the procurement of negotiated price grain, providing a subsidy of .03 yuan per jin. It made arrangements to purchase 600 million jin of rice from Anhui Province. The grain was purchased, but the national treasury refused to pay the bill. The subsidy remains unpaid to this time. The grain departments had to advance 18 million yuan for this purpose. The offhanded way in which policies are applied are also expressed in arbitrariness and misinterpretations. An example is the definition of the area to which no issuance of IOUs is to apply in the procurement of agricultural products. The spirit of the central government intent was clearly all agricultural products that the peasants sell, but acting in the spirit of the national financial administration conference, financial units limited it only to fixed procurement items. The "modification" of policies actually reflect the rigid interests of different sectors to the point where they take it upon themselves to revise, accept or reject, and distort central government policies. This has become an "intestinal obstruction": in the implementation of government decrees. Lack of separation of government administration and enterprise management, and institutional impediments are also one of the causes of policy distortions. While realizing that government policies are frustrated by the interests of certain sectors, one must also recognize the existence of problems in other regards as well, namely that at the time policies are drawn up, insufficient account is taken that certain aspects of the system for their implementation itself is changing as part of reform. Instead, traditional administrative methods continue to be followed. For example, units such as the specialized banks, grain, and supply and marketing departments continue to discharge numerous functions for policy purposes while they are also engaging in reforms to change their operating systems. They are in process of partly or completely changing from being administrative agencies to operating like business enterprises. While in this process, enterprises own business character and the continued discharge of functions of a policy nature creates inherent contradictions and clashes. Therefore, until such time as government administration has been completely separated from enterprise management, and during the designated period when policy and business functions continue to be centralized in a single entity, if the policies we formulate fail to take account of the profit and loss situation of the interests in the system that is to enforce the policies, which is in process of becoming a business, and if there is no mechanism for recompensing losses for the implementation of policies that an organization of a business nature incurs, resistance in the implementation of policies will be difficult to avoid. If the losses that grain and supply and marketing businesses incur in the discharge of tasks for policy purposes are commingled with business losses, whatever the treasury should pay for or has no way of knowing what to pay for the banks will be allowed to suspend. This will not only disrupt relations among grain dealers, banks, and the treasury (actually the treasury will incur a bank overdraft through the suspension of a grain enterprise account), but since you will not acknowledge the business character of grain dealers, supply and marketing units, and the specialized banks, you actually tacitly permit them the right to haggle with the government. In such situations, our policies themselves frequently become the best bargaining chip; consequently, policies are frequently sacrificed under such a system. Therefore, unless relations between the government and business concerns are straightened out, policy functions and the business functions handled separately, many of are policies will remain in their infancy. A fate for them other than anticipated will be a foregoing conclusion. 6. The incompleteness of rural grassroots organizations and institutions is also a reason why policies are not put into effect. Virtually all of our rural policies must ultimately be implemented by a township or village organization. The situation found in Anhui Province suggests that difficulties in implementing many policies are directly related very greatly to the incompleteness of grassroots organizations and institutions. As was said above, the "single account book" for finances at the village level that exists in all rural villages in Huaibei County is a main institutional reason why the "two funds" do not reach peasant households, and why peasant burdens are so heavy. Since the contracting of production to individual households in these places, the development of various kinds of cooperative economic organizations that transcend peasant households has been slow. The collective economy is weak, and various democratic procedural systems that the peasant self-rule law provides for have not even been broached. Village cadre allowances are the responsibility of the villagers, and this conflicts with the cadres' role of doing the government's bidding. This is manifested very glaringly here. In addition, cadre caliber is low and work style is poor. This makes for tense relations between cadres and the public and not very vigorous policy implementation. 7. Arbitrary policies mean that in large agricultural provinces, the spirit may be willing but the flesh is weak in carrying out policies. This situation shows graphically the need for the local treasury to provide money for the implementation of some policies. As was said earlier, the financial resources of the large agricultural province of Anhui are rather weak. Following implementation of the system of dividing revenues and expenditures between the central and local governments and holding each responsible for balancing its own budget, agriculture suffered more here than in developed provinces. Under these circumstances, until central government policy is tilted somewhat in favor of large agricultural provinces, these provinces financial burdens will increase. Thus difficulties in implementing policies will increase, and ultimately there will be no way to implement them. An example is the national grain production and marketing policy newly inaugurated in 1993, many provisions of which will require local governments to spend money. This includes a change in the method of providing goods associated with the sale of grain in the "three link ups." Local governments will have to pay 100 million yuan in subsidies. Local governments will have to put up 100 million yuan for grain reserves. After grain prices were decontrolled throughout the province on 1 April, the failure to solve grain businesses' longstanding problems will mean losses of 300 million yuan. In addition, allowances paid to administrative unit staff members and workers will require between 900,000 and 100 million yuan. For these several items alone, local treasuries will have to obligate 600 million yuan. This is 11 percent of fiscal revenues. This does not even include the setting up of a grain risk fund and dealing with the pending need for funds of grain agencies. Furthermore, the central government has decided to deduct over a 3 year period the 600 million yuan special grain subsidy paid provinces, and this 600 million yuan is only enough to pay a single year's new payments for grain, never mind eliminating the losses pending from previous years. In such a situation in which revenues do not cover expenditures, for new grain production and marketing policies to suggest that "local government may suitably increase added value standards as their financial resources permit, local government treasuries bearing all increased expenses" is a wish that can even less be talked about. In the investment field, too, the central government also frequently resorts to a proportional division of investment among local jurisdictions. When such a method is applied to the harnessing of large rivers -- projects of significance for the entire country -- (such as the Huai He river system's new Hui and Hong rivers), it is rather unreasonable. Not only does it intensify the inequality of wealth of different jurisdictions, but since the local government of large agricultural provinces cannot pay such sums, assessments must be levied on the peasants. This becomes, in turn, a main reason for the increase in peasant burdens in traditional agricultural areas. To summarize the foregoing, we realize that the inability to implement some central government agricultural policies is not just a failure of vigorous enforcement. It also depends on whether the drawing up of these policies was itself a correct move, whether the policies are workable, whether the gains and losses of the system charged with their implementation have considered and corresponding measures adopted, and whether the external climate is favorable. For large agricultural provinces, the problems are even more complex. They have to bear more directly pressures coming from all sides, and implementation of policies is hobbled by more serious conditions. Therefore, greater effectiveness of our agricultural policies requires efforts in many regards to improve our operating system.
