FR940328-1-00006 FR940328-1-00003 NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION 10 CFR Part 50 RIN 3150&hyph;AC93 Codes and Standards for Nuclear Power Plants; Subsection IWE and Subsection IWL: Extension of Comment Period AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission. ACTION: Proposed rule: Extension of comment period. SUMMARY: On January 7, 1994, (59 FR 979), the NRC published for public comment a proposed rule to amend its regulations to incorporate by reference the 1992 Edition with the 1992 Addenda of Subsection IWE, ``Requirements for Class MC and Metallic Liners of Class CC Components of Light-Water Cooled Power Plants,'' and Subsection IWL, ``Requirements for Class CC Concrete Components of Light-Water Cooled Power Plants,'' of Section XI, Division 1, of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (ASME B&PV Code) with specified modifications and a limitation. The comment period for this proposed rule was to have expired on March 23, 1994. The Nuclear Management and Resources Council (NUMARC) has requested an extension of the public comment period until April 25, 1994, so that NUMARC can provide necessary and constructive comments. In order to assure that the NRC receives the most meaningful comments possible, the NRC has decided to extend the public comment period for the additional thirty-three days. The extended comment period now expires on April 25, 1994. DATES: The comment period has been extended and now expires April 25, 1994. Comments received after this date will be considered if it is practical to do so but the Commission is able to assure consideration only for comments received before this date.
