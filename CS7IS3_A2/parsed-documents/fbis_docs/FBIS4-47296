An example of such an infrared imaging device is one which includes SPRITE radiation receivers operating with internal integration of signals, which ensures a very high detection power but normal operation within a very narrow range of scanning speeds only. The effectiveness of an infrared imaging device is defined as the angular space frequency _n_ of the equivalent thermal pattern to be resolved and thus as the reciprocal of its angular resolution, the latter being uniquely and monotonically related to the probability of detecting or recognizing objects on the ground. That angular space frequency can be determined from the temperature-frequency characteristic Q= _D_T[.sub]R[/]/_D_T[.sub]0[/]= _ps_(x) of the infrared imaging device (x= _ps_ï¿½; _D_T[.sub]R[/]- effective difference between temperature of object and ambient temperature, taking into account the transmissivity of atmospheric air and deviation of the equivalent pattern from the standard one; _D_T[.sub]0[/]- temperature difference equivalent to the set noise). Another characteristic needed for evaluating the effectiveness of infrared imaging is the dependence of the threshold m of Q-magnification due to superposition of image rows or frames on the total relative shift between images. The scan cycle period is assumed to be usually much shorter than the periods of angular oscillations of an aircraft about any of its principal axes. It is also assumed that the photodetector noise may have a hyperbolic component. Figures 2; references 6.
