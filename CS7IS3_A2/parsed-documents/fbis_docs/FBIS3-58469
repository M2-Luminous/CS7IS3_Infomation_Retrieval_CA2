Such was the question being asked yesterday in the lobbies of the National Assembly by several members of the Foreign Affairs Commission. They added that after "giving in to Iranian threats" by sending two presumed terrorists back to Tehran even though they were wanted by Swiss authorities, France, by letting itself be pressured into tearing up its policy concerning the sale of weapons to Taiwan, "allows China to treat it differently than it does the United States." Here is the gist of the official statement, released yesterday: "Aware of China's concerns, the French Government undertakes not to allow French companies to contribute to Taiwan's armament in the future." Last year, the PRC had been enraged by the announcement that France would sell 60 Mirage 2000 fighter aircraft and six frigates to Taiwan. The contracts were vital for the French arms manufacturing sector -- France being the world's second biggest arms exporter after the United States. China had retaliated by unilaterally closing down the French Consulate in Canton. United States Unaffected And yet, the French were not the first Western nation to decide to sell weapons to Taiwan. After the Tiananmen Square massacre (1989), the Americans had gone back on their 1982 pledge not to sell any more weapons to Taiwan. Last July, a vote at the House of Representatives had even confirmed and broadened the U.S. policy change. Furthermore, in terms of volume, the U.S. armament contracts (supplying 150 F-16 fighter-bomber aircraft and leasing a number of frigates) are more than twice as large as the French ones. And yet Beijing has not implemented any retaliation measures against the United States, thus clearly breaking Mao's old iron law which states that "China treats all nations, whether small or large, on an equal footing." At the time, the announcement of the armament contract with Taiwan had not been criticized in France nor in the United States. As shown by the December 1992 parliamentary election, the Taiwan regime, turning its back to the Kuomintang dictatorship, has become a Western-style democracy. Although strictly unofficial, relations between thriving Taiwan and mainland China are quite strong: Through intermediaries operating from Hong Kong, "nationalist" Chinese have become the leading investors in Communist China, thus contributing to the latter's extraordinary economic growth. However, the PRC -- sole holder of Chinese sovereignty in the eye of both the French and the U.S. Government -- has still not abandoned the idea of forcibly bringing back into the fold the island, which seceded in 1949. In such a context, asks a Western diplomat, "can one prevent Taiwan from acquiring what it needs in order to discourage Beijing's intentions?" This same diplomat adds: "Sooner or later, the French Government, which is usually just as ready to uphold the cause of democracy as it is to protect its interests vis-a-vis the United States, will have to dispel the ambiguity."
