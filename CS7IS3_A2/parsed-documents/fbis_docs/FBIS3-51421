The report will be presented to the Permanent Commission of Congress and to Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas. Last week, Camacho Solis said he would go to Congress to learn the opinions of the two senators and 11 deputies from the six parliamentary benches who recently visited Chiapas to analyze the situation there. According to the agenda, the Permanent Commission of Congress will meet at 1000. Camacho Solis will then be presented with ideas and suggestions on how to resolve the Chiapas conflict. Party of the Democratic Revolution [PRD] Deputy Alejandro Encinas, member of the group that traveled to Chiapas, has said that the group will propose measures in addition to the amnesty. [Begin Encinas recording] I think the issue, regardless of the interests of the private sector, the government, and the political parties, is to outline the essentials -- namely, the new relationship the state must have with Indian groups, a relationship that respects their autonomy and their traditions while acknowledging the Indian authorities as formal authorities, as well as the way in which the federation is integrated. [end recording] At the conclusion of the Permanent Commission's meeting, the Chamber of Deputies and Senate will simultaneously convene for a special session at 1200 [1800 GMT]. Later, at 1400, lawmakers from both chambers will join in a General Congress session to be informed of the presidential amnesty initiative for Chiapas.
