"For us, what is important are the actions on the ground and not wild statements," spokesman Oded Ben Ami told AFP. Rabin initially reacted angrily to remarks made by 'Arafat in South Africa urging a "jihad" or holy war to recover Jerusalem and implying in veiled terms that Palestinians were not necessarily bound by their agreement with Israel. Rabin first talked of sending troops to reconquer the autonomous areas but he "soon realised that he risked jeopardising the entire peace process and changed his tune," an Israeli minister who asked to stay anonymous told AFP Thursday. The minister said Police Minister Moshe Shahal and met [as received] two prominent Palestinian leaders from Jerusalem on Sunday to convey a warning to the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) leader. Shahal told them to tell 'Arafat that his remarks could force Israel to reject further concessions to the Palestinians, because of the effect of his statements on Israeli public opinion. "The two Palestinian leaders admitted that their leader had no idea of the role of Israeli public opinion and promised to get the message to him," the unnamed minister said. [passage omitted]
