Kinkel's lecture at the invitation of the "French Institute for International Relations" (Ifri) and the "International Liaison and Documentation Office" (BILD) had been on the program for some time. However, at a time when it is important for the parties involved to overcome irritations in Franco-German relations, the German foreign minister's appearance in Paris is particularly important. During his visit, Kinkel also met with President Mitterrand. The European unification process has opened a new road to the future for Germany, Kinkel said. The overwhelming majority in the Bundestag and the ruling of the Federal Constitutional Court confirmed the general conviction in Germany: "We need more and not less of Europe." France and Germany agree on the historic finding that two neighboring states in the heart of Europe that are so big can only exist together. "Therefore, Germany and France have always placed unification of Europe before going it alone and going special ways." Thus, the two states have become "Europe's pacemaker." "This will and must continue!" The new Europe is no longer the divided Europe of the Cold War, but "the whole of Europe," Foreign Minister Kinkel explained. Here the following "fateful questions" arise both for France and Germany: How can we consolidate peace? How will we ensure the prosperity of our peoples? How will we stand our ground in a global framework? For Germany the answer is clear: "We can only cope with this challenge in and with the European Union [EU]." Kinkel is certain that France's answer is the same. As the first issue in fact, the enlargement by Austria, Sweden, Finland, and Norway is now at hand. "It would be foolish to cling to questions of voting rights now." In 1985 one had jointly made possible the entry of the south of Europe, now it is the turn of the north, he said. French-German cooperation has stood the test in joint initiatives, such as the establishment of a European corps, the resumption of the "Yugoslav" negotiations, and the GATT negotiations. Now the two partners are faced with the further development of the EU: the admission of new member states, the reform of the European institutions, the relationship between deepening and enlargement. "Germany and France must maintain their role as a hinge in an EU that is continuing to grow. This is our joint future task." From 1 July onward, Germany and then France will chair the EU. For these 12 months, the German foreign minister sees a German-French "presidential program" with four focal points: 1. The implementation of the EU treaty, starting from Economic and Monetary Union [EMU]. "Our joint objective is the convergence of our economies." Not all member states can make the step to the third stage of EMU at the same time. "Germany and France have to defend the logic of the EU treaty against all attempts at undermining it," Kinkel demanded. 2. An independent European security and defense policy as an answer to the security policy challenges in Europe. Here the future Europe also needs the security partnership with the United States. "Franco-German cooperation is strengthening the pillar of the bridge across the Atlantic." Kinkel paid tribute to the French efforts for NATO's decision on Sarajevo. "I see with satisfaction that the EU peace plan, which is based on a Franco-German initiative, is now developing into an international peace agreement, which, as I hope, will be solid on a long-term basis. It is an example of the power of the Franco-German agreement." Kinkel and French Foreign Minister Juppe agree on the wish to commit the CSCE member states to "joint action against those who disturb the peace." "The old thinking in terms of zones of interest is no longer acceptable. In the new Europe there can no longer be any room for so-called vital spheres of interest and for the concept of `close foreign countries.'" 3. The EU also has to strive for a more active Mediterranean policy. The German and the French foreign ministers want to "explore" the opportunities for joint initiatives. 4. With a joint EU policy toward the East, the reform states in Central and East Europe are to be taken closer "step by step to our community of stability." Since 1990, France and Germany have been striving for a joint policy toward the East. Kinkel mentioned the contacts with Poland as a positive example. Kinkel proposes a "European development corps" for the Central European reform states. The German foreign minister was more reserved regarding Russia's wishes for help: "Russia's integration within the world economy is only possible as Russia enforces the market economy at home itself." "Together with France," Germany wants to take the Baltic states increasingly closer to the EU. As in his initial comments on European polices that were marked by German-French cooperation, Kinkel had tried before to dispel concerns about a disturbance of relations in an interview with the daily LE MONDE. The contacts between the two countries are "so diverse, close, and natural" that even "different points of view" cannot shake the "excellent bases of our relations," Kinkel said. Referring to Bonn's sensitiveness over preparation for the commemoration of the Allies' landing in Normandy, the foreign minister said: "I do not doubt that (after the meetings between de Gaulle and Adenauer in Reims and Mitterrand and Kohl in Verdun) French and Germans will also succeed in adequately commemorating the end of World War II and Germany's return to the community of democratic states."
