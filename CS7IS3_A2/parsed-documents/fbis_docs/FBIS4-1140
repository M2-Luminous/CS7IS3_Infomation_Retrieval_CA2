According to a statement by the AWB's General Staff "thousands of members of the AWB are already busy moving into the area". This was to ensure sufficient manpower was mustered to ward off any persecution or action against right-wingers by a future communist government. The generals warned that the "so-called peace" which had been found between the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] and the African National Congress would not last. "The fact that the IFP has now been drawn into the elections will definitely be an opportunity for conflict and confrontation between the ANC and the whole Zulu nation," the statement said. The Zulu population, as the biggest single group in the country, would never accept the outcome of the elections when the ANC obtained the majority of votes. "The war between the IFP and the ANC will then intensify. South Africa will be plunged into a bloodbath." The AWB declared that under no circumstances would it be part of the elections. It still regarded the April 26-28 poll as illegal and it therefore had no confidence in the future government. "The General Staff and the Executive Council have therefore decided to protect members of the organisation and the Boervolk [Boer nation] against the chaos, uprising and revolution which will follow," said the statement. It defined the territory which it had declared as its "base, secure territory" as stretching from "Northern Transvaal to the Cape border." Thousands of AWB members were already busy moving into the area to ensure that sufficient manpower was mustered against a communist threat. Right-wing sources confirmed they were aware of AWB mobilisation plans, with most activity centred on the Western Transvaal. Neither AWB leader Eugene Terre'blanche nor Gen Nico Prinsloo, normally the only people authorised to speak to the press from their Ventersdorp headquarters, were available for comment on Thursday afternoon. Their Johannesburg-based spokesman, Fred Rundle, was not available.
