Shooting was heard in northern parts of Bujumbura after a further night of fighting in the central Nyakabiga district, but no casualty figures from that violence could immediately be obtained. Opposition supporters put up roadblocks to close off the city centre and shops there were shut. Most of the few cars on the streets belonged to relief workers. Youths from the Tutsi minority, carrying stones, threatened an AFP photographer before telling him that the government had pledged a new president "representing all Burundis" but had failed to keep its promise. The new trouble began after justice officials on Saturday sacked five of the seven members of the constitutional court, which had been due to rule on the election of Hutu Agriculture Minister Cyprien Ntaryamira as head of state, in place of the late Melchior Ndadaye, a Hutu who was assassinated in a failed coup bid by the Tutsi-dominated Army last October 21. Soldiers were numerous on the streets Tuesday but did not intervene when Tutsi youths stoned a young Hutu, the photographer said. Ndadaye had been the first elected president from the Hutu majority. Military sources said almost a score of people were killed in clashes on Monday. An opposition coalition on Monday called on Burundis to stay away from work until the "restitution of the dismissed members of the constitutional court," all of whom were Tutsis. The sacked judges themselves issued a statement declaring their dismissal unconstitutional and accusing the government of "seeking at any cost to prevent the persistent risk that the court could invalidate" Ntaryamira's election. [passage omitted] Prime Minister Sylvie Kinigi, a Hutu, was Tuesday due to meet party leaders in a bid to resolve the latest crisis, officials said. For weeks after the coup bid, Kinigi went into hiding with other government members in foreign missions here as ethnic massacres swept across the small highland nation, leaving tens of thousands of dead, according to relief workers, and sending hundreds of thousands fleeing to neighbouring countries. [passage omitted] Former colonial power Belgium expressed "concern" at developments in a Foreign Ministry statement issued in Brussels on Tuesday. The statement noted that Belgium had backed the democratisation process that led to last year's multi-party poll and ended traditional Tutsi rule. "The Belgian Government considers that everything should be done so that the Government of Burundi can restore order and peace and that the political obstacles can be raised," the statement said. It expressed Belgium's support for Kinigi and for Ntaryamira as "elected president," and called on all parties to take part in "national reconciliation."
