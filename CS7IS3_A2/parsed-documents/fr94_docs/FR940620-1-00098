(2) The contracting officer shall extend the time for response if the Contractor submits a written request showing the need for additional time to prepare a response. (3) The contracting officer may request additional supporting documentation if, in his or her opinion, the Contractor's explanation does not provide sufficient evidence to justify the validity of the asserted restrictions. The Contractor agrees to promptly respond to the contracting officer's request for additional supporting documentation. (4) Notwithstanding challenge by the contracting officer, the parties may agree on the disposition of an asserted restriction at any time prior to a contracting officer's final decision or, if the Contractor has appealed that decision, filed suit, or provided notice of an intent to file suit, at any time prior to a decision by a court of competent jurisdiction or Board of Contract Appeals. (5) If the Contractor fails to respond to the contracting officer's request for information or additional information under subparagraph (f)(1) of this clause, the contracting officer shall issue a final decision, in accordance with the ``Disputes'' clause of this contract, pertaining to the validity of the asserted restriction. (6) If the contracting officer, after reviewing the written explanation furnished pursuant to subparagraph (f)(1) of this clause, or any other available information pertaining to the validity of an asserted restriction, determines that the asserted restriction has_ (i) Not been justified, the contracting officer shall issue promptly a final decision, in accordance with the ``Disputes'' clause of this contract, denying the validity of the asserted restriction.
