Not only does the action completely undermine the Thai military's contention that it no longer supports the reviled guerrilla group but it has also exposed the country to accusations of human rights abuses and international condemnation. The reaction from Phnom Penh, with which ties are already strained, was swift and not surprisingly bitter. "It is a human rights abuse from some people or Thai authorities, and I would like to say clearly that (Cambodia is) not happy about this," Foreign Minister Prince Norodom Sirivut stated on Saturday. Sirivut, who is due in Bangkok today to discuss the repatriation, hinted that Phnom Penh would now review earlier pledges to extend timber and gem contracts in the Pailin area and return seized mining and logging equipment. The foreign minister also called on the "international community to look very carefully" at the Thai action and Bangkok's refusal to allow the UN or other aid organizations to go to the sites where the refugees are being held. The world community, which just last month pledged an additional $770 million to rebuild Cambodia, can only be expected to react with disapproval to a move that will be perceived as prolonging the fighting. The Cambodian army's attack on the former Khmer Rouge stronghold coincided with a propaganda offensive by the Thai military to convince a skeptic world that it no longer supports the guerrillas. Thai military officers who built up close contacts with the Khmer Rouge during the resistance war against the Vietnamese-backed government in the 1980s, have been accused of maintaining and profiting from the relationship after the guerrilla group took over the gem and timber-rich border zones around Pailin in 1989. Following a call from the United States for Thailand to show it had cut its links with the group, the military arranged for journalists to tour the border two weeks ago. A second press tour of the villages where the refugees had taken shelter was arranged on Friday but then abruptly cancelled. Instead, the army sealed off the area, denying diplomats, journalists and officials from the UN and International Red Cross access to the refugees. At the same time reports began to emerge that the military had begun repatriating refugees, many against their will, despite an agreement with Phnom Penh to discuss and plan the return of the Cambodians. In the ensuing news black out, unconfirmed reports claimed that the military may have culled out the young and able-bodied men among the refugees and repatriated them first by truck, to the Khmer Rouge-controlled zone of Phnum Malai. Asked to explain the government's actions, spokesman Aphisit Wetchachiwa, cited the long refugee burden Thailand had carried and told AFP "we think what we have done is appropriate." If denying refugees, many of whom were not only fleeing the fighting but also the Khmer Rouge, international security guarantees and forcing them back to areas they fear, can be considered "appropriate" neighbourly behaviour it is obviously going to take a long time before relations between Thailand and Cambodia reach a level of mutual respect. Ever since 1979 when more than 30,000 Cambodians died after the Thai military forced them off steep cliffs along the border and into mine fields, the lack of respect officials have shown for the lives and welfare of Cambodia refugees has been a national shame. In a small but telling irony, while independent observers and international aid agencies were denied access to the refugees over the weekend, Thai traders were allowed to profit handsomely selling food supplies to the refugees in return for jewellery and gold. Once again, the image Thailand has presented to the world has been of conspicuously sleazy border traders enriching themselves under the administration of the military and off Cambodian refugees caught up in a murky political game. As of yesterday, many of the refugees were still waiting to be sent home. There is still time to admit that the repatriation was undertaken with undue haste and to negotiate for the Cambodians to return under conditions that are acceptable to Thailand, Phnom Penh and the United Nations. The decision to send the refugees back was most likely taken under a dated Cold War reflex that seems to afflict many of our senior foreign ministry and security officials and not out of avarice or any intention to keep the Khme Rouge alive. But while some people in Bangkok may believe that as long as refugees are being involuntarily pushed into Khmer Rouge-held areas, Thailand's blighted international reputation is not going to improve.
