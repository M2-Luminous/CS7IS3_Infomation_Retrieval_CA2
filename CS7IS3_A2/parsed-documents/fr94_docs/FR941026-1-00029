FR941026-1-00029 FR941026-1-00013 The actual month-end account balance used to calculate the entitlement must be adjusted by transactions which are processed before the payment is processed but which relate to the period on or before the month-end used for the calculation. For example, assume that in March 1995 the Board receives a qualifying court order awarding the former spouse one-half of the participant's account balance as of the end of February 1995. In May 1995, the Board processes an adjustment record received from the participant's employing agency which removes from the account $100 that was determined by the agency to be an excess contribution erroneously made by the agency in January 1995. If payment pursuant to the court order is made in July 1995, the amount paid would be computed based on the February 1995 month-end account balance, minus the $100 which was removed from the account in May 1995 but which related to the period prior to the February month-end computation date. On the other hand, if the adjustment record was for an erroneous contribution made in April 1995, then the February balance would be used in the calculation of the former spouse's award without reduction for the $100 adjustment. Section 1653.4(b) provides that, where the award does not cite a specific date or event, the entitlement will be calculated based on the month-end balance on or immediately preceding the date the order was entered by the clerk of the court or the date the order was filed by the clerk of the court, if the order does not show a date entered. If the order does not indicate a date entered or filed, the date the order was signed by the judge will be used. Once the appropriate date is established, the rules of paragraph (a) are applied as if that date had been specified in the order. Section 1653.4(c) provides that, if the court awards a specific dollar amount, but indicates that the amount awarded must be paid out of the balance that is in the account on a certain date, the award will be for the lesser of the amount awarded or the appropriate month-end account balance, determined and adjusted under the same rules as in paragraph (a). This approach is based on the notion that the court has no power to award a sum that is greater than the amount in the account on the particular date cited in the order. Also similar to the rules set forth in paragraph (a), if no date is specified in the court order, the award will be assumed to be based on the date the order was entered, filed or signed as appropriate. Under ยง1653.4(d), unless the court order specifies otherwise, no earnings will be credited to the amount awarded. If the court specifies that interest or earnings are to be credited, but does not specify a rate or method of calculation, the Board will use the actual rate of return on the participant's account for the time period involved based on the funds in which the account is invested. The participant's account may be invested in one or more of the following funds: the Government Securities Investment (G) Fund, the Common Stock Index Investment (C) Fund, the Fixed Income Index Investment (F) Fund. Because the earnings may be based in whole or in part on the earnings of the Common Stock Index Investment (C) Fund or the Fixed Income Index Investment (F) Fund, and those funds may suffer losses for any given period of time, the earnings credited to the award could be either positive or negative. The earnings calculation will begin with the month after the month-end balance used in calculating the principal amount of the award, and will end with the month preceding payment. If the court specifies a different method for calculating interest to be credited to the award, that method will be used. Section 1653.4(e) makes it clear that under no circumstances may a participant's Agency Automatic (1%) Contributions be paid pursuant to a court order it those funds are not vested under 5 U.S.C. 8432(g) at the time of payment. While the entitlement may initially be calculated to include such nonvested sums for purposes of advising the parties of the amount awarded, the amount will be recalculated excluding those sums if they have not become vested by the date of payment. Section 1653.5 sets forth the procedures for making payments pursuant to qualifying retirement benefits court orders. Under ยง1653.5(a), if a qualifying order is found to require payment, an appropriate tax notification will be provided to the payee after issuance of the Board's decision. Payment will not be made less than 30 days after issuance of the tax notification because, under the Internal Revenue Code, the payee will often have the right to elect a transfer to an Individual Retirement Arrangement (IRA) or other eligible retirement plan, or to make a tax withholding election. As discussed with respect to the elimination of the period for appeal of the Board's decision, this minimum waiting period of 30 days also provides the participant an opportunity to seek an amended order from the state divorce court or to challenge the Board's determination in Federal court under 5 U.S.C. 8477. Section 1653.5(b) states that payment must be made directly to the individual(s) specified in the court order. However, as required by the Internal Revenue Code, this paragraph also provides for a spouse or former spouse to elect to have all or a part of the payment transferred directly to an IRA or other eligible retirement plan. Section 1653.5(c) provides that no payment may be made from an account that exceeds the vested account balance at the time of payment, excluding any outstanding loan at the time of payment. Although outstanding loan balances are included for purposes of computing the amount of an award as of the appropriate computation date as determined in accordance with ยง1653.4, payment cannot include any amount that is outstanding as a loan, because the money is not in the account and thus is not available to be paid. Payment of more than the vested account balance excluding the outstanding loan balance would require a payment from the Plan that would have to be absorbed by the rest of the TSP participants.
