Chettha said he believed military aid would not be forthcoming because that would break the 1991 Paris Peace Accords on Cambodia. "If any country wants to give arms support, it will have to think twice. But I don't think that will happen and therefore the warring in Cambodia will come to a halt," he said. Chettha said the collapse of peace talks between Phnom Penh and the Khmer Rouge was not a worry for Thailand. However, some people might be affected if fighting spilled across the border into Thailand.
