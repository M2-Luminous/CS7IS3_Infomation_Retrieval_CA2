Politically, the Democratic Russia Party is closer to the centre than the Russia's Choice," co-chairman of the Democratic Russia movement Lev Ponomarev, whose idea it was to set up a new party, told ITAR-TASS. According to Ponomarev, the party, which is now being set up by Yegor Gaydar, i.e. the Russia's Choice party, would most likely be a bourgeois-type organisation, while the Democratic Russia Party regards itself as a "right-wing social-democratic party in the Western sense of the term", and will "contribute to the social adaptation of the population to the ongoing reforms", will combat bureaucracy. Ponomarev explained that the Democratic Russia Party was "in a way a party of the opposition". It is in opposition to the government, especially to the local authorities in the provinces, but not to the president, whom the party still regards as the "locomotive of reforms". "We dare oppose the authorities to a greater extent than the Russia's Choice party. We have not signed the social concord agreement, while Gaydar did it," Ponomarev stated. "The Democratic Russia Party relies on the backing of the same social groups as the Russia's Choice, that is the intellectuals, small and medium-size businessmen, and it will inevitably compete with Gaydar's party for influence on these sections of the population," Ponomarev noted. "As to the already existing organisational foundation of the Democratic Russia movement, Ponomarev said that it had split between the two new parties. In some places most of the members of the movement's regional organisations had joined the Russia's Choice party (for instance, in Archangel), but in most of the regions they decided to join the Democratic Russia Party. He said that in Moscow the membership of the Democratic Russia movement had split between the two parties almost equally. Ponomarev believes that in spite of all their current differences, the democrats were obliged to nominate one common candidate to the post of president during the future elections. "We do not plan to nominate our own candidate. We shall do everything we can to have one common candidate from all the democratic forces," he stressed.
