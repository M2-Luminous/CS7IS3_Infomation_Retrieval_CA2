Many Latin American countries promoted its creation, and, at last, during the International Conference on Human Rights held in Vienna the necessary conditions were present. However, the creation of the position of human rights high commissioner was delayed a few more months. The Vienna Declaration entrusted this task to the General Assembly. Some countries had misgivings, but then something crucial happened. A work group was created to dispel these misgivings, and its presidency was bestowed on Ecuadoran Ambassador Jose Ayala Lasso. Thanks to the diplomatic endeavors of the Ecuadoran representative an agreement was quickly reached by all governments. On 20 December 1993 the General Assembly created the position of high commissioner for human rights. On 14 February 1994 Ambassador Ayala Lasso's efforts were rewarded with his appointment to the position. [passage omitted] Ayala is described by Emilio Cardenas, Argentine ambassador to the United Nations, who has no doubts that the Ecuadoran diplomat is the ideal person for the position. [Begin Cardenas recording] There are issues that develop on the international scene that are complex. At the same time their histories are not always well known or taken into account. In my opinion, these attributes of Ayala Lasso represent to all of us not only a source of pride, but also the hope that a person with his qualities will be the man who, for the first time, will adequately perform in the position of human rights high commissioner. [end recording] The human rights high commissioner must be well versed on the topic and must have an impeccable reputation and a deep understanding of different cultures in order to perform his duties impartially, objectively, and efficiently. The resolution creating the high commissioner's position establishes that the high commissioner must have knowledge of all human rights issues in the civilian, political, cultural, and economic spheres. He also must respect each states' sovereignty, keeping cultural differences in mind, and must abide by the principle that human rights are universal and that all governments must help guarantee them. [Begin Ayala recording] This is a very important decision taken by the United Nations, and it fulfills almost 50 years of aspirations. In my opinion, it fundamentally consists of creating a kind of spokesman for humanity's conscience, whose objective will be to contribute, through dialogue and concerted action, to the progress of human rights worldwide. [end recording] [passage omitted] Ambassador Ayala Lasso has been Ecuador's UN representative since 1989. Formerly, he was ambassador to Peru, Belgium, Luxembourg, and the EEC, as well as the Ecuadoran foreign minister in 1977. He was also an international law professor at the Central University of Ecuador and has published articles on international issues in various newspapers. Ayala Lasso is a lawyer and economist and has several university degrees. [passage omitted]
