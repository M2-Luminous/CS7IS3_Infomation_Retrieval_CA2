What Kiev Feared and Moscow Was Apparently Not Ready to Face Has Happened"] [Excerpts] Judging by the results of the first round of presidential elections on the peninsula, it seemed that the greater part of the population thought the Crimean Republic's reunification with Russia will be a panacea for all the woes that have befallen them. This was precisely what Yuriy Meshkov, presidential candidate from the Crimean Republican Movement, promised them (subsequently with some qualifications). On the day of the second round of elections, 30 January, Mustafa Dzhemilev, chairman of the Crimean Tatar People's Assembly, gave a news conference. He was sharply negative of Yuriy Meshkov's possible election as Crimea's president. He is convinced that wherever conflicts have arisen, the situation strongly resembled what is happening in Crimea today. Mustafa Dzhemilev sees as the main danger the Black Sea Fleet, a greater part of whose servicemen voted for Zhirinovskiy in the elections to the Russian Federal Assembly. According to Dzhemilev, Crimean Tatars do not understand Meshkov's wish for Crimea to have close relations with Russia: "Why not with Turkey, where the living standards are several orders of magnitude higher, or with America?" [passage omitted] On 31 January Nikolay Bagrov organized a news conference for Crimean, Ukrainian, and numerous foreign journalists. He stated that in all likelihood, he would leave politics. According to Bagrov, "the president will be placed in a difficult position because the election program will have to be implemented. But it is infeasible." Nikolay Bagrov said that he is not going to run for either the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet or the Crimean Supreme Soviet. He ended the news conference by saying: "I am grateful to everybody for their cooperation. Thank you." On 31 January the Crimean Supreme Soviet Presidium held a session in which Nikolay Bagrov made a statement which says in part: "I consider it impossible to remain chairman of the Crimean Supreme Soviet after the results of the second round of presidential elections in the Crimean Republic. I ask the extraordinary session to accept my resignation." [passage omitted]
