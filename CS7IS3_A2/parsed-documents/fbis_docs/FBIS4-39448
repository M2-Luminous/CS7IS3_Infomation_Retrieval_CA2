On the U.S. side the working groups were headed by Senators S. Nunn and J. Exon, on the Russian side by S. Yushenkov and A. Piskunov. The U.S. legislators voiced extreme concern at the state of civilian control in the defense sphere in Russia. Special attention was paid to the need to monitor the observance of the regime governing the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear materials and of chemical and bacteriological weapons and their components. The Russian deputies accepted the need for civilian control within the framework of the approval of the federal budget and verification of its implementation as well as the ratification of international treaties, backed up by the functions of the parliamentary monitoring of their implementation. During the meeting there was a broad exchange of opinions on the state of affairs in the sphere of strategic offensive weapons. The question of extending the Nuclear Weapon Nonproliferation Treaty in 1995 was regarded as a priority. The two sides agreed that in mutual relations with Ukraine special account is to be taken of the delay in the deadline for the latter's fulfillment of the obligations under the Lisbon protocol on affiliation to the Nuclear Weapon Nonproliferation Treaty, which is holding up the entry into force of the START-1 treaty and the preparation of START-2 for ratification. Despite the persistent attempts to find coordinated decisions, it has not yet proved possible to find common approaches on the possible levels of the further reduction of strategic offensive arms, even though the sides do not deny the need for that, or on the creation of the conditions for the testing im military theaters of ABM systems relating to the 1972 ABM Treaty. Considerable attention was paid at the meeting to the use of the U.S. resources allocated by the Nunn-Lugar initiative to the destruction and recycling of nuclear and other types of arms belonging to the Russian Federation. Attention was drawn to the fact that these resources are not being used effectively enough. Of the $432 million allocated in 1992-1993, the Russian side has used less than $100 million. In view of the slow rate at which the executive power structures are concluding the relevant agreements it was deemed expedient to hold joint hearings on this question in fall 1994. It was noted that joint military exercises are an important measure for strengthening confidence between the two countries. Bearing in mind the complex domestic political situation in the Russian Federation, the U.S. side agreed to propose to its government that the initial stage of the joint exercises by peacemaking forces be switched to U.S. territory.
