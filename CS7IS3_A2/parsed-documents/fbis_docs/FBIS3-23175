Hufelschulte and M. Krischer: "Liaison Man of the RAF"] [Text] The news from the FRG Interior Ministry came by telephone. The caller urged that senior official Karl B. should be immediately transferred to another department of the Federal Office of Criminal Investigations (BKA). In the BKA president's staff in Wiesbaden, the explosive nature of the official order was immediately clear. After a brief note about the telephone conversation, the high-ranking official picked up the stamp and put "confidential -- official secret" on the piece of paper. No one should learn what Interior Minister Manfred Kanther and his State Secretary Kurt Schelter had just -- on 2 February 1994 -- ordered. The banishment from Bonn hits a dedicated BKA official, who has caused serious problems for the German security authorities, which have difficulties anyway, and is now radically condemned to silence -- eight months after the antiterror operation in Bad Kleinen. Senior official Karl B., who was the head of BKA Antiterorrism Department Number 11, found out: There is a high probability that Klaus Steinmetz, the alleged spy of the Rhineland-Palatinate Office for the Protection of the Constitution in the Red Army Faction [RAF], is a leading RAF activist. The man, who put the investigators on the trail of Birgit Hogefeld and Wolfgang Grams in Bad Kleinen in June 1993, was a top courier of the RAF and obviously knew of secret terror operations. However, he kept everything to himself and did not tell his controllers at the Rhineland-Palatinate Office for the Protection of the Constitution about his knowledge. The official BKA paper, which was drawn up by Karl B. and which immediately disappeared in a drawer because of the relentless analysis, permits only one conclusion: Steinmetz cheated the authorities. He cheated the Rhineland-Palatinate Office for the Protection of the Constitution as well as the chief federal prosecutor, who suspended proceedings against him on 28 January. "The investigations," Hans-Juergen Foerster of the Chief Federal Prosecutor's Office says, "did not give sufficient reason to publicly indict him." A BKA official told FOCUS: "They are glad that Steinmetz is gone now. They do not want to ask him anything anymore. They do not want any answers that would be embarrassing -- embarrassing in particular for those who controlled Steinmetz as a liaison man and who would now have to realize that they had lost control of him and that he might have committed crimes while they protected him." Steinmetz, who is hidden somewhere and being prepared for a new life with a new identity abroad, would have to face indictment according to the uncomfortable BKA paper. According to the findings by the terrorism experts, the guy, who according to himself was a minor cog and mediator between two camps, is in reality a big shot. As one can read in the BKA dossier, on page 17, he is considered to be a person who "is tightly integrated in the RAF structures" and can probably "be called a supporting member of the RAF." According to the BKA analysis, Steinmetz never took the truth very seriously. His statements are "incredible" and "in complete contradiction" with BKA findings "on essential topics." The alleged liaison man claims to have established contact with the RAF command echelon in autumn 1991 in Metz, France. He claims to have met Hogefeld and Grams, who were caught in Bad Kleinen, in Paris in February 1992. After evaluating all evidence, the BKA investigators are certain that he had access to the RAF command echelon much earlier. Steinmetz gave a bad impression also with his statements about the spectacular RAF attack on the prison in Weiterstadt on 27 March 1993. Shortly after the operation in Bad Kleinen, he claimed that he had learned about the forthcoming blowing up of the super prison. Interrogated by the BKA and the Chief Federal Prosecutor's Office later on, Steinmetz made a turnabout. "I did not know anything about that beforehand," he dictated to the reporters and was thus permitted -- the investigating authorities knew about the interview -- to publicly present himself as innocent. The explosive BKA report leads to other conclusions: Klaus Steinmetz, to whom the RAF gave the cover name "Bruno," was obviously a top courier of the terrorists who had gone underground. He transported documents that, according to the BKA dossier, "would permit profound insight into the communication structures if the police got hold of them." A task that no one -- and quite certainly not the strictly secret RAF command echelon -- would entrust to a "minor cog." The transport of "structurally relevant secret messages," as the BKA analysis says about Steinmetz's role, "is probably assigned to such persons to whom both the sender and also, in particular, the recipient (illegals, RAF members for whom there is an arrest warrant) have a long tested and intensive relationship of trust." One insider told FOCUS: "Now they are all fluttering with fear. After the BKA stock-taking, one must necessarily investigate the question of whether the liaison man perhaps knew about assassination attacks beforehand, such as about the ones on Rohwedder and Herrhausen." Karl B., who is renowned in the BKA because of these expert qualifications, suddenly felt an icy wind blowing in his face after he had presented his report. Reportedly, he was three times requested to formulate his findings about the true role of liaison man Steinmetz differently. Karl B., called Charly by his colleagues, stuck to his version. The result: The hot document was stamped "not usable in court." The Chief Federal Prosecutor's Office, the master of the investigations, reacted with irritation to the official, whose analysis threatened to torpedo the suspension of the investigations against Steinmetz. In a talk with BKA President Hans-Ludwig Zachert in January 1994, Karlsruhe Senior Prosecutor Gerhard Loechner is said to have harshly criticized the tense relationship between the two authorities. The scapegoat was found quickly: senior BKA official Karl B. However, also internally, both in the Wiesbaden BKA as well as at the Rhineland-Palatinate Office for the Protection of the Constitution in Mainz, Charly the Steadfast caused big trouble with his report. The reason: Important evidence has disappeared. The background: According to BKA investigations, Steinmetz was handed a particular cargo one day before the operation in Bad Kleinen. Wolfgang Grams wanted to send two glasses of red currant jam to his parents. Birgit Hogefeld reportedly gave Steinmetz two personal letters. After examining the typewriter ribbon, it was concluded that one letter was for her mother, the other one for a woman from the supporters' scene, who uses the cover name Vicky. After the GSG-9 operation the Rhineland-Palatinate Office for the Protection of the Constitution took over Steinmetz's cargo. During an interrogation by the BKA Antiterrorism Department Number 24 of 24 August 1993, official G. remembered the jam -- however, he claimed not to know anything about the letters. It is, however, these two mysteriously disappeared letters that make Steinmetz's great importance in the RAF structure clear, the suppressed BKA dossier indicates. In the future, the uncomfortable senior official Karl B. is supposed to keep his hands off terrorists. As of 1 March 1994, he will be transferred to another department -- the Interior Ministry has refused any comments about the background of this transfer. Charly, the experienced RAF hunter, now has to keep statistics about drug-related crimes.
