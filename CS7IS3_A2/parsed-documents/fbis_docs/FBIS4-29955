The "interim draft compilation" of the mired details of the discussion so far will be submitted in a "concentrated form" at the sixth meeting of the subcommittee on 9 June. It is expected that only a harsh refutation led by petroleum side members will result, the compilation of "an interim report" on the same day will be difficult, and it is certain that "final compilation" will be carried over until 20 June. Although the "compilation draft" that will be submitted to the subcommittee on 9 June is considered "to have the appearance of a mosaic" (Petroleum Department, Agency of Natural Resources and Energy), it seems that they have clearly worked out the direction toward relaxation of regulations on the whole. The concern with the contents is that the "basis" is the "Memo of Major Discussion Points" in the form of a consolidation of previous discussions submitted by the Secretariat to the subcommittee meeting held on 19 May. The "draft compilation" will probably be created referring to this memo. Therefore, one can attempt to anticipate the "compilation" via the "Memo of Discussion Points"... For the first point of discussion, "In what direction should we aim for a stable supply guarantee policy in the long term," noted in the memo are both the assertion that 1) "An oil crisis is generated every 10 years, and in the future, dependence on the Middle East will rise, tight supply and demand are anticipated, and we should aim at a stable supply for the future by a consumer-site refining method," and the idea that 2) "Considering the trend toward internationalization of the petroleum products market, especially the progress in integration of the Asian market, it will be impossible to close the domestic market forever, and also inappropriate from the viewpoint of opening up future prospects for the petroleum industry. Along with planning for internationalization of product price levels and price structure by liberalizing imports, we should consider a stable supply within an international market." However, it appears that the "trial draft" on 9 June will be closer to the second point. Concerning the second discussion point, "Should the consumer-site refinery method be secured by the Designated Petroleum Products Import Provisional Measures Law," the memo asserts: 1) "From the importance of a stable supply, it is necessary to secure systematically a consumer-site refinery method by the Designated Petroleum Products Import Provisional Measures Law, and the insurance premium for that should properly be borne by the public." 2) "The framework of the designated Petroleum Products Import Provisional Measures Law has become such that imported goods do not flow directly into the domestic market, and it impedes the efficiency of the market and hinders the elimination of price structure distortion and the foreign and domestic price differential. Insurance premiums are too high in the current arrangement." 3) If there is an obligation for storage of imported products to guarantee a stable supply, that is sufficient and the law should be abrogated." 4) "Consumer-site refining is both economical and efficient and, considering that Japan's petroleum industry has international competitive power at the refining stage, it is excessive to guarantee the consumer-site refining system by the Designated Petroleum Products Import Provisional Measures Law." Among these, ideas 2, 3, and 4 will probably be incorporated. On the third point, "Will it be necessary to review the storage system in case of expanding imported products," this issue perceives the necessity of storage and it does not appear that it will result in a large dispute. On the fourth point, "To what extent should we systematically guarantee the quality of petroleum products in the case of expanding imported products," it says: 1) "It is necessary to make a systematic guarantee in order to maintain the environment, safety, and existing high quality, including performance covering that." 2) "Supplying only high-quality products robs the consumer of the opportunity of selection, and we should supply products with diverse product quality." 3) "Based on the trends of various countries of Europe and the United States, we should continue to study in detail to what extent it is necessary to guarantee systematically the current high level of quality." This issue will probably be mentioned in the "compiled draft" with points 1 and 3 as the axis. Three assertions are listed for the fifth point, "Is it necessary to manage the domestic distribution routes in peacetime from the viewpoint of response in an emergency," but as a whole, in preparing for a crisis and carrying out compulsory constraints on demand, there is a strong possibility that the direction will be indicated toward the necessity for service stations to accurately manage supply routes. For the sixth and final point, "Shouldn't we proceed with distribution efficiency," the focus has been on assertions that: 1) "Service station (SS) sales are one-fourth that of the United States and one-half that of Europe. The cost per sale is great and we should promote further efficiency." 2) "Expansion of imports is necessary for overall efficiency in the distribution system." 3) "We should indicate the direction of abolishing the designated district system based on the Gasoline Sales and Distribution Business Law." 4) "It is necessary to pursue cutting services in response to the criticism of excessive service, and safety regulations preventing introduction of the self-service method are excessive." 5) "By promoting distribution efficiency, 400,000 people have been hired centering on small service stations, which exerts a considerably bad effect on service station management itself." Here, it is certain that a tendency is shown toward the promotion of efficiency while being mindful of point 5. Viewed thus, the "interim compilation draft" which each member will have in his hands on 9 June will probably be rather remote from the assertions of the petroleum industry which considers that "the Designated Petroleum Products Import Provisional Measures Law is absolutely necessary" (Petroleum Federation chairman, Yasuoki Tateuchi). In any case, the "settlement" of "heated argument" anticipated by the subcommittee on 9 June will determine the future direction of the relaxation of petroleum industry regulations.
