Spokesman Major Dacre Holloway today. The spokesman said that Yasuhi Akashi, the chief U.N. representative for former Yugoslavia, had been informed of the Serb decision at Pale today, the stronghold of Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, where Akashi and Karadzic had been meeting in a bid to break the deadlock over the enclave. Meanwhile, Akashi is negotiating with Bosnian Serb leaders on a truce for the besieged southeastern Muslim enclave and the release of some 200 U.N. personnel. According to the latest news reports, 19 Canadians -- 16 U.N. soldiers and three military observers -- were released by Bosnian Serb forces outside Sarajevo on Sunday [17 April], three days after they were detained in retaliation for NATO air strikes.
