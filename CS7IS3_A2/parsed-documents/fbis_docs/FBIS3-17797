The military command issued a statement on Tuesday [29 March] retaliating a recent amendment to the Dniester laws which declared all Army weapons, equipment and other hardware belonging to Tiraspol. "Tiraspol actually provokes seizure of the 14th Army's weapons and equipment," the statement said and qualified the actions of Dniester leaders as "demonstrating extreme disrespect towards the Russian Federation and its peace-keeping efforts in the region." The Army command demanded the annulment of the "provocative" amendment.
