The memorandum concerns differences of figures for government military personnel to be confined in 29 areas recommended by the United Nations. The NOTICIAS newspaper quotes Lieutenant Colonel Osorio Mateus, assistant of the government's representative in the CCF, as saying that our complaints are still in force. He questioned if there wasn't another intention behind Aldo Ajello's statements on 3 June, that the government withdrew its complaints.
