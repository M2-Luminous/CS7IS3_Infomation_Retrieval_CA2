One Defense Ministry source said Wednesday that the government had decided earlier to hold Team Spirit if the North Korean nuclear issue was not resolved. Since Pyongyang has said it will allow the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to conduct inspections, however, the government can consider suspending the exercise, he said. Team Spirit could be suspended if it contributed to resolution of the nuclear issue and stability on the Korean peninsula, the official said, requesting anonymity. But there is still a possibility that North Korea is employing delaying tactics in its negotiations with the IAEA to force postponement of Team Spirit beyond March, when the exercise was originally scheduled, he said. The government, therefore, will make a final decision on Team Spirit after watching developments in the North Korean-IAEA negotiations, the official said. In other words, the government will wait until the IAEA concludes that it can maintain continuity in nuclear safeguards in North Korea before making a final decision on the exercise, he said. South Korea and the United States are expected to make a joint announcement on Team Spirit at the end of this month or in early March, the official added.
