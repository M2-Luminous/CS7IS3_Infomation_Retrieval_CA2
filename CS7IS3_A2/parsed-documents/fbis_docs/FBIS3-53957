The prime minister is currently speaking at the Cinematheque in Tel Aviv. Our political correspondent Udi Segal reports: [Begin recording] [Segal] The prime minister said that 1994 will be a watershed. This year will determine whether the Middle East is headed toward peace, Rabin asserted. Prime Minister Rabin made several important statements here with regard to Syria. He revealed that the Americans have reached the conclusion that Syria is prepared to make peace according to the Egyptian model. Israel hopes to avoid repeating the Egyptian precedent, Rabin said, at least with regard to withdrawal from territories. [Rabin] This government, on the basis of its election platform, is prepared to make a territorial compromise on the Golan Heights. Whoever says we lack a mandate to do so is simply talking nonsense. It appears in our platform; we said it out loud, despite the pain it entailed. I pray that we will be able to avoid repeating -- and we will make absolutely every possible effort in this regard -- the price we paid for peace with Egypt. I would like to say that in this regard, the Egyptian precedent -- or the price we paid for peace with Egypt -- is on the mind of every Arab leader. I have not still not received any definite sign that Syria accepts our definition of peace, and it goes without saying that we are far from accepting the full and painful price it is demanding in exchange for peace. [Segal] Prime Minister Rabin said that his decisions on significant territorial concessions will be made on the basis of a national referendum. He refused to define at this time what he means by significant concessions. Prime Minister Rabin said that at present, he still does not know whether the fundamentals of a peace agreement can be worked out with Syria. Once he is confident that this is feasible, a law will have be passed on a national referendum so that the Israeli public can vote on the issue. With regard to Syria, Rabin said that when one refers to the Egyptian model of peace one is also speaking about the other aspects of that peace or, in other words, peace with normalization and security arrangements. Rabin also addressed the Palestinian track and explained that no progress has been made in the current negotiations with the Palestinians. This, Rabin asserted, is because PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat is still demanding the symbols of national sovereignty. Rabin reiterated Israel's demands with regard to the border crossings and the jurisdiction of the Jericho area. Rabin confirmed that agreement has not been reached on either the size of the Jericho area or on the issue of the border crossings. As for the Gaza Strip, Rabin said that he would feel no sense of loss if Israel handed the Gaza Strip over to the control of the Palestinian police. He also referred to the Gaza Strip in the context of Israel's negotiations with Egypt in the 1970's. Rabin said he does not remember the Egyptians ever asking for the Gaza Strip. [Rabin] I do not remember the Egyptians ever demanding the return of the Gaza Strip in the course of the negotiations. I can tell you now, and not on the basis of some wild assessment, that if we were to offer the Gaza Strip to Egypt today, the Egyptians would tell us to go choke on it by ourselves. [Segal] Rabin also alluded to Lebanon and Jordan. With regard to Jordan, the prime minister assessed that Amman will not sign a separate peace with Israel unless progress is made on the Syrian track. This is an important statement in the wake of the assessments made by Foreign Minister Peres and Foreign Ministry staffers that Jordan could indeed sign a separate peace agreement. As for Lebanon, Rabin said that country is obviously totally dependent on Syria. Thank God, Rabin said, that no one had sought to establish settlements there. [end recording]
