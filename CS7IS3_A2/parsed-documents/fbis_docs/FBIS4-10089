FBIS4-10089 "drlat067_p_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-067 Daily Report 5 Apr 1994 Ecuador Government Makes Symbolic Payment of Foreign Debt Government Makes Symbolic Payment of Foreign Debt PA0604120694 Madrid EFE in Spanish 2316 GMT 5 Apr 94 PA0604120694 Madrid EFE Spanish BFN [Text] Quito, 5 Apr (EFE) -- The Ecuadoran Government announced today that it has decided to end the 20-month delay in the payment of its foreign debt service because it believes that its renegotiations with private creditor banks are "in their final phase." At a news conference, Finance Minister Cesar Robalino said, "I have authorized the payment of $5 million in interest as a symbolic show of the good faith and seriousness of the governnment, which wants to close a chapter that has considerably limited the country's development." Ecuador had not paid its foreign debt service since May 1992, during the government of President Rodrigo Borja (1988-92), who managed to include approximately $1 billion for that purpose in the total renegotiation package with the credit banks' Administrative Committee. Ecuador's debt with the private banks is close to $6.5 billion, half of the country's total debt. Some government officials have pointed out that Ecuador is trying to reduce its debt with the private banks by at least 50 percent, but Robalino did not confirm that percentage today "to avoid hindering the negotiations," he said. Robalino added that a few hours ago, the IMF directors received the so-called "letter of intention" that outlines the government's economic policy, which is expected to be approved by the full directorate during its 11 May session. Along with the presentation of this document, the Ecuadoran authorities asked the IMF for a loan of $180 million. Robalino announced that the government will later request "additional aid for a debt reduction program," but he declined to disclose further details. At the end of May or in June, Robalino will present the same economic program to the Paris Club and request a refinancing loan of $400 million, which is approximately the amount of the debt Ecuador has with that organization. In sum, the Ecuadoran Government expects to receive, following passage of its economic program, approximately $1 billion in "fresh loans" from the IMF, World Bank, Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and other international organizations. The program outlined in the "letter of intention" anticipates "the country's economic growth, in real terms, by three percent up to December," which is below the expectations recently announced, Robalino added. "This implies that economic reactivation will surpass the population's growth and that the Ecuadoran people's standard of living will improve," he added. The other goals of the 1994 program are to reduce annual inflation by 20 percent after dropping it from 60.2 percent in 1992 to 31 percent in 1993; increase the country's International Monetary Reserve (IMR) to $1.5 billion; and put an end to the fiscal deficit. The minister also reiterated the government's "political resolve" to modernize and reduce the state apparatus and to privatize all institutions hampered by deficits.
