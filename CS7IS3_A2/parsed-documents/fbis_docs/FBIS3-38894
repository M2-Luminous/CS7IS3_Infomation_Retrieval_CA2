Fabbri also said he is worried by the worsening of the conflict between the Somali factions. [Begin Fabbri recording] The army and defense chiefs of staff have planned our homecoming in agreement with UNOSOM [UN Operation in Somalia] and have taken the needs of the other contingents, such as the German one, into consideration, in order to be able to guarantee an environment of maximum security. In order to verify from the ground that everything is proceeding according to plan, today I made arrangements for a mission [as heard] under the command of Deputy Chief of Staff General Zoldan. I have confirmed that a naval flotilla will be sent offshore near Mogadishu, and that aircraft will be redeployed in Nairobi. We are doing everything we can think of to guarantee maximum security during the withdrawal phase. The mission is practically over. There are some technical time limits which are obligatory in relation to agreements that we have made with the United Nations. [end recording]
