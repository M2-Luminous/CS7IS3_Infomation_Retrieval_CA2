It is the second of its kind after a link was established between the sse and the securities trading center in east China's Fujian Province. With it, all buying and selling orders can be transmitted on computers. Brokers at both places can trade securities listed on these two stock markets and can receive quotations and settled accounts issued by them, and investors' accounts are in common use in the two cities. Since a successful trial of the network in January, over 90,000 citizens in Shenyang have been encouraged to open new accounts within the past two months. The network will offer more opportunities for members of the SSE from different parts of the region to enter the Shenyang market.
