The recording was made at the very end of the outgoing year when he was rounding up its results, and these results, I must say, were extensive and varied, and out of all that variety, we have selected the things that concern everyone directly: housing, conditions of service -- but each of you can add to the list yourself. Listen on. [passage omitted] [Begin Grachev recording] [passage omitted] Regarding military discipline: the results of 1993 show that, unfortunately, due to serious failings in the work of staff commanders and educational organs at all levels, and also through lack of personal discipline, people continue to die, weapons, ammunition, and military property are misappropriated, and cases of absence without leave continue to occur. The Ministry of Defense is making every effort to solve these problems. To illustrate this, we managed this year to slightly reduce the gravity of problems linked to losses and misappropriations of weapons and ammunition. In comparison with the identical period last year, the quantity of misappropriated weapons fell by a factor of more than 17. In comparison with 1992, the number of dead was almost halved. An order of the Ministry of Defense on measures for maintaining law and order and military discipline in the Russian Armed Forces has been worked out and dispatched to the troops with the aim of improving discipline in the forces. We believe that its execution will enable the state of affairs in this area to be improved significantly in 1994. [end recording]
