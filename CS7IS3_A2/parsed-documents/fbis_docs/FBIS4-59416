[passage omitted] Speaking after his meeting with Speaker Birri, al-Murr said that what is happening is not a crisis as much as a political problem to which we seek a solution. He added: Speaker Birri plays a major role in finding this solution or helping to find one. Noting that certain proposals exist, al-Murr added: We hope that these proposals will help us emerge from the crisis. Following his meeting with Birri, al-Murr returned to Prime Minister al-Hariri's residence, where he met with him in the presence of Minister Walid Junblatt. Earlier, al-Murr visited Defense Minister Muhsin Dallul. Al-Murr denied any knowledge that a Syrian envoy is expected to arrive in Lebanon today or that the president, Chamber speaker, and prime minister would leave for Syria. He noted that the crisis is on the way to being resolved.
