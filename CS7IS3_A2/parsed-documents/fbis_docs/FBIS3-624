In a handwritten communique circulating in Djibouti since yesterday, this official, Ahmed Ougoureh Kifle, announced the dissolution of the political bureau led by Ahmed Dini Ahmed and the formation of a 13-member new "executive council" in which he is the leader and commander in chief of the resistance. The text of the communique accuses the former leadership of making "unforgivable mistakes that resulted in cases of disappointment and in a situation unbearable for all." It blames the former political bureau for "its negative policy and inability to bring the various situations under control." This, according to Kifle, has caused "a state of anarchy and no-progress, which has paralyzed the FRUD for two years now." The new executive council, which mostly comprises "famous commanders" of the early hours of their struggle and which apparently wants to get rid of the front's hardliners, "pledges to end the no-peace no-war situation." It contemplates to evolve new struggling strategies, while being open to a possible dialogue with the government in power," the text adds. Kifle does not also rule out moves likely to lead to direct contacts between the fighting sides with the view of ending the crisis that Djibouti is going through. The main FRUD officials did not react to this communique today.
