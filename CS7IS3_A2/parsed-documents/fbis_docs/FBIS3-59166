Deniz Ogut] [Excerpts] Azerbaijan's postponement of the "Turkic Republics" summit, which was due to have been held in Baku, shocked Ankara. [passage omitted] The summit was postponed in line with a request from Russia, which is following a "backyard" policy on Central Asia and the Caucasus. This process, which started with the dispatch of Russian troops to Tajikistan, continued with the solution of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict on a Russian initiative and Moscow's intervention in the continuing Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict. Realizing they can achieve lasting peace only by siding with Russia, Georgia and Azerbaijan joined the CIS. From then on, Russia has said: "If unity is needed, we already have the CIS; we do not want a summit of the Turkic republics." A Dream Collapsed Within Four Days Recent military victories by the Azerbaijanis against the Armenians are due to Moscow helping Baku, which is acting in tandem with the Russians. In return, Baku postponed the "Turkic summit." [passage omitted] Turkey's broken dream is not the only result of the postponement of the Baku summit. What really faded was the illusion of a share in the Caucasian and Central Asian cake by acting as a front for the West. Trying to establish ties with the former Soviet republics, Turkey acted as the representative of the IMF, World Bank, similar other imperialist institutions, and NATO. In line with these institutions' desires, Turkey advised them to follow an unbridled privatization program. This was Turkey's thinking to create "a Turkic world extending from the Adriatic to the Wall of China." It did not happen. Shaman Dance by Turkes, Demirel, and Inonu In agreement with the United States, Yeltsin has now declared the region part of his responsibility. Turkey, which failed to develop its own independent ties with these republics, has remained helpless in the face of this new development. Privately, the Russians are saying: "We had relations with these republics for many years and will continue to have relations. Why did Turkey start to utter the slogan `From the Adriatic to the Wall of China?' This frightened us." The Russians tease: "Now, Turkish officials are reacting to Zhirinovskiy's statements. Well, weren't we supposed to be concerned when Turkes, Demirel, and Inonu were organizing Turkic world meetings in Antalya and, like Shamans in our Siberia, dancing around fire and hammering the iron on the anvil?"
