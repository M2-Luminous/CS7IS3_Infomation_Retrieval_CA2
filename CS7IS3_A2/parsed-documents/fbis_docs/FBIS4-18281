It said the forms of the protests were to be discussed locally, but could include work stoppages. Referring to protests by French young people against a government plan for low-wage youth employment, now dropped, the CGT communique said that "By acting to halt job cuts" at the SNCF and "in defending the future of rail facilities," the rail workers "are carrying on a struggle similar to the one waged by young people, who demand only the right to live and the right to stable and useful employment."
