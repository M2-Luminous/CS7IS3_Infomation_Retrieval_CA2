Certain leaders, notably Alberto Neto, president of the Angolan Democratic Party, PDA, have expressed the belief that they should be present at the talks in Lusaka. [Begin Neto recording] (?There is talk) that peace will be achieved by any means. Let us add that, to that end, there must be trust and dialogue. Dialogue is something which is already happening, so there is the need to do away with lack of trust now. This is why we believe that other civilian political parties, including the PDA, should be attending the Lusaka peace talks or other subsequent talks so we can contribute toward peace and national reconciliation, as stated in the Law on Political Parties and in the Angolan Constitution. National reconciliation cannot be achieved by two political forces alone. [end recording] The following is what Milton Kilandamoko, president of the Angolan Social Democratic Party, PSDA, said: [Begin Kilandamoko recording] In principle, we (?believe the talks will lead) to a cease-fire accord that will end hostilities and that will allow us to return to our normal lives, so that we can really turn to thinking about national unity. [end recording] Paulino Pinto Joao, president of the Angolan National Democratic Convention, CNDA, made the following comment: [Begin Joao recording] There is a clear need for achieving an agreement in Lusaka: First of all, because the Angolan people do not want war any more. We all aspire to peace and that is our message to our brethren negotiating in Lusaka at this stage. Second, because democracy is not achieved through war. To make democracy, there has to be peace. People must accept and tolerate differences so they can look for areas of consensus concerning solutions to the nation's problems. [end recording]
