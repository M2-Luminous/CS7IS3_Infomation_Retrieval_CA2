The Social Democratic Party of Austria [SPOe] and the Austrian People's Party [OeVP], Franz Vranitzky and Erhard Busek, have achieved the main objective of their government and no longer have to waste any time dwelling on the past: Their election campaign for the parliamentary election in October should focus on clear ideas for the future and avoid narrow-minded polemics. Even more so, since this Sunday [12 June] also brought a defeat for Joerg Haider, who wanted to turn 12 June into a day of voting out the Vranitzky government. He failed spectacularly. Particularly in urban areas, which is where the Freedom Party of Austria [FPOe] sees great potential for support, 75-percent majorities in favor of the EU were quite frequent -- with the number of opponents in many cases not rising beyond the share of the electorate held by the FPOe, the Greens, and Communists. This allows another interpretation of the result: Even those less well-off and the less-educated hardly fell into the trap represented by the slogans of fear launched so violently by TAEGLICH ALLES -- a sign of political matureness, as was the high voter turnout, which was not the result of weather conditions. Nevertheless, no one should believe that the advance of the FPOe has now been stopped or even that the SPOe and OeVP can now be sure of defending their share in the fall election. It is probably true what Vranitzky and his government team pointed out on television again and again: The EU referendum was not the right vote to give someone "a good lesson," because the parties' performance should be evaluated in the fall. This was understood by Austrians, and they were capable of differentiating. They have given the FPOe leader something to think about. Nevertheless, the Austrians may well go for escapism this fall by, for example, confirming the same Joerg Haider once more as the bad boy of this republic in the fall. Of equally high importance is the effect of this result internationally. It looks as if Austria has finally recovered from the setbacks of the Waldheim years. Such clear EU votes are rare, which is why the Austrians will be able to present themselves in Brussels with a rather high degree of self-confidence. There are two more aspects: First, the EU referenda in the two Scandinavian countries and in Finland will undoubtedly be influenced by the Austrian yes, while in Switzerland the debate on Europe will flare up again. Even more so since Switzerland yesterday voted against participating in UN peace missions. Its international reputation will suffer and the polarization between "internationalists" and "isolationists" will grow. Second, our neighbors -- the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia -- will understand the result as a support for their ambitions to be able to join the EU at the turn of the century, which would offer them better protection against Russian ambitions, which might flare up again at any moment. Austria therefore has a leading role in these former "satellite countries." Despite all these positive points, one should not ignore responsibility toward those Austrians who voted no. After all, they are not only fearful people or egocentrics. Many excellent scientists, numerous critical artists, and a considerable percentage of worried farmers (just to name a few groups) asked questions that have to remain on the political agenda. The oft-cited maturity of the citizens must be complemented by openness on the part of the government in taking account of criticism in its EU policy and the readiness of the media to publicize the arguments of EU opponents.
