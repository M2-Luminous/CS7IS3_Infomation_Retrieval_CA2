Even though he recognizes the Congress' right to make the request and respects the congressional resolution, presidential spokesman Felix Loarca reiterated that the resolution runs counter to what has been determined by the international community. He noted that the 50th Session of the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva, Switzerland, maintained the position of appointing an independent expert adviser for Guatemala, ruling out the possibility of appointing a rapporteur or other drastic action in recognition of the government's efforts. Loarca said the government's intentions and steps to consolidate democracy and to continue with the national peace and reconciliation process are clear to the people and the international community, and, therefore, the call from Congress runs counter to this. As for the congressional decision to condemn the executive for the attack on Deputy Obdulio Chinchilla, he said he does not have any substantive comments to make because he believes the people can draw their own conclusions after the government showed clear signs of its concerns to guarantee the safety of Guatemalan citizens. He said a series of problems have been generated in the country over the past three decades; in turn, it is unfair to blame this government for the situation when its democratic commitment has been demonstrated through abundant proof and evidence. He said Congress sometimes overlooks the scope of the problem and people start thinking we have a magic wand to solve this problem, when, in actuality, it has been less than a year since we received a government facing one of its worst crises ever. As for death threats against other deputies, Loarca said the government condemns all types of violence, regardless of who is carrying it out. Likewise, he called upon those people promoting these kinds of actions to reflect on the serious damage they are inflicting on the democratic reconciliation process.
