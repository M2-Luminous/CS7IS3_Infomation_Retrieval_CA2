The meeting was attended by government members and heads of ministries and departments of the mining and coke-chemical industries, metallurgy, power engineering and transport. "The discussion was suggested by a recent meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers that dwelt on prices on energy carriers, primarily coal," Ukrainian Vice-Premier Vasiliy Yevtukhov told UKRINFORM. "We have raised coal prices, which resulted in the increase of prices on sausage, milk and bread. It is clear as soon as coal prices are raised, coke prices immediately go up, which is followed by price increase on machine-building and agricultural products. "Some meeting speakers noted we can raise fuel prices and keep those in metallurgy and power engineering on the same level. It is impossible since the production costs in these branches include coal spending. The meeting aimed to reach a parity of prices in the coal industry, metallurgy and power engineering and achieve mutual understanding without which it is impossible to overcome the economic crisis," he added.
