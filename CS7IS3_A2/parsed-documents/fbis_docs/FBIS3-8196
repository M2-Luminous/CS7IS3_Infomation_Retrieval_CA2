These meetings are being organized for the third successive year by the weekly SLOBODNY PIATOK [FREE FRIDAY]. In place of the traditional one invited guest, today's meeting was attended by five guests, who were representatives of nonparliamentary political parties: the Social Democratic Party of Slovakia [SSDS], the Christian Social Union [KSU], the Party of Conservative Democrats [SKD], and the Party of the Green in Slovakia [SZ]. They were represented by their leaders Jaroslav Volf [SSDS], Jan Klepac [KSU], Pavol Hagyari [SKD] and Jozef Pokorny [SZS]. The Hungarian Civic Party [MOS] sent its deputy chairman Janos Toth. Our editor Ludmila Bulakova prepared for us a digest of this debate, which lasted over an hour. [Begin recording] [Bulakova] [passage omitted] Mr. Klepac [KSU], what would your position be if you were in government? [Klepac] I think it is necessary to gather enough courage and draw a line behind the past, but it should not be a line that prevents us from talking about the past. [passage omitted] It is necessary to say everything so that the citizens know why the lustration law [passed by the former federal authorities as a vetting system for the highest administrative, legislative, and executive posts] is valid but not applied, why the assets of the communist party have not been dealt with, why companies and state organizations are still being chaired by former exponents of the past regime, and other issues. Mr. Meciar promised when he assumed power that he would release a so-called white book on what happened in Slovakia. I am surprised that this white book has not yet seen the light of day. [passage omitted] [Bulakova] What about you, Mr. Toth? [Toth] I think that the minority issue is not isolated and cannot be isolated from the social and economic dimension wherein it exists. It is imperative to deal with the Slovak social and economic problems; otherwise, there could be a total collapse of the economy. Needless to say, the social consequences of such a collapse would be incalculable. [passage omitted] [end recording]
