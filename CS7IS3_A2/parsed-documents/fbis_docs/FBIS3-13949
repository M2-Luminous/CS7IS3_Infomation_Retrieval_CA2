He said the presence of John Garang and Riak Machar would give impetus to the negotiations. Speaking during an interview with Kenyan television, Dr. al-Hajj said the Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and Development [IGADD] initiative was unique, since it included African countries adjacent to Sudan, whose problems were identical to Sudan's problems. He said the similarity would help in resolving the southern problem. Meanwhile, in a telephone call from Nairobi, the official spokesman of the government peace delegation, Dr. 'Ali al-Hajj, said some negative developments had occurred during the 24 hours following the official inauguration of the peace talks. He said so-called opposition elements had sent representatives to Nairobi with the aim of aborting the peace talks. Dr. 'Ali al-Hajj said the government delegation had warned the IGADD group about the aims of the opposition group. He said the Kenyan side had been notified that peace was not a priority for the opposition, whose main aim was to topple the government in Khartoum, using the southerners as tools to do so. Dr. 'Ali al-Hajj said the elements who arrived in Nairobi were the same people who had attended the Washington Symposium and the London Forum under Baroness Cox. He said the southern problem should not be mixed with the toppling of the government, and stated that the southern problem should come first. Dr. al-Hajj further urged all parties to give a chance to the IGADD countries to play their role, especially after the emergence of positive signs, with the rebel leaders attending the talks for the first time.
