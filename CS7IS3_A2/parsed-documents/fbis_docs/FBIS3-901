Nigerian Foreign Minister Baba Gana Kingibe, interviewed on television said the demand was "unacceptable" since the very reason for the proposed summit was to discuss the dispute over the Bakassi Peninsula in the oil and fish-rich Gulf of Guinea. "Of course that (pre-condition) is unacceptable. The precise point of their meeting is to discuss the Bakassi dispute so the question of withdrawing from Bakassi before the meeting does not arise," Kingibe said. He said however that Nigeria was considering an offer from Cameroonian President Paul Biya to meet his Nigerian counterpart General Sani Abacha on neutral ground in Africa. "As you know, the head of state (Abacha) invited President Biya to come to Abuja to discuss the Bakassi problem (...) the invitation was extended without preconditions and the invitation was accepted without pre-conditions", the minister said. Kingibe who spent two days in Cameroon for talks last week said that before he went Biya had said he was willing to attend talks in Maiduguri, capital of Nigeria's north-eastern Borno State near the Cameroon border. However Kingibe said that when he met officials in Yaounde it "became clear that the Cameroonians were shifting their position regarding conditionalities before the meeting could take place--that the gesture of goodwill and good faith should be made by Nigeria and that we should withdraw our troops from Bakassi before President Biya could meet with General Abacha in Maiduguri." The Cameroonians said that the "Cameroonian public opinion would not understand their president coming to Nigeria when Nigerian troops are in what they consider to be their territory." They suggested that "the two heads of state should meet in a neutral country and we are working towards that," Kingibe said. Biya said Monday in Yaounde that the meeting could be held in Cairo since Egypt currently holds the chair of the Organisation of African Unity. Kingibe said he would travel Wednesday to Cairo to present Nigeria's position on the dispute to the Egyptian authorities. [passage omitted]
