During the first phase, the deputies discussed a wide range of topics, ranging from regional economic development to national development, from micro-economic activity to macro-control measures. Their topics also covered such areas as political affairs, economic growth, social development and culture. However, the keynote of speeches made by deputies from various parts of China and Chinese leaders during group discussions is how to correctly handle the relations between reforms, development and stability. That topic is not a new one. Before the convocation of the current session, Chinese leaders had already elaborated the issue during various meetings and their inspection tours of grassroots units. Chinese Premier Li Peng noted that the deputies have reached a consensus on that issue during the ongoing session. Many newspapers overseas have also written articles to highlight the issue. It can be noted that the realistic choice by China serves as a new angle for the outside world to have a new understanding of China and that the choice makes it possible to predict the country's future. Media organizations in China have different descriptions of the topic, with some calling it a "main melody" and others calling it a "concerto." Speaking to the deputies from Shanghai, Chinese President Jiang Z emin described reforms, development and stability as "three closely interrelated pieces of strategy" on a chess board. According to Jiang, it is imperative to promote reforms and development amid stability, while ensuring long-term social stability through reforms and development. During the first session of the eighth NPC held a year ago, the keynote of speeches made by the deputies was "seizing the opportunity for development and speeding up development." During the current session, they also called for efforts to seize the opportunity and accelerate development, and yet they all emphasized the importance of balancing the relations between reforms, development and stability. A deputy from a locality put it well that the change shows that the Chinese Government has become more experienced and mature in guiding the country's development and reforms, and that people have gained a more profound and comprehensive understanding of the significance of establishing a socialist market economic structure. For deputies from all parts of China, the proper handling of the relations between the three aspects is not a philosophical question, but a realistic one. This is because all kinds of people -- government officials, business executives, workers and farmers -- all face that question every day, and that the relations between reforms, development and stability is related directly to the immediate interests of every Chinese. While backing that strategy formulated by China's policy makers, deputies from different localities and industries view it from different angles, placing emphasis on different aspects. For example, mayors paid closer attention to social and price stability, while deputies from underdeveloped central and western China emphasized that narrowing the gap between eastern and western China is essential to China's long-term stability and social stability. Meanwhile, government officials from agricultural provinces and farmer deputies stressed that the farming sector serves as the basis for development and stability in China. Business executives asked the government to take specific measures to arrange the livelihood of workers in financial difficulty. The secretary of a provincial committee of the Chinese Communist Party pointed out that the anti-corruption campaign is a significant measure to correctly handle the relations between reforms, development and stability. Facing both economic achievements that have been scored over the past few years and deep-rooted contradictions that have arisen in economic and social life, the Chinese people now need to explore new approaches of development and push forward reforms oriented with the establishment of a market economic structure. However, reforms also involve the readjustment of the interests pattern and risks. This constitutes a major background for the central topic during the current NPC session. Public opinions overseas have noticed that it is very difficult to balance the relations between reform, development and stability. During the current NPC session, deputies have also expounded the difficulties China is currently facing in carrying out reforms and pursuing development. At the same time, they have also analyzed various favorable conditions and made proposals for promoting development and maintaining stability. Many of their proposals have been submitted in the form of bills to the bill-handling group of the NPC session. That indicates that deputies are confident of success of the policies formulated by the central government. A number of proposals by deputies coincide with the government's consideration. For instance, some deputies were worried that it will be difficult to keep this year's price index to below ten percent. Therefore, they asked the government to take effective measures to curb price hikes. Speaking to deputies from Hunan Province, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji said that to stabilize the market and curb price rises is the key to balancing the relations between reforms, development and stability, and also an important task of governments at all levels. Recently, the State Council has mandated governments at all levels to monitor the change in prices of 22 kinds of commodities and service items most closely related to people's livelihood. When necessary, governments should examine the increase in prices of some of these commodities and service items and step in to intervene. The measure, designed to check prices from skyrocketing, has been well received by the deputies. The deputies also spoke of other difficulties and factors of instability, about which the government is sober-minded. Both the deputies and the government stressed the importance of carefully organizing and implementing reform measures this year and promptly solving new problems that are likely to crop up in the course of reforms.
