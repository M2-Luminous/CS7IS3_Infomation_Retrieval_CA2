According to the scientists with the Shanghai Biochemical Research Institute under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the memory peptide is a substance existing in higher animals. On the basis of repeated animal experiments, the scientists undertook systematic research of the molecular structure and neural function of the peptide and developed a workable illustration of its position in the animal brain and the mechanism by which it enhances memory. Scientific experiments proved that the artificially produced memory peptide is able to promote and extend memory and speed up the recovery of memory damage. As a result, it is expected to be beneficial in treating senile amnesia and dementia.
