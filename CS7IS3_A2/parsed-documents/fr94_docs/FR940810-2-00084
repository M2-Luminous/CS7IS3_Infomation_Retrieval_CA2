FR940810-2-00084 FR940810-2-00055 Availability of an Environmental Assessment/Habitat Conservation Plan and Receipt of an Application for an Incidental Take Permit for the Proposed Westminster Glen Subdivision, Austin, Travis County, TX AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. ACTION: Notice of Availability. SUMMARY: MaBe, Inc. (Applicant) has applied to the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) for an incidental take permit pursuant to Section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Endangered Species Act (Act). The Applicant has been assigned permit number PRT&hyph;793122. The requested permit, which is for a period not to exceed 10 years, would authorize the incidental take of the endangered golden-cheeked warbler ( Dendroica chrysoparia ). The take would occur as a result of the construction of and operation of a residential development on a 270-acre tract in Austin, Travis County, Texas. The Service has prepared an environmental assessment/habitat conservation plan (EA/HCP) for the incidental take permit application. A determination of jeopardy to the species or a finding of no significant impact (FONSI) will not be made before 30 days from the date of publication of this notice. This notice is provided pursuant to Section 10(c) of the Act and National Environmental Policy Act regulations (40 CFR 1506.6). DATES: Written comments on the application and EA/HCP should be received on or before September 9, 1994. ADDRESSES: Persons wishing to review the application may obtain a copy by writing to the Assistant Regional Director, Ecological Services, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, P.O. Box 1306, Albuquerque, New Mexico 87103. Persons wishing to review the EA/HCP may obtain a copy by contacting Mr. Bryan Arroyo, Ecological Services Field Office, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 611 East Sixth Street, Suite 407, Austin, Texas 78701 (512/482&hyph;5436). Documents will be available by written request for public inspection, by appointment, during normal business hours (8:00 to 4:00) at the Southwest Regional Office, Division of Endangered Species/Permits, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, P.O. Box 1306, Albuquerque, New Mexico 87103, or the Ecological Services Field Office (8:00 to 4:30), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 611 East Sixth Street Suite 407, Austin, Texas 78701. Written data or comments concerning the application and EA/HCP should be submitted to Ms. Jana Grote, Acting Field Supervisor, Ecological Services Field Office, Austin, Texas (see ADDRESSES above). Please refer to file number PRT&hyph;793122 when submitting comments. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Bryan Arroyo at the above Austin Ecological Services Field Office address. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 9 of the Act prohibits the ``Taking'' of endangered species, like the golden-cheeked warbler. However, the Service, under limited circumstances, may issue permits to take endangered wildlife species if such taking is incidental to, and not the purpose of otherwise lawful activities. Regulations governing permits for endangered species are at 50 CFR 17.22. The Applicant plans to build a residential development located northwest of Austin near the intersection of Ranch Road 2222 and City Park Road in Travis County, Texas. The development will occupy approximately 116 acres with the remaining 153 acres proposed as a conservation area. These activities will permanently eliminate about 107 acres of occupied golden-cheeked warbler habitat. The Applicant proposes to mitigate the incidental take via preservation and management of about 153 acres as a golden-cheeked warbler preserve through a conservation easement. Additionally, the Applicant will conduct territorial mapping surveys on lands adjacent to the proposed development, provide operating and maintenance funds for the lands (on-site 153 acres) to be preserved, conduct the necessary biological surveys, minimize clearing of lots, establish a 300-foot buffer of no construction from a golden-cheeked warbler territory during the breeding season, and revegetate with native plant species. The Applicant considered three alternatives but rejected two of them because they were not economically viable. James A. Young, Assistant Regional Director, Ecological Services, Southwest Region (2).
