FR941207-0-00102 FR941207-0-00016 Following Congress' direction in the CRT Reform Act, the Copyright Office issued a notice adopting the full text of the former CRT's rules and regulations on an interim basis. 58 FR 67690 (Dec. 22, 1993). We made only slight technical changes to those rules, stating that we intended to review and revise them during the course of a future rulemaking. Id. We then published proposed regulations that revised the adopted CRT rules to adapt them to the requirements of the new CARP system. 59 FR 2550 (Jan. 18, 1994). We concluded that we were not a successor agency of the CRT, and that Congress intended to establish an entirely new system. Therefore, the proceedings the CRT had begun but not concluded by the effective date of the CRT Reform Act would not be taken up where they had been left, but would rather be begun anew under the new CARP regime. Id. at 2551. 1 The Copyright Royalty Tribunal's final rule requiring Performing Rights Organizations to submit separate, specific, and written authorization to represent their members is stated in section 259.2. 1 Copyright Office revised and renumbered rules that had been found in 37 CFR part 311 of the CRT's regulations as 37 CFR Part 257. On February 15, 1994, the Performing Rights Organizations filed a comment with the Copyright Office seeking to reconsider the rule, now adopted by the Copyright Office, that required separate, specific, written authorization from Performing Rights Organization members. ( In the Matter of Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panels: Rules and Regulations, Copyright Office Docket No. RM 94&hyph;1). Essentially in response to our Notice of Proposed Rulemaking Comment 4, the Performing Rights Organizations asked that their comments either serve to reopen the CRT's former rulemaking proceeding or that the Office consider the matter anew. On February 23, 1994, the Gospel Music Coalition and Copyright Management, Inc., jointly replied to the Performing Rights Organizations' comment and opposed reconsideration of the issue. Id. Reply comment 10. III. Petition for Inference of Agency In commenting on our adoption of the CRT rule, the Performing Rights Organizations assert that the rule disenfranchises the many writers and publishers who would otherwise be qualified to receive DART royalties. Following the CRT's interim rule, the performing rights societies contacted their members. One wrote to each of its members that unless the members notified the organization to the contrary, the organization would represent its member writers and publishers. Subsequently, when the CRT later required separate, specific, written authorization, the Performing Rights Organizations again attempted to contact more than two hundred thousand writer and publisher members in less than four months. Performing Rights Organizations states that they have agreements with the major foreign performing rights organizations to represent foreign writers and publishers whose works are exploited in the United States. They also assert that since not all eligible claimants responded to the writing, a significant number of members may still have the impression that the Performing Rights Organizations are representing their claims and that the CRT's final rule effectively leaves these members without an avenue to present their claims. Id. Comment 4 at 4&hyph;8. The Performing Rights Organizations also urge that even if the Copyright Office rejects the concept of a permanent rebuttable inference, the rebuttable inference should extend through the 1993 DART distribution proceeding. Claims for 1993 royalties were required to be filed during the months of January and February 1994. The Performing Rights Organizations claim that even with the mass mailings following the Tribunal's final ruling, there was no practical way to obtain all of the required signed written authorizations before the filing period expired. They also suggest that the abolition of the CRT effectively disenfranchised the Performing Rights Organizations' members and affiliates, since it eliminated their only forum for being reheard on this issue. The Performing Rights Organizations also contend that further prejudice will result to their members and affiliates because of a private settlement, entered into by all joint claimant groups and all but one of the individual claimants to the Musical Works Fund, that links distribution of 1992 DART royalties, to which the rebuttable inference of agency applies, to the outcome of the 1993 proceedings, to which the rebuttable presumption would not apply. Id., at 12&hyph;15. IV. Opposition for Reconsideration The Gospel Music Coalition and Copyright Management, Inc., oppose reconsideration of the issue. They believe the matter has been amply briefed and settled by the CRT, and no new issues of fact or law have been raised. They oppose the rebuttable presumption of agency and urge the Copyright Office not to disturb the final regulation. Reply Comment 10, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (94&hyph;1). The Gospel Music Coalition and Copyright Management, Inc., note that the CRT's rationale for granting a temporary inference of agency is no longer applicable, since the time pressures have been greatly eased. Moreover, they state that since the CRT specifically ruled in January 1993 that the AHRA did not grant Performing Rights Organizations special entitlement to make claims on behalf of their members more than a year remained until the end of the filing period. They contend this was ample time to obtain the required authorizations from members. Furthermore, they argue that all organizations had the same opportunity to obtain written authorizations from their members. They state that if the Copyright Office adopts the rebuttable inference in favor of the Performing Rights Organizations, it will give these organizations a benefit over other group claimants. Moreover, the Gospel Music Coalition and Copyright Management, Inc., claim that the silence of members should not be considered as implied consent to representation by a performing rights society, and that excusing the performing rights societies from obtaining separate, specific, written authorizations to file claims grants these organizations preferential treatment. Id. V. Policy Decision and Request for Comments The Copyright Office has not considered this issue. Less than 30 days before the CRT Reform Act was enacted, the CRT expressly ordered the Performing Rights Organizations' petition to reconsider to be held in abeyance. In our December 22 rule, we noted that we did not consider the Office to be a successor agency to the CRT. Therefore, matters pending before the CRT would have to begin anew.
