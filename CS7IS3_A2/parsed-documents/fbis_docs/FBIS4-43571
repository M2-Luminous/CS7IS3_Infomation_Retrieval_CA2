Belgian officials immediately said that this possibility had been rejected by their investigation committee. French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, currently visiting Abidjan, brushed aside these accusations: [Begin Juppe recording] From what I gather, the author used the conditional tense in his article. He reports allegations according to which the French were wearing Belgian uniforms, and so forth. I shall not expand further. According to my information this seems to be pure fabrication. I have no more comments to make. An investigation under the aegis of the UN secretary-general is currently underway to establish the truth. All these rumors are obviously baseless. I regret that such accusations are being made using the conditional tense. Either one is certain of the facts, and has evidence or one keeps quiet. [end recording]
