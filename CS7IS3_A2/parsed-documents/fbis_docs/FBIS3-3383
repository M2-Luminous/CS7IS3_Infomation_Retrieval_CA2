Qiao Shi, NPC Standing Committee chairman; Li Ruihuan, chairman of the CPPCC National Committee; and Comrades Tian Jiyun, Wang Hanbin, Pagbalha Geleg Namgyai, Cheng Siyuan, Tomur Dawamat, Ismail Amat, Yang Rudai, Qian Zhengying, and Liao Hansheng attended the party and joined the minority deputies and members coming from all parts of the country to mark the victorious convocations of the two meetings. Wang Zhaoguo, vice chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, chaired the tea party. Addressing the party, NPC Standing Committee Vice Chairman Buhe said: Directed by the guidelines laid down by the 14th national party congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and proceeding along the path of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, our great motherland attracted worldwide attention with our high economic growth, political stability, national solidarity, and social progress last year. This year is crucial for restructuring the economic system, and the success of the second sessions of the Eighth NPC and Eighth CPPCC National Committee will be significant for properly handling the relations between reform, development, and stability and expediting all national projects in all fields through accomplishing the task of overall importance -- "seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider to the outside world, expediting development, and maintaining stability." Buhe said: The current situation is very favorable for China's reform, opening up, and modernization; and the situation also provides minority regions with a good opportunity for promoting economic and cultural development. Just as Premier Li Peng stated in his government work report: "Through reforms and opening up to the outside world, minority regions, with state support and economically developed areas' assistance, certainly will demonstrate their own strengths, have stronger vitality for economic development, gradually reduce the gap with economically developed areas, and achieve prosperity with them together." While this reflects the consistent policy of our party and government, it is also the experience acquired from years' of actual work. As long as we are united as one and work hard earnestly, minority areas certainly will achieve new and greater victories in their economic and cultural development. He said: Deepening reform, opening wider to the outside world, maintaining a sustained, rapid, and healthy national economic development, and ensuring the successful implementation of all reform measures are major issues we must make special efforts to deal with today. Only when we work together to safeguard and develop political stability and unity and consolidate and develop our socialist national relations marked by equality, solidarity, and mutual assistance can we build our great motherland into a happy and harmonious home of people of all nationalities. Artists of the central national song and dance ensemble and the Central National University Department of Choreography staged an art show at the reception.
