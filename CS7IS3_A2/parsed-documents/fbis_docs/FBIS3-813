"I will fight them on the beaches. I will fight them on the plains," he said, adding that the main reason he had registered his Freedom Front for the April elections was to prevent an ANC-NP monopoly in a constitution-making government of national unity. He blamed the NP and ANC for last week's Bophuthatswana violence, flaws in the constitution and unrest. Speaking in Kimberley after Freedom Alliance leaders met to discuss their circumstances after recent developments, Gen Viljoen said the Freedom Front might apply for membership of the alliance. Inkatha Freedom Party President Mangosuthu Buthelezi said the alliance was outraged at the "unchristian, double-crossing betrayal" by the government of Bophuthatswana President Lucas Mangope. Mr Mangope said he still considered himself president of the territory and was considering legal action againt the government. "They had no right whatsoever to oust me. I am constitutionally and legally still the president of Bophuthatswana." Gen Viljoen said his participation in the elections would still depend on certain guarantees from the ANC and NP. Although worried he could cause a split in the Afrikaner right wing, he said his departure from the Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front, AVF] would more likely benefit Afrikaner unity in the long term because there were now two groups on different paths but with the same objective -- self-determination and a "volkstaat" [homeland]. Gen Viljoen said his new Freedom Front did not intend to draw support away from the Afrikaner Volksfront or the Conservative Party [CP], but to recruit other Afrikaners and ex-NP members. This would reinforce support for the volkstaat ideal, he said."What is important is that we must fight the NP and fight the ANC with everything available...on all possible fields we must attack." He said his decision to leave the AVF was prompted partly by differences in opinion and political thinking with its controlling bodies. But the last straw was the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [Afrikaner Resistance Movement, AWB] and its refusal to obey instructions during last weeks' military intervention in Bophuthatswana. "To me it is very clear that a military option with the AWB would be a most dangerous thing to do. I am afraid I have had enough proof that I can not trust them to obey orders." Gen Viljoen did not, however, rule out a military solution without the AWB. Asked about reported looming splits in the CP, its leader Ferdi Hartzenberg said although there were "differences of opinion on a small scale" talks were under way in a bid to stave off divisions. He was confident of a volkstaat being achieved. "We will have our self-determination and freedom in our territory. It is not possible to stop us achieving our ideals."
