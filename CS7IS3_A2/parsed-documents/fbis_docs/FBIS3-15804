The Russian parliamentarians, headed by Ivan Rybkin, chairman of the State Duma, held meetings and talks with the leaders of the Senate, George Mitchell and Robert Dole, and with Senators Sam Nunn and Richard Lugar. They visited the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, whose chairman is Claiborne Pell. The speaker of the House of Representatives, Thomas Foley, gave an official luncheon in honor of the Russian delegation. ITAR-TASS correspondents asked a member of the delegation, Vladimir Lukin, who is chairman of the Duma's international affairs committee and a former Russian ambassador to the United States, to comment on yesterday's talks, which were held behind closed doors. He said that a wide range of issues, including both international problems and the state of our economy and budget, were discussed. There was especially great interest in the economic situation in Russia at the meeting with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. A thorough discussion on Bosnia took place. We agreed to coordinate our actions better within the framework of partnership, i.e. coordinating our steps first, then acting, rather than the other way round. On the whole the talks were constructive, there was no suggestion of confrontation, irritation and so on. We have now reached the stage of mature partnership, we have moved on from the days when we agreed in advance to what anyone told us. This fact naturally creates some nervousness here. In addition to the meetings in Congress, the State Duma delegation also visited the Pentagon, where it was received by U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry. Bearing in mind that the delegation was invited by Congress, wasn't this merely a courtesy call, the ITAR-TASS correspondents asked. No, replied V. Lukin. We were met by a solid team and there were solid talks about problems which concern them - ratification of fundamental treaties, including START-2, accession to the convention on chemical weapons, and open skies. The ITAR-TASS correspondents asked how united was the position of the Russian parliamentary delegation, given its lack of political homogeneity. V. Lukin said that in his view there are really only two groupings in the Duma. One is geared to constructive and professional work on ending the crisis and to cooperation with all branches of power. The other is interested in chaos. Our delegation, he stressed, was made up entirely of representatives of the first grouping, and the shades of difference between us were secondary. Our prime motivation was to show our American partners that we hail from a single state, that we are Russian patriots and that we are upholding our country's interests, rather than settling internal scores. The talks and meetings were also attended by Sergey Glazyev, Sergey Yushenkov, Mikhail Zadornov and Galina Klimantova, who are all chairmen of State Duma committees.
