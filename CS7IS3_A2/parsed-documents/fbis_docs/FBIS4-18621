He was speaking at a ceremony at which South Africa presented the agency with a symbolic plough, made from a dismantled nuclear device. "We have dismantled our nuclear devices," said Mr Botha. "We have signed the Nonproliferation Treaty, the safeguards agreement and we have associated ourselves fully with the ban on chemical and biological weapons." Mr Botha said the peace and security of the planet depended particularly on the will of advanced, industrialised powers with access to vast stockpiles of nuclear weapons and which consumed a large portion of the earth's resources. "The technologies which the industrialised nations have made available to the world have improved the quality of life of a large proportion of humanity, although for the most part they remain out of reach of the poor, developing countries," he said. "Some of the dramatic technological advances have also brought unintended negative consequences in their wake." Poorer countries were faced with a two-fold problem, said Mr Botha. "They cannot enjoy the advantages of modern technology, but at the same time must face the negative consequences which that technology has brought with it."
