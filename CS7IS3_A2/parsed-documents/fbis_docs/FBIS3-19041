It was "significant progress" in the field of human rights that Clinton had expressly made the precondition for extending the most-favored-nation clause in trade with China. But this demonstration of U.S. determination does not seem to have impressed Beijing very much. China knows very well that a market of 1.2 billion potential buyers magically attracts industrial nations suffering from recession. And so far, the West has always given in as soon as Beijing made some vague indications of willingness to improve. What has become a major slap in the face of the U.S. President may have been Beijing's unsuitable attempt to maintain stability, to get to grips with the social tensions. These are permanently aggravated by corruption, rural exodus, horrendous inflation and crime rates -- the other side of a booming economy. During the weekend, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher is expected in the Chinese capital. He may severely criticize China's human rights policy, but afterwards they will come to an arrangement again. There is too much at stake for both sides: It is a matter of economic interests. And in this case, moral principles do not stand much chance in the first place.
