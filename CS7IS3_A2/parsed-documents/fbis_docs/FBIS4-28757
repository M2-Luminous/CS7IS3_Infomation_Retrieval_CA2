FBIS4-28757 "dreas114_l_94007" FBIS-EAS-94-114 Daily Report 9 Jun 1994 Philippines First Quarter Balance of Payments Reduced First Quarter Balance of Payments Reduced BK1306141494 Manila BUSINESS WORLD in English 9 Jun 94 pp 1, 5 BK1306141494 Manila BUSINESS WORLD English BFN [Text] The country's balance of payments (BoP) position dipped by 4.64 percent to a $616 million surplus during the first quarter compared with the year ago level of $646 million, according to the latest Bangko Sentral [Central Bank] figures released yesterday. Foreign investments inflow primarily accounted for the surplus, posting a 203.18 percent increase to $1.619 billion from the year ago level of $534 million. Of the total, $502 million was traced to the remittance in March of Arab American Oil Co. (Aramco) to the national government as payment for a 40 percent stake at Petron Corp. The Aramco proceeds accounted for 46 percent of the P1.085 billion improvement in the foreign investments inflow. The rate of outflows continued to outpace inflows during the quarter, climbing 285.25 percent to $1.071 billion from the year ago level of $278 million. The Bangko Sentral data showed that unrecorded outflows, lodged under the "errors and omissions account," went down by 10.28 percent to $192 million from the year ago level of $214 million. A source said the drop in the withdrawals of nonresidents may be due to the substantial influx of investments in government securities and bonds, which is usually associated with the hike in domestic interest rates. Inflow of medium and long-term loans declined by 23 percent to $914 million from the year ago level of $1.187 billion. This may reflect the cautious stance taken by multilateral and bilateral institutions as the country negotiated for a three-year program with the International Monetary Fund. The IMF Executive Board is scheduled to take up the Philippine request for a $650 million facility before the end of the month. Net short-term capital, including foreign borrowings with maturities of less than one year, registered a whopping 114.29 percent increase as $45 million were repaid during the period. The balance sheet was exacerbated by the trade deficit, which widened by 29.82 percent in the first quarter compared to the year ago level. Merchandise trade deficit totalled $1.663 billion as import payments outpaced export receipts, posting a 21.91 percent uptick to $4.579 billion. Export receipts, on the other hand, amounted to $2.916 billion, registered a 17.82 percent hike from the year ago level of $2.475 billion. The source pointed out the growth in import receipts could have been fuelled by speculations that the peso exchange value would continue to strengthen against the dollar. Although remittances from overseas workers increased to $2.209 billion during the period, this failed to offset the 24.69 percent growth in nonmerchandise trade payments totalling $1.389 billion. The country's current account position showed a $676 million deficit. Receipts from invisibles, which include freight and merchandise insurance, travel and investment income, grew by 8.38 percent to $194 million from the previous year's $179 million. Corresponding payments stood at $27 million, a surge of 1,250 percent from the year ago level of $2 million. Other BoP accounts registered the following advances: -- monetization of gold, $38 million or a 137.5 percent hike from the previous year's $16 million; and, -- revaluation adjustments, $1 million, or a 97.14 percent decline from the year ago level of $35 million.
