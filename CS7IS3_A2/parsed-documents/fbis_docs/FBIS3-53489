According to a Central News Unit report from Paris citing the newspaper LIBERATION, in circumstances when the Algerian Government has deprived Islamists of all resources and is trying to suppress them, the appearance of an Islamic television network in the country, even for a short time, has perturbed Algerian officials. Numerous residents in the Algiers area saw the television network's program at 1815 to 1830 last Monday [3 Jan] on channel 21 on the UHF band. This program presented the latest reports on the condition of Algerian combatants followed by a request to all armed Islamic groups to forge solidarity against the dictatorship in Algeria and still pictures of incarcerated FIS leaders. According to LIBERATION, the Algerian Islamists are also presenting regular weekly programs, referred to as Wafa [loyalty] radio, by means of radio apparatus. In this program, they transmit radio messages on frequencies used by the police and security forces, repeatedly calling on these forces to refrain from fighting against and killing their own brothers and asking them to abandon the dictatorial regime.
