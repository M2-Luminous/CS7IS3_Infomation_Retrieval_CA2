KEYHAN's correspondents sent to Baku report that the Iran Red Crescent Society will pay all the costs of building and starting this hospital, and in addition an eight-person medical team has been sent to the Imam Hoseyn Camp in this area to provide health care and treatment services to the refugees. In discussing their observations at the Azeri refugee camps, the Iranian physicians announced: The spread of skin diseases among the Azeri refugees is seriously threatening the lives of thousands of innocent people. Radio Baku reported that thousands of Azeri refugees have been infected with skin diseases. Quoting an Iranian physician, it said: The lack of field bath houses, hot water, washing and cleaning materials and the failure to observe the principles of hygiene are considered to be among the causes for the spread of these diseases. According to Radio Baku, despite the ceaseless efforts of Iran's medical teams at the camps, due to the failure to receive international aid, Azeri war victims are not in good health and are suffering from diseases such as malnutrition, pneumonia, and chlorosis.
