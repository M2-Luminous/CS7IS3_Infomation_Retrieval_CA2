The meeting studied the issue of granting Hong Kong SAR permanent resident status to returned emigrants who have become foreign nationals. Members tended to favor the application of the stipulations of Clause 4 under Article 24 of the Hong Kong SAR Basic Law to settle this issue. Considering the close relations between returned emigrants and Hong Kong, members held that prior to obtaining a fresh permanent resident status, returned emigrants may enjoy the rights to enter and stay in Hong Kong without restrictive conditions. The meeting also discussed the retirement security issue in Hong Kong as well as reviewed the issue's development and current situation in Hong Kong's history. Members unanimously felt that great importance should be attached to retirement security, a major issue that concerns the people's lives and is closely linked to the overall Hong Kong society. Members pointed out that retirement security should be treated separately from social welfare. The system should be considered on the basis of Hong Kong's actual conditions, and the principle conducive to Hong Kong's social stability and economic prosperity should be upheld.
