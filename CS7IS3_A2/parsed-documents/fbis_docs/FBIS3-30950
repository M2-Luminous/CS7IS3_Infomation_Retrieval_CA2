Both countries will send letters to the UN Security Council demanding international controls over Bosnia-Herzegovina's borders to achieve a peaceful solution. 2. The two sides have agreed that the commanders of the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] and the Bosnia-Herzegovina army, Generals Ante Roso and Rasim Delic, should meet within the next seven days to outline in conrete terms an agreement on a total cease-fire between the Bosnia-Herzegovina army and the HVO in all battlefields as the first step to the solution of all issues in the interest of the Croatian and Muslim peoples. 3. Both sides will speed up negotiations on an unconditional exchange of all prisoners, particularly the Mostar group, and cooperate in the search for missing persons. 4. Both sides agreed to continue their talks on all models of future Muslim-Croatian relations in Bosnia-Herzegovina and future relations between the two countries and to respect the agreements already finalized. 5. Agreement has been reached that, regardless of any future solutions, the return of all refugees should be secured following the restoration of peace. 6. Agreement has been reached that the talks should continue and intensify. Geneva, 10 February 1994. This joint statement was signed by Haris Silajdzic, General Ante Roso, and Mate Granic. The joint statement is a step toward the solution of Muslim-Croatian relations as well as of relations between the Republic of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, Mate Granic said following the signing of the joint statement. He maintains that the signed statement and the letters sent by ambassadors of the Republic of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina to the United Nations in New York are a basis for appropriate action by the UN Security Council. The plenary session began at 1800 in Geneva's Palace of Nations where peace mediators Owen and Stoltenberg are talking to the representatives of the three peoples of Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is hard to say how long this session will last because of the irreconcilable standpoints of the Serbs and Muslims regarding the makeup of a commission which should investigate the circumstances surrounding Saturday's massacre in Sarajevo's marketplace. The Serbs insist on their own representative taking part in the commission's work, something that is being met with resolute disapproval from Muslims. [passage omitted]
