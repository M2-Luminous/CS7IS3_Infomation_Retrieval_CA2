BZV Chairman Mikalay Statkevich who heads this commission has outlined its goals. [Statkevich] I would like to note that BZV is not a political organization, nor does it fight for power. This is what determines our stance on the presidential elections. We support all candidates who stand for democratic and patriotic positions, and we have given our members the opportunity to independently support this or that candidate. Perhaps the BZV leadership has assumed a wrong stance. But we could not stand aside during the elections, since the fate of our country -- which, as we believe, is controlled by the Mafia -- depends on the election returns, which are the last chance to eradicate this evil in a peaceful way. Knowing unpopularity of the ruling circles' main candidate for the presidential office -- Mr. Kebich [Belarusian prime minister] -- as well as of possible violations of the law and fraud during the elections, BZV came up with the initiative to establish a public control commission. The initiative was supported by 14 organizations, who had nominated seven candidates for the presidential office. Some of them, as the saying goes, have already dropped out of the race. Nevertheless, these organizations have confirmed their membership in the commission, whose main goal is to ensure honest elections. [Lazowskaya] Mikalay Viktaravich, the commission has already been operating for quite a while. Obviously, its members have already learned about certain violations of the law. [Statkevich] We have been receiving a great many reports about them. The lion's share of them concerns one of the candidates -- Mr. Kebich. [Lazowskaya] Apparently, there is no point in listing every case of fraud. Nevertheless, could you outline the methods used. [Statkevich] First of all, this concerns using state administration bodies to collect signatures, including abuse of office and moral pressure on state organizations' workers. The commission members know of cases where pensioners were not paid their pensions, kolkhoz workers -- their wages, and that workers and clerks were threatened with layoffs should they refuse to sign the petitions for Kebich. In Zhlobin, for instance, the following case took place: A teacher joined [former Supreme Council Chairman] Stanislaw Shushkevich's team at his own initiative. However, he learned later that his name was included in the list of signatures collected by the prime minister's initiative group. Thus, the law was violated. I can also say a few words about the situation in the Army. Only representatives of the Council of Ministers chairman's team have the right to canvass and collect signatures among servicemen. Activists from Comrade Novikaw's [Communist Party leader] team also obtained the right to do so, but a little bit later. Yet, despite their commanders' orders, soldiers do not always sign the petitions for the aforementioned people. It so happened that a commander himself is collecting military identification cards from his subordinates and placing the signatures in support of a candidate. [Lazowskaya] The electoral battle continues. In my opinion, new facts of violating the law are still to appear. Is the public control commission predicting them? What measures are being taken to prevent them? [Statkevich] According to our sources, the most widespread instance of fraud will be the practice of oblast commissions' not registering voting ballots. Local commissions' attempts to fill out ballots in pencil may become another kind of violation, all the more so since the law does not say anything about it. Additionally, in rural areas, there is a widespread practice of dropping ballots into boxes delivered directly to houses, which gives to people the opportunity to plant extra ballots. During a meeting between a delegation of the public control commission and the Central Electoral Commission Chairman Abramovich, we shared our concerns in this regard. Alyaksandr Mikhaylavich [Abramovich] assured our representatives that there will be lists of people who want to vote at home. I would like to point out that our observers will monitor this. Mr. Abramovich also stated that accountability is envisioned for forging ballots. If the Central Electoral Commission learns of such incidents, the case will be handed over to an attorney's office. I would like to add that BZV will carefully monitor the election results. Those electoral commission chairmen who commit any violations, hoping that the victory of their favorite candidate will wipe everything out, will be punished in the most severe manner.
