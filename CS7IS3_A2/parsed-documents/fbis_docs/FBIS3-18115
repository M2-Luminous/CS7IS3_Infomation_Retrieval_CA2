Of this amount, the return of the Bundeswehr unit cost about DM15 million, Ruehe said in Bonn this morning. Personnel, training, materiel, operations, and transport cost DM295.3 million. A refund of DM70 million was expected from the United Nations, thus reducing the cost of the whole mission from May 1993 to March 1994 to about DM240 million. The procurement costs for materiel of almost DM60 million also have to be deducted from this sum as "long-term investment." The Bundeswehr could use the additional improved equipment in future humanitarian missions, in case of disaster or as "crisis reaction forces." Ruehe described the resources spent in Somalia as "investment in humanity and in the future of the Bundeswehr." The Bundeswehr's mission to Somalia saved tens of thousands of people from dying of starvation and from disease. The Bundeswehr also "gained unique experience." The German support unit's camp at Beledwynne was cleared this morning. The commander, Colonel Holger Kammerhoff, was the last soldier to leave Beledwynne at 0936 local time. The whole German unit is to have returned to Germany by the end of March.
