FR940503-1-00017 FR940503-1-00004 The Proposed Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend 14 CFR part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. ยง39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: SAAB Aircraft AB: Docket 94&hyph;NM&hyph;23&hyph;AD. Applicability: Model SAAB SF340A airplanes having serial numbers 004 through 159 inclusive, and Model SAAB 340B airplanes having serial numbers 160 through 330 inclusive; equipped with Flight Equipment and Engineering Limited (FEEL) Model 121 series seats listed in FEEL Service Bulletin 25&hyph;20&hyph;1294, Revision 1, dated May 1993, or FEEL Service Bulletin 25&hyph;20&hyph;1287, Revision 3, dated March 1993; certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent failure of the backrest on these seats, which could inhibit emergency egress, accomplish the following: (a) Within 28 days after the effective date of this AD, perform a detailed visual inspection to detect cracking of the tray stop spindle and backrest spindle bosses of the inboard section of the seat, in accordance with FEEL Service Bulletin 25&hyph;20&hyph;1287, Revision 3, dated March 1993. (1) If no cracking is found, or if cracking is found that does not penetrate the shear web, repeat the inspection of that seat thereafter at intervals not to exceed 150 hours time-in-service until the requirements or paragraph (b) of this AD are accomplished. (2) If any cracking is found that penetrates the shear web, prior to further flight, replace the inboard section (up to issue 12), and identify the modification plate with ``25&hyph;20&hyph;1287A,'' in accordance with the service bulletin. Thereafter, repeat the inspection at intervals not to exceed 150 hours time-in-service until the requirements of paragraph (b) of the AD are accomplished. (b) Within 6 months after the effective date of this AD, repair and identify the modification plate with ``25&hyph;20&hyph;1294,'' in accordance with FEEL Service Bulletin 25&hyph;20&hyph;1294, Revision 1, dated May 1993. Accomplishment of the actions required by this paragraph constitutes terminating action for the requirements of this AD. (c) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113. Note: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113. (d) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with sections 21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. Issued in Renton, Washington, on April 26, 1994. James V. Devany, Acting Manager, Transport Airplane Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service.
