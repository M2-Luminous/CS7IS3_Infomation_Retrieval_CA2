And since Senator Brown cannot comprehend continuing that blockade, he submitted a bill to the U.S. Senate imposing sanctions on any Arab government abiding by resolutions that boycott U.S. firms dealing with "Israel". The Brown bill was immediately approved by a majority of 93 votes. Nobody in the U.S. Senate supported the Arabs, although the U.S. decision will first affect pro-U.S. Arabs, because it "bans the sale of U.S. arms to Arabs and withholds all types of U.S. services and military consultations to any state not abiding by the U.S. decision." Of course, pro-U.S. Arabs will not be disappointed by their Washington master. In fact, they will use the Congressional decision as an excuse to get rid of the boycott resolutions to which they are committed by Arab unanimity. We do not expect pro-U.S. Arabs to resist, reject, or speak out against the decision, because those following the course of recognizing "Israel" have already begun dealing with it on political and security levels, and will soon begin dealing with it on the economic level, through economic projects in Gaza and Jericho, or through the Middle East market now being established via relations and agreements that cover the entire Arab homeland and extend to all its capitals. Since Washington is committed to the peace it is formulating and leading in the Middle East, it considers the Arab boycott to be harmful to the peace efforts. It does not understand how the pro- U.S. Arab camp can recognize "Israel," guarantee its secure borders and establish normal relations with it, without cancelling the boycott resolutions and measures with the open decision that Washington has asked of the Arab League, now that the United States has guaranteed the required majority in that organization. Washington is now working for Tel Aviv's economic superiority, after it has guaranteed its military superiority. With this superiority, Washington asks its Arab camp to guarantee Tel Aviv's economic and military hegemony without condition or restriction. A powerful Israel guarantees U.S. interests in the region and guarantees the continued existence of the rulers -- presidents of kings -- that Washington appoints over the region.
