True, the rise of long-term rates that has been taking place for many weeks required a gesture as significant as it is symbolic. Because the signal given by the Bundesbank is primarily addressed to financial operators, whose reaction is worrying central banks. This issue was discussed by the big moneymen last weekend in Basel. Europe is faced by the grave danger of seeing its long-term interest rates continue to stretch at the risk of strangling the recovery that is beginning. The U.S. Federal Reserve has put in motion this dangerous movement. By deciding--quite logically--to raise short-term rates, which had dropped to abnormally low levels, its chairman, Alan Greenspan, provoked a rise in U.S. long-term interest rates that the fear of overheating the economy, and hence of the possible return of inflation, has accelerated. The tragedy is that this upward movement extended to Europe, where the situation is very different because it is just emerging from a deep recession. How is it possible to put an end to this contagion, as fearsome as it is irrational? How could operators be convinced that it is possible, and logical, to decouple the evolution of the interest rates on both sides of the Atlantic? The decision of the Bundesbank is the most adequate. First, because it proves that German and European monetary authorities do not fear a resurgence of inflation. Secondly, because it tends to pull down these notorious long-term rates. In this confrontation, the position of the Bank of France is an uncomfortable one. Indeed, for many weeks France's long-term interest rates rose more rapidly than Germany's. This phenomenon leads to questioning the efforts that have taken place over many decades to prove the pertinence of the so-called strong franc policy. One can understand the concern of the bank governor, Jean-Claude Trichet, about whom it must nevertheless be said that the recent reopening of the debate on the other economic policy did not help him. The problem is that this debate may well develop as the presidential election draws closer.
