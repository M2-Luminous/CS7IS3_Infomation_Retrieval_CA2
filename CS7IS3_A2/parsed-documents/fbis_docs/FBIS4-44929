FBIS4-44929 "jpnea029___94009" JPRS-NEA-94-029 JPRS Near East & South Asia 2 March 1994 NEAR EAST IRAQ Koranic Teaching in Schools Reported, Reviewed Koranic Teaching in Schools Reported, Reviewed 94LH0042A Baghdad ALIF BA' in Arabic 2 Mar 94 pp 16-18 94LH0042A Baghdad ALIF BA' Arabic CSO [Article by Ma'sum Sa'di] [Text] It is a great step for us to teach a child how to read and understand the Holy Koran beginning in elementary school to implement what the president-commander stipulated when he said, "It is necessary to formulate a plan under which the student understands the Koran thoroughly upon completion of secondary school." However, for many reasons, students, guardians, and teachers of the Koran have voiced many complaints regarding the plan's implementation. For this report, we went around to the concerned parties to become familiar with the causes of the problem and students' and officials' opinions, hardships, and recommendations for mounting a successful campaign of faith that achieves the desired objective. The importance and results of teaching the Holy Koran to students are obvious. Such instruction provides students with spiritual values and concepts by which they can correct what is wrong. It also helps them develop good language skills. Elementary school students memorize a suitable number of verses at each level. This develops their language skills and enriches their vocabulary with terms that they will use year after year. Students and guardians have problems with the difficult instruction and the method used to convey it. The curriculum includes many long chapters of the Koran and is thus very intensive and difficult for the child to absorb. For example, the first-grade curriculum, like that of other levels, includes two books. One is the Islamic Education Book. It includes five chapters of the Koran for memorization ("The Opening," "The Purity of Faith," "Mankind," "Help," and "Abundance"), several religious teachings (e.g., prayer, the principles of Islam, and love of God and his Prophet), and short prophetic traditions. The other book is the Holy Koran for reading with a commentary on "its readings and its meanings." It includes more than 30 chapters. Is this not too much for a child to learn to read and write word by word? Most believe that the Islamic Education Book is very adequate for this level. This is what Majidah Hamid, a teacher, says. She goes on to say that the Koran is very intensive and too advanced for first-grade students, and that the Islamic Education Book by itself more than adequately fulfills the desired purpose. Unsupportive Method The teaching method plays an important role and has a far-reaching effect on the psyche of the child and student. What is happening in our schools is that some teachers and instructors are not in harmony with the desired goal. Their method is unsupportive and tough rather than gentle to make the subject easy. This generates strong reactions. One woman, Iman Jamil, relates her hardships as follows: My daughter, Halah, is in the third grade in elementary school. Her main problem concerns memorization of the Holy Koran. She weeps in fear of the teacher of this subject, who threatens to beat them and screams at them if one of them does not know how to read a word correctly or did not memorize a chapter well. Halah's mother says that she does not know how to explain some of the meanings and verses about which Halah asks, which the mother finds to be beyond her daughter's age and educational level. Halah asks her about them continuously, because they are a part of the curriculum. For example, the chapter, "Women," deals with marriage and related matters, which are undoubtedly beyond the level of Halah, who is not yet 10. An official source in the Education Ministry told us that the ministry has established a process in which parts of the Holy Koran are introduced at each academic level, from the first grade of elementary school through the sixth grade of middle school. He emphasized that the early levels start with short chapters. Also, the ministry has asked teachers not to require students to memorize chapters or verses of the Koran except for those specified in the instructions for each grade, aside from chapters and verses designated to be understood and explained generally. The ministry also prepared a manual called From the Rules of Recitation and distributed it to all teachers and schools in the country. The manual specifies the recitation rules, which must be learned in each grade. Nonetheless, what is happening is raising questions! Another important thing that we noted, about which many guardians complained to us, is the fact that teachers digress from the subject and speak of matters having no bearing on religion. The president-commander emphasized this point in a speech during a meeting with officials regarding elementary and secondary education. He said, "The Koran must be understood in a precise, integrated curriculum, without independent opinions and without development and expansion. We want to teach only the Koran." Regarding this problem, let us present several illustrations of what some teachers have been doing in our schools. Muhammad Talib is in the sixth grade of elementary school. He returned one day from school and removed all of the pictures hanging on the walls of his home, even those of his father and relatives. When his mother asked him why he did so, he told her that the teacher of the Holy Koran had told them that it is "forbidden" to hang pictures on the wall, because it violates religious teachings! Wasan, a student in the third grade of middle school, is still a cause of dismay for her father. He has taken her from one physician to another because of her difficult psychological state, which induces a feeling of fear in her. She awakens at night from persistent nightmares and dreams of death, because the Holy Koran teacher speaks continuously and in detail of the nature of death, the size of the grave, the afterlife, how God will punish mankind, how the body disintegrates, and other details which have aroused fear and dread in the students' psyches. There are many other examples and illustrations. Instruction in the Holy Koran has thus come to have side effects stemming from independent opinions and instructional [methods], which most students find difficult to endure. As a result, most families with children in school are experiencing difficulties. Courses for Teachers Are Brief and Fast In most cases, we find that the teacher is either strict or incompetent. In either case, the desired goal is not achieved, because the Koran is learned in a difficult manner. One factor contributing to this outcome is the failure, despite the importance of this subject, to select teachers who can teach the Koran effectively based on principles and methods that facilitate the explaining and understanding of this subject. At present, teachers are not well prepared relative to the importance of the campaign. The Education Ministry has held training courses, but they have been brief and fast. The teacher Iman 'Adnan: How can we convey an intensive curriculum in a simplified, understandable manner if it causes us hardship, and we find it difficult at times to absorb it? The Koran comprises foundations and principles, and the courses in which they enrolled us were very brief, lasting not more than a month. These courses covered 11 subjects, only four of which pertained to the subject. I do not know how "reasoning by analogy and adaptation" and other lessons from which we neither derived nor understood anything are related to teaching the Holy Koran. This is a faith campaign. One would assume that it would be of adequate utility and not so abbreviated. What happened is that we were dismayed by an intensive, lengthy curriculum, which we were required to convey in a simplified manner to students who are still in the early stages of their education! What the Concerned Parties Say Our first thought was that the Awqaf and Religious Affairs Ministry--because it specializes in the principles and teachings of the Koran and all that pertains to it--would have a role in the faith campaign in the schools, whether by giving its opinion and advice or by helping to formulate the academic curriculum and select the teachers. This is certainly not to say that the Education Ministry lacks competence in this area. However, a specialist undoubtedly knows the subject of his specialty better than others. Accordingly, we went to the Awqaf and Religious Affairs Ministry, only to be surprised to learn that the ministry has had no involvement whatsoever in the matter, although it has expressed its willingness to help and is still willing to provide advice or help if asked to do so. The important thing is to achieve a positive outcome and a successful campaign. To become familiar with the opinions and observations of specialists in the principles and teaching of the Holy Koran, we met with Dr. Muhyi Hilal al-Sirhan, the dean of the College of Islamic Sciences at Baghdad University. He spoke with us about teaching the Holy Koran and memorization of it to elementary school students. He said: The Koran is a rich source of vocabulary words, a sea of meanings and terms, and an inexhaustible treasure of meritorious morals and comely characteristics. It is worthwhile for us to explain to our elementary students an appropriate measure of the word of almighty God, which is the best word, and to have them memorize short chapters and then progressively longer chapters of the Koran. As to the memorization method at the early elementary level, the instructor should first use the conventional memorization techniques used in the schools. When the students become skillful in this initial phase and can memorize, they can then be assigned to memorize texts as homework. The memorization of texts in the school is carried out in steps. After the meanings and commandments of texts have been taught, and the students have become proficient in reading them aloud individually and collectively applying the rules and principles of Koranic recitation, written verses are then presented to the students on a blackboard, signboard, television screen, or card. After the students can consistently read the verses well, the teacher begins to gradually cover up words, first one word, then two, then three, and so on until an entire passage is covered. In this way, an entire chapter can be memorized, paying heed to the correct pronunciation "rules of Koranic recitation" and their practical application. Shaykh Dr. 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Sa'di, the chairman of the Islamic Literature Association and a professor at the Institute of Imams and Preachers, finds that the teaching of the Holy Koran in a sound manner enables the student to master the words of the Holy Koran. He believes that we should follow the method used in the traditional Kuttab [the lowest elementary level in the Koran schools], which focuses on memorization of the Holy Koran. This method consists of teaching children at the early elementary level the Arabic consonants and vowels and how they are connected. This is called spelling. Then the student is able to read any word in the Holy Koran. This method has its principles and rules. Academic research done in this area can be circulated to the teachers of the Holy Koran, who can be enrolled in courses for this purpose. Shaykh 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Sa'di continues: Perhaps it is said that this method is antiquated and not accepted by modern pedagogy. However, experimentation has proved that it is the only method for mastering the words of the Holy Koran. Psychologically, the students' desire to recite the Holy Koran can be awakened by making it attractive and by easing the difficulties of which they complain. The class can be divided into groups that compete for a prize. Also, young students can be taught the purpose of reading the Koran by explaining to them God's reward in the afterlife and the benefit that the student will enjoy in his temporal life. The current curriculum being taught at the elementary and higher levels requires some revisions, namely the selection of short chapters for the lower levels, longer ones for the middle, and lengthy ones for the final levels. Ideas and Recommendations After we obtained these opinions and heard the hardships of students, their guardians, and concerned persons, the goal of all of us is still a successful faith campaign. The following are some recommendations for review and possibly use by officials and persons concerned with this subject: - The teachers now responsible for teaching Koranic recitation are not experts in this area. This subject should be taught by specialists who have extensive experience in this field. The imams of mosques spread throughout the country can be used for this purpose, if only for a transitional period, until a complete Koranic cadre is trained. We also call for developing current teachers of the Holy Koran by enrolling them in long courses in the method for teaching and simplifying the subject. - Reduction of the curriculum at the elementary levels: How nice it would be to limit the curriculum to the "Islamic Education Book in the first, second, and third grades inasmuch as it accomplishes the desired goal. - We also call upon teachers of the subject to be patient and gentle, tolerate their students' mistakes, and descend to the level of their intellect and comprehension without violence, beating, or threats.
