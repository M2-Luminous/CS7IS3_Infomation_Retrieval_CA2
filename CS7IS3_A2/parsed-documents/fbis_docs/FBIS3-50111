Maglaj correspondent Hajrudin Sermic reports that "although the attacks of the Chetnik and Ustasha forces have entered their fifth day, we can already say that their offensive is a total fiasco. Great losses in their ranks have taken their toll, although this morning they are perpetrating combined tank-infantry attacks on the southern sector of the front, on the entire stretch from Bradici to Nekolje. The fighting is fierce, but the knights of the 201st Maglaj [Brigade] are holding their own. The aggressor army is taking out its rage on the civilian population. Howitzer shells of all caliber, mortar and tank shells are raining down on Maglaj. Four people, two of them children, have been wounded in the past 24 hours. The material damage is also great." An unidentified correspondent from the 4th Corps information service says that "in the past 24 hours, the free part of Mostar Commune has been the site of the fiercest shelling registered in the past month. The Ustasha [words indistinct] criminal policy with large caliber shells, and destroyed the densely populated residential areas. They fired over 160 howitzer, tank, and mortar shells at the parts of Mostar controlled by the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 4th Corps. The Ustasha artillery targeted the Mostar districts of (?Zelic), (?Padina), (?Pazoric), and (?Ceric), while the enemy used antiaircraft weapons and snipers against the southern parts of the city. There was no peace on the northern part of the Mostar Commune. The Ustashas fired around 40 shells from all types of artillery weapons at this region. Potoci, (?Krivac), and [name indistinct] were targeted. In the south of the Mostar Commune, 15 120-mm mortar shells were fired at Blagaj, while five 120-mm mortar shells landed on Svacici. The Bosnia-Herzegovina Army reconnaissance units have discovered that the Ustasha forces are again using captured civilians to dig trenches and reinforce their positions. The demarcation lines in the 4th Corps operational zone are strong and stable." Brcko correspondent Hamid Deronjic reports that "strong Chetnik forces continue to regroup on the Brcko front. Concentrations and movements of enemy tanks were again sighted last night on the central part of the front, just outside Donja Brka. Four truckloads of manpower have arrived in the same area. Movements of the enemy's armored vehicles have also been sighted in the areas of Sumari and Delina Ravna. Overnight, the enemy has been using chain saws to clear the undergrowth and make room for his tanks. The enemy's reconnaissance groups were intensely active last night in the areas of Cadjavci and Omerbegovaca." The studio announcer cites a report by the 4th Motorized Brigade information service and says that "there is some sporadic artillery fire on the Ilidza front, while Hrasnica, Sokolovici, [name indistinct], and Butmir are the scene of small arms' provocations."
