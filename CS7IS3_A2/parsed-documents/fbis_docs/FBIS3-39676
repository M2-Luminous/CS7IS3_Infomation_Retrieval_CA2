Ministers have insisted for weeks they are not waiting for an IRA/Sinn Fein response but are pushing ahead with efforts to find agreement between political parties on a predominantly internal settlement. In an interview in today's BELFAST TELEGRAPH, however, Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland minister responsible for developing the suspended inter-party talks, concedes that peace and a political settlement are "inextricably linked." "The declaration and the talks are part and parcel of the same process," he said. "I don't believe you can have peace without a widely acceptable political settlement and I think you probably can't have a widely acceptable political settlement without peace." His comments imply that without the IRA renouncing violence, the prospect of inter-party talks reaching agreement are slim. Mr Ancram's comments come on the eve of the meeting between the Irish Taoiseach, Albert Reynolds, and John Major at Downing Street to review progress of the inter-party talks as well as Sinn Fein's response to the joint declaration signed by both governments before Christmas. Yesterday, the Northern Ireland Secretary, Sir Patrick Mayhew, said that he was hoping to see new institutions of joint co-operation between the North and south of Ireland set up as part of his package designed to bring agreement between Dublin, London and the four constitutional parties in Northern Ireland. He welcomed "any step that is intended to develop co-operation on economic and other matters." He thought that the new institutions "could be undertaken...without impinging on the sovereignty of Northern Ireland." Sir Patrick, speaking in the Commons, was pressed by his shadow, Kevin McNamara, on whether new North-South bodies dealing with issues like as the economy or infrastructure should have an executive role, based on ground rules laid down by both governments. Sir Patrick argued that "any organisation, call it a board or a structure, should have clear objectives, with clearly defined lines of authority, coming from wherever it is appropriate, whether it is Westminster, Dublin, or any subsequently established legislative body." The British Government sent secret outline proposals to Dublin this month on the extension of co-operation between the two parts of Ireland. The Ulster Unionists would like the bodies to be almost exclusively consultative, but are willing to see the British representatives drawn from a Northern Ireland assembly. James Molyneaux, the Unionists' leader, indicated that representives of a proposed Ulster assembly could talk to the South, as long as "the sovereignty of Northern Ireland remained undiminished."
