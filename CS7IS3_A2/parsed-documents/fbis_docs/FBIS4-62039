This was stated by a high-ranking Russian diplomat specializing in the Korean issues. He repeated that in accordance with the agreement between the former USSR and North Korea several thousand of North Koreans are working on Russian timber-cutting plants in Far East. The term of the agreement expired in late 1993. A Russian delegation has recently left for North Korea in order to discuss the new agreement on timber-cutting works. The Russian party specially insists on several provisions of this agreement. "In particular, we demand that human rights of North Korean citizens be respected in accordance with the Russian legislation and international standards," the diplomat pointed out. He added that the issues on human rights caused "certain irritation" on the part of North Korea. "Our colleagues from North Korea state that everything is all right with them in the sphere of human rights. However, according to non-official information, North Korean representatives on the timber-cutting plants sometimes take the passports of North Koreans working there so that they could not leave for South Korea or for any other third country. They do not always receive all their money," the diplomat said. He emphasized that Russia wanted all North Koreans on its territory to have passports with them. "I hope we will manage to settle all contradictions with the North Korean leadership without violating the international law and the interior legislation of our countries," the Russian diplomat stated. South Korean sources announced that the North Korean leadership was going to send back many of North Korean timber workers so that they do not go to South Korea. The Russian diplomat said he was bewildered with such information. "In fact, this would mean wrecking Russian-North Korean cooperation in the sphere of timber-cutting works and would make conclusion of a new agreement more difficult," the diplomat suggested. However, he underlined that Russia had not undertaken to repatriate North Koreans unwilling to return to their home country. "If a person is on Russian territory and the person committed no illegal actions we have no reasons to hinder their departure to a third country," the Russian diplomat said.
