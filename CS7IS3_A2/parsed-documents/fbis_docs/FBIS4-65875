A Defense Ministry strategy document envisages founding a European agency to make future decisions on all arms exports. [Correspondent C. Meincke] The detour via Europe is intended to open up new sales markets for German arms products. The confidential Defense Ministry strategy document for the planned European arms agency says that the project would only make sense if national restrictions were lifted. However, this would also involve an amendment to the Maastricht Treaty, which lays down that production of and trade in war materiel are governed by national laws. Thus, in the future the agency alone should make decisions on arms deals. This would mean for example that the loose French restrictions could also be applied to Germany. Since the military strategists are aware of the reluctance of the British to enter into such close cooperation, they want to found a small club of determined partners, which will include above all France. The Defense Ministry predicts that trade being carried out through the arms agency would cost many jobs. This price would however have to be paid, since in free competition, the highly efficient German arms industry as a whole would probably emerge as a net profit-maker.
