The sources said deputies of the ruling coalition parties will resume talks on Monday to finalize the accord and send it to the heads of the coalition parties, who will then decide to choose Hata, 58, as their candidate for premiership. Parliamentary balloting for the next prime minister is likely to take place either April 19 or 20 and Hata, who is also deputy premier, will become the new Japanese leader. Saturday's agreement was bad news for former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe of the largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party, who sources said may decide not to run for prime minister because of a lack of support. Hata left Marrakech, Morocco on Friday morning for Tokyo after attending high-level talks and signing a new global trade pact. Watanabe will hold a second round of talks with LDP President Yohei Kono on Monday in which Kono will try to talk 70-year-old Watanabe into abandoning his plans to succeed Hosokawa, 56, LDP sources said. Watanabe has toyed with an idea of quitting the LDP and seeking an alliance with Shinseito [Japan renewal Party], of which Hata is leader, and Komeito [Clean Government Party], in a bid to become the next prime minister. But sources close to the Watanabe faction inside the LDP predicted that Watanabe would drop plans to run for premiership. During the meeting of the deputies, the ruling parties ironed out their differences over such key issues as political reform, Tokyo's policy toward North Korea's alleged nuclear arms program, its international contributions and tax reform, officials said. New party Sakigake [Harbinger Party], one of the coalition parties which declared Friday that it will not take a post in a new cabinet, did not send its representative to the meeting. The senior coalition officials confirmed the ruling parties will stick with a policy accord reached before the startup of the Hosokawa administration last August, Social Democratic Party (SDP) [Social Democratic Party of Japan -- SDPJ] Secretary General Wataru Kubo told a news conference. Kubo also said the parties should reach an agreement calling for early Diet approval of the already overdue fiscal 1994 budget as the next government's "urgent and most important task." The policy discussions followed a week of political turmoil triggered by Hosokawa's abrupt decision to call it quits on April 8. On the stance Japan will take toward North Korea's suspected nuclear arms program, the SDP, which has traditionally maintained close ties with the (North) Korean Workers' Party, will not face difficulties in working out a common policy, Kubo said. "We will honor a U.N. decision and strive to do all we can within the bounds of the Constitution," he said, in a reference to the SDP's readiness to respect the possibility of U.N. sanctions against the communist country. At Saturday's meeting, the ruling party representatives concurred on the need to solve the question of how to define the role of Japan-U.S. security arrangements, Kubo and other coalition officials said.
