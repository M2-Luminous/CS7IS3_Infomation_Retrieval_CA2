The plowing and draining of forests and spraying of sapling thickets with pesticides will come to an end by the end of 1996 if the unanimous proposals in the forest industry's first environment program are implemented. The recommendations are of great importance to the landscape of northern Finland because over half of the forest regeneration areas are being plowed. Machine contractors will be given two years to adapt to the situation. The forest industry's environment program was delivered to Environment Minister Sirpa Pietikainen (Conservative) and Agriculture and Forestry Minister Martti Pura (Center Party) on Tuesday [15 March]. The program differs from the agriculture program in that the committee proposes changes in the laws for the forest industry, and it does not settle for recommendations. According to the program, the diversification of commercial forests will be the most important task of forestry experts during the present decade. The committee wants to call clear-cutting cultivation cutting. In the committee's opinion, it is unfair to compare Finland's few hectares of clear-cut forest with Canada and Russia's thousands of hectares of logged forest, especially since they are not worried about renewing their forests in those countries -- by seeding and planting -- as we are in Finland. The committee proposes 10 hectares as the initial size of areas to be clear-cut; a clearing area could be as large as 15 hectares in Lapland. Clearings will not be completely stripped anymore; some of the trees are supposed to be left to grow old and decay. Order of Importance for Nature Conservation Programs In its program the committee also proposes that the forest law be revised and they demand that the current nature conservation programs be implemented within the next seven years. They lay particular emphasis on protection of the program for the conservation of old forests and of threatened species. "The purpose of the program is to change the forest industry such that, in addition to timber production, the industry also sees to the care of all of the forest wildlife and the maintenance of biodiversity," the chairman of the committee, general manager Juhani Viitala, emphasized. The program teaches Finns a new expression, key biotope. Groves, lush woodland, stream banks, shoreline, island, and hardwood forests, among others, are ecologically important key biotopes. The program lays emphasis on special care for them and their importance to commercial forests. In the committee's opinion, we ought to take a critical view of the purchasing of forestland in connection with conservation. "We don't have to buy up everything. We're considering exchanges of land, nature conservation bonds, shares in state companies, and use restrictions as alternatives instead of redemption," Viitala said. On behalf of the health of the forests, they propose in the program that logging be increased. Finland's forest growth comes to 85-88 cubic meters, 3 million of which are in protected areas. "We estimate that compliance with this program would exclude 5 to 10 million cubic meters from logging. Since 55 million cubic meters are logged in normal years, implementation of the environment program will not jeopardize the forest industry's growing need for timber either." Forest Boards Would be Responsible for Monitoring Locally, forest boards would be responsible for the diversity of forest wildlife and its development. The forest boards would work in cooperation with environment officials. Monitoring the care of the environment would be entrusted to the forest boards. Since difficulties that have arisen in implementing conservation programs have negatively affected relations with landowners, the committee proposes that forest care associations serve as intermediaries in sales of woodpecker forests. "Landowners would get information on conservation programs from representatives of forest care associations, with whom they are used to doing business anyway. This is assuming that environment officials inform the forest organizations on the biological principles conservation is based on and provide them with information on financing and alternative courses of action," Viitala said. Implementation of the environment program would cost the government 260 million markkaa a year. Proposals for New Forest Laws Law for the permanent use of forests: Finland's first general law governing forests. The drafting of the law has already begun and it is supposed to go into effect in 1995. The law would apply to all forests owned by owner-group associations, the state, and corporations. Private forest law: The promotion of forest wildlife diversity would be specified as the goal of forest care. To go into effect in 1996. Laws on forest centers and association forests as well as forest care associations: Forest organizations' obligation to promote the diversity of forest wildlife would be written into the laws. The organizations would be responsible for furthering care of the environment in connection with practical forest management and for monitoring them in cooperation with environment officials. To go into effect in 1996. Forest damage prevention law: Those who gather wood in the summer would be obligated to avoid turning over roots, which decays spruce thickets. Forest contractors would have to pay forest owners compensation for any damage they cause while harvesting trees starting with 1996. The committee wants to ban excessive cleaning up of forests so that some decaying trees will be left in forests. National Policy The environment program for the forest economy was drafted within six months, faster than anyone would have thought possible. International agreements signed by Finland and the forest industry's ability to compete on markets in which emphasis is laid on sound ecological practice are behind the Agriculture Minitry's speedy action. Diversity must be included in ministry programs and laws since Finland committed itself to promoting diversity in its forests at the environment conference in Rio and at the conference of forestry ministers in Helsinki. Committee chairman Juhani Viitala hoped that the program would receive some measure of official support from the government. It will be easier for us Finns to demand that others make changes in the ways they exploit their forests if our own laws and guidelines are in order. On the committee were representatives of, among others, the forest industry, the National Board of Forestry, Tapio, the MTK [Forest Industry Association], the National Boards of Waters and Environment, and the Nature Conservation League. Ten of the 12 members of the committee were foresters. In addition to official Nature Conservation League member Esko Joutsamo, the committee also heard a great deal from Nature League, World Wildlife Foundation (WWF), and Greenpeace activists at different points of their deliberations. The committee's unanimous proposal will now go through a rapid round of circulation for comment. The Environment Ministry's forest conservation strategy, which concentrates on protected areas and restoration problems, among others, instead of commercial forests, will be presented next week.
