This accusation came from Gregorio Rosal, alias Comrade Roger, spokesman for the Militor Glor Command. [Begin correspondent Norie Temblor recording] In an exclusive interview with GMA-7 at Sierra Madre, Rosal said that the breakaway factions lost the right to use the name Alex Boncayao Brigade after they broke off ties with the Communist Party of the Philippines. It will be recalled that many CPP units headed by the NCR [National Capital Region] regional party committee cut their ties with CPP Chairman Jose Maria Sison. In this connection, Rosal said they will reactivate the real Alex Boncayao Brigade to counter the impostor ABB. Regarding the coming peace talks, Rosal revealed that the CPP remains open to the peace talks. In the meantime, Rosal called on Ramos to give more attention to the important issues in the peace talks rather than focusing on the issue of giving Sison a passport. On the ongoing cease-fire, Rosal disclosed that they have not committed any violations. Meanwhile, government troops continue their intensive surveillance of suspected New People's Army camps.
