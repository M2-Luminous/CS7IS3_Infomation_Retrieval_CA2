This parliament has representation from those parties that achieved success in the recent election. It is a parliament of the people of this region, elected by them; therefore we do not doubt that the people will give it due respect and cooperation in its operation. We congratulate all the parties that achieved success in this election and we desire that they work together toward development in KwaZulu/Natal. Special congratulations to the new prime minister of the region, the honorable Dr. Mdlalose, who has been given the great responsibility of leading at a time of healing of the wounds and hurts of the people of KwaZulu/Natal. We do not doubt that he will be able to work together with Mr. Jacob Zuma of the ANC in making peace between the followers of the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] and the ANC, who have been at loggerheads for many years in this region. We request that other ANC leaders in the region, such as Mr. Harry Gwala, support Mr. Zuma in this task. The time for war is now past. This is a time of reconciliation and reconstruction. This is the time to gird up for the hard work at hand of repairing the damage inflicted by apartheid in this country, especially on the black community. In KwaZulu/Natal we have the wonderful opportunity of also working together to rebuild what was broken down by the anarchy and violence that compromised much that was good in the region. This region has a great many people, but also has much poverty and underdevelopment. Job opportunities must be created, houses must be built, schools must be built and teachers trained, hospitals and clinics must be built, roads constructed, and food and other commodities produced. All this cannot be achieved without peace and reconciliation in this region. We therefore urge everyone to work for peace and reconciliation if our freedom is to bear tangible results.
