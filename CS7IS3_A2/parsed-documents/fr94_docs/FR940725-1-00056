FR940725-1-00056 FR940725-1-00010 Section 23.59␣Takeoff Distance and Takeoff Run This proposal would clarify §23.59 with no substantial change in requirements. The proposal would change the opening text to clarify that the determination of takeoff run is the applicant's option since the applicant may choose not to present clearway data. The reference in current §23.59(a)(2) and (b)(2) to ``along the takeoff path,'' in a takeoff with all engines operating, would be deleted since takeoff path is a one-engine-inoperative condition. Additionally, the reference to V LOF is replaced with the words ``liftoff point'' to clarify that the requirements specify a point and related distance, not a speed. Section 23.63␣Climbs: General Proposed new §23.63 would assemble general climb requirements from §§23.65 and 23.67 into a single section and differentiate between WAT limited airplanes (reciprocating engine powered airplanes of above 6,000 pounds maximum takeoff weight and all turbine engine powered airplanes) and those airplanes that are not WAT limited (reciprocating engine powered airplanes of 6,000 pounds or less). (See the proposed change to §23.45 for discussion of WAT limits.) Proposed new §23.63(a)(1) would require that compliance be shown out of ground effect. This requirement is in current §23.67(e), which applies to commuter category airplanes. Proposed new §23.63(a)(3) requires that compliance must be shown, unless otherwise specified, with one engine inoperative, at a bank angle not exceeding 5 degrees. This requirement is in current §23.149 and has been applied generally for part 23 airplanes except commuter category airplanes in certain circumstances. Section 23.65␣Climb: All Engines Operating This proposal would clarify §23.65 and would change minimum climb speeds for multiengine airplanes. Proposed revisions to §23.65(a) would change the applicability from ``each airplane'' as adopted in Amendment No. 23&hyph;45 (58 FR 42136, August 6, 1993) to ``each normal, utility, and acrobatic category reciprocating engine-powered airplane of 6,000 pounds or less maximum weight.'' It would change the phrase ``angle of climb'' to ``climb gradient'' and establish the climb gradient at 8.3 percent for landplanes and 6.7 percent for seaplanes and amphibians with certain specified performance conditions. Proposed (a)(4) would establish a minimum climb speed for multiengine airplanes of not less than the greater of 1.1 V MC and 1.2 V S1 , which would provide a margin above V MC . The cowl flap requirements currently in paragraph (a)(5) would be moved to §23.45(c). Current §23.65(b) would be deleted. These requirements should have been deleted in Amendment No. 23&hyph;45 (58 FR 42136, August 6, 1993), but they were overlooked. Since the adoption of Amendment No. 23&hyph;45 there is no longer a rate of climb requirement in §23.65(a). The alternative means of compliance allowed by paragraph (b), therefore, is obsolete and not consistent with the more stringent performance requirements proposed by this NPRM. Also, the alternative means of compliance in paragraph (b) was rarely used by applicants. The proposed §23.65(b) would add WAT limits for reciprocating engine-powered airplanes of more than 6,000 pounds maximum weight and turbine engine-powered airplanes. (See proposal for §23.45 for discussion of WAT limits.) Current §23.65(c) would be moved to §23.65(b) and the temperature and altitude requirements would be deleted since WAT limits are proposed for turbine engine-powered airplanes and the four percent gradient would apply at any approved takeoff ambient condition. Proposed §23.65(b)(2) provides for landing gear down unless the gear can be retracted in not more than seven seconds. This is more stringent than the present requirement, but the same as the proposed one-engine-inoperative takeoff climb requirements, and is considered appropriate to this weight and class of airplane with WAT limits. Current §23.65(d) would be deleted since the requirements would be covered in the proposed §23.45(h)(2) and current §23.21. Section 23.66␣Takeoff Climb; One-engine Inoperative Proposed new §23.66 would require the determination of the one-engine-inoperative climb capacity of all WAT limited reciprocating engine-powered and turbine engine-powered airplanes immediately after takeoff. Since most reciprocating engine-powered airplanes do not have autofeather, the condition immediately after takeoff can be critical. There is not a minimum climb requirement in this configuration, only the determination of the climb or descent gradient. This information does not become a limitation; it is provided to the pilot in the AFM (see §23.1587) to allow the pilot to make informed judgments before takeoff.
