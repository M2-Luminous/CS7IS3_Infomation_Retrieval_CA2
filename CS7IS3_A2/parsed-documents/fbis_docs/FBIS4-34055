This law was hastily approved last week by the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. Despite the entrepreneurs' criticism of the original text, the vetoes did not eliminate any of the controversial items of the law, which was created to control price abuses. In a message sent to the Senate, the last house of the legislative branch to approve the draft antitrust bill, President Franco explained the reason for the three vetoes. One of them eliminated Article 79 from the law, as it would have rendered vacant the positions of advisers, president, and universal agent of Cade [Administrative Council for Economic Defense] until the Senate appoints new officials. The blanks left by the vetoes were filled by a new provisional measure promulgated today by President Franco. This provisional measure will also help regulate the functioning of Cade until a draft bill on the issue is examined by Congress. According to the provisional measure promulgated today, the positions of Cade president, advisers, and universal agent remain in effect. Cade has now become a self-supported government organization instead of just another organization under the Justice Ministry. In his message to the Senate, President Franco explained that the empty positions would make Cade nonfunctional at precisely a time when the government must control the companies to prevent inflation in the new currency, which is to go into circulation on 1 July. The government created two more advisory positions. The mandates of the officials who will occupy them will end together with those of the current Cade members. In the future, the mandates will last two years and one year, to make it possible to renew 50 percent of the Cade board. Another veto eliminated Article 22, which had been badly written. The article linked two simultaneous infractions -- unjustified increase in prices and charging excessively high prices -- to the Economic Policy Secretariat (SPE) of the Finance Ministry. By replacing the preposition "and" with "or," the new provisional measure allows the secretariat to take action in either case. The provisional measure also establishes that as far as fines are concerned, the company's profit during the fiscal year preceding the filing of a Cade administrative lawsuit should be considered. The basis for the fine -- which can range between 1 percent and 30 percent of company's profit -- must be corrected in accordance with the criteria used to update the payment of overdue federal taxes, until the fine is paid for. Independently from collecting the fine, the Economic Rights Secretariat [SDE] of the Justice Ministry will ask the prosecutor general to adopt the required judicial measures to prevent economic abuse if the preventive measures adopted by the SDE are not complied with. President Franco also vetoed Article 82 of the law, which establishes that expenses involved with the implementation of Cade be paid for with budget funds allocated to the Justice Ministry. The provisional measure does not really clarify how the Ministry will meet these expenses.
