At this news conference, president Rugova presented the very grave situation in Kosova, due to the continuous violence and repression of Serbia against the Albanians. For more details, Mehmet Haziri reports from Prishtina: [Haziri] At today's meeting with reporters, president Rugova expressed his concern over the intensification of the Serbian repression against the Albanian population in Kosova, which was manifested during this week with raids on the pretext of searching for arms, maltreatments, violent recruitment of Albanian youngsters into the Serbian Army, raids on private firms, and convictions of Albanians in trumped-up trials. The Serbian army and paramilitary forces are being more and more incorporated into this wave of police repression. President Rugova condemned the application of violent measures of the installed Serbian power in the Dodona Children and Youth Theater in Prishtina, which has been developing an intensive cultural and artistic activity for a long time. President Rugova said that the intensification of the Serbian violence and state terror aims at threatening and provoking the Albanian population. He also greeted the statement of U.S. President Bill Clinton, who expressed sorrow over the status of Kosova, and that of Vice President Al Gore who highly assessed the peaceful resistance of Albanians, who were not provoked by the violence exerted on them. Rugova hailed the statement of French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, who warned that Kosova will be included in the package for the global solution of the crisis in former Yugoslavia. However, he attracted the attention that Kosova cannot be compared with the Knin province, as it had its own constitution as a federal unit of former Yugoslavia, ethnic territorial compactness, and the expressed political will of the people. Even this time, president Rugova asked for international protection for Kosova. Answering a reporter's question about Albania's diplomatic commitment and that of President Berisha toward the solution of the Kosova problem, Rugova pointed out that the common denominator of the diplomatic commitment of Kosova and Albania at the present moment is to prevent conflict in this area. Commenting on some statements and articles in Serbian circles and media on the possibility of the creation of a new confederation in the Balkans, president Rugova said that the ideas for such confederations have yielded no results so far, and it is too early to talk about them. First, ethnic problems should be solved in the Balkans -- everyone be placed in his own land -- and then discuss the possibility of any relationship of interest for all sides. The confederation cannot exist with the domination of one over the other, president Rugova said among other things at today's meeting with reporters.
