They "console themselves" with the thought that the refugees and those people made homeless are in a worse position than themselves. A person could overcome the economic difficulties if it were not for the pillage and robbery, murders, terrorist acts, and so forth. One gets the impression that apparently nobody is any longer capable of establishing the peace and order that people long for. However, the republic's Security Minister Igor Giorgadze does not share this pessimistic view. [Gvelesiani] Batono [Georgian polite form of address] minister, you were in western Georgia for almost one month. What was the purpose of such a long trip? [Giorgadze] In accordance with the instructions from the head of state, I was entrusted with forming a brigade and going to western Georgia in order to familiarize myself with current processes there and implement effective measures aimed at discharging the extremely serious crime situation. From 20 February until 14 March, we were in Poti together with the operational brigade, which was carrying out extremely complex and labor-intensive work. Accompanying me were special units from the Ministry of Security that were conducting operations aimed at exposing and seeking reconciliation with armed groups. These were not punitive operations. We held talks with leaders of armed groups that fought on the side of the ex-president and that, until now, have been hiding in the forests. It is superfluous to speak about a general reconciliation since all those who have been robbing and intimidating the peaceful population have committed criminal offenses and therefore have to be brought to account before the law. The fact that there no longer exists the fear of the revival of "Zviadism" in its armed form can be viewed as the biggest achievement. We can confidently say today that the fear of a new civil war in western Georgia has been eliminated. I believe this is due to the work of employees of the Ministry of Security and others. For 24 days we held talks with three armed groups. It is true that we were unable to achieve reconciliation with all of the 160 persons united in these groups. However, the talks are continuing and they require prudence, patience, and time. Certain members of the law enforcement bodies have themselves complicated our work; it has turned out that they have been demanding fairly large sums for "reconciliation" from those people who have been coming out of the forests with their submachine guns. In addition to weapons that have been surrendered voluntarily, we have managed to confiscate a large quantity of firearms. We have retrieved stolen trucks and equipment. However, this is the material side of the trip, which I consider to be less important. The main thing is that people have declared their trust in our department, and this has the greatest social and political importance. [Gvelesiani] The incident that occurred between the heads of the two power ministries alarmed the entire republic [bomb blast at the Ministry of Security building on 25 December 1993, physical confrontations between security and defense ministry personnel, including ministers over loss of Abkhazia, disruption of signing of military agreement at Ashgabat CIS summit]. How has it ended? [Giorgadze] Reason prevailed in the conflict that arose between me and the defense minister. The government commission has not yet completed its work. I believe it will establish who was wrong and who was right. For me, this question was of the greatest importance in order to prevent a further aggravation of the conflict. This was an unprecedented event in the history of the state. If the situation is not cleared up, it could be interpreted as an attempted coup. The damage suffered by the Ministry of Security is very great. It amounts to 18 billion coupons; two employees were seriously wounded and cars belonging to the ministry were destroyed during the explosion. I think we managed to avoid further complications arising from the conflict when armored vehicles and armed persons were brought out onto the street in order to seize the counterintelligence building. Everything ended in little bloodshed. [Gvelesiani] Batono Igor, the violations in the banking and credit and financial system, the misappropriation of humanitarian aid, and the removal of raw materials of strategic importance from the state leads us to believe that a powerful mafia is operating in Georgia. [Giorgadze] For almost two years now, there has been talk about violations in the credit and financial system; several commissions have been formed and are working; suspects have been arrested but, as can be seen, the major criminals have remained free, as not a single serious violation in the banking sphere has been cleared up. On instructions from the head of state, our ministry became interested in this matter. On the basis of investigative materials, we arrested the vice-president of the National Bank. Given the reaction that this fact has caused among a number of senior officials, it can be supposed that we are dealing with serious violations whose successful investigation will expose all those who sacrificed the country's interests for their own gain. The Ministry of Security has been entrusted with forming an independent economic service that will be able to control and examine violations in the economic and credit systems. However, at the moment, we do not have sufficient funds for this. It is certain that existing mafia groups have found support both in state bodies of administration and in executive power. Therefore, the struggle against them and their exposure will take a long time. This is a serious problem and the Ministry of Security alone will not be able to cope with it. [Gvelesiani] Does the fear exist that Georgia will become a transit country for drugs? [Giorgadze] Unfortunately, this process is already under way and the international narcotics business, which trades in illegal arms and narcotic substances, is interested in our territory. The point is that, whereas before, the narcotics route from Asia to Europe bypassed the USSR, it now runs as follows: eastern Asia -- Pakistan -- Afghanistan -- Central Asia -- Azerbaijan -- Georgia. Therefore, Georgia unhesitatingly took part in the international conference held in Istanbul on the initiative of the Black Sea countries and devoted to the problems of the struggle against the narcotics business and terrorism. Work in this direction is intensively under way. My deputy and a special group are currently in Bucharest, where a meeting of special services is continuing at which the latest means and methods in the struggle against the drugs mafia are being perfected. Incidentally, a sizable amount of drugs has already been smuggled via Georgia to Europe. The absence of borders and strict customs controls and appropriate legislation are complicating our work very much. [Gvelesiani] The view is being spread here and supported by high-ranking officials in the power structures that Georgia is unable to restore order by itself and, therefore, is calling on an external force for help. [Giorgadze] I do not share such a view. Georgia can certainly establish order in its own land. This is borne out by the recent intensification of the struggle against the criminal world and the subsequent positive results that have been achieved. The Ministry of Security just like its predecessor -- the Intelligence and Information Bureau, was not tasked with acting upon information received. One got the impression that we could only obtain information while some "distant uncle" would establish order for us. Now, the situation is different. Those special divisions that make up the power structures of the Ministry of Security are well trained and well disciplined and composed of young men trained to carry out special operations; I believe it is possible to train similar groups in the Ministry of Internal Affairs as well. In my view, the power structures currently existing in the Ministry of Security should also exist in the future in Georgian military formations in the form of special subunits. The correct selection of professional cadres will enable us to form and train such special subunits in all the power ministries that will be able to restore order in the country in the shortest period of time. We need more than just the desire to do this. We need to create the appropriate legislation, material and technical base, and means for this. Then, we will no longer be reliant on external help but will be able to act entirely on our own. [Gvelesiani] When will the security service's archives be made public? [Giorgadze] After Gamsakhurdia became head of state, "interest" in the security service's archives exceeded all bounds. There were gross violations of the law. I believe we should now form a parliamentary commission that will investigate and determine how unique material, which was stored for tens of years in the security service, was destroyed. Those documents, which presented in an "unembellished" form the activities of persons in the government, were removed and destroyed. Certain unconscientious employees in the security service have used archive materials to build their political careers and there were also cases of archive materials being sold. There occurred a series of serious violations that have to be exposed as a matter of urgency. The archives are now again in a sorrowful state; we do not have the appropriate storage cases and repository that ensures the protection of unique materials. As can be seen, we are unable to appreciate what the Ministry of Security archives mean for the country's security. There is the experience of other countries where, after a certain period of time has elapsed, secret documents become available to the public but only if they do not compromise the interests of the state. In Great Britain, when the time arrived to make public a certain number of documents, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher opposed this and postponed this measure for, I think, 30 years as the publication of this material did not accord with the country's interests. One can say without exaggeration that certain materials in our archives could cause another civil war in Georgia. Therefore, we should be very careful with archive materials. I would like to ask Parliament: True, there are many very serious problems to be resolved in the country, but a legislative base should be elaborated in the shortest period of time that would enable the Ministry of Security and the entire state security system to function normally. The existence of laws would settle many questions and also strictly define the problem of the safekeeping of materials in the archives. [Gvelesiani] Batono minister, the public is alarmed by the terrorist acts that are being aimed at certain individuals or formations. While pointing out the high professional level of the crimes that have been committed, the leaders of political parties are clearly pointing the finger at the Ministry of Security. The inability to solve these crimes strengthens suspicions.... [Giorgadze] It is naive to think about an improvement in the criminal situation when there is a huge amount of weapons and explosive materials in the hands of the population; against the background of the existing chaos in the banking system, we are now facing the consequences of the wave of violence perpetrated by persons who have become unbelievably rich as a result of illegal commercial operations and mafia clans. Groups that have been deceived or swindled are settling scores with one another, dividing spheres of influence, are often unable to agree with one another.... Nothing new or special is happening in Georgia. This is a characteristic feature of any capitalist system and is being strengthened here with the formation of a free market economy. As for those leaders of political parties who often travel abroad, they know very well that the problem of terrorism exists on a world scale and, in a number of countries, it has been raised to the rank of state policy. Therefore, such a naive approach to a most important question is embarrassing, as is heaping blame on the security service. You often hear the security service being reproached on account of its "inaction" -- not a single terrorist crime has been solved. I am ready to deliver a report on the work carried out to the relevant commission. Provided you do not claim that I am trying to justify myself, I would like to give you a few examples concerning terrorist acts carried out in Great Britain. Between 20 December 1993 and 29 January of this year (in London) and between 15 December 1993 and 4 February of this year in Northern Ireland, more than 20 explosions took place, causing damage to buildings, the subway, houses, and shopping centers. There were victims among the law-abiding population. Not one of these crimes has been solved! It is also significant that this has been taking place in a democratic country that has a 400-year-old parliamentary tradition, the strongest investigative and special services in the world, and a police force equipped with the most modern equipment. In our conditions, it is particularly difficult to solve terrorist crimes since, apart from our not having the necessary equipment, our work is being complicated by other factors. I will give you some concrete facts. A terrorist act was committed against the "Mkhedrioni" ["Horsemen" -- a legally sanctioned armed formation recently incorporated into the Rescue Corps] leaders Zaza Vepkhvadze and Gia Svanadze. Our investigators were not permitted onto the scene of the crime; following an explosion in Rustavi, Temur Talakhadze, the leader of the "Mkhedrioni" branch in Rustavi, was killed. The scene of the crime was sealed off and we were not allowed there either. We were granted access several hours after the event but could not find any incriminating materials or other material evidence. The same thing happened following the explosion at [Deputy Defense Minister] Nikoloz Kekelidze's apartment. Ministry of Security employees were only allowed in after the second explosion (at that time the heads of the Ministry of Defense were examining the scene of the crime). We were able to set about our work some 12 hours after the terrorist act had been committed. Naturally, we found that all evidence had again been destroyed and the scene of the crime had been tidied up. In spite of the aforementioned or other objective or subjective reasons, the greater part of these crimes are in the process of being solved. At the moment I cannot say any more about this. However, we hope that the investigations will soon be over and the criminals will be brought to justice. Therefore, it is possible to make complaints provided they have some substance. We will accept any kind of criticism but neither the Ministry of Security nor any self-respecting professional will accept something that is undeserved. [Gvelesiani] Batono minister, to what extent is it possible to forecast the next terrorist act? [Giorgadze] It is possible to forecast the targets of terrorist acts but I believe that making such forecasts is an unenviable and ignoble activity. At the same time, it is highly risky as the opposing side can use these forecasts to their advantage. It is possible that such acts will continue. We know of high-ranking officials who accumulated vast wealth during the [civil] war. It is expected that they will redistribute spheres of influence, which does not exclude the use of violent methods. I am convinced that these persons, who, for several days were locked up, hungry and thirsty, in "safes," will definitely try to pay their opponents back for this. Yes, there have been such cases. Those who reckon that the other side has cheated them of thousands or millions of dollars, will try to retrieve these huge sums by violent means. In clarifying their relations, neither side will refrain from shedding blood. [Gvelesiani] Are these terrorist acts perhaps politically motivated? [Giorgadze] This also cannot be excluded as there have been cases of terrorist acts committed against various political parties. There have been explosions at some of their headquarters; buildings have been damaged; there have been no victims although this has possibly been due to pure chance. Incidentally, a political battle implies the use of terrorist methods -- in an uncivilized society, of course. I have often said and emphasize once more: In order to establish order in the country and put a halt to the wave of violence perpetrated by criminal bands, the power ministries must have the very latest equipment and, in order to train specialists, the state must spend sizable sums of money. Otherwise, no one will put a stop to the anarchy and disorder. We will not be able to restore the economy without the involvement of foreign partners who, precisely on account of the criminal situation, are refraining from making any investments. Therefore, I ask the head of state, Parliament, the government, and the republic's population to invest immediately the necessary funds into strengthening the Ministry of Security. Our salvation is in our own hands!
