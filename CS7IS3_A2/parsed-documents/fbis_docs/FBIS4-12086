Speaking at his home in al-Rumaylah today, 'Usayran affirmed that the Chamber of Deputies is the defender of liberties. He added that the purpose of a media law is to organize the dissemination of political information, not to suppress liberties, especially as such suppression is a fruitless activity in Lebanon. He pointed out that during the civil war the militias attempted to dictate their wishes to local communities. He explained that all those who lived through that period know that the silent majority in Lebanon opposed and still opposes any attempt to suppress liberties.
