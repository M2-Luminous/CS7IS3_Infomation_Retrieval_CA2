The cable stressed that the committee adheres to the unity of Yemen in that it rehabilitates the history of the country. It stated its rejection of the secessionist step taken by the traitor 'Ali Salim al-Bid and his secessionist gang, and called for purging the country of this rotten band. The cable said that far from echoing the grass roots opinion in the YSP, the decision only speaks for the secessionist gang led by al-Bid. The Leading Committee of the Fattah Corrective Stream in the YSP appealed to the brother chairman and members of the Presidential Council to take a determined stand against this separatist step which aims to take the Yemeni people back to the era of division and to kill democracy. The committee emphasized that it is taking the side of constitutional legality and its courageous forces as they stand up to the gang of apostasy and secession inside the YSP.
