FBIS4-4489 "dreas063_c_94008" FBIS-EAS-94-063 Daily Report 1 Apr 1994 North Korea KSDP Official Urges Visit by ROK Party Leader KSDP Official Urges Visit by ROK Party Leader SK0104110594 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1030 GMT 1 Apr 94 SK0104110594 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, April 1 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the Central Committee of the Korean Social Democratic Party [KSDP] in a statement Friday declared that the Pyongyang tour of Yi Ki-taek, president of the South Korean opposition Democratic Party, must be realised unconditionally and no one must block it. "At a time when the inter-Korean relations have reached an impasse, the visit of the president of a South Korean opposition party to Pyongyang will be a particularly meaningful one," he noted, and went on: "If the visit of Yi Ki-taek to Pyongyang is realized, it will, no doubt, be beneficial to removing the danger of a nuclear war created on the Korean peninsula and finding the way of peace and reunification of the country by joint efforts of the nation. It will not be harmful either to the North or to the South. "Yet the traitor Kim Yong-sam is opposing and blocking his trip to the North, arguing that it `is premature' and `impatience is an anathema'. This is an improper act." "Kim Yong-sam once gave vent to grievances when his visit to Pyongyang was blocked by the former military dictatorial regime, after he expressed the wish as an opposition man. But now, seated in power, he is keeping the president of an opposition party from visiting the North. It is the height of perfidy and treachery." The spokesman stated that the Korean Social Democratic Party would make every sincere effort to realise bilateral and multilateral negotiations between politicians of the North and the South out of the desire to promote the great unity of the nation, transcending differences in ideology and idea and social system, and achieve reunification in the 90s.
