To review the year's development, our reporters (Deng Xiujian) and (Shi Yan) interviewed Vice Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei and two international affairs researchers. Here is (Lin Shaowen) with this year-end special "Global Briefing 93." Vice Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei says that 1993 is the second post Cold War year. The world on the whole is gradually becoming a multipolar system. He admits that instability is on the rise, although a new world war is unlikely in a short time. Tian Zengpei says one important change in 1993 was the rise of the Asia-Pacific region in terms of political and economic importance. Tian Zengpei says the rapid and steady economic growth in Asia has become the focus of world attention and contrast with the recession elsewhere, especially in the industrial world. The national GNP in major Asian nations rose by 7.1 percent in 1993. He says the combined total economic strength of Asian nations around the Pacific Rim is now one quarter of the world total. This has forced many countries to adjust their foreign policies. The U.S. Government has gradually shifted its foreign policy focus to the Asia Pacific as President Clinton believes that it will play a most important role in the U.S. economy. Signs show Japan is returning to Asia economically. With half of its overseas investment in East Asia, Japan has surpassed U.S. as the leading investor in the area. European countries such as Germany have also adopted new policies toward Asia. In contrast, industrialized countries all suffer from a kind of post Cold War syndrome. Tian Zengpei says many western countries suffer from the longest economic recession since World War II. This caused social problems and political instability. Public demonstrations continue. Some ruling parties which have been in power for long period were crushed at the polls. Some government leaders have to be replaced. The vice foreign minister calls it the second most important characteristics of the year. [passage omitted] Vice Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei says regional economic cooperation is most valued. The European Community has approved the Maastrict Treaty on closer European union. The United States, Canada, and Mexico endorsed the North America Free Trade Agreement to develop the region into the world's largest free trade zone. The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum held its first minister meeting and an informal leadership meeting, pledging to strengthen cooperation in economic and trade matters. And finally, in December, after tough bargaining, 117 countries concluded the Uruguay Round agreement on global trade under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade.
