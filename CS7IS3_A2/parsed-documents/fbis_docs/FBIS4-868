A member of the Executive Bureau of the Sacred Union of Radical Opposition stated this during a European tour. (Jacques Matamba Moyo), who is also the chairman of the Confederation of Reformist Nationalists, said that the radical opposition has just formed an army. The mission of this armed branch of the opposition is to topple the Mobutu regime. (Moyo) is asking foreign nationals to leave Zaire. Here with the details is (Moyo), talking to Ousmane Kaba: [(Moyo)] It is possible -- when one looks at what is currently happening -- that a social explosion of great magnitude could take place at any time in Zaire, due to the extreme deterioration and degeneration of the current socioeconomic situation for the military, I repeat, the military, civilians, and religious followers. We are saying that, in order to prevent--as usual--Mobutu's friends abroad from putting pressure on state powers in their respective countries, and in order to prevent them from coming to Zaire under the cover of a rescue operation and saving the dictator, we are asking them as early as now, to make the decision -- as precautionary measures -- to evacuate their nationals. The socioeconomic situation has deteriorated so much that it obliges responsible people, responsible statesmen, to prevent what might happen. We are asking foreigners to leave, to leave us alone to settle our disputes calmly, and when we are through with this we will resume our political cooperation and aid efforts with them.
