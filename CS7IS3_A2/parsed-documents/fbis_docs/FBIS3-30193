People are not only panning for gold but also digging for gold ore, primarily in Ky Anh and Huong Khe districts. At the Hoa Hai gold mine in Huong Khe District, people from various localities have come to dig for gold ore using a variety of implements such as rock crushers and manual grading machines. At times, thousands have come, with the average being 200 people with about 40 rock crushers in operation. There have been reports that Nguyen Van Dai, a local person, extracted 40 kg of gold ore, which is the equivalent of 26 ounces of gold. After mining this gold, he abandoned his tools and left the area, fearing that he would be robbed. One person was murdered while digging for gold. Village authorities collect 1.2 million dong for each gold excavation pit without giving any attention to how the land is dug up. This has had a serious impact on the environment.
