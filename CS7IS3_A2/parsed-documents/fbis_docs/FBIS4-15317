Noting that the previous call-up was "a complete success," he touched on the problem of desertion. According to him, the names of all deserters are known, and if they have not yet been punished it is because these are difficult times and everybody is too busy to look for them. The time will come, however, when they all will face the court. He said that all measures have been taken to keep deserters from leaving the territory of the republic--"for this contingent, the airport is closed." Interpol is involved, and with its help those deserters that have left Armenia may be returned. "There is no forgiveness for them; they do not have a peaceful future--they will not be able to live, work, or study with impunity. Moreover, they will be `blacklisted.'" Vazgen Sarkisyan promised that chairmen of rayon councils who will not ensure that the call-up process proceeds smoothly will themselves be called up for service.
