This calls for a pause to examine what the United States is planning to do at the present stage. The report directly quotes the defense secretary himself, a proponent of creating the proposed divisions, saying that these will consist of highly trained, powerful, and fully equipped forces. The usual excuse the American people are given as a justification for the creation of such forces is to support the "legitimate" U.S. stand. But the truth is completely the opposite. The truth is that the U.S. stand worldwide, beginning with Vietnam and Iraq and ending with Somalia, is so far motivated by the U.S. past defeats in battles against the peoples of these countries. Meanwhile the type of these defeats should not be forgotten. [sentence as published] The U.S. defeat in Vietnam seems somewhat different, both in essence and in form, from the failure of the U.S. aggressive plan against Iraq. Now that Washington seems to be embroiled in another defeat in Somalia, it means that Washington is plagued by defeats in every place, location, and time. The arsenals of faith by which the people arm themselves will always remain stronger than the arsenals of destructive weapons by which American aggressors arm themselves. Undoubtedly this is certain and stands no argument. It is also certain that the United States wants to create this type of military force in order to make up for the failure of the Rapid Deployment Force [RDF] it established shortly after the Vietnam war with the aim of imposing its hegemony on the world. Indeed its aim is also to wash the dirty American face of some of the mud of defeat and of the shame of failures of NATO plans against Iraq under the U.S. leadership. It is also certain that the tasks of the new forces of aggression will be directed against the Third World countries but will not go beyond to tension areas in Europe. Therefore it is unlikely that the American forces will intervene in order to stop the unjust aggression against the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina, for example. What Western commentators said regarding the objective behind establishment of the new aggressive forces is that it is to boost the American people's morale, end the embarrassment in which the U.S. forces found themselves in Somalia, and reassure the American people that the U.S. will not get involved in major conflicts. In fact, this is not all that lies behind creating the new aggressive forces. What lies behind it is something bigger and more serious, namely the greedy and covetous way the United States insists on imposing hegemony on the world. This is confirmed by the fact that Washington has categorically rejected the idea of establishing a joint European Corps, because it insists that there should be no other force sharing U.S. hegemony of the world. On the other hand, events have confirmed the implicit criticism by UN Secretary General Butrus Ghali--despite his well-known record and his accusing the United States of playing the role of world policeman. [sentence as published] A quick glance at the tasks of the new U.S. aggression forces would readily show that their objective is not to support the "legitimate" U.S. stand, but rather to strengthen the role of the U.S. policeman on the international level so that the U.S. force will remain the world's number one force following the collapse of the cold war, as the U.S. defense secretary said.
