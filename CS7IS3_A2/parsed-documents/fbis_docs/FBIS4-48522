The hike, proposed in the ANC's national health plan presented in Johannesburg yesterday, represents a shift from 11.5 percent to at least 13 percent of last year's Budget. ANC health department head Dr Ralph Mgijima said the plan set out a five-year progamme to create a single, integrated national health system based on effective primary health care and funded through existing taxation. "A single government structure will co-ordinate all aspects of both the public and private health care delivery and all existing departments will be integrated." In addition to general taxation, ANC health advisers recommended increased excise on tobacco and alcohol of up to 100 percent. They added that reduced expenditure by other government departments such as defence could see extra funds being diverted to health. "Additional expenditure can be immediately derived by increasing taxes on tobacco which will have an added effect of reducing consumption," Mgijima said. The plan, which includes a strong emphasis on building up the public health service and discouraging expansion of the private sector, was presented to Health Minister Nkosazana Zuma yesterday and was likely to become official health policy. The comprehensive plan, which also recommended the zero-rating of basic foodstuffs, would be "thoroughly discussed" with the Finance Department, said Mgijima, adding that the ANC strongly supported moves to extend VAT exemption to medicines and medical services. As a means of achieving an equitable health care system, the report urges the Health Minister to recommend next month that, among other things, free medical services be provided to children under the age of six, the elderly, the disabled and pregnant and nursing mothers. It also called on government to urgently appoint a commission of inquiry to examine the crisis in the medical aid sector and to consider alternatives such as a compulsory national health insurance system. It proposed that, in addition to general taxation, health care be funded by an insurance system based on employer and employee contributions. The proposed commission of inquiry is expected to investigate the economic feasibility of such an insurance scheme and undertake planning if there is sufficient consensus on the option. The investigation into an insurance system would be based on whether current medical schemes could form its basis and whether existing schemes met specified statutory conditions governing the health insurance system. The ANC's health plan suggests that membership be compulsory for all formal sector employees and their dependents and that the health coverage provided by the scheme be statutory defined. Existing health insurance companies and medical schemes would be free to offer "top-up" cover for services not covered in the insurance package, said Mgijima, adding that the long-term goal would be for all citizens, including the unemployed, to be covered under the system. An Econometrix senior economist said the zero-rating of more basic foodstuffs was better than government food subsidies, and said government could make up for the lost revenue by increasing taxes on "luxuries" such as tobacco and alcohol.
