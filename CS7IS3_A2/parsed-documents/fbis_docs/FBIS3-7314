Speaking at a lecture, Kono pointedly criticized Hosokawa's abortive tax hike plan that would have replaced the current 3 percent consumption tax. Stating that the Hosokawa administration has raised doubts about its political capability since its formation last summer, the LDP chief also said the government should be blamed for the long delay in the Diet debate on the fiscal 1994 state budget. The delay is due largely to the government's decision to postpone customary year-end budget formulation until early this year, Kono said. Kono also demanded that Hosokawa come clean on a questionable loan he allegedly received from a scandal-tainted trucking firm. Kono is the first LDP president who has failed to become prime minister in nearly four decades. Under the LDP rule that ended last August, the post of party chief automatically carried the premiership because of the party's majority strength in parliament.
