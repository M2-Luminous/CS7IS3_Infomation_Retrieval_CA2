According to the refugees, the Vietnamese who fled from the Khmer Rouge's massacre around Boeng Tonle Sap Lake last year and who have gathered in Chrey Thom at the Cambodian-Vietnamese border with more than 1,000 boats, now number about 10,000. Nevertheless, according to the figure of the Kandal Provincial Research Commission, when the UN High Commissioner for Refugees toured the area on 20 April 1994, the number of those refugees remained only 5,000. So where were almost half of other ethnic Vietnamese? Answering this question, the Vietnamese displaced persons said: It is not difficult for those wanting to leave Chrey Thom. The easiest way for them is to sell their boats, then leave the area. According to local informed sources, those leaving this place have returned to their birthplace around Boeng Tonle Sap Lake; they claim that they were born in Cambodia. The cause of the Vietnamese refugees' continued departure from Chrey Thom without permission from the Cambodian authorities is that they can no longer live in hardship there. A great many ethnic Vietnamese in the area said: The remaining Vietnamese refugees will leave in next three months if there is no solution to their problem from the Cambodian Government . Their departure implies that they demand to return to their old places. According to this argument, there are two problems worth being considered: 1. The departure from the Chrey Thom area without law supporting those refugees: The departure appears to be evidence of the government's incapability to administer foreigners living in Cambodia. This sufficiently shows that the government's immigration law to be promulgated in the near future will encounter difficulties in their implementation. Because the ethnic Vietnamese continue to insist that their real birthplace is in Cambodia and because some of them even have identity cards as proof. 2. When the government's immigration law has not yet been issued, the Vietnamese war refugees should not be allowed to come, leave, or act at will. It is reported that they can travel wherever as they please and that their presence in the area is just for receiving meager assistance from humanitarian organizations. Now and then they go about doing their business in Vietnam or in Phnom Penh. There is another group of Vietnamese who do not yet have proof that they were born in Cambodia have looked for ways to establish that their real birthplace is in Cambodia. Besides, in light of the event, it can be concluded that the area has not been under the control of the Cambodian authorities. If it is the case, this issue should be up for review.
