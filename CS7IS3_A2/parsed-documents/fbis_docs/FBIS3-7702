During the meeting, both sides agreed that "the JNP, the DSP and Sakigake [Harbinger] share the same political beliefs and policies," and they proposed that as a first step toward realigning the current political parties "the three ruling parties form a unified parliamentary group in the House of Representatives." The JNP and the DSP are trying to play a mediatory role between the ruling coalition parties and to look for a way to rally the ruling coalition parties to field their unified candidates in the next general election at a time when Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], Komeito, and the Social Democratic Party of Japan are increasingly feuding over a plan for a policy research council. Present at the meeting were five legislators from the JNP, including Secretary General Masuo Matsuoka, and five legislators from the DSP, including Secretary General Takashi Yonezawa.
