The consultation will take place at the two-day Awashima Forum, which starts in Japan on Friday. The forum, organized by the Japan Institute of International Affairs, will shed light on Asia-Pacific cooperation after the conclusion of the Uruguay Round in April. Almost all the countries and regions in the Asia-Pacific Rim are expected to participate in the conference. "We attach great importance to integration with the Asia-Pacific economies, with which most of our trade is involved," said Long Yongtu, assistant minister at the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC). He leaves today for Japan together with a senior Chinese research fellow in the automobile industry. He said that the advice of Asia Pacific nations would be beneficial to China. Most countries in the region support China's re-entry into the global free trade body because they know that today's multilateral trade system would be incomplete without Chinese participation.
