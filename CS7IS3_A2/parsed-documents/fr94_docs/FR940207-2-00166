FR940207-2-00166 FR940207-2-00077 Applicants' Legal Conclusions 1. Applicants are requesting an exemptive order to the extent that the proposed issuance and sale of an unlimited number of classes of shares representing interests in the Funds might be deemed (a) to result in the issuance of a ``senior security'' within the meaning of section 18(g) of the Act and thus be prohibited by section 18(f)(1) of the Act, and (b) to violate the equal voting provisions of section 18(i) of the Act. 2. Applicants believe that the proposed Multiple Pricing System does not present the concerns that section 18 of the Act is intended to redress. The Multiple Pricing System does not involve borrowings and will not affect a Fund's assets or reserves. The proposed arrangement will not increase the speculative character of the shares of the Funds, since all such shares will participate pro rata in all of each Fund's income and all of each Fund's expenses, with the exception of the differing distribution fees and incremental agency costs, if any. Moreover, the capital structures of the Funds will not facilitate control without equity or other investment, nor will they make it difficult for investors to value the securities of the Funds. 3. Applicants believe that the issuance and sale by the Funds of an unlimited number of classes will better enable the Funds to meet the competitive demands of today's financial services industry. Under the Multiple Pricing System, an investor will be able to choose the method of purchasing shares that is most beneficial, given the amount of his or her purchase, the length of time the investor expects to hold his or her shares, and other relevant circumstances. The proposed arrangement would permit the Funds to facilitate both the distribution of its securities and provide investors with a broader choice as to the method of purchasing shares without assuming excessive accounting and bookkeeping costs or unnecessary investment risks. 4. Applicants believe that the proposed allocation of expenses and voting rights relating to the rule 12b&hyph;1 distribution plans is equitable and would not discriminate against any group of shareholders. With respect to any Fund, the rights and privileges of each class of shares are substantially identical, and consequently the possibility that their interests would ever conflict would be remote. In any event, the interests of the Class A, Class B, and Class C shareholders with respect to the service fee and/or distribution fee would be adequately protected, since the rule 12b&hyph;1 plans for each of those classes will conform to the requirements of rule 12b&hyph;1, including the requirement that their implementation and continuance be approved on an annual basis by both the full board and the disinterested directors of the Funds. 5. Applicants believe that the implementation of the CDSC in the manner and under the circumstances described above would be fair and in the best interests of shareholders of the Funds. Thus, the granting of the order requested herein would be appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act.
