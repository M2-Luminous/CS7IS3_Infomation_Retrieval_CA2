Is this the hour that you have been waiting for? [Haider] Citizens are now rejecting the forms of government that they previously accepted as the lesser evil in view of the communist threat. These parties are too large and too inflexible to respond to serious change. It is no longer possible to turn a 1950's Borgward into a racing vehicle. [DER SPIEGEL] You are proposing a pan-European "liberation course." What does that mean? [Haider] In Italy, Austria, and Germany, new political parties are being formed outside the framework of the old parties. Our common concern is autonomy, an end to corruption, and the strengthening of the plebiscite elements of the rule-of-law state. [DER SPIEGEL] A truly mixed movement extending from Le Pen to Haider? [Haider] Not at all. [DER SPIEGEL] But it does include Gerhard Frey and his German People's Union? [Haider] What makes you think that? Mr. Frey only acknowledges himself and would rather come to nothing than become part of a movement. [DER SPIEGEL] So, your man is Schoenhuber? [Haider] People who hold extremist, reactionary ideas do not belong in a democratic renewal movement. The Republikaner have not gotten beyond the stage of being a protest party of the right. [DER SPIEGEL] This curt distinction that you have made does not sound convincing. [Haider] There are many Republikaner who would feel better in another movement. There are cultured people such the Baden-Wuerttemberg group leader Rolf Schlier, who I find to be an interesting conversation partner. However, he will not get any further under Schoenhuber. [DER SPIEGEL] Where are your allies in Europe? [Haider] I consider liberal parties to include the group around Giscard d'Estaing in France, the Liga Norda, the Suedtirol Liberal Party in Italy, the Radical Democratic Party in Switzerland, and the Association of Free Citizens in Germany, which was founded by former Bavarian FDP [Free Democratic Party] land chairman Manfred Brunner. There are contacts with all those groups, and cross-border activities will probably be launched shortly. [DER SPIEGEL] Will you support Manfred Brunner in the European elections? [Haider] From time to time, I feel the need to correct all the untruths that are being spread about me in Germany. That accords well with Manfred Brunner's initiative, and he is an interesting fellow. In any event, this year I will be addressing FDP local associations at their invitation. [DER SPIEGEL] There is an FDP presidium resolution that rules out cooperation with you. Who has invited you? [Haider] Several courageous local associations in southern and central Germany. [DER SPIEGEL] How do you rate the prospects for a right-wing populist party in Germany? [Haider] There will probably be a grand coalition in Germany in the short term, and only then will a new force be able to establish itself, a liberal party that will address practical problems, will be able to succeed without the Republikaners' customary excessive stress on nationalist matters, and could obtain between 15 and 20 percent of the vote. [DER SPIEGEL] So, what room is left for the FDP? [Haider] I expect the party to become insignificant. If it continues to defend the system and only tries to gain as much as possible from what exists at present, it will shortly be superfluous.
