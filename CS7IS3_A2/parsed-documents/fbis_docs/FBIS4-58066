FBIS4-58066 "drnes084_j_94022" FBIS-NES-94-084 Daily Report 30 Apr 1994 ARABIAN PENINSULA Yemen Wrapup of Reports on Country's Political `Crisis' Wrapup of Reports on Country's Political `Crisis' Ministry Renews Mediation Call EA0105210694 Aden Yemeni Republic Radio Network in Arabic 2045 GMT 30 Apr 94 EA0105210694 Aden Yemeni Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [Statement issued by Defense Ministry on 30 April; place not given] [Text] A responsible source in the Defense Ministry has renewed its appeal to the joint military commission and fact-finding committee, set up by the House of Representatives, to urgently mediate with the ruling military authority in Sanaa so as to save the wounded members of the 3d Armored Brigade. The source has also appealed for a guarantee that medical help and food supplies reach units of the brigade and the tribes of al-Sarih and al-Jabal, which have been subjected to continuous artillery bombardment by Republican Guard forces, central security forces, the military police, and tribes loyal to the ruling family in Sanaa. This came after the Defense Ministry received firm evidence showing that a number of wounded members of the 3d Brigade had been captured or removed from hospitals, shackled, and moved to national security centers and military garrisons, while being treated in a most inhumane and immoral way. They were interrogated with the aim of extracting fantastic confessions from them in front of television, for cheap propaganda and political ends. Information has confirmed that many of these wounded persons are in terribly bad shape, that their lives are in danger as a result of torture (?in addition to) their wounds. What confirms these inhuman actions on the part of the military ruling authorities in Sanaa, which are being committed without any moral, patriotic or religious feelings, is the fact that on 30 April these authorities arrested Lieutenant Colonel 'Abd-al-Nabi Hadi al-Mahdi, the commander of the 14th Battalion of the 3d Armored Brigade. He was lying in bed at Amran Hospital, having been wounded on 27 April in 'Imran by Sheikh Hamud Atif and his gang, on the orders of President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, who ordered the battalion commander to be brought to his office dead or alive. The Defense Ministry source appealed to all patriotic forces, social personalities, parties, institutions, and humanitarian organizations -- particularly the Yemeni Red Crescent, Arab Red Crescent, and the International Red Cross, to discharge their humanitarian responsibilities toward our sons and brothers, who are being subjected to the most revolting physical and mental torture at the hands of the torturers and (?intelligence men) of the ruling military family in Sanaa, by guaranteeing the dispatch of medical and food aid to the 3d Armored Brigade and the sons of the al-Sarih and al-Jabal. Issued by the Defense Ministry [Dated] 30 April [words indistinct].
