What is on its agenda? [Sha'th] The first meeting is needed to determine the action plan for moving toward Gaza and Jericho and the Palestinian land. This is the first meeting. Portfolios or responsibilities should be distributed among the members. We will complete the appointment of the other members. The total number of members should be 24. We will prepare a detailed plan of action for this authority and for its departure as soon as possible for Gaza and Jericho. We will also discuss the plan for completing the negotiations that will enable the early assumption of powers in the West Bank and the completion of what has not been completed in the negotiations which led to the conclusion of the Gaza-Jericho agreement. [Mu'addi] Will the names of the remaining members of the Palestinian Authority be announced tomorrow? [Sha'th] This will be discussed tomorrow. If agreement is reached on all the names, then they will be made public. Otherwise, some of the names will be announced, and the others after going to Gaza and Jericho. [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, reports mention that the Palestine National Council [PNC] will soon meet in Gaza to strike off the National Charter provisions on Israel. What do you have to say to this? [Sha'th] This is one of the matters brother President Yasir 'Arafat and Minister Peres had agreed upon. What is important is the the PNC meeting in Gaza will be an important meeting because it will bestow more legitimacy on the new Palestinian authority and will discuss many issues, and most certainly the PLO's commitments vis-a-vis the reciprocal recognition that took place last September. [Mu'addi] When do you expect the PNC to meet? [Sha'th] I do not expect it to meet before the Palestinian National Authority is firmly established on the ground and there is a real beginning of work, and complete security. I do not expect this to take place very soon. [Mu'addi] Major General Amnon Shahaq communicated to you Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's request concerning Mr. Yasir 'Arafat's commitment to the agreement in light of the recent statements in Johannesburg? [Sha'th] The truth is that there is an ongoing dialogue between us. It goes without saying that President 'Arafat abides by this agreement which he himself signed in Cairo on 4 May. He has no intention not to abide by what he has committed himself to. I believe that the Palestinian National Authority will certainly reemphasize the Palestinian side's abidance by this agreement. [Mu'addi] Has Mr. 'Arafat replied to Mr. Rabin's request in this respect? [Sha'th] The truth is that there are psychological and political matters in politics. I do not believe that what is requested is political, meaning that the one who signs an agreement abides by it. If he does not abide by his first signature, how can he be asked for another signature? The question is one of confidence. I believe there can be no doubt as to President 'Arafat's commitment to this agreement. President 'Arafat does not need a new piece of paper. If there is no confidence, then to what extent can one trust the new piece of paper? I believe the question is purely psychological. President 'Arafat is committed to what he had signed. We hope that the Israeli side is too. I hope that we would not wage this battle of statements. If one wages such a battle, then there are many statements by the Israeli side which one cannot accept as an expression of good intention about maintaining this agreement and its other requirements. I specifically have in mind Mr. [Yosi] Sarid's statements on President 'Arafat as mayor of Jericho municipality. This is something that is not in line with the agreement that President 'Arafat and Prime Minister Rabin had signed. I hope that this period of no confidence will be brief and that we all prove on the ground that we are completely serious in our commitment to all that we have signed and that we wish to proceed forward because this agreement is a transitional agreement, and we want to complete it by many other stages until we reach the definitive peace agreement that will set the bases of just and lasting peace among our two people. [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, one last question: Is 10 June the date when Mr. 'Yasir 'Arafat will arrive in the self-rule area? [Sha'th] This is what we will discover tommorrow in the meeting in Tunis, God willing. [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, member of the Palestinian Authority, thank you.
