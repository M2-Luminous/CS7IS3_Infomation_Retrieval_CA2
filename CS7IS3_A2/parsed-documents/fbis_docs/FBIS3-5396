The U.S. imperialists' current step to deploy Apache helicopters, which are known to be the main offensive helicopters of the U.S. Army, is part of arms buildup maneuvers intended for a northward invasion, and is very alarming [simsangchi anta]. Just as the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks is at hand, the U.S. imperialists are running wild with arms buildup maneuvers intended for a northward invasion. This clearly shows that they have no faithfulness [sinui] and sincerity as a dialogue partner and are continually creating disturbances [changae] in DPRK-U.S. talks.
