The KSS Central Committee also approved the party's electoral manifesto, the submitted KSS slate of candidates for the parliamentary elections, and the election staff. KSS Chairman V. Dado will be the Communists' main leader in the coming elections. The meeting also dealt with cadre issues--M. Zozulak, J. Sevc, and Anton Porubsky were elected KSS deputy chairmen--and assessed some aspects of domestic and foreign policy. The KSS Central Committee resolutely protests against Zbigniew Brzezinski's call that nuclear weapons be used against the DPRK if necessary. It regards Russia's pressure actions and the U.S. efforts to impose an embargo as interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign state.
