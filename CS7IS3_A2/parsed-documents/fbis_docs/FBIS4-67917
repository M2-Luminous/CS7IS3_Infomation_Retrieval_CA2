The chemicals were smuggled into Iraq through a ``neighbouring'' third country, according to the statement received here by AFP which did not identify the country. The truck drivers ``admitted during questioning'' they were trying to transport the chemicals through Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq to regions controlled by the Iraqi central government.
