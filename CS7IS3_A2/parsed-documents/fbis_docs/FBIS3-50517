The market basket includes 20 pounds of rice, 20 pounds of sugar, six bars of soap, 10 pounds of beans, and a gallon of oil. The article reports that workers earn between 600 and 900 cordobas per month. According to Ronaldo Rodriguez, president of the enterprise's board of directors, El Caracol sells 130,000 to 170,000 pounds of grain per month, and has set a goal of 200,000 pounds for December. Managua BARRICADA of 6 December 1993 on page 14 reports that the footwear factory Rolter will be shut down temporarily due to financial problems caused by smuggling and taxes. Assistant Manager Francisco Lacayo explains that the factory cannot compete with smugglers who pay no import tax while the factory is forced to pay a 17-percent sales tax to Managua City Hall. Lacayo says that the tax is "excessively high" for a product which is included in the basic market basket. According to the article, the enterprise's 240 workers, most of whom are single mothers, understand the factory "is going through hard times" and hope that it will reopen in a few months.
