The money falls under the Community's Cohesion Financial Instrument, an interim measure in place until the beginning of November, when the Maastricht Treaty and its Cohesion Fund legislation are due to come into force. Of the six projects approved, four are to treat or supply water while the others are road projects linked to plans for the Trans European Networks. The latest Cohesion Fund projects for Portugal, all of which will receive 85% EC funding of their total costs, come after the European Commission approved a first batch on July 29. The largest of the environmental projects, due to attract 21.6 mEcus [million ECU] from the Community, involves the building of three plants, at Gondar, Rabada and Agra, to treat industrial and domestic waste water in the Ave river basin. A second, due for 5.1 mEcus EC aid, is to improve water supplies to most of the towns in the Barlavento (Algarve). EC funds of 4.6 mEcus will go toward an upgrade of water treatment capacity at the ETA Asseiceira while a further 11.4 mEcus will part-fund water supply projects to places including Vila Nova da Barquinha and ConstEncia. Cohesion Funds are intended to help Greece, Spain, Portugal and Ireland, the Community's poorest countries, to improve their transport and environmental infrastructure as a means to bring their economies closer to the convergence criteria required for European Economic and Monetary Union. This year, the first in the seven-year programme, available funds total 1.565 billion Ecus, of which Portugal is to get a 16-20% share. The aid is in addition to that granted under the Community's Structural Fund programmes.
