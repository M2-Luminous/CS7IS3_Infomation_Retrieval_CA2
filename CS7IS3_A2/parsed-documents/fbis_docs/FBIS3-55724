He noted that the elections to the new Russian parliament were held at a dramatic period of the country's life. Their main result is that they have laid a good foundation for national concord. Ivanchenko said that more than 58 million people had taken part in the elections. As a result, the country got a new constitution. All the parties and movements have expressed their readiness to create a new parliamentary system. The elections were held for the first time in Russia according to the proportional system. They refuted the view of some sceptics that elections in Russia could be held only according to the majority system. Ivanchenko noted the openness and glasnost of the election campaign. The Central Election Commission was able to guarantee equal rights and opportunities to each of the 13 registered election unions. "The elections were monitored for the first time by international observers. More than one thousand of them came to Russia for that purpose," Ivanchenko stated. "The Election Commission had accomplished a huge amount of work during a very short space of time," he added. Ivanchenko noted that only 150 complaints and appeals were received by the Central Election Commission after the voting, and that they were all carefully studied and corresponding measures were taken. He said that there was no doubt that the elections were absolutely legitimate. Ivanchenko also stated that the financial activities of all the election unions were now being checked and the results would be published. The vice-chairman of the Central Election commission said that 144 deputies were elected to the State Duma of the Federal assembly (parliament), including 225 in federal constituencies from parties and movements, and 219 -- in single-mandate constituencies. He recalled that no elections were held on the territory of the Chechen Republic due to the stand assumed by its leadership. No elections were held also in several constituencies of Tatarstan. Six seats are yet to be filled in the State Duma. Ivanchenko said that the newly-elected deputies of the Duma included people of 32 nationalities. More than one-third of the deputies have scientific degrees or titles. Representatives from presidential structures account for about five per cent of all the Duma members. The State Duma includes 68 former people's deputies of the Russian Federation, 32 of whom were elected in single-mandate constituencies. Ivanchenko dwelt also on shortcomings of the present election system. He stressed that the electoral legislation should be improved.
