Venizelos stressed that this is the unanimous view of all political party leaders; it was expressed at a meeting under President Konstandinos Karamanlis on 10 May 1993. Venizelos added: These positions are firm and our permanent representative Ambassador Zafiropoulos will convey them to NATO. We hope that a diplomatic solution to end this bloody war will be found, that is, an immediate and viable solution. Answering another question, Venizelos said Greece is not willing to veto a decision on military operations because, as he explained, the international common view would see Greece as part of the Yugoslav crisis. The spokesman concluded: On the contrary, the international community should realize that our country is a factor of stability in the Balkans.
