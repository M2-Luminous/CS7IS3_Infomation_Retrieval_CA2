The current meeting studied the implementation of the spirit of the meeting of the Central Commission for Political Science and Law and the national conference of discipline inspection and supervision organs, and made arrangements for the province's anticorruption struggle in the next stage. The meeting also adopted the report on the achievements made in the past 10 months of the anticorruption struggle throughout the province. According to statistics, during that period, procuratorial organs at all levels throughout the province accepted 687 economic criminal cases for prosecution, of which 208 were embezzlement and bribe taking cases, constituting 40 percent of the cases filed for investigation and prosecution. Of the 687 economic criminal cases accepted, 145 were major cases involving more than 10,000 yuan in funds, and 34 were important cases involving cadres at the county and departmental levels and above. Compared with the previous year, the number of cases filed for investigation and prosecution and the number of major and important cases doubled and redoubled. This shows that phased achievements have been made in the anticorruption struggle. The meeting held that although some achievements have been made in the province's anticorruption struggle, there are still many problems. Their main manifestations are that the development of the anticorruption struggle is imbalanced; there is a gap of understanding among leading cadres; and because laws are not enforced strictly and no effective measures are taken to fight corruption, the investigation and prosecution of cases proceed slowly. [passage omitted] Provincial party Secretary Yin Kesheng and Deputy Secretary Cai Zhulin delivered speeches one after another. [passage omitted] In their speeches, they particularly urged cadres of the discipline inspection and supervision organs, as well as cadres and functionaries of political-legal organs, to enforce laws impartially by removing barriers and obstructions, to promote the province's work in all fields of endeavor with the victories scored in the anticorruption struggle, keep the spirits of the masses of people high through the anticorruption struggle, and strive to elevate the province's work in all fields to a new level.
