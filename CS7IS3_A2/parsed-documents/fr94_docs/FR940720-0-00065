FR940720-0-00065 FR940720-0-00006 I. Insubstantial Errors The final rulemaking for the regulation of reformulated and conventional gasoline contained a number of errors, ambiguities, and misrepresentations of Agency intent which are being addressed by this direct final rule. Of these errors, many are minor in both form and effect. The minor errors do not require detailed discussions since they all have at most a negligible effect on compliance with the regulations, and require only simple corrections. Such minor errors took the form of typographical errors, grammatical errors, inadvertent omissions, and inadvertent insertions. The table below lists all the insubstantial errors that are being corrected in this direct final rule. Other errors are more substantial. The more substantial errors and the associated corrections have been discussed on an item-by-item basis in the following sections. ␣ 1Identification code 1Regulation reference 1Correction A 80.41(h)(2)(iii) Correct the paragraph reference from 80.101(g) to 80.101(h).
