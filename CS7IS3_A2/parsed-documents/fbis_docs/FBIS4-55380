"It is in Slovakia's interest that the government which will emerge from the parliamentary elections in Hungary be communicative, ready for constructive dialogue, with a realistic approach to resolving bilateral questions and to developing relations between the two countries," the press release says. "The Slovak Foreign Ministry believes that the new Hungarian Government will continue in the political and social changes it has started and its foreign policy will stem from rational positions," the release concludes. The tension in the Bratislava-Budapest relations has eased somewhat after Jozef Moravcik's new government was appointed on March 16. He acknowledged his willingness to conduct a dialogue with his counterpart Peter Boross, and Boross's rivals Gyula Horn and Gabor Kuncze. Bratislava hopes that it will conclude with the new Hungarian Government the basic state treaty on inviolability of border which Budapest has so far refused, making the treaty conditional on extending the rights of ethnic Hungarians.
