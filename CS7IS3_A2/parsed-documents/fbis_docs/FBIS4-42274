On Friday [27 May], the third trading session after the religious holiday, the Turkish lira [TL] firmed to 31,000 against the U.S. dollar, after Thursday's close of 32,000. It was traded at 33,000 on Wednesday. The lira has recovered by 22.5 percent since April 7 when the lira/dollar parity peaked at 40,000. Its losses against the dollar have amounted to 82.3 percent this year. Thousands of individuals lined up in front of bank branches from 4 a.m. Thursday to buy three-month government papers carrying an annual compound rate of 406 percent. The three-month net rate on the same Treasury bills was an all-time high 50 percent, compared with only 32.5 percent in the previous auction. All of the TL20 trillion papers were sold out by 2.30 p.m. on Friday, Treasury sources said. The Treasury will make payments worth TL58 trillion during June to finance domestic debt repayments and public sector salaries. In 31 different auctions, it has raised a total of TL34.511 trillion this year, but cancelled nine auctions. Following a government decision to cover all savings deposits under full state insurance, the banks have tended to raise both deposit and lending rates. Presently, annual rates on three-month, six-month, and one-year accounts range from 135 to 160 percent. Experts say the banks have been flooded with fresh funds after the decision. "After the government gave assurances on savings deposits, the deposit volume has doubled," said Ismet Alver, general manager of Tekstilbank. Bankers said high rates will be maintained as long as the Treasury remains short of cash and the monetary authorities insist on defending the national currency with the interest instrument. "We shall work with high rates for some time to come. Otherwise, money will flow into foreign currencies, pushing up the exchange rates," said Hamit Belli, board chairman and chief executive officer at the private-owned Turkish Bank. During a summit Thursday, held under the auspices of the Turkish Banks Association, the banks did not reach a gentlemen's agreement on interest rates. "We postponed talks to an unknown date. There was no agreement as to what the interest rate ceiling should be," said one banker who attended the summit. Businessmen are worried. "The latest rates on Treasury bills are incredible and may create endless fear. This will worsen the economic crisis," said a statement from Atalay Sahinoglu, chairman of the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce (ITO). He pointed out that the Treasury came forward with the 400 percent interest rate exactly on the day when the bankers had gathered to discuss a reduction in interest rates. "This is ignorance," Sahinoglu said. There were reports from the Istanbul Chamber of Industry that capacity utilization in the manufacturing industry dived from 82.5 percent in April 1993 to 69.9 percent in April this year.
