[Seminario] Our institute is doing two kinds of investigations. First, we have the projects for the development of applied technologies, which provide for various techniques for testing several materials. These investigations are being made at the Nuclear Research Center of Peru. [Alegria] How are those projects financed? [Seminario] Financing comes from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), while IPEN professionals participate in the development of projects. The duration of the projects is generally two to three years. [Alegria] What are the applications of that research? [Seminario] It is very important to emphasize that the work has biomedical, agricultural, and industrial uses. The results provide techniques that can be used by economic agents in general, and are a clear example of the transfer of technology. [Alegria] What other type of research is IPEN doing? [Seminario] There are other projects, with various objectives. Among them is the project for food irradiation technology, in which we are receiving international technical cooperation. [Alegria] Is IAEA cooperating in this project? [Seminario] Right. IAEA has provided the equipment, which consists of a source of cobalt 60 (a material that emits gamma radiation) and the electromechanical part. The equipment, worth $1.5 million, is about to arrive in Peru. [Alegria] When will project operations start? [Seminario] We are now building a special facility -- 60 percent of the construction has already been completed -- that is necessary for the installation of the equipment. We estimate that construction will end in four months. [Alegria] And when will the plant begin operating? [Seminario] By the end of the year, because installation of the equipment will take four months. Russian technicians will come for this purpose. It will then be possible to use gamma rays for food preservation. [Alegria] What will be the specific applications of the project? [Seminario] The plant will have two main uses. First, it will serve to extend the shelf life of food by inhibiting deterioration (thus permitting transportation and exportation of food). On the other hand, it will be used for the decontamination of vegetables (eliminating microorganisms, fungi, and bacteria). I want to emphasize that this plant will also serve to exhibit the technology of the field and prove the profitability of nuclear activities. There are many privately owned plants like this around the world. [Alegria] What will be the main economic repercussions of this project? [Seminario] This technology will permit major progress in the manipulation of food, and this will expand the supply of exportable farm products. This technique has actually been used, at a laboratory level, for the past four years. Unfortunately, the scale at which we can operate is limited because of the small size of our equipment. [Alegria] What specific work has been done? [Seminario] For example, decontamination of carmine dye for export. As you know, this product is obtained from an insect (cochineal), which is found in tuna. The insect has some "natural" contamination that has to be eliminated in order to access international markets. We have also treated lucuma [local Peruvian tree] flour, cacao, and even murex capsules. [Alegria] That is, relations with the private sector have already been established... [Seminario] Right, and they are quite good. Our facilities are also used by the chemical and pharmaceutical industries for the preservation of raw materials (which are very sensitive), and for the sterilization of products for surgical use. Nuclear sterilization (or radio sterilization) has great potential, because this method is more advantageous than the others. There are currently more than 150 nuclear plants providing this service throughout the world. [Alegria] Is irradiation for preserving food also widely accepted? [Seminario] Of course. In 1983 a special committee consisting of FAO, WHO, and IAEA specialists recommended this for the preservation of food. From that time on, every country has been studying specific cases to establish its own dosages. [Alegria] IPEN recently signed several agreements with Concytec [National Science and Technology Council]. Are any of the agreements related to food preservation? [Seminario] Yes. We believe this technology can provide concrete solutions to the country's food problem. The current loss of harvested food is over 30 percent, and this percentage could be reduced by nuclear irradiation. We should understand that it is more difficult to create new agricultural zones than to prevent part of the harvested food from being lost. We are talking about practical solutions. For example, in the case of fish, the irradiation technology can be applied as a complement to other conservation techniques to ease transportation. [Alegria] What will the agreement with Concytec consist of? [Seminario] It will serve to complete the laboratory equipment, and to carry out the research, development, and dissemination of the project. [Alegria] What is the professional level of the people working in the IPEN? [Seminario] Two training programs have been carried out since the institution was created. The first was carried out in this country, and the second involved a training period in Argentina. We had a full staff in 1988, and from that time the training has been constant. We have given master's degree courses at Peruvian universities. Agreements have been signed with the Engineering and San Marcos Universities for the implementation of postgraduate courses in nuclear engineering and nuclear chemistry. In sum, I can say that our capability and experience put us in a good position within the Latin American context. [Alegria] What is the importance of science and technology at the international level? [Seminario] Very important. The UN Development Program (UNDP) has adopted the issue of scientific and technological progress and the modernization of the productive sector as one of the priority issues for the 1992-1996 period. This issue was adopted as a result of concerted action by Latin American countries, which have recognized the urgent need to develop their own science and technology, to increase production and competition and to reach the levels of the developed countries. [Alegria] Finally, what are the prospects for the use of nuclear energy in industry? [Seminario] Since nuclear fission was discovered 50 years ago, the application to industry of the energy liberated by this process is so large that there is no area of the technological field that has not been experimented with. Its application has therefore benefited man at the industrial level.
