The government's chief negotiator, Mr. Roelf Meyer, said a single ballot paper was the sole option in view of the extent of voter illiteracy and uncertainty. During his talks with President F.W. de Klerk yesterday, King Goodwill Zwelithini of the Zulus repeated that separate ballot papers were a condition for the Zulu participation in the election. The question will be high on the agenda when the Freedom Alliance holds talks with the government and the ANC [African National Congress] tomorrow.
