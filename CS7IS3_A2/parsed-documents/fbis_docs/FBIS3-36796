Repeated written requests from the Finance Ministry for the debts to radio enterprises to be repaid remain nothing but scraps of paper. As a result of the communication enterprises' inability to pay for electricity and other materials, radio centers in Kamchatka, Kalinigrad and other areas have been cut off. Most of Russia's radio and television enterprises are on the verge of stoppage. Unless the demands of communication workers are met, from 10 February only the transmission of morning and evening information programs from Ostankino and the All-Russian State Radio and Television Company will be provided.
