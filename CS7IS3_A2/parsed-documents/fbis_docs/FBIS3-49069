They also shelled the area with Maljutka missiles. The Ustashas used all artillery pieces to shell Gornji Vakuf, while they launched primitive explosive devices at Stari Vitez. Regrouping and reinforcement of Ustasha forces has been sighted in the area of Zepce. The Chetniks from Mt. Ozren are sending reinforcements to Novi Seher. The Zvornik free territory is again under fierce artillery fire from the Serbian aggressor. Yesterday, in the course of the afternoon, the remains of the once beautiful Zaseok were destroyed with tank shells fired from Klisica and the surrounding hills. This morning, the Chetniks continued their provocations against the lines of the 206th Chivalrous Brigade. Its troops are in position and are ready to resist all attacks. The autonomists' army continues its provocations in the Bihac region. Yesterday's attempt at an infantry breakthrough was decisively repelled by the 5th Corps units. Fikret's [Abdic] paramilitary is concentrating its forces which means that they are preparing a new offensive. Our army's defenders are ready for it. In the Seven South Operative Group zone of responsibility, the enemy today targeted civilian targets in Maglaj and provoked the defense lines of the independent Tesanj Battalion. New forces are being brought in toward the region of Novi Seher, which means that new attacks are in preparation. What particularly worries the 120,000 citizens and refugees in the area is the lack of food, medicine, and energy. In the Second Operative Group zone of responsibility, the Serbian aggressor has intensified artillery activity. The enemy is targeting the free territories of Doboj and Gracanica. This morning he attempted an infantry breakthrough that was decisively repelled by the 109th Doboj Brigade.
