This announcement was made by President Carlos Menem during the 27 January cabinet meeting at Government House. The head of state informed his ministers that Scopa is stepping down from his post to become SIDE Secretary Hugo Anzorregui's aide as of 1 February. The president reportedly told Scopa: "I am grateful to him for continuing to work and cooperate in this government department." As Media Secretary then reported, Scopa attended the cabinet meeting in lieu of Anzorregui in his absence. National Security The government on 27 January made clear that governors will have to sit on "the National Security Council as permanent members as they request joining the council." This information was provided in a decree issued by the Executive Branch and published in the OFFICIAL GAZETTE on 27 January. The decree clarifies the invitation made to governors in Article 11 of the law on national security (24059). The decree added that in the current National Security Council "it is possible to notice that governors have not been expressly incorporated in the council as members. It is totally incompatible with the spirit and letter of the Constitution that provincial governors -- or government ministers, if power is delegated to them -- have not been requested to sit on the National Security Council while provincial police chiefs are already full members of it."
