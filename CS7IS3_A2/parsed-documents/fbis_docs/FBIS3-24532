Solid-phase immunoenzyme studies showed that native Rm-III reacted with the antibodies with and I[.sup]50[/] of 1.4 x 10E-9 M. Inhibition studies involving the anti-Rm-III antibodies and related toxins with diminishing homologies with Rm-III yielding showed a rise in I[.sup]50[/] to 3.7 x 10E-6 M for the least homologous toxin. Correlation of the immunochemical findings with amino acid sequences showed that the epitopes of the homologous toxins share identical structural dispositions that encompass amino acids at positions 2, 11, 20, 28 and 46-48.
