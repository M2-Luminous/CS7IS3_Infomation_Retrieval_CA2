Zieleniec, currently in Paris attending a two-day conference on the stability pact which opened today, said that the conference's final resolution would call on Central and East European states to do so tomorrow. Zieleniec explained that the Czech Republic had similar agreements will all its neighboring countries and their inclusion in the pact was voluntary. He protested against the Western countries' apparent tendency to present the crisis in the former Yugoslavia as the reason for holding the conference. "I see it as a great simplification where Sarajevo serves as an argument and simultaneously the talk is about the Czech Republic. This logic has no place in Central European political thinking," Zieleniec said. However, the wording of the final resolution is generally acceptable, he told journalists. Positive changes were to a great extent initiated by the Czech Republic which emphasized that "economic cooperation was a pillar of good relations and roundtable discussions should include economic cooperation," Zieleniec said. Regional roundtable discussions should follow up the Paris conference resolutions and result in the conclusion of bilateral and multilateral agreements on good neighborly relations in different regions, Zieleniec said. So far six regions have been proposed, among them Central Europe and the Baltic. Zieleniec said discussions should embrace not only borders and ethnic groups but also regional cooperation, economic cooperation and free trade. Attempts were apparent at the conference that representatives of minorities participate in these discussions as well. This demand was raised by Hungarians living in Romania and Hungary supported it, Zieleniec said, considering it unlikely that the conference would agree with this. He went on to say that the stability pact was not a pact in the legal sense or an international norm, but a "political process which is acceptable and natural." The Czech Republic's attitude is reflected to a great extent in the words of the former presidential office head Karel Schwarzenberg published by today's French paper LE FIGARO who said that in the part of Europe to which the stability pact would apply "prejudices are deeply rooted and feelings have deep historical connections." The conference organizers are not familiar with the problems in this part of Europe, Schwarzenberg said. They did not realize either that discussing "our intimate problems" could result in the "opening of new Pandora's box." "Can you imagine a roundtable discussion in a Basque-inhabited region in France dealing with Basque and Irish problems in France, Spain, Britain and Ireland indulgently observed by Czechs and Americans?" asks Schwarzenberg in the paper, and replies with a definite "No."
