Russia favours a "common and single position of the world community" on this problem, Demurin said. He believes such position should include "clear benchmarks and determination for ensuring the implementation of the adopted decisions," as well as "reflect the will of the international community to meet the rightful interests of all sides involved in the settlement which are moving along the path of peace." He stressed that "there should be no doubts about the ultimate goal." in his view, it is important for Russia, the United States, the European Union, the United Nations and all other concerned countries to have a "common and clear-cut position." "Seeing the prospects for political settlement and having a clear vision of what the post-war future of the countries that emerged on the territory of the former Yugoslavia should be, one can make decisions on intermediate steps," Demurin said. He warned, however, that such steps, if taken without clear understanding of the consequences, may be harmful for the settlement process in the former Yugoslavia. Demurin described as "allegations" statements by today's newspaper IZVESTIYA that the Russian Foreign Ministry's position on the Bosnian crisis has allegedly not been supported by President Boris Yeltsin and is now being reworked. He stressed that "these allegations are far from the foreign policy and the essence of Russia's foreign policy initiatives." He noted that there are "no disagreements, let alone contradictions" between the president and the Foreign Ministry.
