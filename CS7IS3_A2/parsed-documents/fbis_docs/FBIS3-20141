At least, this is indicated by all signs from the government and almost all political parties on the pseudo-dilemma: whether our soldiers will go to Bosnia. Let us look at the problem first. The United Nations damaged its prestige and called on Turkey, the pseudo-ambassador of peace--and not only "Attila" [nickname of Turkish forces in northern Cyprus]--to protect Bosnia with its arms, so it says. As all the countries appear unwilling to put blue helmets on their soldiers, the willingness of Ankara comes...perfectly dressed. Therefore, the United Nations and all who really dictate its decisions put aside principles in its best interest, as they interpret it. On the contrary, Turkey is not damaging its principles. Turkey's principles are identical to its interests. Weapons and force are basic aspects of its principles; they are aspects that describe its historical identity. They have always been its tools for...imposing the peace. Consequently, Turkey is faithful to its history. Our country has its own principles: in some cases, it would have been better if it had not had them. Greece's most important principle is its commitment to peace. It is a principle that has never been decorated with the...accessory of arms. Of course, our country has interests, too. However, common sense does not find any interest that would be served by our engagement in Bosnia. What could be the purpose of an even peaceful Greek presence there that would also be dangerous? On the contrary, our presence under blue helmets in Bosnia would legalize the Turkish presence in the Balkans. Therefore, our country does not have any conflict of interests and principles that would tempt it to put them aside for once.... Consequently? Consequently, there is no dilemma. There is an opportunity to transform our diplomacy and change the international climate that wants Greece to be Europe's black sheep. If the international community cannot see the bull that pounces on the Balkan glass shop, it is in need of an eye doctor. The responsibility for what will follow will be passed by history onto those who ignored it and opened the door to "Attila," who this time is on a blue-helmeted bull.
