These events, however, have turned out to be a public relations fiasco for Beijing and failed to score any political points in the tussle with the British to win the hearts of the Hong Kong people. Mr Lu, the director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, led a delegation of almost 200 Beijing appointees in Hong Kong to visit the People's Liberation Army (PLA) stationed in Guangdong. This could have been an excellent occasion for the Chinese military to polish up its image, tarnished by its role in the crackdown of the pro-democracy movement in Tiananmen Square five years ago. The audience was by and large a compliant one. Combat skills aside, the army could have easily left an impression that they were highly disciplined and civilised. But Xinhua chose to veto all applications by the Hong Kong media to cover the trip, the first of its kind focusing on the training of the PLA to be deployed in Hong Kong after 1997. The official reason for the news agency's ruling was that the tour would involve some military secrets. That feeble excuse was even challenged by some of the guests. A delegate to the National People's Congress, Miss Liu Yiuchu, for instance, pointed out that there were foreign passport-holders among those advisers on the invitation list. She argued that there was no reason why foreign citizens should be allowed, while the Hong Kong press had to be denied access. Xinhua was unable to come up with a sensible explanation. Given the significance of the event, Hong Kong journalists opted to neglect the reporting guidelines set by the State Council and tried their luck anyway. To their surprise, the two main pro-China dailies in Hong Kong and the Guangdong Television Station were permitted to cover the event. The television footage on the company's demonstration shown on the local channels was, in fact, copied from the Guangdong station. Despite the reporters' technically illegal status, Mr Zhang Junsheng, the Xinhua spokesman, chose to make public comments about the merits of the PLA and their need for more contact with the public through the eager Hong Kong press. This makes a complete mockery of the Chinese authorities' rules on Hong Kong reporters' activities on the mainland. Only a few days before, other Chinese functionaries, such as Mr Wang Fengchao and Sun Nansheng, declared that it was necessary to weed out illegal reporting by the Hong Kong media. The way the NCNA handled the tour has further alienated the local news media. This incident came within a couple of weeks of more than 1,300 journalists signing a petition, demanding China respect the freedom of the press. And another 130-odd reporters on the China beat further pledged to boycott freebies offered by official Chinese units for a month. The display of the PLA's military might was followed by an auspicious ceremony to mark the Bank of China's admission to the exclusive club of banknote-issuing institutions in Hong Kong. The issuing of $3 billion worth of BOC notes does not carry substantial financial implications, but the move symbolises Beijing's increasing presence in the territory. It serves as the most visible reminder of the coming of China, before the five-star bauhinia flag for the future Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is raised on July 1, 1997. Many note collectors were disappointed when the bank announced that some of the new banknotes with lucky number sequences were withheld for a charity auction. A press release by the bank described the distribution of the new notes to its customers on the first day as orderly. However, it has emerged that only an estimated 500 of the 12,000 sets for collectors managed to reach the bank's branch offices for public consumption. Many of those with lucky sequence numbers had been reserved reportedly for the bank's own employees and its major accounts. This serves a reminder to residents of the prevalence of nepotism within the Chinese bureaucracy. Mr Lu, who heads the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, attended both the occasions. It does not appear to be the case that he is insensitive to press coverage. He was seen reading a pile of local dailies, in both Chinese and English, before starting the proceedings of the economics sub-group of the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) yesterday. It has thus remained unexplained why he was so determined to dodge not only protesters but also the press, during the first two days of his visit. It was only on his third day in the territory that he agreed to make a brief statement in front of the cameras, saying that the Hong Kong Government's unfriendly attitude towards the PWC was to blame for his refusal to meet the Governor. Public opinion is clearly sympathetic to the Governor, as residents are keen to see the two top officials resume direct dialogue. Mr Lu was probably speaking the truth when he noted that it would not be productive even if he were to meet Mr Patten at this stage, while official Sino-British relations are so sour. Yet this has reflected badly on his colleagues, who earlier justified his snubbing the Governor on the grounds that Mr Lu was too busy and that he was not wearing his hat as the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office's director. His first few lines in Hong Kong reinforced the widespread impression that official Chinese spokesmen, including those from both the Foreign Ministry, Xinhua and Mr Lu's own office, cannot be taken too seriously.
