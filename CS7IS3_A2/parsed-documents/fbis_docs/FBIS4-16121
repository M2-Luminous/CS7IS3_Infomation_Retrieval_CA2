Republic's Second-Largest City Threatened by Major Armenian Offensive"] [Text] According to an Azerbaijan Defense Ministry report, in the past few days Armenian troops have launched a large-scale offensive in northeastern Nagorno-Karabakh, involving a great number of tanks and armored personnel carriers. Although the Defense Ministry still claims that the Azerbaijani troops have been able to withstand the onslaught of the Armenian forces, your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent has learned from confidential sources that the Armenian troops have advanced a few kilometers toward the district capital of Geranboy (Shaumyan -- NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA) adjoining the Agderin (Mardakert -- NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA) district of Nagorno- Karabakh. It is well known that the Geranboy district, which was recaptured by Azerbaijan in a successful offensive in summer 1992, is strategically important as a town located in direct proximity to Azerbaijan's second-largest city, Gyandzha. The district's possible capture by Armenian troops would, therefore, pose a real threat to Gyandzha. Observers in Baku point to the fact that the Armenian troops' offensive on the Gyandzha axis was launched right after Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan paid a visit to Moscow 8 April in an atmosphere of strictest secrecy. According to reports from sources in the Azerbaijan leadership, during his talks with Russian leaders Ter-Petrosyan spoke about the possibility of exerting military pressure on Baku so that it will soften its stance on Russia's peace plan for Nagorno-Karabakh. The plan, which, among other things, calls for Russian troops to be brought to Azerbaijan as peacekeeping forces, was spurned by the Baku authorities as violating the republic's sovereignty. In addition, Baku was somewhat worried by Russian President Boris Yeltsin's edict on setting up Russian military bases on the CIS countries' territory. Azerbaijan Defense Minister Mamedrafi Mamedov has stated that "none of external forces will manage to impose on Azerbaijan the deployment of foreign bases on the republic's territory." Thus, on the eve of the meeting of the Council of CIS Heads of State, scheduled to take place in Moscow 15 April, a fairly critical situation is coming about in relations between Baku and Yerevan, and a certain tension is felt in Russian-Azerbaijani relations. To all appearances, Azerbaijani leader Geydar Aliyev will try to draw his CIS partners' attention to the stepping up of hostilities on Azerbaijani territory by the Armenian troops.
