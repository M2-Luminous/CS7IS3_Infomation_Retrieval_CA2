A member of the TEC Management Committee, Mr. Mac Maharaj, said there was concern about the way in which Home Affair Minister Danie Schutte had granted temporary licenses to 15 radio stations. He proposed that the TEC authorize the management committee to create a substructure to advise it on a process of short-listing applicants to the Independent Broadcasting Authority.
