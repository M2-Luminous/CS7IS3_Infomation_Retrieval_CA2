Up to 40,000 young officers leave the army each year. Understaffing of officers (especially young officers) has reached a critical point: .2 percent is the margin separating the army from a loss of combat readiness. Manning levels for enlisted men and sergeants are at just 54 percent. Army losses outside of combat zones stood at nearly 2,500 men in 1993, which is nearly 500 lives more than in 1992. The Defense Ministry could lose control of the Russian Army in the near future. If this happens, General Grachev will be issuing orders only within the bounds of the "Arbat Military District"--the complex of General Staff buildings on the Arbat. The situation is beyond belief. Boris Yeltsin, continuing the tradition of talking about the most important issues far away from official podiums, unveiled upcoming plans for army reform at a meeting with Suvorov School cadets. "The task of invigorating military reform has been posed. It is now possible to act more decisively and more consistently," said the president. The Russian Army will use a new principle to defend us--a mobile defense reminiscent of the American "flexible response strategy." Instead of unbroken defense along our borders, for which there is no longer enough manpower or money, we will have compact mobile groups trained to fight local wars. They will be the first line in the event of a "big" war. However, Russia is embarking on a very complex reform with a Defense Ministry that has already demonstrated its utter inability to carry out reforms. In the two years since the creation of the Russian Defense Ministry, faith in democratic reforms in the army has been totally undermined. And the ministry leadership has managed to turn against itself not only officers, but also its own people. Hazing has become so bad in units, on ships, and even at schools that desertion has reached massive proportions. Youths avoid military commissariats like the plague. This was discussed at a recent conference entitled "Army and Society" in Moscow. After its harsh army conscription of students at vocational-technical schools, technicums, and commercial higher schools in the fall of 1993, the Defense Ministry, according to some reports, is already thinking about abolishing student conscription because the educational institutions failed to produce significant numbers of recruits. Ideological control over the Armed Forces has now been lost. On February 23, as they observed the anniversary of the Red Army's creation, probably very few officers recalled that on May 7, by order of the first Russian president, the Russian Army was formed. After abolishing political agencies by Order No. 15 of January 12, 1994, the military leadership set no new ideological priorities, without which, unfortunately, our army cannot yet function. The Defense Ministry didn't even try to revive the traditions of the Russian officer corps. The resulting vacuum has willingly been filled by "patriots"--the newspaper ZAVTRA, with the disclosures of an anonymous general on the events of October, was read in some units until it had holes in it. Two years too late, Pavel Grachev remembered the Orthodox Church, on which the Russian Army was based before the revolution. It will probably be another two years before concrete decisions are formulated and chaplains appear in the units. The armed forces leadership has also failed to protect the army from corruption. The following is from a letter from armed forces and war veterans (!) to President Yeltsin: At a time when the state has no way to promptly pay its soldiers, more than 20 billion rubles in public funds appropriated to the military insurance company (Reserve Colonel S. A. Tsikolyuk, president) to be used to provide servicemen with life and disability insurance, by order of Grachev and Vorobyev, were channeled to commercial structures through the Menatep Bank at an interest rate of 240 percent. No one knows who is distributing that interest and for what army needs. Of the proceeds from sale of property belonging to the Western Group of Forces, less than 15 percent has been allocated to finance construction, purchase housing, and solve other social problems facing servicemen. On the other hand, millions of marks were used to buy an enormous quantity of calcium carbide, which is apparently no longer available in Russia, and various materials. Money was also found to buy a Mercedes Benz that our forces urgently need. After the breakup of the USSR, we ended up with third-echelon forces. And the most combat-ready units were left behind in the ex-Soviet republics. Great hopes were pinned on the divisions being withdrawn from Germany, but they became drawn into commerce and are returning to Russia utterly incapable of combat. Things have reached the point where Polish racketeers working the highways have established special duties for Russian military transit drivers taking cars to Russia: A Russian warrant officer pays 200 marks, an officer 400. It is said that when Soviet troop commanders moved from Hungary to Germany, the generals' plane was preceded by heavily loaded cargo planes carrying their personal property. "They took only the most essential items with them," the pilots joked. Does a person need a lot? As it turns out, yes. The cargo planes of the Western Group of Forces were so heavily loaded that the first deputy commander of the 16th Air Army was arrested and jailed. Colonel-General Burlakov, the commander in chief of the Western Group of Forces himself, was involved in one case. Inspections were of little help. What commission can withstand the temptation of German marks, let alone German women! It is said that one general who headed a rear-services commission that was inspecting the Western Group came back with syphilis--a young woman's "gift" for him. There is nothing surprising about the fact that the Western Group of Forces has become drawn into commercial activities--only command and staff exercises have been held there for some time, and the soldiers march on paper only. What is surprising is this: Just one or two cases of corruption have been made public. Yet such cases are legion. Is it any accident that Western Group of Forces Military Procurator Yuriy Yerin was recently promoted to general? Reformers have been disliked throughout history. But Pavel Grachev's unpopularity is of a quite different nature. The minister has recently been accused of selecting personnel on the basis of personal loyalty, something that has repeatedly spelled the ruin of bureaucrats of various ranks. Moreover, military personnel are extremely vulnerable to protectionism: Officers are limited in their ability to earn money, and a military career is the only thing the state can use to entice them to serve. Grachev's unpopularity with the troops has reached the point where instead of the honorable title "grandfather," which is bestowed on especially respected commanders, General of the Army Grachev is called by his first name, together with the word "Mercedes," for the car he travels in. A Russian defense minister can't ride in some Soviet Volga or Zhiguli! The whole army is discussing Pavel Grachev's recent dispatch of his son to the Western Group of Forces, contrary to his own order stating that only servicemen with previous service in "hotspots" may be sent to lucrative Germany. Senior Lieutenant Grachev flew to the Western Group of Forces just a few months before the withdrawal of our last forces from Europe. When he returns, an apartment in one of the comfortable compounds the Germans built for the Russian troops being withdrawn might await him. Such mistakes by the defense minister discredit the very idea of reform. The situation in the army is reminiscent of 1990-1991, when the unpopular premiers Pavlov and Ryzhkov attempted to reform the economy. The Russian Army is no longer combat-ready today. There is just ONE Russian missile-armed submarine on alert duty in the ocean. (The Americans have 10 or 11 submarines.) Meanwhile, according to participants in the "Army and Society" conference, all reform has been reduced to the "signing of standard contracts, new uniforms, and higher pay." A frightening process has begun in the army. District commanders no longer rely on their ministry and turn to local authorities directly for help. In this way, the army is becoming tied to regions, something that, in the event of a crisis, could break it up into component parts. The Defense Ministry is making desperate attempts to enhance its prestige. General Kondratyev, the deputy minister, suddenly becomes a diplomat and goes to Nagornyy Karabakh to extinguish the conflict. Within a few days his much-publicized mission collapses, and now Kondratyev is giving interviews in the Dniestr region. Pavel Grachev is also making his diplomatic debut, but he prefers foreign countries. In recent days the government has launched an outright war on defense appropriations. The Defense Ministry is asking for almost 60 percent of the entire state budget (almost 80 trillion rubles), saying the army could collapse. The ministry is indeed in a trap--the army has to be cut, since there is not enough money, but cuts are impossible because no money is available for the legally mandated payments and compensation either. The situation is further compounded by the fact that in this transitional period, the old military administrative division of Russia into military district has been left intact. This essentially requires that the defense budget be doubled. But the taxpayers are poor, and so reform will most likely be of a shock-therapy character. The Russian Army, it seems, will have to cross the Alps yet again. But this time without Suvorov.
