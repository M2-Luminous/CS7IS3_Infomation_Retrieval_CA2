F. Guzik, S. A. Chinenov, Taganrog Radiotechnical Institute, Russia; UDC 661.325] [Abstract] Traditional computer architectures are inadequate to solve some problems in real time and simple parallel computing is inadequate for database operations, especially when the database is large. A complete topology between processors is needed for efficient processing in real time. The ability to reconfigure memory and processors decreases the total number of iterations required to process large data files. This article examines the possibility of using a hypercube switching network to reconfigure processor elements and memory in database machines. Two hypercubes are united to form a four-dimensional hypercube. Any processor can be linked with any memory unit, and any memory unit can be linked with any other memory unit. The hypercube can be used to perform randomization, sorting, and other relational algebra operations. Figures 4; references 4: 3 Russian, 1 Western.
