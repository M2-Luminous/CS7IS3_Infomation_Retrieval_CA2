If funding is not ensured, this could cause a serious loss and affect the province's reputation and image in opening up to the world. Second, construction should be organized and coordinated properly, with attention paid to safety. Third, good preparations should be made before production starts, training should be provided to staff members and workers, rules and regulations should be formulated which conform with modern enterprise management. Fourth, production costs should be reduced by means of meticulous calculations. Fifth, all departments should provide all-out support, should give the green light, and should not engage in disputes over trifles, still less should they create difficulties. On economic development zones, Zhang Boxing said: The practice of the Xian and Weinan economic development zones has proved that hinterland areas also have the ability to build economic development zones well. The most important point is to emancipate the mind. [passage omitted]
