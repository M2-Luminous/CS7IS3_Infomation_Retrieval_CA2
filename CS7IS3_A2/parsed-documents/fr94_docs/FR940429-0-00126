ACTION: Final Regulations. SUMMARY: The Secretary amends the Student Assistance General Provisions regulations. These regulations are needed to implement statutory changes to the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended by the Student Right-to-Know and Campus Security Act (Pub. L. 101&hyph;542), the Higher Education Technical Amendments of 1991 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;26), the Higher Education Amendments of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;325), and the Higher Education Technical Amendments of 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;208). These regulations require an institution of higher education to disclose information about its campus safety policies and procedures, and statistics concerning whether certain crimes took place on campus. These regulations also make technical changes to Subpart F of the Student Assistance General Provisions regulations, which governs misrepresentation. Encouraging students to pursue high quality postsecondary education is an important element of the National Education Goals; a safe campus environment facilitates such education. EFFECTIVE DATE: These regulations take effect July 1, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Paula M. Husselmann or Kimberly L. Goto, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue, SW. (Regional Office Building 3, room 4318), Washington, DC 20202&hyph;5346. Telephone: (202) 708&hyph;7888. Individuals who use a telecommunications device for the deaf (TDD) may call the Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) at 1&hyph;800&hyph;877&hyph;8339 between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m., Eastern time, Monday through Friday. Institutions should note that some of the provisions of these regulations may relate to the provisions of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). If an institution has questions concerning FERPA, the institution should contact Ellen Campbell at (202) 732&hyph;1807. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Student Assistance General Provisions regulations implement requirements that are common to the participation of postsecondary institutions in the student financial assistance programs authorized by Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (Title IV, HEA programs). These programs include the Federal Pell Grant, Federal Stafford Loan, Federal PLUS, Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS), Federal Direct Student Loan (FDSL), State Student Incentive Grant (SSIG), Federal Perkins Loan, Federal Work-Study (FWS), Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG), Presidential Access Scholarship (PAS), and National Early Intervention Scholarship and Partnership (NEISP) programs. On July 10, 1992 and October 22, 1993 the Secretary published two notices of proposed rulemaking (NPRMs) for 34 CFR part 668 in the Federal Register (57 FR 30826&hyph;30833 and 58 FR 54902&hyph;54905, respectively). Both of these proposed regulations included a discussion of the major issues surrounding the proposed changes that will not be repeated here. The list below summarizes those issues and identifies the pages of the preambles to the NPRMs on which a discussion of those issues may be found. The final regulations to implement the Student Right-to-Know Act, proposals for which were also included in the July 10, 1992 NPRM, are not included in these regulations. With the passage of the Higher Education Amendments of 1992, and its proliferation of completion and graduation rate provisions, it became necessary to write a second NPRM regarding these rates. The Secretary expects to publish the second NPRM this year. The Secretary does not want to delay publication of final regulations regarding campus security and is, therefore, proceeding with this publication separately. As indicated above, here is a summary of proposed issues relating to crime prevention and statistical disclosure: Addition to student consumer provisions to require the disclosure of an annual security report (57 FR 30828 and 58 FR 54903); Addition of list of actual disclosures to be made (57 FR 30828 and 58 FR 54903&hyph;54904); Addition of time periods for collection of crime statistics (57 FR 30829 and 58 FR 54904, but superseded by subsequent statutory change reflected in these final regulations); and
