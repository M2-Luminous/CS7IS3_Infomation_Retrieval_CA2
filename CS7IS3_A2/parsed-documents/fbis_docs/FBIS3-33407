Thus, there now may be labor collectives full of the most diverse and well-reasoned opinions on the steps our government should take to straighten out the country's finances, yet they have given little thought to the problems, weaknesses, and errors that plague their own daily work. This seems to be a good time, then, to emphasize the importance of the first point on the agenda of the Workplace Parliament assemblies. It is none other than the economic and financial problems of each particular place. We have already observed in the initial preparatory meetings a tendency to devote less energy and time to debating internal affairs, and to pay more attention to the exchange of opinions on what the entire country should be doing. It would be a mistake to be taken in by the false notion that the second point is more important, while the first one is just a formality with no practical purpose. The financial imbalances that currently affect the national economy can only be solved by taking action on both sides of the supply-demand pair, and it is in workplaces where supply is created. It is also there, given the difference between what is spent and what is received from selling services or products, where the scale can be tipped toward one side or the other of the aforementioned pair. Thus, the most decisive measures will not be the general ones taken to eliminate the consequences of the financial imbalance, but rather those that are undertaken to eliminate the cause of it, which is basically the fact that in the past few years there has been much more money than goods circulating in the national economy. If we were to take only general measures to reduce excess demand by removing money from circulation, we would not solve the underlying problem. The real solution lies in achieving a proper balance between what is produced and what is spent at the workplace. For this reason, it would be illogical to have a brilliant discussion at an enterprise, establishment, or shop, with impressive knowledge of the cause and laudable proposals for what the country should do to improve its finances, and then to have a discussion of internal affairs that involved no pain and no gain, or rather, more pain than gain. Just as we reject the idea of a "packet of measures" hitting the entire national economy at once, with equal fervor we appeal today to all workers, to their union leaders, and to managers to draw up their plans for the economic and financial reconditioning of each unit. For this purpose, any self-respecting management should present to the assembly a true economic analysis of the operation of the workplace, including specific proposals for making improvements. This report should not be written by anyone other than the principal administrator of the unit. The purpose of the report is to spark a debate and to propose courses of action. Therefore, the kind of account that is full of incomprehensible jargon and weighed down with details that hide the essential truth, the kind that is bred naturally by incompetence, is to be avoided. These reports should avoid taking a tone of either self-pity or praise; otherwise, the assemblies would become mere recitations of calamities, or celebrations of partial success. In neither case would they address the issue of what could have been done better and what failed to be done. We caution that, from the standpoint of the workers and their union representatives, efficiency is not always indicated by the fulfillment of the plan. We know full well that there are plans that are rotten with paternalism, whose figures take into account not only limitations on raw materials, energy, and labor resources, but also major components of administrative inefficiency that we are trying to combat. It is important for workers, when discussing the first point on the agenda of the Workplace Parliament assemblies, not to allow the debate to get off track and focus on the impact other workplaces have on their own. In one of the initial meetings, we saw workers bitterly blaming the suppliers of a certain raw material, while little or nothing was said of the well-known fact that large quantities of that valuable and scarce resource tend to be lost somewhere between the warehouse and the assembly line. These discussions also must be protected from the tendency to complain about the prices that are paid for certain goods and services. Without denying that there are errors in the setting of some prices, the fact is that real efficiency is not achieved by demanding better prices, but by cutting costs. And it is precisely this issue of costs, together with the quantity and quality of production and services, that should lie at the heart of the plan to be adopted at each workplace to improve economic efficiency. It is possible that not every place will have a cost system that allows for an analysis based on the economic performance of a workplace. Therefore, the first agreement, the first measure that must be taken in these places, is precisely to create such an instrument to at least indicate the principal expenditures involved in every peso of goods produced. Beyond the limitations imposed by the current economic situation in many centers, what lies behind those unmeasured expenses is order or disorder, discipline or laxity, rigor or leniency, controlling resources or diverting them, talent or mediocrity in the administration, a spirit of struggle or a sense of indifference, responsibility or negligence, shoddiness or excellence. Hence the importance of the first point on the agenda of the Workplace Parliament assemblies that will take place in tens of thousands of production or service units. If each one of these places takes a step forward, a great deal of progress can be made merely by compounding positive actions. Then the influence of the overall measures, those taken all over the country, will be felt in the best possible way. These measures can be truly effective only if action is taken in the workplace.
