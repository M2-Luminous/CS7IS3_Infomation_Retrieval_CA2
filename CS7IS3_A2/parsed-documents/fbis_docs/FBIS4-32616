But he bore no resemblance to the politician who, at gatherings in the Park of Culture and Recreation or in the television program "Kroky" [Steps], shocks spectators with angry revelations about his political sympathizers from the Movement or the coalition. This Meciar, who is visibly thinner, is a sympathetic, direct man with a cordial smile on his face, who appears to me to be diffident rather than aggressive. Before the leader of the opposition enters the soundproof booth of the broadcasting studio of Radio Twist to answer listeners' questions in an hour-long roundtable, Lubos Machaj, program director, greets him and points out the modest premises of this modest radio station. Then he gives him the pleasant news about the relative strength of listeners who support his politics and those who condemn it: it is 50-50. That was indicated by the questions phoned in to Radio Twist by 70 listeners a day before the broadcast. I looked at Meciar, who received this information with modest satisfaction. Even before the HZDS chairman accepted the invitation of the radio station, we asked him several questions in order to take advantage of the situation and not have to talk to him by phone. We were interested to know how much truth there is to the rumors about the security measures in the HZDS building on Tomasikova Street. The shadow prime minister does not deny anything but acknowledges only that they accepted four members of the security guard. The bullet-proof glass in the windows of his office he consigns to the realm of disinformation games. In the brief interview, we also touched on the question of tapping politicians' telephone conversations, which Ludovit Cermak complained about at the meeting of the National Council. "Let them listen in on me all they want," Vladimir Meciar declared. "It does not bother me at all. When you have a politician who tells everything on radio or television anyway, it is really a waste of time." But he nevertheless admits that, in the past, during the totalitarian regime, security did tap his phone. But because he knew that a recording on tape lasts only 45 minutes, he saved the important matters for after this time elapsed. (Editor's comment: This is obviously a misunderstanding because we know that State Security used the so-called endless tapes for tapping phones, which eliminated the possibility of missing some of the conversation.) However, the interview, which Radio Twist broadcast, could be taped by anyone. And certainly his political opponents taped and listened to it in order to find out what he learned from his political defeat and whether he chose another tactic. It seems to me that he did. Not only from what he said, but rather from what he did not say. He was not confrontational, he did not thunder at his political opponents, he did not threaten with his planned steps, and did not accuse his former sympathizers of betrayal. He answered questions, even the most stupid ones, calmly, mildly, and to the point. He conceded that the HZDS leadership made a critical analyzis of the causes of what happened and came to the conclusion that the fault was not in the people but in the system, so that, in a year or two, this could happen again. Vladimir Meciar realizes that people were already tired of the constant political tension, permanent crisis, and a series of scandals, and that they welcomed the relative calm that filled the Slovak political scene after the change of the government. He himself embraced nonconfrontational politics, obviously also in order to win over citizens frightened by his methods. As he said, "we want to address not only our sympathizers, but also those who do not understand us. At this time, we are drafting, with a large team of experts, a program for the future development of Slovakia. We want to present it to the voters for evaluation, and, if they like it, let them vote for HZDS; if not, let them choose another alternative. But we want to win over voters with our program, not by asserting that we are good and the others are bad." In the radio roundtable, Meciar had to listen not only to questions from those who applaud him in the Park of Culture and Recreation, but also from those who are horrified by the possibility of his return to the political arena. After all, Meciar recently declared that his first step will be to remove President Michal Kovac from office. He moderated his tone, he controls himself well, and he shows much more willingness to meet others halfway, but obviously he will not forgive his political opponents anything. It was clear mainly from what he said about the election law that is being drafted: "Moravcik's present party, which sits in the parliament without the benefit of elections, is not legitimately in the parliament and should collect 10,000 signatures. They are now thinking about how to repeal this part of the election law, so that they would not have to meet this obligation. But that would create a situation where every family could establish its own party and run in the elections." We can accept this statement, to be sure, only with a big dose of benevolence, as a kind of poetic license, because, to establish a political party, you also need 10,000 signatures. More fundamental will be whether Vladimir Meciar will succeed in acquiring a new image of a more tolerant politician, one who respects the rules of democratic politics and who will not ruthlessly pursue his vision of political power. If he also wants to convince the voters from other political parties of this, he must first distance himself from the militant groups of his followers, as he did in this interview, when he reacted to the statement of one participant in the meeting: Better a civil war than Michal Kovac as president. "There can be an agent provocateur in every crowd," said Meciar, "but that does not mean that this agent provocateur is my follower. My followers were, and are, civil people." If Vladimir Meciar succeeds in convincing our entire nation of this, it will be his greatest victory.
