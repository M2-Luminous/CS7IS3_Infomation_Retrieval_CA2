The general state budget for 1994 was fixed at 203,329,800,000 CFA francs. Here is the report on the extraordinary cabinet meeting presented by the government spokesman, Communication Minister Ouardougou Bolou: [Begin Bolou recording] The cabinet examined the only item on its agenda, namely the examination of the draft 1994 general budget bill. The general state budget for the 1994 fiscal year, which comprises recurrent expenditure for institutions and public investment expenditure and is worth 203,329,800,000 CFA francs, was adopted after extensive debate. This amount is broken down as follows: recurrent expenditure, 70,839,800,000 francs; public investment budget, 132,783,000,000 francs. The budget falls within an extremely difficult context for our country which is characterized by economic recession and the new financial situation brought about by the devaluation of the CFA franc. However, the government wants to rigorously take national imperatives into account, particularly the implementation of the transition guidelines and the honoring of its foreign commitments in line with measures to redress the serious macroeconomic imbalances of the country.
