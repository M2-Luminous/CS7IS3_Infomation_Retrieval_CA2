[passage omitted] In his address, Major al-Khuwayldi al-Humaydi warned against the dangers posed by challenges confronting the Arab nation, indicating that they formed an obstacle toward achieving any Arab integration, prosperity and progress. [passage omitted] He added that one of the most prominent challenges facing us and which the enemies are using to impede our unity and to destroy our basic principles with deep-rooted crusade-like rancor is the crisis fabricated more than two years ago by Western states against the Great Jamahiriyah. The Western states insist on continuing to use the so-called Security Council to issue unjust mandatory resolutions which all the world -- people and agencies -- have rejected. Major al-Khuwayldi al-Humaydi said that the repeated threat by the three Western states and their indifference to all initiatives to find a peaceful solution to the crisis required collective confrontation in line with the requirements of our charters and pacts to prevent those countries from carrying on implementing the same method they have been following, and to work on lifting the unjust mandatory sanctions imposed on your brothers in the Great Jamahiriyah, which have resulted in large physical and material losses that have spread to the AMU. [passage omitted] Major al-Khuwayldi al-Humaydi said: We announce from this podium, full self-confidence, that we are ready to hold direct dialogue with Western states, on equal footing, without there being room for any terrorism or encroachment. We also announce that we are prepared to receive their judges, with grace and honor, in line with recognized international rules. Al-Khuwayldi al-Humaidi added: Your brothers in the Jamahiriyah expect a decisive solution and practical steps to lift injustice from them to emerge from this summit. Any position which contradicts that will make Libyans feel the futility of this union as being one political entity and will leave them with a feeling of deep disppointment. [passage omitted]
