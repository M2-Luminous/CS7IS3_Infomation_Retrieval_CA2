We therefore asked Tereza Ganza-Aras when she intended to convene the Commission. [Ganza-Aras] I will convene the session as soon as I receive a request that will satisfy both the material and formal terms as foreseen by Article 50 of the Chamber of Counties Standing Orders. The request of a group of deputies, whose signatures were illegible, demanding that the session be convened urgently, should have specified why the request was made and exactly what they meant by "urgent," and it should have explained the reason for this urgency. [Duka] No valid requests have been made recently? [Ganza-Aras] No. The above-mentioned article of the Standing Orders that the group of deputies refers to, specifies that one must state the topic that is to be discussed at the session. I acted in accordance with the Standing Orders and thereby protected the dignity of the Commission and of the Chamber of Counties. The president of the HDZ [Croatian Democratic Community] Club used expressions like "we demand," as if this was a party directive that I had to obey without objection. [Duka] Is it difficult to figure out who is behind this request? [Ganza-Aras] Yes. Names and surnames should have been typed next to signatures in order for it to be seen whether they are members of the Commission. When I find out exactly what problem is to be evaluated by the Commission, then I will use the possibility provided by the Standing Orders and consult experts. There are lawyers in the Commission, but it would not be harmful to hear the opinion of professors of law. If I had satisfied the "demand" of the president of the HDZ Club, it would have been pure voluntarism. 30-Day Deadline [Duka] You have mentioned a deadline of up to 30 days for convening the session. Is that according to the Standing Orders? [Ganza-Aras] The Standing Orders say that the duty of the president of the Chamber of Counties is to submit agenda proposals within 30 days. The other rule says that presidents of working bodies have the rights and obligations toward their bodies that apply to the president of that chamber. Therefore, the longest deadline is 30 days. However, according to a Standing Orders article, there is a possibility of shortening deadlines, so, since this request is urgent, I will convene the Commission as soon as I get everything necessary for the regular course of the session. However, the date for which I will convene the session will depend on when I get the material and when I get assessments. Notice of a session is sent to members eight days before the session takes place. [Duka] Still, even without professional opinion, do you think different interpretations of the Standing Orders are possible? Was it legally possible to replace Manolic last Friday? [Ganza-Aras] I think his interpretation was valid. All lawyers I met in those long recesses in the corridors of the parliament house share my opinion. There was a state of general consternation due to attempts to impose a party model on the work of the parliament. [Duka] Professor Smiljko Sokol says this is not a parliamentary crisis. What is you opinion? [Ganza-Aras] I think he is wrong. I do not know what else could be called a parliamentary crisis if not replacing the president of a chamber of the parliament?! Secondly, the Chamber of Representatives and the Chamber of Counties are obviously dependent on each other, and the Chamber of Representatives will not be able to begin a new session until this interrupted session of the Chamber of Counties is brought to a close. For a certain group of bills it is obligatory to first get the so-called previous opinion of the Chamber of Counties, and there are such bills at every session. And in order to alleviate the crisis, I will try to convene my commission as soon as possible, but even that opinion is not reliable. Again, the Chamber of Counties will alone decide whether it will accept that opinion or not. What Kind of Ballot? [Duka] At the session of the Commission, there will probably be outvoting. What is the party structure of deputies? [Ganza-Aras] All commissions are composed so that HDZ members have an absolute majority. Commissions have 17 members each, four of which are liberals, one member of the Social Democratic Party, one member of the Istrian Democratic Congress -- Sosic is formally a member of the Croatian Party, but he is a member of the HDZ Club -- and one member of the Croatian Peasants Party. There are eight HDZ members -- nine with Sosic. I suppose they will all come to the Commission session so that there will be outvoting, as usual. [Duka] If Manolic is replaced, they will vote for a new president. In case there are several candidates, there will be a secret ballot. [Ganza-Aras] Yes, but only as a rule. For, if seven deputies demand an open ballot, then an open ballot will decide whether there will be an open or a secret ballot. The Standing Orders are composed so as to disable the opposition as much as possible. The president of the Chamber has absolute power and, now, in the case of Manolic, it recoils on the HDZ. People say that a stick has two ends. Therefore, it is best not to have it. [Duka] In early Fall, one began working on new standing orders for both chambers. This work was particularly aided by Mesic and Manolic. However, in the end, it was all stopped. [Ganza-Aras] We completed the Standing Orders in November last year. During a year and a half of work of the Chamber of Representatives and a year of work of the Chamber of Counties, many Standing Orders solutions appeared vague, so new Standing Orders regulated many matters more precisely. However, when they were already copied and ready to be sent to deputies for approval, everything was stopped. Who Stopped Standing Orders? [Duka] Who stopped them and why? [Ganza-Aras] I can only guess. Prominent HDZ spokespersons raised the issue. Among other things, the secret ballot was emphasized as a problem. Those standing orders explicitly demanded a secret ballot when making decisions about people. They tried to introduce more order in deadlines for composing the agenda. However, it seems that the ruling party wants to have incomplete standing orders so as it can interpret them as it likes. [Duka] Now we see that Professor Sokol is not satisfied with these standing orders. Therefore, he too might be replaced after this case. [Ganza-Aras] Yes, he is not only dissatisfied with the Standing Orders but also with the constitutional definition of the Chamber of Counties, and we know that he and Mr. Seks were those who wrote this Constitution. Sokol, for instance, says that the president of the parliamentary chamber must enjoy the trust of most deputies in the chamber or must step down. No one disputes that. But, the session of the Chamber of Counties began on Wednesday, continued on Thursday, and there were demands for Manolic's replacement on Friday, and in two days of the session, the president of the chamber [Manolic] did not come into conflict with any deputy. It seems that 36 deputies remembered overnight, after full two days of session, that they no longer trust their chamber president. The opposition wanted to continue and conclude this session. HDZ deputies finally suggested interrupting the session. The demand for replacement could have been put on the agenda of the next session of the chamber. Furthermore, Sokol concluded that the constitutional position of the Chamber of Counties must be changed. All parliamentary opposition parties think that the Constitution must be amended exactly with regard to the position of the parliament.
