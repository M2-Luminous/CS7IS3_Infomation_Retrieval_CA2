Because of disappointment over Japan's new package of stimulus measures, which fell short of fulfilling the United States' high hopes, the Clinton administration appears to have decided to break off the working-level negotiations between bureaucrats of the two countries and to look for political decisions from Prime Minister Hosokawa and Foreign Minister Hata. The Clinton administration has decided to do so because of the U.S. Administration's long-held view that "if pressure is applied on Japan, Japan yields to the United States' trade demands." This is unfortunate for Japan. The Clinton administration has decided to break off the working-level negotiations in defiance of domestic criticism against it for being impatient for trade results from the framework talks. Its decision can be termed a dangerous gambit. The administration's decision to break off the working-level negotiations has been anticipated. In the working-level negotiations on government procurement of telecommunications equipment and medical instruments held on the morning of 8 February, before the Clinton administration notified the Japanese Government [of the working-level talks' suspension], the U.S. Trade Representative made an unprecedented demand that "Japan increase its government procurement of foreign-made telecommunications equipment and medical instruments by 25 percent every year" with the aim of having Japan reject this demand. The Japanese delegation clearly viewed this demand as a "U.S. proposal aimed at bringing an end to the working-level negotiations." A member of the U.S. delegation said that "Japan's new package of stimulus measures" has prompted the Clinton administration to break off the working-level negotiations. The Japanese Government originally was supposed to decide to cut the income tax for three years, but now it has decided to cut it for only one year. In response, the Clinton administration has expressed its dissatisfaction. In cabinet-level negotiations, the U.S. side will try to wring a commitment from the Japanese side under which Japan will go along with the United States on numerical targets and will cut its income tax for many more years. The Clinton administration thinks that toward this end, it is wise to opt for negotiations with Japan's foreign minister, who is considered to be "close to the prime minister and able to make decisions."
