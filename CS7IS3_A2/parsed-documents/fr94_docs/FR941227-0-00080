FR941227-0-00080 FR941227-0-00015 Delegation by the District Commander 33 CFR 1.07&hyph;10(b) The District Commander now has more flexibility to delegate authority for review of alleged violations to any member under the District Commander's command. For example, the District Commander may now delegate case review authority to the Captain of the Port for certain pollution prevention violations, thus eliminating the need for review by the District Commander's staff prior to forwarding the case to a Hearing Officer. The expanded delegation authority allows District Commanders greater flexibility in allocating their personnel resources to process violation cases. Discussion of Comments and Changes I. General Comments The Interim rule language of ยง1.07&hyph;11 and the NOV form used for the pilot program left the impression that a party could request a hearing on the proposed penalty offered by the NOV. In fact, if a party does not wish to accept the NOV, a full case is forwarded to the Hearing Officer who then makes an independent determination and issues a preliminary assessment letter to which the party can respond. To clarify this procedure ยง1.07&hyph;11 now specifies that the NOV include a statement that the party may decline the NOV and, if the NOV is declined, the party has the right to a hearing prior to a final assessment of a penalty by a Hearing Officer. The NOV also states that taking no action on the NOV has the same result as declining the NOV but the processing time may increase. Furthermore, the NOV form makes it clear that the Hearing Officer is in no way bound by any assessment proposed by the NOV. To facilitate understanding of these rights the NOV form is reproduced in Figure 1. BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;14&hyph;P E:GRAPHICSER27DE94.000 E:GRAPHICSER27DE94.001 BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;14&hyph;C
