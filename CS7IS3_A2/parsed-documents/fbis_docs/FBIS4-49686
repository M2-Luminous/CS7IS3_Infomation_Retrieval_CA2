"The so-called referendum suggested by the Dalai Lama is yet another trick for his splitting activities," a foreign ministry spokesman said. "The question of holding a referendum on the future of Tibet does not exist," he added. The Dalai Lama raised the possibility of a referendum earlier this week, saying 14 years of talks with the Chinese had made no progress. "I may have no choice but to go in for a referendum of Tibetans, both inside Tibet and those outside, for them to discuss their options," the Nobel peace laureate said. The foreign ministry spokesman reiterated that Tibet was "an inalienable part of China" and warned against any action that could undermine Chinese sovereignty over the Himalayan region. "Any attempt aimed at splitting Tibet from China will meet with firm oppostion from the Chinese people, including Tibetans," he said. Chinese troops took control of Tibet in 1959.
