FR940314-2-00079 FR940314-2-00045 a. The organization is legally incorporated as a nonprofit organization; and b. Not less than 51% of the composition of the Board of Directors or governing board of the mutual assistance association is comprised of refugees or former refugees, including both refugee men and women. State Administration States are reminded that under current regulations at 45 CFR 400.206 and 400.207, States have the flexibility to charge the following types of administrative costs against their refugee program social service grants, if they so choose: Direct and indirect administrative costs incurred for the overall management and operation of the State refugee program, including its coordination, planning, policy and program development, oversight and monitoring, data collection and reporting, and travel.

Allocation Formula Of the funds available for FY 1994 for social services, $68,681,700 is proposed to be allocated to States in accordance with the formula specified below. A State's allowable allocation will be calculated as follows: 1. The total amount of funds determined by the Director to be available for this purpose; divided by_ 2. The total number of refugees and Cuban/Haitian entrants who arrived in the United States not more than 3 years prior to the beginning of the fiscal year for which the funds are appropriated and the number of Amerasians from Vietnam eligible for refugee social services, as shown by the ORR Refugee Data System. The resulting per capita amount will be multiplied by_ 3. The number of persons in item 2, above, in the State as of October 1, 1993, adjusted for estimated secondary migration. The calculation above will yield the formula allocation for each State. Minimum allocations for small States are taken into account. Allocations for political prisoners are based on FY 1993 arrival numbers for this group in each State from the Refugee Data Center and are limited to States with 170 or more political prisoner arrivals. We have limited the population base to FY 1993 political prisoner arrival numbers because these funds are intended to serve recent arrivals. We have not included States with fewer than 170 former political prisoners in the political prisoner allocations formula because the resulting level of funding would be insignificant. In these States, we believe the small number of political prisoners could be adequately served under the State's refugee social services program. IV. Basis of Population Estimates The population estimates for the allocation of funds in FY 1994 are based on data on refugee arrivals from the ORR Refugee Data System, adjusted as of October 1, 1993, for estimated secondary migration. The data base includes refugees of all nationalities, Amerasians from Vietnam, and Cuban and Haitian entrants. For fiscal year 1994, ORR's formula allocations for the States for social services are based on the number of refugees and Amerasians who arrived, and on the numbers of entrants who arrived or were resettled, during the preceding three fiscal years: 1991, 1992, and 1993, based on final arrival data by State. Therefore, estimates have been developed of the numbers of refugees and entrants with arrival or resettlement dates between October 1, 1990, and September 30, 1993, who are thought to be living in each State as of October 1, 1993. Refugees admitted under the Federal Government's private-sector initiative are not included, since their assistance and services are to be provided by the private sponsoring organizations under an agreement with the Department of State.
