[PAPAZYAN] Rather than dwell on any particular significance of Armenia's participation in these meetings, I want to concentrate on the outcome of the meeting that has just been held. It's well-known that some of the problems recently discussed are of special interest to Armenia. For example, the Karabakh problem had a place in the final communique of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC). It was stressed that the problem cannot be brought to a conclusion through force of arms but only in peace, through meetings and within the framework of the Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). The emphasis put on this made us feel positive and happy. [TDN] How would you evaluate the visit to Istanbul of Azerbaijan President Geydar Aliyev at the invitation of President Suleyman Demirel, and his meeting with the U.S. Secretary of State? [PAPAZYAN] It is a mistake to put any particular interpretation on this. Everyone knows that there is the possibility of bilateral -- or multilateral -- meetings and discussions. This meeting has no special significance in our eyes. [TDN] From time to time officials from the Armenian government are in Turkey for the Black Sea Economic Cooperation, NATO or other reasons. Have the meetings between the Turkish state and Armenian government officials helped improve Armenian-Turkish relations? [PAPAZYAN] The normalization and development of Armenian-Turkish relations are as always a topic in our bilateral meetings. For example we spoke about this Friday [10 June] in our meetings with Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin and Ozdem Sanberk. I am hopeful that there will be some developments soon. In Turkish-Armenian relations certain conditions have been imposed by the Turkish side. Naturally, efforts have to be made to put the problems which exist between the two sides behind us. Obstacles to improved relations do exist, but our meetings have taken place in an atmosphere of cooperation. [TDN] Could you say that the Karabakh issue is the only obstacle to the normalization of Turkish-Armenian relations? [PAPAZYAN] Turkey ties the normalization of relations with Armenia, and the establishment of diplomatic ties between the two countries, to the solving of the Karabakh problem. That is, the difficulties that exist can be put behind us when progress is made towards a peaceful solution in Karabakh. However it is necessary to say that, from our point of view, linking the normalization of relations between our two countries to the Karabakh issue is a mistake. It's true that there are problems which have to be solved between the two countries and some continuing sources of tension. But we do not think it useful to make preconditions concerning the improvement of relations. The normalization of relations between us has important repercussions for the stability of the entire region. [TDN] How do you perceive Turkey's having created a military post in Erzurum which is directed at Nakhichevan and Karabakh and that will be used in line with Turkey and CSCE's desire to contribute to peacekeeping forces in Karabakh? [PAPAZYAN] We haven't received an official request concerning this desire. Our government will evaluate any such request whether from Turkey or any other country. [TDN] It has been said for a long time in the Turkish press that Armenia has opened its arms to the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan], or supports the PKK, or shelters them. Although we know you have been asked this question very often, what can you say on this subject? [PAPAZYAN] I'm sick and tired of having to make a statement on this topic. What I know is that my Turkish counterparts that I meet at all levels have been aware that this is simply not true. But what a pity it is that the Turkish press and media always fuel Turkish public opinion with groundless suspicions like this. In my opinion this hinders the normalization of Turkish-Armenian relations. I don't wish to believe that the Turkish press doesn't want the two countries to normalize their relations. I would say that this business is Turkey's own internal problem and that we have no intention of interfering in Turkey's internal affairs in any way. How Turkey reaches a solution on this issue doesn't interest us at all.
