Sources in NATO headquarters and the Russian Embassy told ITAR- TASS that negotiations will be held here on Saturday between the NATO chief's political adviser Gebhardt von Moltke and Russian officials to specify the programme of the Russian foreign minister's visit. On Wednesday, the North Atlantic Council called on Russia to hold a discussion of its relations with the alliance in pursuance of the accords reached at the meeting of the NATO foreign ministers and their East European partners in Istanbul on June 9 and 10. At the Istanbul conference, the North Atlantic alliance welcomed Russia's intention to join without any preconditions the programme of cooperation for East European and former Soviet countries proposed by the leaders of the NATO member-countries in January. The NATO ministers at the same time agreed to "a broader dialogue" with Russia with due account of its size and weight in international affairs and its nuclear status. Over the past six months, the question about Russia's special relationship with NATO was in the centre of talks about Moscow's membership of this programme which provides for cooperation in military planning and training, joint exercises and interaction in peacekeeping and rescue operations. Russia proposed a formal announcement of its special status and asked for NATO's pledge to hold mandatory consultations with Russia before making important political decisions. The alliance which recognizes Russia's role, sought to put a deeper dialogue with Moscow on "a more informal basis." As concerns the framework agreement, Brussels position is firm: it is one and the same for all partners and gives all of them equal access to cooperation with the alliance. The framework agreement will be signed by Russia in the same form as it was signed by 20 partner-countries, including states of the former Warsaw treaty and the former Soviet Union, ITAR-TASS learned in NATO headquarters. It is possible that two other documents will be agreed, although it is not yet clear what name the first one will be given: it may be a statement, a declaration or a protocol of the meeting between the Russian minister and members of the North Atlantic Council. NATO expects Russia to put on the table a presentation document which contains proposals for cooperation and is submitted by every partner. Andrey Kozyrev is due to meet first of all NATO Deputy Secretary- General Sergio Balanzino (Secretary-General Manfred Woerner is away for treatment). He will then attend a meeting of the North Atlantic Council to sign the framework agreement. NATO sources did not rule out the possibility of changes to the habitual procedure. One of them is that the council meeting will be attended not only by permanent envoys but also by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and probably some other foreign ministers who will arrive in Brussels for the occasion. A day before the signing, Andrey Kozyrev is due to hold a meeting with Warren Christopher to discuss key international issues, including the tension on the Korean peninsula.
