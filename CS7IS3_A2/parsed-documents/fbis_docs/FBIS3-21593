Nedyukha, candidate of technological sciences: "Ukraine's Nuclear `Cheapness'"] [Text] Here is information that was broadcast on 16 January on the "Ostankino" TV channel: "Ukraine will not receive any other compensations except for reciprocal fuel elements for atomic electric power plants." Proceeding from this concise thesis, what advantages for Ukraine can one speak about in general? First, Ukraine will only receive $300 million out of the $800 million allocated by the United States for the nuclear disarmament of the CIS countries. This sum [$300 million] is allocated for dismantling the world's third most powerful nuclear arsenal that is much larger than those of, for example, Belarus and Kazakhstan taken together. Second, Ukraine will have to allocate several times that sum from its own resources for the destruction of the missiles themselves, their fuel filling, and especially launch silos. In accordance with previous estimates, this will amount to at least $3.2 billion. However, who will cover the resulting deficit of about $3 billion for the service being rendered by Ukraine in order to reinforce the national security of the United States and Russia, something, which the leaders of those countries do not deny. What about the advertised free market principles, based upon a balance of demand and supply? Third, if something really needs to be compensated for in full, it is Ukraine's growing strategic vulnerability. In accordance with the information issued by high-ranking representatives of Ukraine's Ministry of Defense that was broadcast on Ukrainian TV Channel One on 17 January, it may be necessary to proceed to modern types of nonnuclear weapons, something about which the Ukrainian president cautioned earlier. This means that it will be necessary to take additional enormous sums from the budget. However, due to the absence of any prospects of resolving this problem without assistance from the Russian military industrial complex, more specifically, by crediting its functioning, this may only be done by lowering the standard of living of the Ukrainian population. Fourth, such crediting will, in fact, be done for Russia's atomic industry. Russia has the possibility of selling the Ukrainian part of uranium for hard currency and at world prices and, at the same time, setting exclusive prices for those fuel elements that will be supplied to Ukraine. Belarus has already expressed its disagreement with Russia's thesis that the "lion's share" of profits from the sales of uranium will go toward covering the expenditure for destroying the missiles (IZVESTIYA, 19 January 1994). Moreover, at the news conference held by Colonel General Ye. Maslin, main expert of Russia's Ministry of Defense, that was broadcast by "Ostankino" on 18 January, a categorical demand was made that all nuclear missile warheads be immediately transferred to Russia as only then would reciprocal supplies of fuel elements be made. As they say, the more you have, the more you want. On the whole, even from the point of view of the degree of reliability of the highly advertised economic advantages that Ukraine may get, all of this does not look as radiant and nice as the numerous "advertisers" are trying to prove. At the same time, the "Ostankino" TV channel asserts with confidence and optimism that here, too, "Russia will in no way sacrifice its own national interests." Can anyone say the same thing about Ukraine? This particularly applies to the problem of guaranteeing Ukraine's national security, especially against the background of the recent "optimistically probabilistic" statement by the U.S. president who said there were "very good chances that Russia will not become an expansionist state again and will not threaten its neighbors." In simpler terms, this statement means that the United States will certainly never get involved in warfare with nuclear Russia, even if the latter does resume its "old" practices. What real guarantees for Ukraine can one talk about in general, if the two formal presidential guarantees in respect of the 14 January 1994 agreement will expire in three years time? Regarding declarations about the beginning of a new nonnuclear era, India has already dropped its "nuclear fly" into the nonnuclear "ointment" of the American and Russian promises, having declared that it was not going to proceed in the "Ukrainian direction," also in view of all its accompanying motivations. Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that Ukraine will remain the only standard-bearer of the movement toward a radiant "nonnuclear" future. It is true, however, that we are used to moving in "radiant" directions. In recent decades, we have done nothing but that.
