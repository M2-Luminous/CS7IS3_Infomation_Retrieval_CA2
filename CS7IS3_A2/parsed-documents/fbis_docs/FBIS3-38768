Mr. Sarkozy, we have just seen these reports from Sarajevo. What sadness and what a failure. [Sarkozy] Yes, we no longer want to see these pictures. It is no longer a matter for words or speeches. As early as yesterday evening, speaking through Alain Juppe and Francois Leotard, the French Government called for two things, two very precise things. Everyone here in France and abroad must know that we will do everything to ensure that our demands are met. First of all we want the siege of Sarajevo to be lifted. In concrete terms, this means the besieging Serb forces must pull back 30 km so that they can no longer massacre the civilian population. Second, we demand that all heavy weaponry, both on the Serb and the Bosnian side, be placed under the control of the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR]. This is what we have demanded. If it does not happen [pauses]... France has indicated that if this is not done willingly, as part of a political agreement, then we would have to use all the means at our disposal, including air strikes. What has to be quite clear is that military intervention is not an aim in itself. It would be meaningless to answer massacres with massacres. Military intervention serves to show that we want such a solution. France cannot decide on this alone, and this is why France has called for a meeting of the council of ministers of the North Atlantic Council, because it obviously has to be an international intervention. But believe me, the French position is without any hint of ambiguity, and it cannot be otherwise. I would like to make one last point: Our public opinion has to know that of the 3,000 UNPROFOR troops bravely doing their job in Sarajevo, 75 percent are French.
