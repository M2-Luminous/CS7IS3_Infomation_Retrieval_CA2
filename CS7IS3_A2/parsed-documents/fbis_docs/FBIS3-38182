Marking an apparent Government change of tone about the prospects of hard-line Irish republican acceptance of the joint Anglo-Irish statement, he spoke of "a rational ground" for hope about the Provisionals' reaction. "We believe we may yet see a positive response from the provisionals," he said. "Of course, there is a rational ground for hope, because it is so much the will of and demand of the people of this island, north and south, that after all the declaration calls for nothing to be given up by anybody -- apart from violence. "It simply says that constitutional principles shall be based upon consent and agreement, and nobody is excluded from that process, save and except those who hope to bring a bomb or a bullet to fortify their arguments." Pressure on Sinn Fein mounted today when the U.S. government effectively refused party president Gerry Adams a visa to visit a New York conference. A statement in Washington said the White House would only consider his application if he publicly renounced violence and threw his support behind the Downing Street peace declaration. At the same time, the first of four Sinn Fein "peace commission" hearings to gauge reaction to the London-Dublin statement within the republican movement was being held in Londonderry. Sir Patrick -- speaking after a meeting in Dublin of the Anglo-Irish intergovernmental Northern Ireland Conference -- also appeared to offer greater scope than before for clarification for the republicans of the December 15 document signed by Prime Minister John Major and his Irish counterpart Albert Reynolds. "I am not aware of any particular part of the document that we have been asked to clarify," he said. "I am not inviting a request for clarification, but it so happens that nobody has said `Look, we don't understand paragraph three,' which is quite interesting." Sir Patrick claimed that a letter sent by Mr Adams to Mr Major amounted to a request for negotiation rather than clarification. He emphasised: "We will continue to make clear what the document does and does not do. We continue to make speeches that do just that. I do not believe there is anything between the two governments on this and I certainly don't wish to see anybody under any genuine misapprehension as to what the declaration says. What I am not prepared to do is to negotiate. I am not prepared to unravel something that has taken as long as this has to put together, and which is very clear and comprehensive. I will not gloss it and say it means something it does not say." The conference meeting, initially set to end early this afternoon, went on for more than six hours. In a joint statement afterwards, Sir Patrick and joint chairman Dick Spring, Ireland's deputy premier and foreign minister, condemned recent violence in Ulster, and said a range of issues had been reviewed. Sir Patrick relayed British disappointment at the Irish government's recent decision to scrap a 20-year-old ban on broadcasting interviews with members of the IRA, Sinn Fein and other groups with paramilitary links. A similar ban continues to operate in the United Kingdom. Both Sir Patrick and Mr Spring appeared to rule out setting a deadline for the IRA and Sinn Fein response to the Downing Street declaration after today's talks. The Ulster Secretary said: "There is no talk of deadlines. The principles are not going to cease to apply come the end of month one, two, three or five." And Irish Foreign Minister Mr Spring added: "What we are trying to do is of such importance that a deadline would not help."
