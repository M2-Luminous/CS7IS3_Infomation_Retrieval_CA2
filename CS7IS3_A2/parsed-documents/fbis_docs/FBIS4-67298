Despite strict penal provisions incorporated in the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, illegal cultivation of opium poppy and cannabis continue to flourish in large parts of Bankura, Burdwan, Purulia, Birbhum, Nadia, and the North-24 Parganas. While cultivation of opium poppy seems to be largely concentrated in Bankura, the districts of Nadia and the North-24 Parganas happen to have the largest concentration of cannabis cultivation as detected by the State Excise Department. The minimum punishment for cultivation of opium poppy is a rigorous imprisonment of 10 years, extendable to 20 years. According to the Excise officials, villagers seem to care less about legal consequences and desperately indulge in the act, which yield opium and from which morphine is derived and finally, of course, the deadly heroin. Although opium poppy had an edible use through one of its by-products, popularly known as posto cultivation of the same was potentially more dangerous than cannabis, whose derivatives were charas and hashish, said an official of the State Excise Department. Statistics speak volumes about this growing and dangerous trend among villagers, who according to the Excise officials, find it more reasonable and lucrative to cultivate opium poppy and cannabis. Excise officials feel that whereas the cultivation of opium poppy is less costly than that of other cash crops, the return is more rewarding. This could be one of the reasons for widespread cultivation of the same, said an official. According to the Excise Department, several bighas of land are being utilised for this purpose. The figures available from the department, say nearly 285 acres of land was found to be under cultivation of opium poppy plants in the district of Bankura alone, which happens to be the prime area of such cultivation in West Bengal. This detection was only for the financial year 1993-94, where the estimated number of poppy capsules was about a crore. In the same financial year, the Excise Department detected opium poppy cultivation in about 20 acres of land under the Kaksa thana area in the Burdwan district also. Regarding cannabis, the Department found 20 bighas and 31 acres under such cultivation in two separate raids in Nadia in March this year. The given area had an estimated yield of about 4,870 kg of cannabis. While there was no definite proof of the manufacture of opium despite a noticeable rise in the cultivation of opium poppy plants as admitted by the Narcotics cell of the State Excise Department, officials felt that a popular by-product of opium poppy, posto meant for edible use could have been a major reason for its widespread cultivation. The price of posto, which had gone up significantly in the past few years, could have prompted villagers to go for large scale cultivation with fertile soil and adequate irrigation facilities, said a senior official of the Department. However, the Excise Department seems to be determined to arrest this growing trend in several districts of the State. On conditions of anonymity an official of the Department said, a series of raids would be conducted in different districts including, Bankura and Nadia in the current financial year, based on specific information received by the Department. When asked about the extent of cooperation received from the villagers the official said in most of the cases instead of cooperation it was tough resistance, which at times virtually snowballed into a confrontation between the Excise people and the villagers. According to the Excise Department, cannabis was available at retail outlets and sold without restrictions till December 12, 1989, the cut-off date as decided at the UN's single convention on Drugs and Psychotropic Substances in 1961 to which India was a signatory. It was decided at this convention that the signatory countries would stop non-medicinal and non-scientific use of cannabis within stipulated time frame. Hence, from 13 December, 1989 both cultivation and sale of cannabis became illegal.
