The northwestern Gansu Province, home to 44 minority nationalities, is an example. The people of minority nationalities have been driven by the current nationwide economic tide to get involved in various businesses such as commodity transportation, business and sightseeing. The local people of the Hui, Tibetan, Dongxiang and Salar nationalities transport local products, daily necessities and garments to Sichuan Province and the Tibet Autonomous Region, in return taking back arts and crafts and medicinal herbs. Moreover, some local farmers have set up joint ventures in co- operation with business people from India, Sikkim and Bhutan. Uygur-nationality people who live in the Qilian mountains have developed scenic spots to attract tourists. The province's Kazak Autonomous County of Aksay and Mongolian Autonomous County of Subei have established economic co-operation ties with Kazakhstan and Mongolia, respectively. A number of markets for leather, wool, timber and tea have emerged in the province. Some of its products are exported to Hong Kong, the Commonwealth of Independent States and Southeast Asian countries. This economic prosperity has in return promoted unity and stability in Gansu. Some of the richer local people have funded the building of schools and roads.
