FBIS4-15754 "drsov070_a_94037" FBIS-SOV-94-070 Daily Report 11 Apr 1994 RUSSIA INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Duma Speaker Demands Ships' Release Duma Speaker Demands Ships' Release LD1104190694 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1556 GMT 11 Apr 94 LD1104190694 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [Text] Speaker of the State Duma (the lower house of parliament) Ivan Rybkin in a letter to the Ukrainian leadership has protested at Kiev's seizure of the Black Sea Fleet's group of warships deployed at Odessa and the detention of the group commander, officers and men. The letter requests the immediate release of the detainees in the name of long-running friendly relations between Russia and Ukraine. Head of the parliamentary committee for CIS affairs Konstantin Zatulin told reporters in Moscow that soon after receiving an INTERFAX report about the incident on Monday, the Duma Council had held consultations with Chief Commander of the Russian Navy Feliks Gromov and Russian chief negotiator in talks with Kiev Yuriy Dubinin. He said the two officials would fly to Kiev late on Monday and that the "incident will be resolved and servicemen released". Zatulin expressed the hope that the incident was caused by misunderstanding rather than being a deliberate act intended to strain bilateral relations. If the detainees are not set free, he said, the Duma will have to resume discussion of the issue on Wednesday and adopt a special resolution. Zatulin did not rule out a souring of relations between the two countries and their parliaments. At the same time, the Russian official said the incident might have been planned as a way of causing friction between Moscow and Kiev. Zatulin believes that tension is being fuelled in Ukraine in a bid to cancel presidential elections in June and impose presidential rule in the country.
