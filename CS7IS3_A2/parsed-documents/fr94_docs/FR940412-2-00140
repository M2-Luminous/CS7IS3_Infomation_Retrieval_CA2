FR940412-2-00140 FR940412-2-00098 National Park Service Gary Marina, Supplement to the Draft Environmental Impact Statement AGENCY: National Park Service, Interior. ACTION: Availability of supplement to the draft environmental impact statement for the Gary Marina, adjacent to Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. SUMMARY: Pursuant to section 102(2)(c) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the National Park Service (NPS) announces the availability of a supplement to the draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) for the Gary Marina. The city of Gary proposes to construct a marina on Lake Michigan adjacent to the west boundary of Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. The proposed marina would require an access road through Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. The supplement to the DEIS was prepared by the city of Gary and the NPS. The city of Gary and the NPS's preferred alternative for marina access is identified in the supplement to the DEIS as the ``proposed'' access alternative; construction of an access road on the abandoned Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad bed, within the west end of Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore, and on U.S. Steel Corporation property, adjacent to, but outside, Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. This is a new alternative that was not previously described in the DEIS of April 1989. The new alternative was developed in response to public and agency comment on the DEIS. Many comments called for the development of an access alternative with less impact to Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore than those presented in the DEIS. The city of Gary and the NPS's preferred alternative for the marina location is identified in the DEIS as Site 1, which is behind an existing breakwater on land currently owned by U.S. Steel Corporation. All other marina site alternatives described in the DEIS have been eliminated from further consideration. Comments on the Supplement to the DEIS should be received no later than June 7, 1994. Comments on the supplement to the DEIS should be submitted to: Mr. Dale Engquist, Superintendent, Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore, 1100 N.
