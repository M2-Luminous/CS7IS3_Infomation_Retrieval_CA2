FR940426-0-00058 FR940426-0-00012 The Commission is adopting the proposed amendments with some modifications to reflect comments received. The modifications generally relate to the scope of the obligation to deliver the wrap fee brochure ( i.e. , the definitions of ``wrap fee program'' and ``sponsor'') and the disclosure requirements of the brochure. 5 5 Form ADV is a joint federal-state form used to register as an adviser with the Commission and with all states that require adviser registration. The amendments were prepared in cooperation with the North American Securities Administrators Association, Inc., which has voted to amend its Uniform Rules under the Uniform Securities Act to adopt the wrap fee brochure requirements discussed in this Release. A. Applicability of Disclosure Requirements The Commission proposed to require that the wrap fee brochure be provided by ``sponsors'' of ``wrap fee programs.'' The Commission received several comments concerning the scope of these terms. The amendments, as adopted, contain modifications to reflect certain of these comments. 1. Wrap Fee Programs Under the proposal, a ``wrap fee program'' was defined, in part, as a program under which any client is charged for investment advisory and execution services a specified fee or fees not based directly upon the transactions in the client's account. Some commenters asserted that programs under which clients are charged a wrap fee for portfolio management and execution of transactions, but under which no advice about portfolio managers is provided, should be excluded from the definition of wrap fee program because of the absence of advice about portfolio managers. 6 The wrap fee brochure is intended to address the special disclosure needs of clients participating in programs that offer investment advice and brokerage for a single fee, regardless of whether advice about portfolio managers is provided. 7 Therefore, as adopted, the definition of wrap fee program includes programs under which no advice regarding portfolio managers is provided. 8 6 Under many of these programs, only a single portfolio manager, usually the broker itself or its affiliate, is available to clients. 7 The only disclosure requirement that necessarily will not be applicable to programs not contemplating the selection of a portfolio manager is Item 7(f) of Schedule H, regarding how the sponsor selects and recommends portfolio managers. 8 The definition includes only wrap fee arrangements that are part of wrap fee ``programs,'' a term intended to describe arrangements that have some degree of uniformity among clients and that are entered into more than occasionally. Thus, an adviser that occasionally enters into wrap fee arrangements with clients and does not promote or solicit clients for wrap fee arrangements is not a sponsor of a ``program'' under the amendments. a. Managed Account Programs . In the Proposing Release, the Commission requested comment whether ``managed account programs,'' under which clients are provided with advice about portfolio managers but are charged advisory fees together with transaction-based commissions (rather than a single fee), should be included in the definition of wrap fee program. Commenters generally were opposed to the inclusion of managed account programs in the definition. Because managed account programs do not involve advisory and brokerage services provided for a single fee and thus do not raise the types of disclosure concerns addressed in the amendments, the Commission has not included these programs within the definition. 9 9 As noted in the Proposing Release, the definition of wrap fee program includes programs under which clients are offered a choice between a wrap fee and a fee-plus-commission arrangement. Proposing Release, supra note 1, at n.9. The sponsor of a program offering a choice of fee arrangements must provide prospective clients of the program with the wrap fee brochure describing each alternative. b. Mutual Fund Asset Allocation Programs . The proposed amendments would have included as wrap fee programs arrangements under which advice is provided regarding the allocation of client assets among mutual funds affiliated with the sponsor. Many commenters argued that mutual fund asset allocation programs should be excluded from the definition because they are more similar to traditional advisory services than to wrap fee programs, and the disclosure concerns they raise are addressed under current Part II of Form ADV (``Part II''). The Commission believes that mutual fund asset allocation programs, because they do not involve the provision of advisory and brokerage services for a single wrap fee, generally do not raise the disclosure concerns addressed in the amendments, and has modified the definition of wrap fee program to exclude mutual fund asset allocation programs. The Commission may consider in connection with future revisions to Form ADV whether additional disclosure requirements regarding these programs are needed.
