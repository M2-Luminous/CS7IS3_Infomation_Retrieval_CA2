Canada's Disarmament Envoy, Ms. Peggy Mason, who is slated to chair the U.N. Secretary General's Expert Group on Verification, arrived here via Kathmandu to discuss the leading questions of disarmament with India at the official level. She is understood to have sought India's active cooperation in the UN Conference on Disarmament. India's initiative in this sphere is widely recognised, and dates back to 1982. The Action Plan enunciated by the late Rajiv Gandhi in 1988 had also called for an international verification regime under U.N. auspices.
