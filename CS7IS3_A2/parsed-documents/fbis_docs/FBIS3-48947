(The screening law passed by the now-defunct Czechoslovak Federal Parliament in 1991 bars former Communist Party officials, and members of the former State Secret Police (StB) and the People's Militia, from high economic and political posts until 1996.) Meciar has asked the Constitutional Court to rule that the law runs contrary to the Slovak Constitution. SME carries an interview with chairman of the opposition Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) Jan Carnogursky, who points out that the law has already been dealt with by the Constitutional Court of the former Czechoslovakia, which ruled that only two of its provisions contradicted the Constitution, primarily the Charter of Fundamental Freedoms and Human Rights, which was adopted into the former Czechoslovak Constitution. The Slovak Republic included the Charter into its own Constitution without changes, Carnogursky recalls, which means that if the Constitutional Court has ruled once on the law's compatibility with the Constitution, it should now ignore any reservations raised by the Government. Eva Poganyova, a spokesperson for Egyutteles, a Hungarian minority movement in Slovakia, says on the same topic that Meciar's stance on the lustration issue has been "unclear" since 1990. She questions the sincerity of Meciar's efforts to cleanse Slovak civic and political life of StB agents. Poganyova describes the screening law as "imperfect" and stresses that it has been a political weapon in the hands of those in power from the very beginning. Democratic Left Party (SDL) Deputy Chairman Dusan Dorotin says in the daily that SDL reservations against the lustration law as a legal norm contradicting the Slovak Constitution are generally known. Dorotin says the SDL will support all moves aimed at putting the end to the psychosis of collective suspicion and at creating an atmosphere of decent respect towards the principles of a law-abiding state.
