Meanwhile, the frightful drop in the value of the dollar against the Japanese yen compelled U.S. President Bill Clinton to call on the Treasury Department to take immediate steps to strengthen the dollar. It should be noted that on Thursday [23 June] the U.S. dollar sold at less than 100 Japanese yen, which is the lowest exchange rate since World War II. The value of the dollar against the German mark also dropped to less than 1.60 German marks to the dollar. International economic experts believe that until 1985, when the (Plaza) Accord was implemented to reduce America's trade deficit with Japan and Germany and the drop in the value of the dollar against European currencies and the Japanese yen were taken into consideration, the U.S. dollar was equal to 260 Japanese yen. This exchange rate has now dropped by more than 60 percent. The policy of dropping the value of the dollar, which was initially started in order to reduce America's trade deficit with Japan and Germany, gave rise to hopes that Japan's imports would increase while its exports would drop. However, although this had negative impacts on Japan, it was unable to correct the Tokyo-Washington trade deficit, which is expected to reach $70 billion this year. Yesterday the central banks of Europe, Japan, and the United States intervened in the foreign exchange markets in order to strengthen the U.S. dollar; by purchasing dollars, they tried to prevent a further drop in its current value. However, Western monetary experts are worried that the drop in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to less than 100 Japanese yen will further accelerate the drop in the value of the U.S. currency. Also, Wall Street monetary sources believe that although increased bank interest rates in the United States may strengthen the dollar, it will result in a drop in the price of shares and bond rates and that the experience of past economic crises in the United States may be repeated. The question now is what impact the drop in the dollar against European currencies and the yen will have on the countries exporting raw materials, especially oil. Since oil is mostly paid for in dollars, and the oil-exporting countries import more from Europe and Japan than from the United States, the drop in the value of the dollar against the yen and the German mark will actually have a negative impact on the regional countries' petrodollar purchasing powers. That is why reducing oil incomes' dependence on the dollar and diversifying the foreign currencies earned from oil exports is being carefully considered by the economic experts of the OPEC member countries.
