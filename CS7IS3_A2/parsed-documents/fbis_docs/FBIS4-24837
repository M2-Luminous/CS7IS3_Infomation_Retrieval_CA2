Liang, 64, took over from Samuel Shieh, whose five-year term expired Tuesday. A trusted economic adviser to President Li Teng-hui, Liang is the first native Taiwanese to fill the governor's post. With a doctorate in economics, Liang has spent most of his career in banking and is considered by many as an enlightened banker who believes the central bank should adjust its policies in line with market forces. Speaking at the changeover ceremony attended by hundreds of well-wishers, Liang said he will continue to promote financial liberalization and internationalization during his five-year tenure. He said he will first seek to develop Taiwan into a regional "funding center" to provide capital for financial institutions and private enterprises at home and abroad. "I think this is not a difficult goal to reach as we already have a foreign currency call-loan market that allow banks to borrow and lend from each other," Liang explained. He said he will push for faster liberalization of the local financial service markets, allowing more foreign banks to set up branches in Taiwan. "The entry of more foreign banks will facilitate our bid to become a regional funding center and eventually a regional financial hub," he noted. Liang also said he will maintain the current "measured" easy credit policy, but will tighten monitoring of lending practices of local banks to ensure that new bank loans, particularly medium and long-term loans, are extended to the manufacturing sector to bolster domestic economic development. As the Taiwan economy has failed to recover as fast as expected, Liang said the central bank may induce further reductions in local interest rates to prod private investment willingness. Noting that the central bank's most important responsibility is to maintain price stability, Liang said he won't sit idle and let the local currency's value drop drastically simply because of market speculation. He said that although the local currency's 2.4 percent depreciation over the past month may benefit exporters, it may also fuel inflationary pressure and thus destabilize commodity price stability and hinder economic growth. In addition, Liang said, he will make the central bank's policy-making process clear to the public, and will upgrade its level of professionalism and protect it from political interference. He also promised to let more people with a reputation for specialized knowledge and integrity take part in the bank's decision-making process.
