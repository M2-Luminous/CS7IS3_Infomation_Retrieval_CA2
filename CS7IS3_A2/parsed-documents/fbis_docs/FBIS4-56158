These certificates will thus earn a lower annual interest rate plus monetary correction which will be determined at the maturity date. This means investors will know their profits on the maturity date of the document. Savings accounts will continue to earn the Referential Interest Rate, TR, plus a 6-percent annual interest. If the banks en mass adopt the URV, the Central Bank will have to modify the TR calculation formula. The TR is currently calculated on the interests paid by the prefixed CDB which is a preestablished interest-earning paper that does not receive monetary correction.
