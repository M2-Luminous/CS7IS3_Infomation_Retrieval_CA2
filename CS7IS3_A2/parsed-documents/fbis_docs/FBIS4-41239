Awcharenka begins by saying that polling stations opened five hours earlier to elect "the first president in the history of Belarus," however this historic event was not accompanied by "crowds lining up to cast their votes." He adds that according to reports from various oblasts, voting is still "gaining momentum." Correspondent Ivan Hladkin, reporting live from the Central Electoral Commission, says that 7,326,550 people are "included on the lists for voting by secret ballot." Over the 10 days granted by the law for those unable to come to the polls on 23 June, some 279,938 people have cast their votes, which amounts to 3.8 percent of the total number of voters. As of 0900 GMT, 39.1 percent of voters have come to the polls in Brest Oblast and voting has been completed at 15 polling stations: - In Gomel Oblast -- 38 percent have voted, voting completed at 11 polling stations; - In Vitebsk Oblast -- 37.2 percent, voting completed at 19 polling stations; - In Mogilev Oblast -- 35 percent, voting completed at five polling stations; - In Grodno Oblast -- 33.6 percent, voting completed at 12 polling stations; - In Minsk Oblast -- 33.2 percent, voting completed at five polling stations. "Only" 20 percent of voters have turned out by 0900 in the city of Minsk. According to Hladkin, a number of people's deputies representing Popular Front Chairman Zyanon Paznyak have sent a motion to the Central Electoral Commission claiming that at one of the polling stations in Smalyavichskiy Rayon, people were forced to vote for one of the candidates. The commission has passed the motion to the prosecutor's office. Several other "petty" violations have been monitored at other stations. Vyachaslaw Makalchuk, reporter from Pinsk, then makes a telephone call to the studio and briefs the listeners on the situation in the city and the cost of holding the elections in the city. Makalchuk says that voter turnout has been "good" and by 1000 GMT "a majority of Pinsk Oblast voters" will have cast their votes. Program moderator Awcharenka then reads a report received from the Belarusian Embassy in the United States, which says that the Boston city administration resolved to "hoist a Belarusian flag over the city on 23-25 June" as a "symbol of solidarity of one democratic state with another." Program moderator Awcharenka then concludes the program saying that the next live connection with the Central Electoral Commission will be at 1200 GMT.
