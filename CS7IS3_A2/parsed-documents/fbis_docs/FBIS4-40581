Our greeting comes to you from Belarus. To be more precise, it is from that unique place where the borders of the three sovereign states, Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine, converge. A meeting of the leaders of the Russian, Ukrainian, and Belarusian Agrarian Parties took place this spring here at the Friendship Monument. Worldly wisdom tells us that peasants should be growing grain and not be engaged in politics. However, the reality of our life proves otherwise. A number of documents that will coordinate the parties' activities were signed at this meeting and the opinion of those gathered here was that this political act today could become the beginning of the movement toward the re-creation of the union of the three Slavic states, and possibly, a single state. [Begin recording] [Biryukov] These are not political ambitions. Even with the most cursory of analyses, we can see the worsening situation and the decline in the standard of living of the peasants, and the population of Russia in general. Probably the same situation exists in Belarus and Ukraine, and it shows that the basic reason for it is this artificial, forced breakdown of the former great state. [Sharetskiy] The peasants are the most landed sector of the population and that is why we, before anyone else, sensed that the purely human need to produce, to recreate that which we had and lost. [Dovgal] I think that the Belarus and Ukraine state systems will regenerate and strengthen if we work in a unified space like this. [end recording] The peasant politicians' pronouncements, like the documents they signed, so far are nothing more that a beautiful gesture, the same as the sowing of seed that took place at the monument near the border of the three sovereign states. Belarus' and Ukraine's mutual relations with the third brother, Russia, will most probably depend to a great degree on the results of the presidential elections. Namely, the Belarusian and Ukrainian Republics' future political and economic directions will be determined after the elections.
