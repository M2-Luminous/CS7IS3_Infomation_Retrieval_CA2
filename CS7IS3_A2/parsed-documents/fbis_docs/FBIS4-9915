According to the new rules, investments in Ecuador's private sector will not require a patent, license, registration, permit, or certificate. Meanwhile, numerous decrees, laws, and administrative rules that had placed restrictions or limitations on industry and free trade were repealed. The price of all local or imported goods, products, and services will be subject only to the free market laws without state controls, which means their prices will be established by the law of supply and demand, based on their quality and price. The new rules state that all products, goods, and livestock will be allowed free movement, transportation, and transit across the country without having to obtain a license or administrative authorization. Also, from now on, all Ecuadoran goods and products are exportable, with a few exceptions subject to quotas, restrictions, or limitations foreseen in the Law for Expediting Exports and Over Water Routes.
