Washington is also fostering UN sanctions against North Korea. The aim of all these efforts is to force Pyongyang to allow an inspection of its nuclear program installations. The International Atomic Energy Agency inspected all but two of those nuclear installations between 1 and 5 March. Now in its report it is trying to force the opening of the plants not visited to verification, although the North Korean Government has rejected the U.S. military threats as being harmful to its national sovereignty. President William Clinton is sponsoring punitive measures against North Korea through the UN Security Council such as by cutting financial, grain, or fuel supplies. Meanwhile, military pressure against Pyongyang continues.
