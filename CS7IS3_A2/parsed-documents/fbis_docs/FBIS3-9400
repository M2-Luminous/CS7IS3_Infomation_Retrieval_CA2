He was on a lightning visit to Hungary on Monday [21 March], and this morning he left for a scheduled visit to Israel. This country, which was not accessible to us until recently, is becoming an interesting partner for Slovakia. Besides economic cooperation, we are also interested in cooperation in the military sphere. Our editor Jan Baranek interviewed Defense Minister Kanis before his departure. [Begin recording] [Baranek] Minister, you will be leaving for Israel in a few hours. What will be the main themes of your talks with the Israeli partner? [Kanis] This visit has been under preparation for a fairly long time. I was thinking whether it would serve any purpose to go on this visit so soon after taking office. After consultations, my colleagues and I gained the impression that the visit was well prepared and that we should go because these relations with Israel are interesting and important to us. The objective of the visit will be, first of all, an exchange of experience in the field of the arms industry and arms systems. We are small countries that can complement each other in some areas of this type of production. Meetings with the prime minister and the foreign minister are scheduled, and, therefore, foreign policy issues and the international situation will also be on the agenda. I will be accompanied by several people from the economic sector and from Slovak arms factories. I assume that they and their partners will discuss the opportunities for cooperation or for trade. [Baranek] What will be the Slovak delegations's stance on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? Would you like to link it to the policy of the former Czech and Slovak Federal Republic? [Kanis] Probably not. Our opinion on Israeli-Arab relations is guided by the relevant UN resolutions, including the latest resolution made on the issue. I think our country is far away from this territory, and, therefore, we have to keep a certain overview of Israeli-Arab relations. In my opinion, Slovakia's foreign policy on this conflict and on these relations is well balanced and meets the preconditions and the criterion of a certain overview on the matter. [end recording]
