Where do the talks stand? What points have been agreed upon? [Ghawshah] Doubtless, agreement has been reached on numerous points but we have not yet received an Israeli response to several others. At the Davos meeting, several points were raised to which Israeli Foreign Minister Peres gave no answer. He said he wished to consult with Israeli Prime Minister Rabin and would return with a response. We are awaiting the Israeli reply to see how much momentum it would impart to the negotiations. Failing this, we will stay in the vicious circle in which Israel wants the negotiations to revolve. This is the result of Israel's hardline attitude and intransigence. [Al-Jundi] Do you believe the meeting with the Israeli foreign minister in Cairo today will lay the foundations to implement the Declaration of Principles? [Ghawshah] If Israel shows a positive attitude, this will remove many hurdles and make it possible to reach agreement within days. If Israel maintains a hardline position, the vicious circle will persist. [Al-Jundi] Dr. Ghawshah, observers ask that if all these problems have occurred in the initial stages of implementing the Declaration of Principles, what will happen when many other complicated problems, now postponed, are tackled? Does the pessimistic outlook that keeps emerging also affect the PLO leaders? [Ghawshah] The Israeli positions raise eyebrows, especially as the Palestinians have shown much flexibility and made many concessions. Instead of responding favorably, Israel has persisted with its hardline attitudes. We believe that the Palestinians are more flexible and more committed to implementing the agreement on the specified dates. [Al-Jundi] There is, doubtless, a great difference between flexibility and making concessions, is there not? [Ghawshah] As I have said, we, the Palestinians, have shown much flexibility. We made concessions sometimes to surmount the obstacles barring the implementation of the agreement. The Israelis, in return, adopted a hardline position and are still making proposals that are not close to the agreement's text and do not show a real commitment to implement it on the specified dates. [Al-Jundi] Dr. Ghawshah, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin often discusses security. Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres announces that no concessions can be made on security. Do the Israelis realize that security is also a Palestinian concern? [Ghawshah] We have approached the security issue as such. But the other side exaggerates the issue and claims that some issues are security affairs when they're not. We think that continuing Israeli intransigence and stubbornness on some positions will not achieve security, but constitute a future threat to it. [Al-Jundi] Dr. Ghawshah, Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat will arrive in Cairo tomorrow and meet President Muhammad Husni Mubarak. Can we say that this a sign that 'Arafat will not meet Peres or will only come to Cairo after the Palestinian delegation has conducted lengthy discussions with the Israeli foreign minister and possibly reached real results that merely need a signature? [Ghawshah] Brother Abu-'Ammar's [Yasir 'Arafat] visit to Cairo and his meeting with President Mubarak will deal with bilateral ties. This is important to the Palestinians. They will also consult on numerous issues. We cannot link the date of this visit with Peres' visit. As for 'Arafat's meeting with Peres, or possibly with Rabin or others, this will depend on the progress in the negotiations and on Israel's willingness to overcome the hurdles and reach an agreement. [Al-Jundi] Can we say that 'Arafat's failure to come to meet Peres in Cairo today is a Palestinian message indicating that 'Arafat's talks with the Israeli foreign minister are futile? [Ghawshah] We cannot say that. But we do not think it is necessary for 'Arafat to meet Peres in all the ongoing meetings. Remember, the basic meetings are between the delegations and the members of the Liaison Committee. Although the need occasionally arises for a meeting between President 'Arafat and an Israeli delegation headed by Peres, we basically believe that President 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Rabin should hold a meeting. Its purpose would be to reach a final agreement and sign it. [Al-Jundi] We thank our guest Dr. Samir Ghawshah, a member of the PLO Executive Committee. You are always welcome. Thank you. [Ghawshah] Do not mention it.
