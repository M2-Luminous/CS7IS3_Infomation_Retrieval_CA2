FBIS4-23529 "drafr110_c_94011" FBIS-AFR-94-110 Daily Report 8 Jun 1994 SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 7 Jun South African Press Review for 7 Jun MB0706170494 MB0706170494 BFN [Editorial Report] THE STAR Africa Urged To Solve Own Problems -- "The `new vision for Africa' outlined by President Mugabe of Zimbabwe last week is yet another expression of what appears to be a growing determination throughout the continent to overcome its problems of poverty, backwardness, foreign debt and ethnic strife," begins the Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 7 June in a page-10 editorial. "His vision of an Africa that will `take charge of its own development and learn from the lessons of the past' will have the ardent support of all Africans and of many of their First World creditors." The editorial continues, however, by warning that these solutions "must be more than interim remedies." "Whatever methods are adopted -- whether by the Southern African Development Community, the OAU or any other body -- they are unlikely to be effective unless they are based on two proven realities. First, that disputes are best resolved through negotiations and, second, that poverty is best combated by free enterprise." BEELD White Referendum Issue Viewed -- "There is widespread appreciation for President Mandela's attempts to enter into negotiations with all parties and organizations as head of state. His willingness to negotiate with the right wing, even though they severely criticized him and his party during the election, is an example of his fairness," begins a page-6 editorial in Afrikaans in the Johannesburg BEELD on 6 June. "However, the time has come for the president and his advisers to decide what course of action to follow as far as the right wing is concerned." "President Mandela has mentioned the possibility that a referendum could be held among whites or Afrikaners to test support for a homeland. Although that possibility will not be easily realized, it creates expectations and injects new life into a dying idea." "President Mandela should guard against creating the impression that he and his advisers are pandering to the demands of the far-right. It seems as if they have not fully realized that Dr. Ferdi Hartzenberg and Mr. Eugene Terreblanche do not really have noteworthy support. There is no burning desire among Afrikaners and/or whites for a referendum on a homeland. The overwhelming majority want to be part of the new order and want to be left in peace to make their contribution." Peacekeeping Force Disbandment Welcomed -- A second editorial on the same page notes that "few people will shed tears over the disbanding of the National Peacekeeping Force. The project went ahead despite warnings that one would be looking for trouble if one took people with different backgrounds and threw them together for a quick training exercise." "The project costed the country millions. The old defense force gave 34 million rand from its budget to the peacekeeping force. In addition to this the huge salaries they demanded and received had a ripple effect on other sectors of the security forces. Maybe some of these soldiers can be drawn into the South Africa National Defense Force's planned service brigade. We only hope that if some of them are roped in to build roads and bridges that their work will be satisfactory."
