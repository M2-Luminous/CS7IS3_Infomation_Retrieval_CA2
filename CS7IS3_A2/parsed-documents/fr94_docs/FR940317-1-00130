(1) Liability of Through Government Bill of Lading (TGBL) or International Through Government Bill of Lading (ITGBL) carriers for household goods shipments is as stated on the GBL. The TGBL carrier may be liable for the full depreciated value of the claim or the current replacement cost of items, without application of depreciation, if the owner purchased replacement cost protection (RCP), also known as ``full replacement protection''. (See DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 2&hyph;51.) For the purpose of computing weight, each piece or package shipped constitutes one article. Any article taken apart or ``knocked down'' for handling constitutes one article. Individual article weights are listed in the Joint Military_Industry Table of Weights in DA Pam 27&hyph;162, Table G&hyph;1. (2) Liability of ITGBL carriers for hold baggage shipments (Codes 7, 8, and J) is normally 60 cents per pound times the gross weight per container (or current contract liability). Excess valuation or RCP is not available on such shipments. (See DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 3&hyph;11.) (3) Liability of domestic freight carriers of household goods shipments is generally stated to be 10 cents per pound per article on the GBL. Excess valuation or RCP is not available on such shipments. For the purpose of computing weight under this type of shipment, each packed item (such as a dish) constitutes one item or article. (Also see DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 3&hyph;15.) (4) Liability of commercial airlines is stated on the GBL. Excess valuation or RCP is not available on such shipments. (See DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 3&hyph;17.) (b) Non-temporary storage (NTS) contractors.

Under this agreement (DOD 4500.34&hyph;R, app H), an NTS contractor is liable for a maximum of $50.00 per inventory line item. (As an exception to this rule, regardless of the way a rank is listed on the inventory, only one charge of $50.00 can be applied when liability is calculated.) The contractor may be liable to the full extent of the declared value if the owner purchased an insurance policy from the warehouse firm. No liability can be pursued against the NTS contractor when goods are given out to a carrier unless an exception sheet was prepared by the carrier showing any differences as to shortages or overages or the condition of items.The exception sheet must be signed and dated by a representative of the warehouse to be valid. (c) Packing and containerization contractors. A local contractor is liable for loss or damage in the amount of 60 cents per pound (or current contract liability) times the weight per article as stated in the liability clause of the contract. Each shipping piece or package constitutes one article. Excess valuation or RCP is not available on such shipments.
