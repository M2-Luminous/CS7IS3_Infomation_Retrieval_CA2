During the news conference held yesterday by the leaders of the Democratic Party-National Salvation Front [PD-FSN], Messrs. Petre Roman and Adrian Severin expressed their worry over the possibility that Romania might not be among the countries that would be integrated into NATO first. Romania's integration into that body would both ensure national security and represent our country's acknowledgment as a part of the free world, the PD-FSN representatives said. The vice chairman of the National Romanian Unity Party [PUNR], Mr. Ion Gavra, announced yesterday that his party had requested that the suggestions included in its anticrisis program should be implemented by the government within a so-called austerity program that is to be presented in parliament at the beginning of February. A communique released yesterday by the Greater Romania Party [PRM] announces that they learned with deep concern about the decisions taken by the Satu Mare and Maramures County Councils on their adherence to the so-called Euro-Carpathian region, an artificial structure that endangers Romania's security and integrity. The PRM demands that the illegal decisions of the two chairmen of the aforementioned county councils should immediately be annulled.
