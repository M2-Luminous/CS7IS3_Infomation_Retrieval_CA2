Havas and Ferenc Koszeg; place and date not given: "If the Liberal Parties Together...."] [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [BESZELO] In your speech [at the national meeting of deputies, 28-31 January] you said that the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] is a true people's party. At the former meeting of deputies, you used the term social-liberal people's party. Contrary to this, our political opponents, including the prime minister himself, has often said that the SZDSZ is a civic radical, rather than a liberal, party. Does this kind of distinction mean anything and does it have anything to say for us? [Peto] Today these terms are not unequivocal in Hungary. If I call the SZDSZ a people's party, this in itself does not clearly define the SZDSZ for others. However, it can be used as a self-definition. The SZDSZ can be called a people's party in the sense that it has become a lasting institution of Hungarian society, and no one any longer assumes that it will play an insignificant role in the elections. For the SZDSZ to achieve similar results to those in the 1990 elections, the support of the intelligentsia who follow otherwise attractive turn-of-the-century civic radical traditions is not enough -- just as it would not have been enough in 1990, either. Today, it is possible to find many people in all strata of Hungarian society who are receptive to the political efforts -- which by no means can be called civic radical -- represented by the SZDSZ. The SZDSZ's supporters and members are represented in all strata of society, and the reason they vote for us can also be grasped to a certain extent. It might be easier to put this into words in negative statements. They vote for us because they seek a kind of party for themselves that is not like the current government parties, not like the current Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], and not like the current Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz]. However, it is also possible to explain the differences because the SZDSZ's image has been established fairly firmly over the past five years. It is a party of modernization that does not delve much into history or ideology, and does not formulate Christian-national or other similar goals that can be seen as ideological goals. It professes to be liberal, but at the same time, the difference from, for example, the Fidesz can be perceived, and this is when we say we are social-liberal. [passage omitted] [BESZELO] What kind of cooperation would you consider desirable between the liberal parties, especially the two "big" ones, namely the SZDSZ and the Fidesz? [Peto] It would be desirable for these two parties if, rather than eyeing each other distrustfully, their cooperation was determined by common interests. If I accept that these are two clearly distinct parties, not only in age but now also in their principles, it would be good if they represented their own principles until the first round in the elections and put their own candidates in the best possible positions, while in the second round, in accordance with the principles laid down in the SZDSZ-Fidesz agreement, candidates would be mutually withdrawn, and we would try to determine the character of the next government through forming a small coalition. This would be the optimal situation but I would not like to appear unaware of the obstacles. In spite of the agreement, the Fidesz is putting much energy into differentiating itself from the SZDSZ by strengthening its own identity, even in cases when cooperation would be better. There is no point in denying that the Fidesz's goal is to become a bigger liberal party than the SZDSZ, and it is putting an awful lot of energy into this. It is also obvious that the Fidesz would be happier to form a coalition with the current government coalition than with the MSZP. However, in the SZDSZ's view, one is worse than the other, and, therefore, it does not yet want to decide on this issue. Finally, it would be no use denying that there is a fair amount of mutual mistrust. I do not know what the Fidesz actually thinks and what it is just saying or doing for tactical reasons; however, its behavior is determined by the unfounded assumption that the SZDSZ has intimate relations with the MSZP. On the other hand, the SZDSZ is suspicious because there are many signs that the Fidesz has particular links with the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] and the government. [passage omitted] [BESZELO] Actually, it would be of vital interest to the Fidesz to try to reduce the mistrust because it is obvious that the liberal line could really determine the next government if a liberal small coalition were formed before the actual government were. [Peto] This is true but it is not always the practical solutions that happen. For a long time -- here there is no change -- the Fidesz has been forming its relations with the SZDSZ from viewpoints of rivalry, rather than general political principles. In certain cases in the past, we could have achieved much more if the Fidesz, rather than seeing the assertion of its self-identity as the main task, had looked at the issue itself on which we could have worked together. However, we have to accept the Fidesz as it is. It would be bad politics to impose our own norms on them. If the Fidesz thinks that it can only work in a coalition where the MDF is on one side, perhaps the SZDSZ on the other, and the Fidesz in the middle, this indicates what they might do. If, in addition to this, they did not consult the MDF before making this decision, the MDF could all of a sudden upset the whole thing by saying that it cannot imagine a coalition with the SZDSZ; if in the meantime, the Fidesz could not afford to be angry with the MDF so became angry with the SZDSZ even for this, well, this would be bad luck, but what could one do? The two big liberal parties with the Agrarian Federation and the Entrepreneurs' Party can only jointly be sure of becoming inevitable parts of the government. Whatever kind of coalition is formed, if only one liberal party is part of it, then its importance will be much less than its numerical proportion. However, the liberal parties together could be a determining force in any coalition.
