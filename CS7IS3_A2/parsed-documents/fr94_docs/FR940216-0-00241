(b) Defenses for prohibited activities. (1) In any case in which a refiner, importer, oxygenate blender, carrier, distributor, reseller, retailer, or wholesale purchaser-consumer would be in violation under paragraph (a) of this section, it shall be deemed not in violation if it can demonstrate: (i) That the violation was not caused by the regulated party or its employee or agent; (ii) That product transfer documents account for all of the gasoline in the storage tank found in violation and indicate that the gasoline met relevant requirements; and (iii)(A) That it has conducted a quality assurance sampling and testing program, as described in paragraph (c) of this section; except that (B) A carrier may rely on the quality assurance program carried out by another party, including the party that owns the gasoline in question, provided that the quality assurance program is carried out properly. (2)(i) Where a violation is found at a facility which is operating under the corporate, trade or brand name of a refiner, that refiner must show, in addition to the defense elements required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section, that the violation was caused by: (A) An act in violation of law (other than the Act or this part), or an act of sabotage or vandalism; (B) The action of any reseller, distributor, oxygenate blender, carrier, or a retailer or wholesale purchaser- consumer supplied by any of these persons, in violation of a contractual undertaking imposed by the refiner designed to prevent such action, and despite periodic sampling and testing by the refiner to ensure compliance with such contractual obligation; or (C) The action of any carrier or other distributor not subject to a contract with the refiner but engaged by the refiner for transportation of gasoline, despite specification or inspection of procedures and equipment by the refiner which are reasonably calculated to prevent such action.
