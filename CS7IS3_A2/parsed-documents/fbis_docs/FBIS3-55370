It is strange that lawmakers have no idea of who is responsible for what and direct their interpolation "to the wrong address," Stasiukynas said at a press conference Wednesday [5 January]. The parliament's rightist opposition demands to take a vote of confidence in the minister for allegedly allowing to burn toxic fuel in boiler houses of several Lithuanian towns and regions. The opposition said the step resulted in numerous gas-poisoning cases. Stasiukynas said Absorbent A-1, the toxic fuel used in some areas, will be collected and stored in a special reservoir of the Elektrenai thermal electric power station. The minister said there are several ways to get rid of the fuel. Experts suggest either to burn it at the Akmene cement factory and in Elektrenai, or to take the absorbent out of the country. The minister said poisonous substances are emitted only when the fuel is burned in low temperatures. In theory, toxic substances should also be emitted when the absorbent is burned in high temperatures, but laboratory tests proved the opposite, he said. Additional tests will reportedly be made in the West. Stasiukynas said Tuesday that the fuel was unlawfully imported by the Lithuania-USA company Lamaringas and sold to the state-run company Siluma (Heat). The importer forged customs documents, which indicated a different kind of fuel, he said. The first warning signals came from the Environmental Protection Department last May. Stasiukynas said his ministry immediately began a search for places where the fuel was used. All absorbent users were known by July-August and all reservoirs containing the fuel were sealed. The minister said the only incident occurred in the town of Kelme where some fuel spilled through a leaky pipe.
