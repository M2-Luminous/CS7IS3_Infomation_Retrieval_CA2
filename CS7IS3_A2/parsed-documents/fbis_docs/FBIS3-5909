FBIS3-5909 "dreas048_d_94021" FBIS-EAS-94-048 Document Type:Daily Report 11 Mar 1994 South Korea Citibank Foreign Exchange Outflow Investigated SK1103092694 Seoul YONHAP in English 0847 GMT 11 Mar 94 SK1103092694 Seoul YONHAP Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Seoul, March 11 (YONHAP) -- The Office of Bank Supervision is investigating a report on the alleged outflow of foreign exchange at Citibank's Seoul branch. An official at the office said, "we are investigating the Seoul branch of Citibank after it was reported that the bank secretly sent out an enormous amount of money to a foreign country in a transaction with a religious group." "NAEIL SINMUN," a weekly newsmagazine, reported in a recent issue that the Seoul branch of Citibank accepted a deposit of more than 10 billion won (about 12.36 million U.S. dollars) at low annual interest rates of 1-6 percent and had Citibank's Hong Kong branch illegally pay a person affiliated with the religious group 1.3 billion won. According to the report, Citibank drew up an interest swap contract with a company in Hong Kong to provide an annual 8.84 percent forward exchange rate in June 1991 and to receive spot exchange rates slightly higher than the London inter-bank offered rate (libor). The bank claimed to have suffered a loss in the contract, which said it should pay higher interest than the actual rate, while in reality giving a sum equal to the loss through Citibank's Hong Kong branch to someone designated by the religious group, the report said. NAEIL SINMUN reported that Citibank's Seoul branch paid a relatively high interest rate, while international interest rates were dropping, because it intended to send foreign exchange to a foreign country under the pretense of a legal final transaction. Citibank said the Hong Kong company with which it made the swap contract is a British bank, but failed to explain clearly why the firm is not registered in the colony. Citibank said, however, that the religious group's deposit and the swap contract are unrelated and that banks often suffer losses in swap transactions. The bank claimed that NAEIL SINMUN wrote a distorted report, saying, "We are studying legal action against the weekly."
