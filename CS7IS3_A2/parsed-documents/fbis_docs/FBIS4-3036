"We have expressed our concern about the medan labor rioting to the Indonesian Government and have ordered our representative office in Jakarta to strengthen protection for our businessmen there," said Ouyang Jui-hsiung, director of the Ministry's Department of Information and Cultural Affairs. According to foreign wire service reports, a labor protest at a medan factory over wages and holiday bonus payments last Thursday turned into a highly-charged race riot against the economically dominant ethnic Chinese. Banks, shops and cars in Medan and several other Sumatran cities were attacked and one person was reported killed. Ouyang, quoting reports from Taipei's representative office in Jakarta, said the riot in Medan has almost been quelled and life there has begun to return to normal. He added it remains to be seen whether the incident would affect the government's "southern strategy," which encourages Taiwan manufacturers to invest more in southeast Asia instead of Mainland China. "We'll keep close watch on developments in Indonesia," he noted. Vice Economic Affairs Minister Yang Shih-chien told a Legislative Yuan committee meeting that the Medan labor riot has not inflicted any damage on Taiwan-owned companies in Indonesia. Yang pointed out Taiwan businessmen are generally regarded as "foreigners" in Indonesia, so they have not been affected by the anti-ethnic Chinese sentiment there. Another Vice Economic Affairs Minister, S.J. Li, also said the ROC need not change its "southern strategy" simply because of the recent labor riot in Indonesia. "The Indonesian Government is obligated to protect Taiwan investors since the two countries signed an investment guarantee agreement in 1990," Li explained. During his recent visit to Jakarta, Li, on behalf of the ROC government, further signed a reciprocal tax exemption accord with Indonesia to avoid double taxation on investors from each side. "Indonesian officials once assured me that Indonesia seeks steady economic development and will do its best to protect foreign investors," Li noted. "I believe Indonesia will properly resolve its recent labor unrest soon," Li said. Taiwan is the third largest foreign investor in Indonesia after Japan and Hong Kong, with its total investment standing at US$4.03 billion at the end of 1993.
