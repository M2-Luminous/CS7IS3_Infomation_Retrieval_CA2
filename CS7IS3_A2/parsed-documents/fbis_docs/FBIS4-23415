SAVANA reports the former soldiers feel they were treated differently from other troops demobilized from assembly areas. They are demanding the payment of 18 months of salaries [words indistinct], pension, and what they regard as perks given to other demobilized troops. SAVANA says Chissano made the pledge at a meeting held in Maputo on 13 May with a commission representing the 16,000 demobilized soldiers. The demobilized soldiers say if their demands are not met they will destroy business centers owned by Mozambican officials, boycott the 25 June and 25 September celebrations, and prevent multiparty elections from being held in October.
