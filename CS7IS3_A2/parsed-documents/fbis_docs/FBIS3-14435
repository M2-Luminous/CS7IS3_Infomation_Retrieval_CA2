FBIS3-14435 "drnes059_o_94003" FBIS-NES-94-059 Document Type:Daily Report 25 Mar 1994 SYRIA Commentary on `Israel's Destructive Role' in Lebanon JN2503151694 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network in Arabic 1230 GMT 25 Mar 94 JN2503151694 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [Station commentary] [Text] Judiciary investigations in Lebanon have revealed the involvement of some Mosad-linked groups in the blowing up of the Sayyidat al-Najat Church, as well as their attempts to plant other explosives at schools and public places in order to create confusion, undermine national accord, and destroy understanding, stability, and salvation in Lebanon. Detained suspects have confessed that they were instructed by Israeli Mosad officers. The conspiracy is large and serious. It has claimed many lives, and might have claimed the lives of many schoolboys. It targets the Lebanese entity, the Lebanese accord, and Lebanese independence. The Government of Lebanon dissolved the Lebanese Forces Party after it convicted several of its prominent members of involvement in the Mosad's plan. Blowing up the Sayyidat al-Najat Church, which brought death and injury to many people, followed the Israeli massacre at the holy Ibrahimi Mosque. Israel believed it could hit two birds with one stone: Covering up the brutal Hebron massacre and destroying the large strides Lebanon has taken on the road to national accord. In the person of the Mosad, Israel planted several time bombs at schools and public places -- bombs that would have killed many people, if not for the efforts of the Lebanese forces that defused them. The Israelis planned for the bombing conspiracy to increase internal tension to an explosive point, allowing the Mosad to exploit the sectarian issue. As a result, the Lebanese soon found themselves on the brink of a new civil war, the national accord was dissolving, and the sound of treacherous gunfire was again heard. Israel wants to avenge Lebanon and the Lebanese because they have stopped their infighting, restored the Lebanese motherland and its genuine traditions of love and coexistence, and got down to work to build their country and restore its vital role in the Arab and international communities, in full coordination with Syria. In fact, Israel's daily brutal aggressions against southern Lebanese villages and cities cannot be isolated from the bombing plan. It is all the same conspiracy, designed to return Lebanon to the furnace of civil war, destruction, and agony by creating a situation in which brothers kill brothers, children die under the rubble of burning houses, women lose their sons, the homeland is wiped out, and sectarian sedition rises up amid the roar of guns. All this raises a series of persisting questions about Israel's destructive role in Lebanon and the region. How can Israel's peace allegations correspond with blowing up the Sayyidat al-Najat Church in Juniyah, with planting bombs in Lebanon, and with raining shells on the southern Lebanese people? While the Israeli Government claims it had no information about plans to carry out the holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, it cannot disavow Mosad's plans to blow up churches and schools in Lebanon. The Israeli Army also committed a new massacre after the holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. Yesterday, it used tank rockets to destroy homes in Hebron, causing scores of casualties among Palestinian civilians. Israel's treacherous shells cause scores of casualties among the Palestinians and the Lebanese every day. Israel does not care if the victims are women or children. What is important is to ruin the Lebanese situation and destroy the Palestinian intifadah. The results, however, run counter to Israel's expectations. The Lebanese have enhanced their cohesion and exposed Israel's games. Lebanon's healthy situation and its accord will block every conspiracy. The Palestinians have also become more determined to continue their struggle and offer sacrifices. They are no longer frightened by Israel's tanks or guns. Israel's destructive role in the region and the peace process and its attempt to plunge the Middle East into the furnace of sectarian conflicts are also exposed to the world. Israel wants to expand and expand. There is no way for that to happen other than via a trouble-plagued Middle East. The results of the judiciary investigations in Lebanon should open the eyes of many in the West, especially those who have sympathy for Zionism, to Israel's destructive role. This should prompt influential sides to curb its aggressive plans, which are aimed at returning to the law of the jungle and destroying peace prospects in the Middle East.
