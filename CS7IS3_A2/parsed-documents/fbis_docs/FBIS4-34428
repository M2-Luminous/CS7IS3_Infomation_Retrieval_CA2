Camacho thus announced his withdrawal from public life and politics during the present administration to devote himself to his family. [Begin Camacho recording] I am leaving the administration after having held responsible posts in times of tension. I have the peace of mind of having respected citizens' rights for social organizations, labor unions, and opposition groups, while defending at all times the government's institutions and public interests. Now, just when I had achieved a bilateral truce for Chiapas, with the government's full support, there have been expressions of criticism regarding my job. Every resource at hand has been used to spread that criticism and to portray it as the government's position. [end recording] In a letter, Camacho Solis suggested to President Salinas that the peace negotiations in Chiapas be partially taken over by Chiapas Governor Javier Lopez Moreno and also by the secretaries of finance, government and foreign affairs. [Begin Camacho recording] To achieve new progress in the peace process, it is necessary at this time to unite the military, to prevent an exacerbation of social conflicts in Chiapas, to conduct extremely careful proselytism activities in the Chiapas electoral campaign, and to design a strategy for a new phase of negotiations. [end recording] Camacho Solis also commented on recent remarks by PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] presidential candidate Ernesto Zedillo concerning the Chiapas issue. [Begin Camacho recording] His assertions regarding the Chiapas conflict have weakened the political negotiations and the role I could have played in taking new steps toward peace. [end recording] Camacho Solis emphasized that the truce agreed on in Chiapas has not failed, and it is a mistake to compare it to a delay in armed actions. He concluded by saying there are two options in this case: the achievement of peace through agreements or through war, whereby victory would be achieved through the use of weapons. President Salinas accepted Peace Commissioner Camacho's resignation. A communique states that the president acknowledged that Camacho Solis has always carried out the duties entrusted to him with honesty, skill, and political conviction. He thanked Camacho for his efforts and determination to consolidate peace in Chiapas, adding that the San Cristobal talks were an important phase in the effort to achieve a political solution of this conflict. Salinas de Gortari said that henceforth the negotiations will be coordinated by the Executive Committee directed by the governor of Chiapas.
