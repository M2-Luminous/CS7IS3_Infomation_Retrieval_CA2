In comparison with 1992, it represents a decline of Sk4.2 billion (12 percent). The report on this situation was provided by the chairman of the Slovak Chamber of the Agricultural and Food Industry, Jozef Juhas. Costs in primary agricultural production rose by Sk1.8 billion, to Sk49.4 billion, in 1993, from Sk47.6 billion in 1992. Indebtedness after the due date, arising from business transactions, increased by Sk800 million and reached Sk7.2 billion, while accounts receivable increased by Sk550 million to more than Sk6 billion. The difference between accounts payable and accounts receivable is more than Sk1.1 billion, to the disadvantage of primary agricultural production. Granted investment credit declined from Sk991 million in 1992 to Sk324 million in 1993. The investment activity of agricultural enterprises also declined. Material investments declined from Sk4.2 billion in 1992 to Sk3.8 billion in 1993, within that amount construction work almost by half--from Sk2.2 billion to Sk1.3 billion. In spite of the fact that the volume of total loans and assistance fell from Sk13.3 billion in 1992 to last year's Sk12.1 billion in 1993--that is, by Sk1.2 billion--agricultural enterprises paid Sk4.6 billion in installment payments and Sk2.2 billion in interest. In comparison with 1992, this is an increase of Sk310 million.
