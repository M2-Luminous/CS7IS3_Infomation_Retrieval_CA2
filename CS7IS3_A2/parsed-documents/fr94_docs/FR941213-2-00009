FR941213-2-00009 FR941213-2-00005 Separate Rates All five respondents have requested separate antidumping duty rates. In cases involving non-market economies, the Department's policy is to assign a separate rate only when an exporter can demonstrate the absence of both de jure and de facto governmental control over export activities. In determining whether companies should receive separate rates, we focus our attention on the exporter rather than the manufacturer, as our concern is manipulation of export prices, and we examine PRC government control of the exporter. In this case, two of the five respondents are Hong Kong exporters that are involved in joint ventures in the PRC that manufacture lighters. Since PolyCity and Cli-Claque are located outside the PRC, the PRC government does not have jurisdiction over them. Moreover, the PRC government does not have any ownership interest in these exporters and, therefore, it cannot exercise control through ownership of these companies. Further, we have no evidence on the record indicating that the PRC government exerts control over these exporters. (See, business proprietary memorandum to the file dated December 5, 1994.) On this basis, we preliminarily determine that there is no need to apply our separate rates analysis and that PolyCity and Cli-Claque are entitled to individual rates. In contrast to PolyCity and Cli-Claque, Gao Yao is a 50/50 joint venture between a Chinese company and Hong Kong company. The joint venture owns both the production and export facilities used to manufacture and export the lighters it sells to the United States. Given the direct PRC ownership in Gao Yao's export facilities, we have preliminarily determined that it is appropriate to apply our separate rates analysis to this company. COTCO's and GLIP's business licenses indicate that they are owned ``by all the people.'' As stated in the Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Silicon Carbide from the PRC (59 FR 22585, May 2, 1994) (``Silicon Carbide''), ``ownership of a company by all the people does not require the application of a single rate.'' Accordingly, these companies are eligible for consideration for a separate rate under our criteria. To establish whether a firm is entitled to a separate rate, the Department analyzes each exporting entity under a test arising out of the Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Sparklers from the PRC (56 FR 20588, May 6, 1991) (``Sparklers'') and amplified in Silicon Carbide. Under the separate rates criteria, the Department assigns separate rates only where respondents can demonstrate the absence of both de jure and de facto governmental control over export activities. 1. Absence of De Jure Control The respondents submitted a number of documents to demonstrate absence of de jure control, including two PRC laws indicating that the responsibility for managing enterprises owned by ``all the people'' is with the enterprises themselves and not with the government. These are the ``Law of the People's Republic of China on Industrial Enterprises Owned by the Whole People,'' adopted on April 13, 1988 (``1988 Law''); and the ``Regulations for Transformation of Operational Mechanism of State-Owned Industrial Enterprises,'' approved on August 23, 1992 (``1992 Regulations''). Respondents' submission also included the ``Temporary Provisions for Administration of Export Commodities,'' approved on December 21, 1992 (``Export Provisions''). The 1988 Law and 1992 Regulations shifted control from the government to the enterprises themselves. The 1988 Law provides that enterprises owned by ``all the people'' shall make their own management decisions, be responsible for their own profits and losses, choose their own suppliers and purchase their own goods and materials. The 1988 Law contains other provisions which indicate that enterprises have management independence from the government. The 1992 Regulations provide that these same enterprises can, for example, set their own prices (Article IX); make their own production decisions (Article XI); use their own retained foreign exchange (Article XII); allocate profits (Article II); sell their own products without government interference (Article X); make their own investment decisions (Article XIII); dispose of their own assets (Article XV); and hire and fire employees without government approval (Article XVII). The Export Provisions indicate those products subject to direct government control. Lighters do not appear on the Export Provisions list and are not, therefore, subject to export constraints. Consistent with Silicon Carbide, we determine that the existence of these laws demonstrates that COTCO, GLIP, and Gao Yao are not subject to de jure central government control with respect to export sales and pricing decisions. However, there is some evidence that the provisions of the above-cited laws and regulations have not been implemented uniformly among different sectors and/or jurisdictions in the PRC (see ``PRC Government Findings on Enterprise Autonomy,'' in Foreign Broadcast Information Service-China-93&hyph;133 (July 14, 1993)). Therefore, the Department has determined that a de facto analysis is critical to determine whether COTCO, Gao Yao and GLIP are subject to governmental control over export sales and pricing decisions.
