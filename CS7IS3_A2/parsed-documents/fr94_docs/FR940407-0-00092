FR940407-0-00092 FR940407-0-00014 List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 51 Administrative practice and procedure, Air pollution control, Carbon monoxide, Intergovernmental relations, Lead, Nitrogen dioxide, Ozone, Particulate matter, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Sulfur oxides, Volatile organic compounds. Dated: March 15, 1994. Carol M. Browner, Administrator. For reasons set out in the preamble, 40 CFR part 51 is amended as follows: PART 51_REQUIREMENTS FOR PREPARATION, ADOPTION, AND SUBMITTAL OF IMPLEMENTATION PLANS 1. The authority citation for part 51 continues to read as follows: Authority: 42 U.S.C. 7401&hyph;7671q. 2. Part 51 is amended by adding a new subpart U, consisting of §§51.490 through 51.494, to read as follows: Subpart U_Economic Incentive Programs Sec. 51.490␣Applicability. 51.491␣Definitions. 51.492␣State program election and submittal. 51.493␣State program requirements. 51.494␣Use of program revenues. Subpart U_Economic Incentive Programs §51.490 Applicability. (a) The rules in this subpart apply to any statutory economic incentive program (EIP) submitted to the EPA as an implementation plan revision to comply with sections 182(g)(3), 182(g)(5), 187(d)(3), or 187(g) of the Act. Such programs may be submitted by any authorized governmental organization, including States, local governments, and Indian governing bodies. (b) The provisions contained in these rules, except as explicitly exempted, shall also serve as the EPA's policy guidance on discretionary EIP's submitted as implementation plan revisions for any purpose other than to comply with the statutory requirements specified in paragraph (a) of this section. §51.491 Definitions. Act means the Clean Air Act as amended November 15, 1990. Actual emissions means the emissions of a pollutant from an affected source determined by taking into account actual emission rates associated with normal source operation and actual or representative production rates (i.e., capacity utilization and hours of operation). Affected source means any stationary, area, or mobile source of a criteria pollutant(s) to which an EIP applies. This term applies to sources explicitly included at the start of a program, as well as sources that voluntarily enter (i.e., opt into) the program. Allowable emissions means the emissions of a pollutant from an affected source determined by taking into account the most stringent of all applicable SIP emissions limits and the level of emissions consistent with source compliance with all Federal requirements related to attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS and the production rate associated with the maximum rated capacity and hours of operation (unless the source is subject to federally enforceable limits which restrict the operating rate, or hours of operation, or both). Area sources means stationary and nonroad sources that are too small and/or too numerous to be individually included in a stationary source emissions inventory. Attainment area means any area of the country designated or redesignated by the EPA at 40 CFR part 81 in accordance with section 107(d) as having attained the relevant NAAQS for a given criteria pollutant. An area can be an attainment area for some pollutants and a nonattainment area for other pollutants. Attainment demonstration means the requirement in section 182(b)(1)(A) of the Act to demonstrate that the specific annual emissions reductions included in a SIP are sufficient to attain the primary NAAQS by the date applicable to the area. Directionally-sound strategies are strategies for which adequate procedures to quantify emissions reductions or specify a program baseline are not defined as part of the EIP. Discretionary economic incentive program means any EIP submitted to the EPA as an implementation plan revision for purposes other than to comply with the statutory requirements of sections 182(g)(3), 182(g)(5), 187(d)(3), or 187(g) of the Act.
