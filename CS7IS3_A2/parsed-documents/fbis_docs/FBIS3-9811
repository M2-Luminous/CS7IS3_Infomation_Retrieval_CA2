[Quintus] In April 1936, when I was still a student. My father, who died shortly before that date, had been the chairman of the liberal organization in Prahova County. [passage omitted] My actual involvement took place at the end of 1945, with the Soviet troops still in the country. I and a group of colleagues and friends decided to join the National Liberal Party [PNL] "Bratianu." We set up a very strong youth organization and I was elected its chairman. Therefore, I occupied this post from the end of 1945 until the spring of 1947, when the political parties were outlawed. I was also a member of the Liberal Youth Central Committee, where I became acquainted with a part of the present leadership of the party. Some of my former colleagues are no longer alive. [Costa] Did you suffer political persecution in the period of communist dictatorship? [Quintus] Of course, I was lucky to suffer less than the others, since I remained in the Collegium of Lawyers, whose chairman was a man with whom I did military service and who overlooked my political past. [passage omitted] Nevertheless, I was once briefly arrested in 1945 and then, for a longer time in 1952, when I was sent to the Canal [the first Danube-Black Sea Canal project, where political prisoners were sent to do hard labor] until 1954, because of my former position in the liberal youth movement. Likewise, in 1956 and 1957 I was submitted to tough interrogations by the Securitate. [passage omitted] [Costa] What are the present prospects of the liberal trend at the international level? [Quintus] I believe that the strongest liberal movement right now is in Japan. [passage omitted] Without trying to show local patriotism, I would say that some of the strongest liberal parties -- I am sorry to have to use the plural here -- are in Romania. Nowhere in the countries with liberal parties is the liberal governing alternative as possible as in our country, if we were to manage to achieve the most important thing for the country, namely the unification of the liberal movement. [passage omitted] [Costa] With what liberal parties abroad does the PNL maintain relations of cooperation? [Quintus] We are cooperating with various parties of a liberal orientation from Bulgaria, Hungary, Germany, Switzerland, and Belgium. In Sweden, there is also a liberal party with which we have been in touch. However, this cooperation has been pretty timid, since we have to pay more attention to PNL internal problems and stability. [passage omitted] [Costa] Regarding the local public administration, how do the PNL representatives in the territory act to solve problems in the spheres they are in charge of? Please tell us how do you cooperate with the other opposition parties in this respect. [Quintus] Personally, I know the situation in many counties, where our councillors cooperate perfectly well with the councillors of the Democratic Party (National Salvation Front) [PD(FSN]) and the Democratic Convention [CDR]. I would like to point out that the letters of intent we have recently signed with the PD(FSN) and the Civic Alliance Party [PAC] proved to be very inspired and were very well received in the territory, where, I repeat, there is a perfect cooperation among us. This cooperation strives hard to thwart the constant attempts of the Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR] to also lay hold of the power in the local administration, where the CDR and PD(FSN) have scored very good results in the local elections. This common front is necessary to thwart this dangerous intention of those in power. [Costa] If it were given a mandate to govern the country, under what conditions would the PNL accept it? [Quintus] This is a hypothetical question, which I will consequently treat as such. First of all, the liberals could only assume the responsibility of government if they were united in a single large party and not in the mess they are right now. For the coming months, up to a year for now, I believe that the country can only be ruled by a coalition of parties that can put together a parliamentary majority. As for us, the PNL has a single representative in Parliament, namely Mr. Caius Dragomir, who, if he is appointed ambassador abroad, will have to give up his post as senator and the quality member of our party. A party that has no parliamentary support cannot fulfill its program in government. However, I believe that, in the current circumstances, only a coalition between the opposition and one of the important forces of the power can assume such a responsibility. If, by some absurdity, I were to be given the mandate to govern, I would refuse it because it would be preposterous for a party that is not even represented in Parliament to think of the possibility of governing. However, I repeat, even if we were represented in Parliament, only a coalition of powerful forces could run public affairs in the current very difficult economic and social conditions of the country and try to implement the reform and revitalize our production and economy.
