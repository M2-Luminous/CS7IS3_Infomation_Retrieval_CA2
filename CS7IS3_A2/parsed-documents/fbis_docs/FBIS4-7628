What has Croatia been promised in Washington and what will it have to do in return? For an answer to these questions, we talked to Foreign Minister Mate Granic in Washington the day after the ceremonial signing of the Croat-Bosniak agreement and his many talks with high-level U.S. officials and representatives of the European "Group of Three." [Staresina] After signing the Washington agreement and talking with Mr. Silajdzic, is it more clear now how the Serbs should be involved in the negotiations? [Granic] Signing the agreement was the first step toward establishing peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which means that this alliance or federation between the Bosniaks and the Croats has become a reality not only on paper but also in practice. We believe that most Bosniaks and Croats have accepted it, and reports confirm that. However, the crucial question now is what will happen next. The United States, or rather special envoy Charles Redman, and European constituents are going to discuss territorial demarcation in Bosnia-Herzegovina between the federation and the Serbian side and, on the other hand, sanctions imposed on Serbia that are connected both to the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and to that in the United Nations Protected Areas [UNPA]. Furthermore, the Security Council is going to discuss the new mandate this week, and that will mark future developments. Moreover, the role of the Russian Federation in the negotiations with the third side has been defined to some extent; The European Union will be more involved in the negotiations. The framework and the location of the negotiations, as well as the determined compromise proposal on demarcation between the third side and the federation, are being decided upon. Internal demarcation will be discussed after the agreement on the final composition of the federation has been reached. Demarcation Proposals [Staresina] Are there several projects of the cantonal demarcation between the part held by the Serbs and the federation? [Granic] We have heard several negotiating standpoints recently: The Serb side is offering 45 percent of the territory to the Croat-Bosniak side, and Mr. Izetbegovic is demanding 60 percent. That is what was said publicly. The European Union will probably try to organize the demarcation based on the Geneva talks -- that is, 51 percent of the territory for the federation. The United States will probably be prepared to apply more pressure on the Serb side to relinquish more territory in favor of the federation. [Staresina] Mr. Churkin said that the Croats and the Muslims have the right to a confederation with Croatia, so the Serbs should have the same right to form a similar confederation with Serbia. [Granic] In that case, Croatia would not want to form any kind of link with the Serb confederation. There would be two confederations. It is more likely that the Serbs will be invited to join the federation under the same terms. That could be a possible solution for Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, it is not very likely the Serbs will agree to that. They have already indicated that. Another option is to form a very loose union between "the Serb Republic" and the federation, but it has not been thoroughly defined yet. [Staresina] A loose connection between "the Serb Republic" and the federation would preserve the borders of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The next step would certainly be a confederate agreement between the federation and Croatia. In that case -- the Serbs have made this clear -- they would immediately go toward Serbia. Of course, that would result in forming two confederations and those two confederations could normalize all relations, even economic ones, but that is all they could do. All formal relations -- Yugoslavia and the union -- are out of the question for Croatia. [Staresina] Do you also mean individual political resistance? [Granic] There will probably be a number of people who will not be satisfied, but they cannot stop the process. U.S. and Russian Influence [Staresina] Is there a possibility of a strong Serb-Russian alliance in the Balkans? [Granic] The Russians have a great influence on Serbia and the Serb side. If the influence is coordinated with the European Union and the United States to reach a compromise and an honorable solution, then it could be positive. On the other hand, any kind of support for a national minority and ethnic community is legal, but only within the framework of international standards and international law. We hope that Russia's assistance will result in the following: reaching an agreement on solving the problem of UNPA zones in compliance with UN Security Council resolutions and European standards for minorities and ethnic communities and to find a peaceful solution for Bosnia-Herzegovina that will not destabilize neighboring countries. [Staresina] The United States has confirmed its readiness to support a peaceful reintegration of UNPA zones, but Vice President Gore has pointed out that quality is much more important than haste. [Granic] The vice president's words convey the basic U.S. view: firm support to territorial integrity of Croatia and to reintegration, political, and diplomatic support along with the pressure on Serbia, of course. But they also say that it is now more important that Croatia's politics be coordinated with the United States and that this is a process that cannot be stopped. Naturally, we would like to see it happen as soon as possible, while the United States thinks it is not so important to hurry the process. Consequently, it is important to find a compromise. No "State Within a State" [Staresina] Has there been any talk about Serb autonomy in Croatia? Did they ask for more than has been provided by the constitutional law? [Granic] Let me go back to President Tudjman's peace initiative. It provides the basis for negotiations, which means that it takes the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Croatia for granted and that it is possible to broach the discussion about the problem of local self-government. For the time being, we will stick to the constitutional law. However, it is possible to negotiate with the Serbs within President Tudjman's initiative, which was offered to the Serbs. It is no secret that there are different views on the problems of local self-government and local autonomy, and Russian views are most liberal, as Mr. Churkin has said a few times himself. [Staresina] Do you mean a "state within a state"? [Granic] That is absolutely out of the question. There will be no federalization or confederalization of Croatia. [Staresina] Have the Russians proposed any particular model of autonomy? [Granic] No. We mostly talked about rights rather than a specific model. We were very categorical about not wanting federalization or confederalization, but we said we would discuss a firm form of local self-government. [Staresina] Have they ever openly demanded federalization or confederalization? [Granic] No, but they did ask how far we would go. [Staresina] Mr. Galbraith, the U.S. ambassador to Croatia, has recently threatened to introduce sanctions to Croatia. Is that still possible? Open Doors to European Institutions [Granic] After signing the agreement, they only talked about ways of helping Croatia and coordinating views. They never once mentioned sanctions. [Staresina] Has there been any specific discussion of Croatia joining "Partnership for Peace"? [Granic] We discussed everything in great detail. The United States, or rather President Clinton, Vice President Gore, and Secretary of State Christopher, strongly supported the process of admitting Croatia to "Partnership for Peace." With the European Union, we discussed membership to the Council of Europe and associate membership to the European Union. Indeed, they will probably wait for the federation and Croatia to do it together. There are no more hindrances for Croatia, but they want to do it that way. Croatia will demand that it be accepted right away, so we will have to work out a compromise. We talked about membership in all European institutions, the World Bank, the deblocking of loans, and the stand-by deals. The United States promised to help with regard to all that. [Staresina] Belgrade radio says that there is a position in Serbia concerning your visit to Belgrade. Do you really intend to go there soon? [Granic] I am prepared to go to Belgrade, if we agree on that. However, before doing so, in accordance with the previous agreement, the Serb -- Belgrade side -- must answer some questions regarding negotiations about telecommunications, the highway.... [Staresina] About accepting the Croatian area code for the UNPA's, too? [Granic] Yes, about that, too. [Staresina] You also met with Turkish Minister Cetin. Will Croatia support the Turkish proposal on including Turkish soldiers in UN operations in Bosnia-Herzegovina? [Granic] We suggested that they come to the occupied Croatian territory. Croatia has very friendly relations with Turkey. [Staresina] Have there been any objections concerning human rights violations in Croatia? [Granic] We did not talk about that at all. It was confirmed that Croatia is able to keep up with all the world standards in the field of human rights as well. [Box, p 4] The Continuity of Croatian Policies [Staresina] What does this continuity consist of? You often point out that the Washington agreement presents the continuity of Croatian politics. [Granic] It has a firm continuity because Croatia and President Tudjman personally -- much before the referendum for independent Bosnia-Herzegovina -- strongly advocated a decentralized Bosnia-Herzegovina, in which the Croats would have equal rights. This continuity is present in every proposal, as well as in the referendum and in recommendation that the Croats say "yes" and accept Couteillero's peace plan and the Vance-Owen plan. We had the most radical views regarding the European Union and the Owen-Stoltenberg plan of dividing Bosnia-Herzegovina into three republics. The present plan also contains decentralized Bosnia- Herzegovina. Furthermore, at a time when the Serbs are holding 72 percent of the territory and the international community has not done anything to stop that, the Croats in Croatia and Herzeg-Bosna will have to take a firm stand in defending their strategic interests. But it is also true that, as early as in August last year, when Mr. Silajdzic and Mr. Cetin visited Zagreb, we discussed possible models of relations that are similar to the present ones -- for example, those between the Croats and the Bosniaks, Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Later on, we continued those talks and President Tudjman and President Izetbegovic signed a public declaration and a non-public agreement on 14 September. We talked about the federation and the confederation during our stay in Sarajevo and then in Geneva. [Box, p 5] Professionals [Staresina] How much have the changes in the political and military leadership of the Bosnian Croats contributed to the success of the negotiations? [Granic] The arrival of General Ante Roso was primarily welcomed by the Croats, with the deep respect of the Bosniaks. The international community also supports professionals who carry out their tasks properly. On the other hand, there were certainly some reproaches of the international public regarding certain people in the previous leadership. However, that leadership organized the resistance to the Serb aggression, an efficient resistance, which should never be forgotten. The appointment of Mr. Zubak was certainly refreshing for the international community, and the Bosniak side has also accepted him. I believe that this has contributed to the success, but I repeat that the guidelines of the policy strategy have been the same from the very beginning.
