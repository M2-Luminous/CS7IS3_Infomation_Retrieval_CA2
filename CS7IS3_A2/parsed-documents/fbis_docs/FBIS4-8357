The declaration states that the vote of the Chisinau parliament reconfirms the criminal pact by which Bessarabia was torn away from Romania in 1941 and it annuls the indefeasible right of the Romanian nation to a part of its territory. Alexandru presented the declaration as one issued by the Romanian Parliament, but the chairman of today's session, Senate Deputy Speaker Valer Suian, stated that to be properly endorsed by the law-making body the declaration ought to be debated and passed by the two chambers. As a result of this, Senator Ioan Alexandru's declaration was considered a personal one that merely represents a possible suggestion made to the Romanian Parliament. [passage omitted] During today's plenary session of the Chamber of Deputies the representatives also discussed issues that were not included in today's agenda, the principal one being the situation in Moldova after the Chisinau parliament's vote in favor of joining the CIS. In that context PNTCD Deputy Petre Dugulescu suggested that the Chamber of Deputies adopt a declaration by which the Romanian Parliament would declare in front of the whole world that the Romanian nation's right to a part of its territory is an indefeasible and inalienable one, and that no act contradicting that right can be valid as an international regulation. The declaration is to be adopted if it is approved of by the Foreign Policy Commission. [passage omitted]
