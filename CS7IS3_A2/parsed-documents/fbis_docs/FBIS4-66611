FBIS4-66611 "jpnea021___94042" JPRS-NEA-94-021 JPRS Near East & South Asia 24 February 1994 SOUTH ASIA INDIA 1992/1993 Public Enterprise Survey Presented 1992/1993 Public Enterprise Survey Presented 94AS0255Q Madras THE HINDU in English 24 Feb 94 p 9 94AS0255Q Madras THE HINDU English CSO [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 23--With the petroleum companies having achieved a significant improvement in performance, central public enterprises recorded a 44 percent increase in net profits during 1992-93. The scenario would have been far brighter, but for the fact that losses by sick public enterprises had mounted to nearly Rs. [Rupees] 4,000 crore. This is disclosed in the Public Enterprises Survey for 1992-93 which was presented in Parliament today. The Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) heads the list of profitable undertakings, with a net profit of Rs. 935 crores, while Rashtriya Ispat Nigam is the highest loss-making concern with a net loss of Rs. 568 crores. The net profit for the year had risen by Rs. 1,040 crores to reach Rs. 3,395 crores during the year. The petroleum sector, as usual, is responsible for the lion's share with Rs. 551 crores but non-oil sector companies also achieved a substantial increase in net profit estimated at Rs. 489 crore. The impact of the loss-making enterprises on the overall performance of the public sector is indicated by the fact that the net profits of 131 enterprises is Rs. 7,346 crores while 104 companies suffered Rs. 3,950.50 crores. In an analysis of the performance of non-oil companies which are not sick, the Survey finds that these have shown net profits of Rs. 1,798 crores compared to Rs. 1,574 crores the previous year. The study had been carried out to exclude the effect of very high profits of the oil enterprises and the large losses of sick companies and evaluates performance of other units in a competitive environment. It concludes that sick enterprises are mainly responsible for low profitability of public enterprises as these account for net losses of Rs. 2,524 crores in the manufacturing and service sectors. The Survey notes that the overall net return on investment, in terms of ratio of net profit to capital employed, had risen only marginally from 2 percent in 1991-92 to 2.43 percent in 1992-93. The gross profit, when viewed as percentage of capital employed, also shows a marginal decline from 18.83 percent to 18.02 percent. According to the Survey, this has to be viewed in the background of the multi-dimensional objectives of public enterprises and the divergent constraints faced by them. In order to be fair to them, it is felt, it will be necessary to take into account the obligations of public enterprises which transcend the concepts of production and profits. The performance of public enterprises had to be evaluated keeping in view the contributions made in discharging socioeconomic obligations, development of backward regions, provision of public utility services and selling basic inputs or products at administered prices. The Survey which had taken the performance of 245 enterprises into account, notes that the investment in these companies had risen by Rs. 11,526 crores, an increase of 8.5 percent. Similarly, gross sales had recorded an improvement of Rs. 12,807 crores, a 9.5 percent rise. Value added in production enterprises also rose by 8.24 percent, from Rs. 35,212 crores to Rs. 38,114 crores. Other highlights: Other highlights of the Survey are, the 13.67 percent rise in gross internal resources. These have increased by Rs. 1,780.51 crores, to reach Rs. 14,723 crores from Rs. 12,942 crores last year. Export earnings have also risen by Rs. 1,366 crores to touch Rs. 10,345 crores during the year. Contribution to the exchequer in the form of corporate tax, Excise duty, Customs and other duties and dividend increased by Rs. 2,136 crores from Rs. 19,951 crores the previous year. The company with the highest investment during the year is the National Thermal Power Corporation with a total investment of Rs. 17,700 crores followed by Coal India Limited with Rs. 10,508 crores. In absolute terms, the gross profit of public enterprises during the year had risen by Rs. 2,303 crores, a 17 percent increase from Rs. 13,675 crores in 1991-92 to Rs. 15,978 crores. The Survey notes that the ratio of net turnover to capital employed brings out the efficiency of utilisation of funds of any enterprises. This had fallen to 95.77 percent in 1992-93, compared to 104.78 percent the previous year. Group-wise analysis, however, indicates that there had been an improvement in the ratio in eight sectors, including tourist services, contracts and construction, textiles and consumer goods. Another 13 sectors had shown a decline, including medium, and light engineering, petroleum and trading and marketing. Providing an overall picture of profit and loss in various industry groups, the Survey notes that the steel sector losses had fallen by Rs. 430 crores. On the other hand, losses of the fertiliser sector had risen from Rs. 394 crores to Rs. 564 crores while the textiles industry losses had increased from Rs. 313 crores to Rs. 572 crores. Profits of the petroleum sector had risen by Rs. 551 crores, while other sectors which had registered some increase in profits are coal, financial services, and telecom. The manufacturing sector as a whole shows a rise in a profit of Rs. 530 crores against Rs. 510 crores for the services sector. On memoranda of understanding (MOUs), it is stated that 98 enterprises entered into such agreement with their administrative Ministries during the year. Of these, 34 were rated as `excellent,' and 35 as `very good'. The Survey says that a major initiative to disinvest Government shareholding in public sector units was taken during the year in order to raise resources, encourage wider public participation and promote greater accountability. An amount of Rs. 1,912 crores was mobilised during the year by disinvesting around five percent equity holding of 16 public enterprises. In the previous year, the Government had disinvested eight percent of the shareholding in 30 enterprises at a total value of Rs. 3,038 crore. Another significant development during the year was the identification of 44 central public enterprises as being sick following the amendment to the Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions ) Act, 1985. Of these, 40 have been registered by the BIFR [Board of Industrial Finance and Reconstruction]].
