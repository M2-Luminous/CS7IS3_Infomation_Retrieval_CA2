That is, in accordance with the GATT accord Thailand can no longer keep its financial sector closed. However, we must be very careful not to rush to liberalize our financial sector, especially as result of the insistence of a superpower, because this could amount to liquidating our own financial institutions. It is not difficult to see that the Newly Industrialized Countries [NIC's] --Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, and Singapore -- and countries rapidly advancing toward the NIC status, and this include Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, are priority targets of economic superpowers who want to establish commercial banks and other forms of financial institutions in order to rake off profits. They accomplish this by virtue of their greater experiences in that sector. Believe it or not, if the 17-19 January visit of U.S. Secretary of Treasury Lloyd Bentsen succeeds in the immediate liberalization of the Thai financial sector, Thai commercial banks and financial institutions could collapse or have their growth throttled. The superpowers' capital and global experience are that great. We suggest the delay of our financial liberalization for as long as possible. The GATT accord is not be enforceable until 1995. In particular, we must not succumb to U.S. demands. The United States itself stated at the signing of the agreement with the EEC that its own financial liberalization would not occur until eight months later. Even as the date for the enforcement of the GATT accord nears, the superpowers will try their best to protect their interests. [passage omitted]
