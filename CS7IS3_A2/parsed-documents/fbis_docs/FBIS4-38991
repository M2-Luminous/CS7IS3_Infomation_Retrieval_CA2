The party's leader Mikhail Lapshin would not place his bet on Rutskoy even though Rutskoy was in charge of the land reform and, more than any other member of the Yeltsin Administration, took to heart the needs and concerns of rural Russia. Lapshin told Interfax the party's Council was yet to decide who deserved the Agrarians' backing. According to Lapshin, both Rutskoy and his Social-Democratic party had to travel a long way before emerging as the leading opposition force. Instead of searching for a presidential candidate, Lapshin said, the opposition had better bring together forces and launch a wide propagandistic and educational campaign. The opposition leader, according to Lapshin, would appear when his time came.
