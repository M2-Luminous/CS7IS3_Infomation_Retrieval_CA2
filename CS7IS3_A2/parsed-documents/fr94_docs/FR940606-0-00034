FR940606-0-00034 FR940606-0-00013 As required by Executive Order 12630, the Department of the Interior has determined that the rule would not cause a taking of private property. No private property rights would be affected by a rule that merely removes obsolete regulations no longer governing activities on the public lands. The Department therefore certifies that this proposed rule does not represent a governmental action capable of interference with constitutionally protected property rights. Further, the Department has determined under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601, et seq. ) that it will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Removing obsolete regulations that no longer govern activities on the public lands will have no economic effect whatsoever. This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. The Department has certified to the Office of Management and Budget that this proposed rule meets the applicable standards provided in sections 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778.
