Notices describing the project status at various points in the process and solicitations for comments will be sent to appropriate Federal, State and local agencies, and to private organizations and citizens who have expressed an interest in or are known to have an interest in this action. The study process will include many public meetings and a formal public hearing. Public notices advertising the locations and times of the meetings and hearing will be prepared. The draft EIS will be available for public and agency review and comment prior to the public hearing. To ensure that a full range of alternatives and issues related to this proposed action are identified, questions and suggestions are invited from all interested parties.
