Speaking at the North Atlantic Council (NAC) meeting held here, Christopher quoted President Bill Clinton as saying that "Now the question is no longer whether NATO will take on new members, but when and how we will do so." He stressed that Russia figures prominently when considering NATO's relationship with nations to the East. "Whatever course its internal evolution may take, Russia is and will remain a vital actor in European security affairs," said Christopher, adding that "It is our interest -- and Russia's -- to develop broad, constructive interaction between NATO and Russia." In addition to the PFP program, the U.S. also welcome other cooperations with Russia, including the "16"1" formula, added Christopher. Although the U.S. recognizes Russia's legitimate concerns in the states that emerged from the Soviet Empire, Christopher warned that "No country has a right to assert a role that is inconsistent with international norms." He went on to say that Europe's stability and security is also based on the treaty on conventional forces in Europe and the U.S. is committed to maintaining the integrity of the treaty over the long term. Foreign ministers from 16 NATO member states attended the NAC spring meeting in Istanbul to participate in the tough task of working out a common approach to NATO-Russian relationship.
