The statement followed his talks with Crimean Vice-President Yevgeniy Saburov on Tuesday. In an interview with ITAR-TASS, Kravchuk said that in all other spheres, especially in the political one, the sides "should coordinate their moves and activities, taking into account the interests of Ukraine and the people of the Crimea and international principles, especially those concerning territorial integrity, the sovereignty of states and their borders." These are the most acute problems, he added. "We need to agree on the status quo and refrain from any pressure," the Ukrainian leader continued, adding that "playing the `Crimean' card will do no good either to the Crimea, Ukraine or Russia," he said. Lately Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov has come up with a proposal to Ukraine to withdraw its troops from the Crimea and ordered military enlistment offices not to send conscripts outside the Crimea this spring. Valeriy Kuznetsov, Meshkov's military adviser, told ITAR-TASS on Wednesday that consultations are now underway with a top military commander from the Odessa military district to iron out disagreements and work out a compromise. The most probable solution would be to leave half of 3,400 draftees in the Crimea and send 20 per cent (about 680 people) to the Ukrainian Army and 1,000 (about 30 per cent) to the Black Sea Fleet, he said.
