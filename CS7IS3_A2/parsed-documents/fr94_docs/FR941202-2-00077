FR941202-2-00077 FR941202-2-00054 NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION [Docket No. 50&hyph;309] Maine Yankee Atomic Power Company (Maine Yankee Atomic Power Station); Exemption I The Maine Yankee Atomic Power Company (the licensee) is the holder of Facility Operating License No. DPR&hyph;36, which authorizes operation of Maine Yankee Atomic Power Station (the facility). The license provides, among other things, that the facility is subject to all the rules, regulations, and orders of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) now or hereafter in effect. The facility is a pressurized water reactor located on the licensee's site in Lincoln County, Maine. II The Code of Federal Regulations at 10 CFR part 73, appendix B, Section I.B.b.(1)(a), ``Vision,'' specifies in part that: For each individual (security officer), distant visual acuity in each eye shall be correctable to 20/30 (Snellen or equivalent) in the better eye and 20/40 in the other eye with eyeglasses or contact lenses. At the time of their employment in 1989 and 1990, the two security officers, who are the subject of the licensee's exemption request dated August 5, 1994, were screened using a licensee-generated form that was based on the requirements of Appendix B to 10 CFR part 73. However, the form did not properly reflect the correct distance visual acuity requirements of the ``other eye.'' On July 28, 1994, the discrepancy between the licensee's form and the requirements of 10 CFR part 73, Appendix B, Section I.B.b.(1)(a) was noted for the first officer. A review of the visual examination records for all security officers found a second instance in which the distant visual acuity requirement was not met for another security officer. The licensee's letter of August 5, 1994, requested an exemption from the distant visual acuity requirement of 10 CFR part 73, appendix B, Section I.B.b.(1)(a) for two security officers who do not meet this requirement in one eye. III Pursuant to 10 CFR 73.5, ``Specific exemptions,'' the Commission may, upon application of any interested person or upon its own initiative, grant an exemption from the requirements of this part as it determines is authorized by law and will not endanger life or property or the common defense and security, and is otherwise in the public interest. The licensee has provided expert professional medical opinions asserting that each officer has normal peripheral vision, normal peripheral depth perception, and normal binocular acuity. Further, each security officer uses the right eye for firearms siting and each currently tests 20/20 in the right eye. Finally, the licensee has committed to have each security officer's vision tested by its optometrist every 6 months to ensure no significant visual deterioration occurs. The criteria to establish that no significant visual deterioration has occurred will be: 1. Vision in the better eye will be at least 20/30 corrected or uncorrected. 2. Vision in the other eye will be monitored. If eyesight in the other eye should worsen, immediate testing will be performed to demonstrate that the individual is physically capable of meeting all the requirements of the Maine Yankee Security Training and Qualification Plan prior to being reassigned duties of an armed security officer. (This testing will include the complete firearms qualification course.) 3. The remaining vision criteria of 10 CFR part 73, appendix B will be met or exceeded. IV For the foregoing reasons, Commission has determined that the proposed vision examination and criteria to establish that no significant visual deterioration has occurred, would not result in a reduction in the physical protection capabilities for the protection of special nuclear material_either on site or in transit_or of Maine Yankee Atomic Power Station. Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 73.5, this exemption is authorized by law, will not endanger life or property or common defense and security, and is otherwise in the public interest. Therefore, the Commission hereby grants the following exemption: The requirement of 10 CFR part 73, appendix B, Section I.B.b(1)(a) that each individual (security officer) have distant visual acuity in each eye correctable to 20/30 (Snellen or equivalent) in the better eye and 20/40 in the other eye with eyeglasses or contact lenses, is no longer necessary for the two subject security officers. Thus, these two security officers may be returned to duties of an armed security officer at Maine Yankee Atomic Power Station, subject to the vision testing commitment and criteria of Section III. above. Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that the granting of this exemption will not result in any significant impact on the quality of the human environment (59 FR 56096 dated November 10, 1994). This exemption is effective upon issuance. Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 23rd day of November, 1994. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Steven A. Varga, Director, Division of Reactor Projects_I/II, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;29660 Filed 12&hyph;1&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7590&hyph;01&hyph;M
