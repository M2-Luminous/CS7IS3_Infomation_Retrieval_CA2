In view of an inflation rate of nearly 40 percent per month and the difficulties being faced by the Brazilian people, the government has sent to Congress an economic plan to defeat inflation. This plan has three stages: first, it adjusts the government's own accounting, reduces expenditures, and balances the budget; second, it creates a stable monetary index, which is known as the Real Value Unit, or URV, to adjust the prices of our economy; third, it transforms this index into a new national currency, which will be strong and guaranteed by the Central Bank, thus reestablishing our currency's credibility and defeating inflation. Since my installation at the head of the Finance Ministry, I have insisted that we should not fool the country by skipping stages. We must first balance our budget. Unless we do that, it will be impossible to definitively force inflation down. To put a decisive end to inflation, the government cannot spend more than it possesses. Otherwise, it will have to resort to the banks and ask for loans or issue money and, as a result, we will have more and more inflation. This is a simple accounting rule: If I have 100, how can I spend 150? If I spend more than I have, I will have to get money to cover the difference. When the government prints money, it is the people who have to pay for it. There is no doubt about that. When the inflation rate is high, the common people lose more. The common people who have no deposit accounts in the banks or even the possibility of having a savings passbook are more affected because they have no way to defend themselves from currency devaluation. They become poorer by the day. President Itamar Franco's administration is doing its best to balance its expenses and defeat inflation. My friends, in this year's budget, the government reduced the expenditures of the administrative machinery and its investments by nearly 40 percent. We have also succeeded in doing something that the pessimistic people declared to be impossible: states and counties have reached agreements with the federal government and are paying their debts in accordance with the rules established by Congress. We must also mention our stern fight against tax evasion, which has already yielded concrete results. We have put an end to tax havens and the privileges of those whose accounts had never been investigated. Despite all these efforts, however, we still need billions of real cruzeiros to be able to obtain a zero deficit in our public accounts. Worst than that, reducing expenses is not enough, because the Federal Government is forced to give most of its revenue to the governments of the states and counties and to finance other expenses contemplated in the Constitution. Out of each 100 real cruzeiros collected by the Federal Government, 80 are already earmarked for mandatory obligations. Only 20 are left to pay for all government expenses, which include health assistance, the antifamine fight, transportation, agriculture, science and technology, and other indispensable programs. How can we balance our expenses? How can we defeat inflation? Society is tired of paying taxes because most of the taxes are unfairly paid by the poor instead of by the wealthy people. This is why the government has proposed a constitutional amendment creating the Social Emergency Fund [FSE]. The FSE will help distribute the national resources better. It will not force us to make new expenditures. It will be used to finance the social programs that cannot, and should not, be subjected to more cutbacks. Unless we have this fund, the government will continue to make debts to cover essential expenditures, as we did in December, when we issued certificates for more than $1 billion -- with interest rates of real 25 percent per year -- to pay for our debts to hospitals and other social programs. Most of the estimated $16 billion required by the FSE, will result from reallocation of resources. Only $3 billion, i.e. nearly 20 percent of the FSE, will result from tax hikes. This increase is indispensable to cover urgent expenses. Who will pay for it? Those who have more; those who make more than 5 million real cruzeiros per month; the financial institutions, which will pay 30 percent more of their profit in social contributions; the upper middle class members, whose income tax will be increased by well below 2 percent; and the banks, which are not contributing to the PIS [Social Integration Program], and will have to do so from now on. This tax effort will not affect either the workers or most of the middle class. We are trying to make inflation stop being a tax that affects the poor to become a tax on the wealthy. Even so, there are always demagogues who contend that the government is merely increasing taxes without cutting its expenses. Let us speak clearly and without protocol: without the FSE, it will be impossible for us to fight the worst of all taxes; that is, inflation. The government is convinced that this program is the best way to achieve the desired stability and to ensure a sustained economic growth. Yet, only together and acting in partnership -- society, government, and Congress alike -- will we be able to overcome the difficulties. The government neither can nor wants to impose its program on the Congress. Most of the economic plans implemented by previous governments -- most of them containing shock measures, confiscations, and freezes -- had been endorsed by the Congress practically without disputes. Today, fortunately, the Congress is not acting that way because democracy entails participation. Nor does our program have characteristics similar to those implemented in the past. Never before has a Brazilian finance minister conferred so much with members of Congress to effect the approval of an economic plan. I held lengthy talks with my congressional counterparts. I accepted good suggestions. I made as many concessions as I could as long as it would not be detrimental to our proposal of approving a zero deficit budget. I agreed to avoid touching the resources of state governments and municipal governments because they need these resources. I did what I could. I pushed my possibilities to the limit. What is going to be voted on this week is the result of this extensive negotiation. A joint effort has been made by the government and the Congress itself. The Congress must now make a decision, not because the government wants it to do so, but because Brazil is in a hurry. We again grew in 1993 and we should increase even more in 1994. By making adjustments, the private sector of our economy has made progress. Industrial production grew by 9 percent in 1993. Our exports totaled nearly $39 billion and our trade balance yielded a $13 billion surplus. Salaries increased by more than 10 percent and employment rose by 3 percent. Our country's international reserves today stand at more than $33 billion, a record figure. Our foreign debt to private banks, the negotiations of which must be concluded by 10 March, does not exceed $35 billion. The inflow of foreign resources into our financial market was more than $12 billion. We have also received $1.3 billion as direct investments. Foreign investors have given a vote of confidence to Brazil. Yet, much remains to be done. We must yet implement constitutional revisions in the area of taxation, social security, and we must redefine the powers of the state governments, of municipal governments, and of the Federal Government, just to mention a few examples. These are fundamental changes that are needed to once and for all balance the government's accounts. We must yet implement a broader privatization program -- I am fighting for this -- in order to consolidate our economic stabilization. There is a major contradiction today in Brazil. The Congress and other sectors agree on the need to stop inflation and to implement constitutional reforms, but there are still those who are objecting to these necessary measures. Some members of liberal blocs want constitutional revision, but they disagree with aspects of our economic program. Progressive blocs partially support the economic program, but they do not want a constitutional revision. Many people advocate the market and free enterprise, but they do not stop pressuring government coffers. They want freedom, but they are afraid of competition and risks. Some of them talk about downsizing the state, but they are vulnerable to pressure groups that are contrary to streamlining the state apparatus. There are others who boycott privatizations and advocate a misguided nationalism by defending stagnant monopolies, even those in nonstrategic areas. They are capable of asking and demanding, but they fail to discharge their responsibilities. Today, Brazil clearly needs everyone to assume his share of responsibility. As President Itamar Franco said: Governability is a responsiblity for each and everyone of us. Either changes pick up momentum now or it will not occur any time soon. The Congress, which through congressional investigating committees is making politics credible again, must act responsibly in the economic area. Congress must decide. It must say yes or no. It must neither fail to act nor postpone its decision. If Congress does not agree with the proposed plan, let it turn it down, because there will always be those who may look for alternate courses. If Congress approves the entire program as submitted, a huge task will be awaiting the finance minister. Our people have always excelled for their patience, but our country can no longer wait. Each of us is responsible for making decisions and for acting in a timely manner, both in the government and in Congress. Brazil is in a hurry and the government is prepared to act. Thank you and good night.
