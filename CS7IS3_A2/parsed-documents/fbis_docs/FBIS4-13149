Soon after his arrival, Mr. Zlenko began the first round of his talks with Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati. Part of yesterday's talks between the foreign ministers focused on regional and international developments and, as he had announced before his visit to Tehran, Mr. Zlenko showed he is willing to do his best for the expansion and strengthening of bilateral ties during his first official visit to Iran. In view of the agreements concluded during the Ukrainian president's visit to Tehran and his meeting with Iranian President Hashemi-Rafsanjani in April 1992, the Ukrainian foreign minister believes the present level of the two countries' ties is not compatible with the needs of the day and that, along with the two countries' political ties, the level of Tehran-Kiev economic exchanges should also be increased to higher and desirable levels. Therefore, the composition of the political-economic delegation accompanying the Ukrainian foreign minister is so designed that, during the three days of talks in Tehran, all areas of mutual interest could be included, especially when Mr. Zlenko has come to Tehran with certain specific and clear proposals for the expansion of bilateral ties. The Ukrainian foreign minister has laid real stress on the need for expanding bilateral cooperation in the fields of energy, steel, petrochemical industries, oil and oil refining, transport, geology and the training of the two countries' experts. The Ukrainian foreign minister, in a detailed report on the latest developments in his country -- especially Ukraine's views vis-a-vis the regional countries -- stressed that regional security is actually a wide-ranging process, which can be attained only through security for all the regional countries. The emphasis the Ukrainian foreign minister places on this point means that, aside from expanding ties with Tehran, Ukraine is willing to cooperate with Iran on regional and international security. On the whole, the trend of Iran-Ukraine ties during the two year period that has elapsed since the start of political and economic relations between the two countries and the outcome of the first round of talks between Dr. Velayati and Mr. Zlenko reflect the reality that the two countries, with due knowledge of their common interests, are moving ahead in consolidating the foundations of bilateral ties. This is not only to the benefit of Tehran and Kiev, but will also prove beneficial to the Caucasian region countries.
