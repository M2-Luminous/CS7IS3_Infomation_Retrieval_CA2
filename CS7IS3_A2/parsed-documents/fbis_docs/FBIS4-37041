Mr. Besharati announced the agenda of the talks as being the expansion of security, military, political, and parliamentary cooperation between the two countries. The interior minister's visit to Turkey is within the framework of the visits that have taken place during the recent decade of ties between the two countries. The heads of the two countries' executive authorities exchange visits to Tehran and Ankara regularly in order to study the possibilities for expanding political and economic relations. The last such visit was First Vice President Hasan Habibi's trip to Ankara in December of 1993, and President Suleyman Demirel is to visit Tehran in the near future. Iran and Turkey are the founding members of the Economic Cooperation Organization, ECO, and are regarded as active members of the Islamic Conference Organization vis-a-vis the Bosnia-Herzegovina issue. Tehran and Ankara cooperate in technical, economic, and transportation fields as well as on regional issues. The volume of trade between the two countries was about $600 million last year, and the amount of goods transported from Turkish ports to Iran reached a figure of 200,000 tonnes. At the same time, security and military cooperation to establish order and tranquility along the borders is considered one of the important aspects of the two countries' relations. Iran and Turkey share a common border of 511 km. Two years ago, a joint security committee was set up to prevent infiltration of elements that threaten the two countries' security. On the basis of the agreements reached, the two countries will not permit any illegal activity on their territory that threatens the other country's security. At present, the interior ministers of Iran and Turkey; officials of the security cooperation committee; the border provinces' governors general; and the governors, military, and security officers stationed along the two countries' borders are in direct contact. These initiatives on the whole and the existing mutual goodwill is assisting the two countries in their war against terrorism and drug trafficking. It is hoped that in the wake of Mr. Besharati's visit to Ankara, further steps will be taken to continue and expand cooperation.
