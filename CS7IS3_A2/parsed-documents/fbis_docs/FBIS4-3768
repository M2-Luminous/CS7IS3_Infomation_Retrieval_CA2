The letter noted: On 12 April, a person in charge of the ARATS said the ARATS agreed in principle that after the ARATS and SEF have made the necessary preparations, both sides can exchange views on the incidents--incidents that caused the loss of lives and property of mainland and Taiwan compatriots--that had occurred in the course of cross-strait contacts and exchanges over the past two years. The ARATS believes at present that both sides should decide on the topics and contents for their exchange of views through consultations before considering the level of personnel, the time, and the place [for a meeting]. If both sides cannot reach a consensus on the topics and contents, they will not be able to find common ground when they exchange views. That is not the type of negotiations sought by any of our compatriots on either side of the Taiwan Strait. The ARATS believes that the contents for the exchange of views should include the following: 1) Both sides should exchange views on the issue of cross-strait tourism contacts, including the safety of mainland and Taiwan compatriots when they are traveling. It was as early as the end of August 1993 when the ARATS and the SEF held their first working negotiations on the implementation of the Wang-Gu meeting that the ARATS proposed in the "timetable for negotiations on the implementation of the relevant agreements reached during the Wang-Gu meeting" that both the ARATS and the SEF hold special negotiations on the issue of "improving cross-strait tourism contacts." However, to date, the ARATS still has not received a reply from the SEF. 2) The ARATS has always called for carrying out all the negotiations on routine, economic, scientific, and technological topics stipulated by the "common agreements reached during the Wang-Gu meeting," and it has more than once suggested to the SEF that the negotiation on "the rights and interests of Taiwan businessmen's investments on the mainland and relevant issues" be started as soon as possible. The ARATS believes that the personal safety of Taiwan businessmen who have invested on the mainland as well as the safety of their property is protected by the laws. If the SEF thinks it necessary, both sides may exchange views [on the topic] when they negotiate "the rights and interests of Taiwan businessmen's investments on the mainland and relevant issues." 3) The ARATS has repeatedly demanded that the ARATS and the SEF hold consultations on the issue of the Taiwan military's killing and wounding in recent years mainland fishermen operating in coastal areas and the resulting serious losses of lives and property. After the ARATS was established, it has continued pointing out to the SEF such inhuman acts which hurt the feelings of our compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Strait and damage the cross-strait harmonious atmosphere, in the hope that Taiwan's relevant departments will attach importance to the issue, compensate [victims for their] losses, find out who is responsible, and sternly punish the killers. Meanwhile, it has called for putting an end once and for all to such violence through ARATS-SEF consultations. However, to date, the ARATS still has not received a reply from the SEF. The letter clearly and definitely pointed out that the delays and failure to begin negotiations on the aforementioned rights and interests of mainland and Taiwan compatriots in their contacts and exchanges, including the issue of their personal safety, are not the responsibility of our side. The letter noted: The present ARATS-SEF contacts and the methods of their cooperation should be conducted strictly in accordance with the "ARATS-SEF agreement on the system for their contact and talks" signed last year. After the "Qiandao Lake incident" took place, the ARATS briefed the SEF on the situation, gave answers to several questions raised by the latter, and responded to its several requests in accordance with the agreement. However, the SEF repeatedly made requests that exceeded the scope of the ARATS-SEF agreement mentioned above. Although the ARATS pointed this out, the SEF still insisted on its requests. This is a practice that does not respect the ARATS-SEF agreement. It is our sincerest hope that ARATS-SEF contacts and cooperation can be carried out in accordance with the existing agreement. The letter pointed out: As far as the "Qiandao Lake incident" is concerned, the pressing matter of the moment is to investigate and deal with the case according to the law. Meanwhile, to show further goodwill, the ARATS took the initiative in inviting the SEF and relevant experts to visit Zhejiang and to make arrangements for the experts to give a briefing on the specific state of the case and to answer questions. If the SEF was willing to understand the details of the case and truly showed understanding and sympathy for the feelings of the victims' families, why did it set preconditions? This is hard for people to understand. The ARATS reiterates its invitation mentioned above and hopes that the SEF soon will propose its name list and itinerary. It has been learned from the relevant department that three suspects were arrested and that they will soon stand trial in accordance with judicial procedures.
