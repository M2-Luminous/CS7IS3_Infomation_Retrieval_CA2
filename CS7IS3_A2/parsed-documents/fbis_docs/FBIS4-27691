This is the first resistance attack for many years. The only targets of the attack were Indonesian military installations, according to Ramos Horta. [Begin Horta recording] There was a very well planned, organized, resistance attack on a number of military units in the outskirts of Dili. It led to strong retaliation from the Indonesians. The shooting went on for several hours. A Chinese was killed with a bayonet by the Indonesian forces -- he was stabbed in the head with it. We are trying to find out more details of the guerrilla's operation, but there is not doubt that it was a major offensive.
