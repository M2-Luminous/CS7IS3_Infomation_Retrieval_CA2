Liu Yi, director of Beijing's National Tourism Administration, said during a tourism fair in Hong Kong that the mainland received some 50,000 fewer tourists from Taiwan in April and May, resulting in the loss of about US$50 million. Spurred by the adverse impact, Liu said, Mainland Chinese authorities have begun a "nationwide overhaul" of tourist safety and decided to shorten the time it takes for the central authorities to take charge after the occurrence of major accidents. Twenty-four Taiwan tourists were robbed and murdered in a pleasure boat fire on Qiandao Lake in Zhejiang Province on March 31. The tourists, together with eight mainland crew members and tourist guides, were found burnt to death in a small room in the boat on April 1. Luggage and other belongings were missing. News of the mishap was suppressed at first and then the Zhejiang authorities claimed it was an accident. Reporters, especially those from Taiwan were barred from the crime scene. Relatives of the victims, who were furious after mainland officials performed autopsies without their consent, were confined in a nearby hotel, and officials from the Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) were three times refused permission to visit the mainland to probe the case. Although the mainland authorities arrested three suspects and agreed to meet SEF officials and victim's relatives nearly 40 days later, many questions surrounding the incident remain. Since April, Taiwan has suspended cultural and educational exchanges, banned sightseeing trips, and is reviewing its economic policy toward the mainland in protest of the mainland's inappropriate handling of the incident. Liu said he was happy to hear that a Taiwan travel agents association decided to lift the boycott on pleasure tours to the mainland on May 25. Xu Heyung, an official from the Hangzhou Overseas Tourism Company who also attended the Hong Kong tourism fair, complained that "we have not had even a single tourist from Taiwan in May." Another official from Hunan Province lamented that planned visits for nearly 40 sightseeing groups from Taiwan were canceled, resulting in the loss of US$900,000 in tourism revenue in the province alone. Meanwhile, an official from the Hong Kong Travel Agency Association said since the Qiandao Lake incident, Hong Kong has witnessed a loss of some 30,000 Taiwan tourists who would previously make one or two-day stops in Hong Kong before or after their mainland visits. Visa applications from Taiwan tourists to Hong Kong also dropped 40 percent since April, the Hong Kong official added.
