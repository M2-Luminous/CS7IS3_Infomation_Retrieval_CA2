This was only a continuation of enemy activity that had started last night when chetnik mortar bombs exploded on the region around Vrbanja Most and at Vis. A similar (?torture) was suffered by other regions covered by the 1st Corps, particularly around Vares where our positions were pounded by antiaircraft guns and antiaircraft machine-guns, Vratnica was pounded from Cekrcici, and Pljesivica and Visocica, near Visoko, were exposed to fire from Vrela.
