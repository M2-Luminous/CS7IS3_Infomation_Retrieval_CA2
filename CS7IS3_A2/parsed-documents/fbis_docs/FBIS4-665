On the one hand there is talk of negotiations that might start between the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] and the government, but details of this are still extremely unclear. Meanwhile, things are speeding up in Kigali as far as fighting is concerned. Shells fell just now right by the runways at the airport, and all air traffic is halted for the moment. Simone Remont, RTBF special correspondent, is still there, and she has just called us: [Begin Remont recording] The situation has worsened considerably in Kigali this morning. Mortar fire started again at dawn, and has not stopped, and it is coming very close to the airport. For example, at 0900 they hit the apron, less than 200 meters from where we are, as convoys of Belgian peacekeeping troops are completing their withdrawal to Kigali airport. The district of Gikondo, southeast of the town center, is a densely populated area. There has been firing this morning. Encircling maneuvers continue. The RPF is seizing all the strategic points around the capital. This morning, two convoys went to the north and south of the town to pick up about 30 expatriates, including 12 Belgians. These are the very last operations of the kind, and the departure of the paratroopers should be completed today -- if the shooting permits, of course. But perhaps this is a just a warning to tell them to hurry. Anything is possible after the 12-hour time limit. [end recording] The arrivals continue, and just before 1000 a seventh plane bringing people evacuated from Rwanda back to Belgium landed at Zaventem airport. It was a Sabena airbus, coming from Nairobi, with 158 people on board.
