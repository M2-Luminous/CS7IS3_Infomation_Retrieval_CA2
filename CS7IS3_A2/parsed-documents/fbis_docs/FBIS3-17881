A close political aide to President Boris Yeltsin, Mr. Poltoranin said in an interview with AL-RA'Y: I fear the Russian people may lose their patience with this filthy effort. While the Russian people have the capacity to endure hunger, misery, and deprivation, they will not remain silent for long when Zionists trample their national pride underfoot through the news media they are seeking to control. In a a recent television appearance, Poltoranin recalled, he said that by speaking the language of the Jewish concentration camps, the Zionists are fueling so-called anti-Semitism in Russia. By temperament, the Russian people, he emphasized, do not discriminate against others on ethnic, racial, or religious grounds. These circles, however, are trying our people's patience. If a massacre should take place, the Zionist lobby active in the media must take the blame in full. The Zionist circles have gone too far in insulting the Russian national dignity, he added. Poltoranin disclosed that the salary of the Russian television Hebrew correspondent is paid by the Israeli Government and so it was not surprising that his reports have an anti-Arab and pro-Israel slant. When I intimated to the Russian television's director my surprise that the cash-strapped station had no correspondents in the country's provinces, while it maintained one in Israel, he revealed to me that the latter gets his pay from Israel. This affair, which as a Russian parliamentary committee chairman I will not condone, is legally and politically insulting to Russia's national dignity and prestige, Mr. Poltoranin said. He would keep the fight against these circles, which he regretted are seeking to isolate President Yeltsin after they secured influential positions within his entourage. I am confident that Mr. Yeltsin will soon heed the danger this represents, and will come to recognize that a halt must be called to the Zionist-inspired defamation campaign against Russian national pride. He indicated that by April, the Russian parliament will pass a law regulating the activities of the media organs, particularly the competing radio and television stations, which, he said have turned into tools manipulated by the Zionist lobby. The parliament, he added, will decree the formation of a federal, central consultative council to administer radio and television. There is a consensus in parliament and an initial acceptance by Mr. Yeltsin that I take charge of this council. We will then put things in order and ban this feverish activity, because Russia will not countenance becoming an occupied country. At the parliament's initiative, a committee was formed to look into where the money came from to fund anti-Arab and anti-Russian television programs, Mr. Poltoranin disclosed. Let me tell you that we will not have our media channels turn into mouthpieces for cheap Zionist propaganda, he added. I asked him about Yeltsin's feelings toward what is happening in Russia. Poltoranin said that by virtue of many complex -- both objective and subjective -- factors, President Yeltsin is suffering from symptoms of a lack of concentration, more precisely drift, because the situation is far removed from the way he had hoped would turn out two years ago when he launched his economic reform program. Two years ago, Poltoranin continued, I put forward to Mr. Yeltsin a moderate, sober, gradualist reform plan to lead up to a full- fledged market economy. Gaydar, on the other hand, proposed a shortcut, which Yeltsin, for purely personal reasons, adopted and, which, in the end proved a failure and produced serious political and social eruptions that the president is now seeking to contain lest there be a total collapse. Yeltsin's awakening came rather too late, which, has, for the past months, put him in a depressed state of mind that I have watched at close range. It has affected his health considerably. Poltoranin said the president's illness is not a secret. He has been suffering from an acute infection of the brain vessels for several years. He has always complained of this. Naturally, his case is exacerbating with age. He added: Still, I do not think it is a hopeless case, although it affects his vigor and activity in one way or another. He added: Until recently, we have been practicing tennis with the president, his favorite hobby. I think he needs more rest. Poltoranin said what is more serious in the president's latest conduct is that he listened to tendentious advisers and shut himself off from the people because his entourage does not provide him with correct information on what is taking place in the country. Russia will see large-scale labor strikes after the formation of regional and federal committees all over the country. These committees will first demand early presidential elections, or more accurately, the dismissal of Yeltsin. Actually, these strikes are legal because the workers have not received their salaries for months. The commercial establishments, like Moost [name as transliterated], which finances several Zionist television programs, confiscates the state budget funds and uses them in commercial deals. After making huge profits, it pays a small part of the wages and salaries which, in turn, lose their purchasing power due to inflation. Thus, these establishments play a major destructive role, protected and supported by ministers in the government and by Ilyushin, the president's close aide who represents the interests of the ruling establishment. Regrettably, the president, due to the objective and personal factors I have mentioned, does not have an accurate or clear idea about what is going on around him. But when the street factor simmers and popular anger bursts out as a result of these policies, it will be too late to do anything. He added: Popular pressure may lead to early elections and this is something the president is not giving due consideration right now. Poltoranin said Gaydar's parliamentary bloc, Russia First, is a political movement with no future. Elaborating, he said: The bloc is suffering from a major split that will surface within the next few weeks. This bloc includes opportunists seeking senior positions. It also includes sincere deputies who blame it for its inactivity and unclear political and economic programs. Those deputies will form their own parliamentary bloc. Once they have done so, I expect them to dismiss Gaydar and the small group supporting him. The Russian national factor also plays a role in the collapse of Russia First because Gaydar refuses to deal with sincere Russians. He prefers to deal with educated Moscovites. These include many representatives of the lobby to which I have referred. He said he personally does not desire a split in Russia First, but reality is stronger than wishes. In his interview with AL-RA'Y, Poltoranin strongly condemned the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron and said: The bestial action perpetrated by an occupation settler was not a transient incident. The regime that sanctioned the horrible massacre should be taken to account because Israeli policy, which is hostile to the rights of the Arabs of Palestine, is fertile soil for acts of repression, terrorism, and the killing of innocent people. He indicated he will ask the Russian parliament to discuss the situation in the Middle East and draw up a sound policy for fruitful cooperation with the Arab states. He added: I said on more than one occasion that the Russian Foreign Ministry policy in the region is limping along on Western legs and that Russia should adopt an independent policy based on its national interests in the region, which is an area of important strategic geopolitical interests for our country. Russia has relinquished its interests in the Middle East to accommodate the aims of those forces that harbor evil to Russia and the Arabs. He said: The West, led by the United States, offered Russia nothing but bad advise. It is occupying positions Russia has abandoned one after another. Russia has only one option, namely, alliance with the Arab states and the Pacific Ocean states so an effective political and economic alliance can be established to end to the imbalance in world power and to confront the U.S. hegemony and the chauvinist expansionist U.S. policy in the world. Concluding, Poltoranin said Russia should toll the alarm in the Security Council vis-a-vis Israel's possession of nuclear weapons because the Israeli nuclear factor threatens the national security of Russia as well as that of the Arabs. He said: Using double standards in dealing with states' possession of weapons of mass destruction should be terminated.
