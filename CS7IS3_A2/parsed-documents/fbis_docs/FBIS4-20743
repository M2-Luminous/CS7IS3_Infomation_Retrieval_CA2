The 3-hour interview was published in GOZARESH-E HAFTEH, a sports, political, social, cultural and economic weekly published by 'Ali Mohammad Mahdavi-Khorrami. A translation of the interview appeared in AKHBAR. On penetration of Iranian culture and civilization into Central Asia and the Caucasus: "After the collapse of the Soviet Union, these nations were naturally interested in reestablishing ties with Iran. In a seminar on Central Asia held at UNESCO last month, I said that if we assess the services rendered by such Iranian personalities as Sepahsalar, Qa'em Maqam and Amir Kabir we would notice that their personality was based on three pillars: Iranianism, Islam and modernism. We have somebody like Amir Kabir (Mirza Taqi Khan, the vizier of Iran's Qajar King Nasereddin (1831-96) about whom men like Fereydun Adamiat and Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani have written books. In other words, he's a personality with which everybody agrees. Amir Kabir was extremely patriotic, devout and Muslim and very much interested in sciences. He set up a polytechnic institute in Tehran 20 years before the Japanese established theirs. Dr. Mosaddeq too was a Muslim, Iran-loving and modernist man. During the Pahlavi era the total divegard of one of these pillars, Islam, led to inbalance in society with the Islamic Revolution being its natural and rational final reaction. Naturally in the early days of the Revolution the impression existed that Islam was able to take the place of the other two elements too. Some went to extremes. But in a conversation with Mr. Rafsanjani, when he had just been elected president, he said he was like Amir Kabir and would focus all his attention on those three main pillars. Because he is a true Muslim and believes in being Iranian and in modernism and new sciences. That is also true about the Rev Ayatollah Khamene'i. Perhaps some elements want to go the extreme course and wrongly imagine that they can count on him. But in my opinion they are mistaken, for His Reverence (the esteemed leader) has proved to be an Iran-loving Muslim and a modernist as well. Now it is possible that he sometimes tells a faction to stay around as well, but in the final analysis he believes in those three branches. I have seen it myself that this mode of thinking exists more or less among officials and second-rank statesmen too. From all this I mean to deduce that Central Asia turns to Iran when it sees Iran rest on these three pillars. They are seeking an Iran which can offer them a suitable combination. They need each and every of these three factors: Islam, Iran and modernity. And so, a balanced behavior and the way we approach the Central Asian and Caucasian republics is reckoned to be a mojor element. We have to be sensitive and alert. We must not subject them all of a sudden to extremist and harsh elements, for they would quickly be driven away from us, as was observed in certain cases, particularly at the beginning. But I hope everything will get into its proper course with all these comings and goings and the aid Iran is providing these republics." On the PLO-Israel agreement: "Two or three years ago and before the present peace plan the PLO representative in UNESCO told me, `Deep down we are not dissatisfied with the Iranian government's tough anti-Israel positions for we can tell Israel we have in the Orient and among Islamic states countries which would not agree with the peace process and negotiation and so you'd better come down and give in to our rightful demands.' With this reasoning, my impression is that Iran, with its opposing stand is actually helping Palestine indirectly. And so for political isolation, we shouldn't worry, because we are defending the Palestinians, on the basis of an ideological-religious link with them, as a Muslim innocent people subjected to the Zionists' oppression. Of course, some maintain that Iran's opposing the peace process and then being left alone in the region may cause our country to go under the burden of making commitments to the Palestinians. But even this is nothing to worry about. Our diplomats, according to a French politician I recently spoke to, are very clever and know what path they are treading. Our Foreign Ministry and its diplomats have calculated everything and know what will happen next, just like chess players. Anyway, I think our positions are not going to harm us. I do believe that Iranian diplomats are patriots, faithful and have strong Islamic convictions and that they don't use those convictions as an excommunicating stick." On Salman Rushdie: "Apart from the fact that I'm against the prize offered for killing Rushdie, I am critical of three points. Firstly, our compatriots, notably the clergymen and Muslim intellectuals have not yet made any attempt to analyze the book, `The Satanic Verses'. They have merely endorsed the fatwa, without making it clear why the Imam issued the fatwa for the killing of Rushdie. The only substantial thing I have seen is a book by Mr. Ataollah Mohajerani. Sometime ago he made a speech at the Human Rights Commission which was highly based on reasoning. I could see clearly that the majority of those who listened to Mr. Mohajerani's speech on the fatwa were impressed. My second criticism is that the fatwa process, instead of being explained to the Westerners through non-government channels, is purely handled by the government. In my opinion making the fatwa a state matter is a weak point. Fatwa is a religious action and so all those conversant with religious laws should express opinion in this regard. My third criticism is that although the Islamic Conference Organization has verified the fatwa on two occasions, we have not yet been able to bring other Muslim countries onto the stage. A conference or seminar is still to be held on this subject. Last December 7, French television asked questions from seven or eight persons, including myself, about Salman Rushdie and then Rushdie appeared before the TV camera and for three hours talked about the views expressed by us. I was the only one who taked against Rushdie. I told the French television, `I don't understand it. If you have anything against Imam Khomeyni's fatwa, OK, fine, that's something. But then you don't have to give credit and award to someone who has insulted the beliefs of more than one billion Muslims. Well, you can say execution is a heavy punishment, but you can't claim Rushdie has committed no crime. Rushdie is asking us to endorse his freedom of being slanderous and abusive. Rushdie is telling us he's being chased, but it was only last month that he was in Washington and the week before that he was in, France, Germany, Spain and Italy. What chase? It's you who is chasing us! You go wherever you like. What's all this. You'd better go and be thankful to all that publicity which caused your worthless book to sell so much and made you famous.' "I told French television, `You're mistaken if you think with all this pressure you're exerting on the Iranian government you can help freedom of idea even a bit in the countries without it. You are badly mistaken, for to no Muslim intellectual, from Morocco to Indonesia, freedom means insulting the Prophet of Islam.' I was asked what I would suggest as a solution. And I said instead of going to the White House and complaining to Clinton, Salman Rushdie should go to the Muslims in India and Pakistan, his bithplace, and repent and ask for forgiveness. If he did that then the Muslims of India would be able to ask Iranian leaders to show mercy to that creature. The West and Rushdie are treading a wrong course; the government and the system of the Islamic Republic must continue to resist all these pressures. "After John Major, the British prime minister, had a meeting with Rushdie I wrote a letter to the newspaper Times, which, of course, the British hypocrisy prevented the letter which was addressed to Major, from being published. In that letter I asked Mr. Major: Wouldn't the Church of England in the 17th century have thrown into fire somebody who wrote a book full of insults to Saint Mary. "Let me emphasize again that the government and Muslim intellectuals of Iran have to resist all these pressures. Besides, those Iranians abroad who have subscribed to the Support Rushdie Statement have shown utter ignorance. Of course, what these 200 individuals have done shouldn't be taken seriously. It's more like a childish obstinacy to the Islamic Republic. It has no depth or content." On UNESCO: "The role of UNESCO is very important. It has to bring different cultures together and establish understanding among them. Now it is possible that some extremeist revolutionaries are not very much in favor of this, but there is no other choice. First, war and bloodshed has to stop before we can drive home what we have to say. There it depends on our own competence, capability and capacity. If the Iranian government, officials and intellectuals show themselves more than this, UNESCO too will be able to reflect like a mirror those features to the world." On Iranian Opposition: "First of all, the opposition abroad has never been a movement. Ever since the beginning these groups have been mere organizations without reliance on people, and almost all of them are on the payroll of foreign countries or the intelligence services of alien governments. An example is the Mojahedin Organization which is fed by Saddam Husayn. There are also gentlemen like Manuchehr Hezarkhani and Nasser Pakdaman who, unfortunately, at one time cooperated with me during the former regime, have now turned completely into Saddam Husayn's men. But then, there are a small minority who are getting paid. I haven't seen any substantial opponent of the Islamic Republic among the majority of Iranians living abroad." On whether there was any positive current among Iranian political groups abroad: "The positive current of these groups is thier failure. When in 1986 I went to Europe, some people came to me and asked me if I wanted to meet any leaders of those groups. I said I would talk to anyone who could tell me how he earned his livelihood. I remember an old-time friend who had collaborated with one of those dependent groups for one or two years. He opened up a bakery in our neighborhood in Paris and it is now some years that he's making bread and likes his country and motherland very much. Well now you could see more and more of these people there whose income is not from suspicious political sources but from their own work and activity. Basically, such individuals maintain no hard attitude towards the regime. If they have criticisms, say of hejab, they are basically a kind of family complaint and is not deep rooted. They have no enmity toward the system." On how the Islamic Republic could attract those individuals and make use of their knowledge and expertise: "I have often said that 90% of the Iranians abroad, even if one day they were political refugees, are now cultural and mental refugees. They don't consider the Islamic Republic to be dependent. My recommendation is to be less stringent. Fortunately, this has been done to a large extent during these two or three years. Right now, some of our embassies are issuing passports to the former emigres who have given up political work and the embassy staff are treating them in a human and agreeable way. But then it depends on the Islamic Republic, which has to provide the condition for these people, to prove effectiveness and make it possible for their expertise to be used in the best possible way in our industry and economy." On the country's economic problems: "I think this too has political roots. It is a question of how the Islamic Republic interprets the issue. The problem is that as yet no single line has been defined for the economic policies. The most important question in the Iranian economy is that of investment guarantees and boundaries. At present, local (as well as foreign) investment has no sufficient guarantee for its own stability. The absence of an overall strategy, the waywardness of establishments, the lack of coordination among organizations and departments, the discrete management and the still persisting confusion, which can render management unsteady, have forced `capital' to flee our country or ever set foot in Iran. So, not only the foreign capital will not come here, but the native capital won't get started. This system needs reexamination, economically as well as politically. You see, the Iranian private sector had make some progress during the Shah's time. For example, men like Khayyami and Iravani, who are even accepted by the Islamic Republic now, erected a series of factories in this country. These men could have been preserved and the Islamic Republic and the people could have benefited from their work. But unfortunately, we made that mistake and out of sheer ignorance we shood everybody, both good and bad, away. In fact, we spoiled and destroyed all that we had built and belonged to ourselves and had nothing to do with the Shah's regime. "To use Hojj Rafsanjani's words, our work is still sloganeering. It's still not clear to many devout and dedicated individuals that the end is one thing and the means another thing. We have all forgotten about the means. Some of the officials want to turn Iran into an Islamic Utopia overnight without having first secured the prerequisite means, facilities and conditions, particularly the world condition. Really, who has told you that, say, Iravani is someone fed by Mohammad Reza (Shah)? No, it wasn't like that at all. Iravani was someone who exploited a specific situation and set up a factory--that's all. Or about myslef. It makes me laugh when some people say I was associated with the Shah's regime. In all stages of my life I have always pursued specific cultural aims. I did deal with the regime but wasn't associated with it. I'm afraid, this type of mentality in Iran was advertised by the communists and the Islamists suffered its blow." On the effects of the Tudeh (Communist) Party's wrong and Machiavellian methods of branding those in the country's political environment: "The Tudeh supporters created the atmosphere of mental terror and repression in our country. They pronounced anyone who had breathed in the Shah's regime an associate of that regime. And that was while they themselves were for 25 years the unpaid lackeys, agents and informants of [the] Russians and the total slaves of the KGB. Yet they came and inculcated in some of our Islamists that (many of our intellectuals) were Taghuti and anti-national. These intellectuals could have been of a great deal of benefit to our country. But those instigations and insinuations made our country deplete of its potential energy. And who committed that treason? The KGB agents and Soviet stooges! Take a look at Mr. Kianuri's (former head of the Tudeh Party) memoirs. He so brazenly and just to please the Islamic Republic changes history and where, for example, the British had caused an event says it was the Americans who did it. They are not genuine in whatever they do, not even Mr. Ehsan Tabari--who some imagine was a man of knowledge, a thinker. This one too has in all his historical analyses referred to religion as being reactionary in natures. But when the Soviet Union's relations with the Muslims turned warmer he called religion progressive. "Our intellectuals are still more or less under the influence of this communist propaganda. Just look at the position some of opponents of the Islamic Republic take. They say since the Islamic Republic has developed a series of problems (which it has) and has committed a series of extremisms (which it has), one must stand up against it and deal with it negatively. This is just a side-effect of that very communist propaganda. These individuals must be told that the Islamic Republic's men may be full of problems, ignorant and uninformed, but they surely take no order from and are not dependent on foreigners. They may even commit something wrong in the name of Islam, but still they can be talked with, for they are independent." On how to give strength to national unity: "I hope [the] leaders of the Islamic Republic will expand their broadmindedness. And if they don't want to formally admit their mistakes and errors, at least they could admit it to themselves that they have gone wrong in some cases. What is now threatening Iran more than anything else is the pressure exerted on the educated class. Fortunately the Islamic Republic of Iran has scored some success in the field of agriculture--that's not to be denied. What the Construction Jihad has done is praiseworthy. I have often said what keeps me interested in the Islamic Republic, despite all its shortcomings, is primarily its political independence and absence of reliance on any power. This is such that after 200 years Iran now has a government that is standing on its own feet, irrespective of the errors it may commit. That the people in the street can now freely criticize high prices and economic problems shows the situation of the recent 10-15 years has made it possible for one to criticize. All this is admirable. But the sort of pressure that is now being exerted on a few million educated salary-earners is one of the dangers threatening the character and existence of Iran. In my view something like 40% of the country's economic woes is because of divided management and lack of harmony among various bodies." On the Persian translation of his book: "What I would like to ask the Guidance Ministry is not to insist on footnotes being everywhere in the book. The book has already been published in English, Spanish and Arabic. It's about a month that the book has started to be distributed in America. Its American publisher has written in his catalogue that the book by Dr. Naraqi is a reply to Betty Mahmudi's book `Not Without My Daughter'. When I first told Mr. Federico Mayor, the director-general of UNESCO, that my book had been published in Farsi he got up and said with surprise, "Bravo the Islamic Republic. It has let a book which talks of prison and torture be freely printed and published.' I have even heard that my book is read in turn in the houses of some Islamic Republic officials. Of course, I don't mean to conclude they make use of what I write, but be sure that they have read it. Fortunately, I have benefited by these gentlemen's favor. I have always said that the communist climate threw me into jail and the mullahist spirit (though some may not like the `word' mullah) saved me from death. Now some might say that's why I'm defending the Islamic Republic. But that's not so. I defend what is right. That's because I know the Islamic Republic has nothing against me. My writings all indicate I have always been mindful of Islam, mysticism and national questions. What I expect from my Muslim brothers is to learn from the earlier extremist mistakes and put aside excessiveness and let the way open for dialogue and discussion."
