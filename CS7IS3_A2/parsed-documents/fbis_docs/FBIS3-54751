The RMDR thanks those independent candidates and representatives of the Russian Free Labor Party and other public associations and trade unions who agreed to contest the elections together with it. The movement expresses special gratitude to its activists who bore the full burden of the election campaign on their shoulders and also to those entrepreneurs who supported the RMDR with their financial resources. The movement cordially congratulates all Russians whatever their political persuasions on the new year, 1994, and sincerely wishes them peace, harmony, happiness, and prosperity. Russia has had a referendum and its first multiparty elections. We are satisfied that the voters approved the state's new Constitution, which is what the RMDR actively urged the country's citizens to do. The elections to the Federal Assembly are of no less significance. For the first time in many years the representative power in the state has become directly dependent on the will and opinions of millions of voters. The historic significance of these events should not be underestimated. Undoubtedly, the lack of experience of multiparty elections in society was bound to have an impact on the results of the voting. However, this cannot be an excuse for the attacks on democracy on the part of those political forces which were unhappy with the election results. Our movement assesses the results of the elections in a balanced and sober way. By operating alone in the election marathon the RMDR could not surmount the 5-percent barrier and will be represented in the State Duma only by deputies elected in single-seat districts. But the more than 2 million votes cast for the movement's federal list are eloquent testimony to the fact that in its less than two years' existence the RMDR has become an influential political force in Russia. Looking to the future with confidence, the RMDR openly and honestly tells all the voters in the country that neither the platforms of the progovernment election blocs nor the platforms of the opposition forces will resolve Russia's pressing problems. Thus the most urgent task today is to elaborate a platform for transformations meeting the interests of the majority of the country's citizens. We urge all democratic forces not connected with the government to begin talks on the coordination of a single new reform platform -- the "Democratic Alternative." The people must know that not all democrats see the solution to the crisis through mass bankruptcies, unemployment, the depreciation of savings, the selling off of plants and stores on the cheap, disregard of the problems of preserving Russia's scientific and technical potential and saving its culture, and kowtowing to the West. The people must also know that they are not rigidly restricted in their choice solely to the following alternatives: a futile return to the past; a set of secuctively simple but unrealistic and often very dangerous solutions; or an improved course of shock therapy. Those 50 million voters who did not take part in the present elections and whose votes may decide the outcome of future elections must surely know that too.
