The next scheduled round of talks between the two countries is to begin on Jan. 18 in Moscow. Olljum in an interview with BNS said several important events, including a U.S.-Russian summit and the first meeting of the new Russian parliament, are to take place before Jan. 18. The chancellor said these events caused the need for some kind of preliminary talks before the scheduled meeting of delegations. Speaking about his planned meeting with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin, Olljum said "the invitation from the Estonian side remains in force." The foreign ministers of the two countries at a meeting in Brussels early last month agreed in principle on a meeting between Olljum and Churkin. Olljum said Churkin had been ready to come to Estonia in the last week of December, when Olljum was having his vacation. Estonia has received no proposal so far about a new possible date for Churkin's visit.
