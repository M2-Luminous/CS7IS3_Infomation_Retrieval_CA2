She was addressing a seminar on clash of civilizations at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, today. She said the task of the world leaders is not to make tragedies like Bosnia and Kashmir appear inevitable, normal, and least of all acceptable. She stressed the need to reverse this trend. Ms. Benazir Bhutto said joined by her Turkish counterpart, Dr. Tansu Ciller, she will visit Bosnia tomorrow. They will express solidarity with the mothers and children of Bosnia who have suffered ethnic cleansing, torture, aggression, and molestation at the hands of blatant aggression. She said that during the continued human rights violations in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Western countries have stood with arms folded, although they were in a position to stop the holocaust in their European Continent. The prime minister said this attitude is a blot on the conscience of the mankind as a whole and not a cause for Islam alone. She said Pakistan and India have been in a state of confrontation for nearly five decades. Settlement of the core issue of Kashmir can help improve regional stability in South Asia. She said this is a goal to which leaders of the region are supposed to work. Solution to the Kashmir problem is the key to regional peace, which must be pursued with utmost determination. The prime minister said that the realization of justice and equity within and among nations constitutes the most viable organizing principle for a new order in the emerging era. Human rights, democratic rights, and the quality of life for mankind must become vital factors in global policies. The prime minister went on to say that these values must cut across cultural and economic blocs. Ms. Benazir Bhutto said the rights of women and children, minorities, basic freedom, and humanitarian concerns must become the concern of a global village which becomes smaller and more intimate everyday with the advance of modern technology.
