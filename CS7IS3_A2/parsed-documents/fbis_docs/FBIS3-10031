This seminar-workshop is the last of other such events held here since last year. Grouped in commissions and in the plenary, the participants analyzed the practice and facets of social administration in Cuba, the National Information Agency has stated. Amalio Fiallo, director of the Center for the Promotion of Man (PROHOMBRE) based in Caracas, main speaker of the meeting, analyzed the fundamentals of participative society, an issue discussed last December at a meeting held in this provincial capital located 550 km east of Havana. Cubans for three decades have been the promoters of a united society, a society against individualism and greed, the participants of the meeting, also organized by Miami's CONTRAPUNTO magazine, concluded at that time. The forum, the second of which is held in the interior of the country, is financed by the Hans Seidel Foundation based in Bavaria, Germany. The first seminar on participative democracy was held last March in Havana, with the participation of prominent personalities of the Cuban State and Government. Similar meetings have been held over the past three years in Miami, New York, Tampa, Washington, as well as Puerto Rico, Venezuela, and Spain. More than 1,000 Cubans residing abroad have attended the aforementioned meetings.
