The total contribution made by the INTAS Association to these projects amounts to 21 million ECU. -- ``With this portfolio of projects, declared Prof. Antonio, Commissioner in charge of research at the European Commission, the INTAS Association constitutes one of the major actors and key elements in scientific cooperation between Western Europe and the former Soviet Union republics''. -- Each project associates a minimum of two laboratories in Western European countries and one in a FSU country. In total, 1214 FSU laboratories and 1754 of the INTAS member States laboratories are involved in the action. -- Covering a wide spectrum of disciplines in exact and natural sciences (physics, astrophysics, mathematics, chemistry, life sciences, Earth sciences, environment); applied sciences and technologies (engineering sciences, aeronautics, space, etc.) and social, economic and human sciences, these projects represent frontier research and are based on cooperation with mutual benefit. Involvement in these joint activities will permit research teams of the New Independent States to stay in their laboratories and get to continue their work at an international level. -- The funds awarded by INTAS to the FSU laboratories are essentially to cover the renumeration of their scientists; the funds directed to the Western European laboratories will cover project coordination costs. -- The 509 projects are the result of a call for submission of research proposals launched just after the setting up of INTAS and with the deadline of 15 October 1993. The large number of proposals received were evaluated by the Council of Scientists of the Association, which consists of eminent scientists from the European Union and the New Independent States. -- These projects represent a second wave of projects launched by INTAS. A first wave of 54 projects were launched in June 1993 for a total amount of 4 million ECU. -- New INTAS Association activities are foreseen for 1994 and should be announced in the beginning of this year. -- INTAS Association groups the European Union, its twelve Member States, Austria, Finland, Switzerland and all of the independent states of the former Soviet Union (Armenia, Azerbaidjan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldovia, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan). It was officially set up on 29 June 1993 by the first meeting of its General Assembly. Additional Information Secretariat of INTAS Association 8, Square de Meeus B-1040 Brussels Belgium
