Orlando Gomez; from the "Midday Television Newscast"] [Text] Despite Colombia's poor image in the realm of human rights violations, it is very possible that the EC countries will increase its tariff benefits. Because of the huge sacrifices Colombia, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Peru have made in blood and money in the struggle against drug trafficking, the EC four years ago established a system that allows these Latin American countries' products to enter the 12 EC countries without paying tariffs or taxes. Thanks to this measure, a considerable amount of Colombian exports are entering the old continent without any problem. EC Ambassador Jose Luis Benito Prior discussed the issue. [Begin Benito Prior recording] This measure covers over 90 percent of Colombia's exports, all industrial products, and a long list of farm products. Colombia, therefore, can congratulate itself for this positive atmosphere. [end recording] Thanks to the good work these countries have done in the struggle against drug trafficking, these preferential tariffs may be extended for another 10 years. [Begin Benito Prior recording] In Europe we appreciate all the efforts that Colombia and other Latin American countries are making in this struggle. Much must still be done, and together we must try to foster a spirit of cooperation. [end recording] These favorable conditions and terms will allow Colombia's most competitive products to establish roots on the old continent within a few years.
