FR940826-2-00004 FR940826-2-00003 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE Bureau of the Census [Docket Number 940827&hyph;4227] Feature and Address Reference Source Assessment Survey AGENCY: Bureau of the Census, Commerce. ACTION: Notice of Consideration. SUMMARY: Notice is hereby given that the Bureau of the Census plans to conduct a Feature and Address Reference Source Assessment Survey in the years 1995 through 1997 under the authority of Title 13, United States Code, Sections 141 and 193. The Census Bureau would use the information collected to identify and acquire reference sources needed to update address and geographic files that are critical for all three phases of the 2000 decennial census_data collection, data processing, and data tabulation. The information to be collected is not available from any single source, either governmental or nongovernmental. DATES: Any suggestions or recommendations concerning the proposed survey should be submitted in writing by September 26, 1994 to receive consideration. ADDRESSES: Director, Bureau of the Census, Washington, DC 20233. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John McKay, Geography Division, Bureau of the Census, Washington, DC 20233, or 301/763&hyph;4667. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Census Bureau will be the sole user of the information collected, and will use it to determine the reference sources that are the most complete and up to date, vis-a-vis streets and addresses, for each geographic area, typically a county or place. The identification and acquisition of complete and current reference sources are necessary for updating the Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (TIGER) data base and creating the Master Address File (MAF) so that the Census Bureau can use the TIGER data base to assign each structure number-street name address in the MAF to the correct geographic location. The TIGER data base is a nationwide geographic data base that is used for producing maps, organizing addresses, and tabulating statistical data. The MAF will be a permanent and continuously maintained nationwide inventory of housing unit addresses to meet the needs of the Census Bureau's statistical programs. The TIGER data base and the MAF are two critical components of the infrastructure to support the 2000 decennial census, and the success of that census depends, to a great extent, on their completeness and currency. This survey proposal has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for approval in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act, Public Law 96&hyph;511, as amended. Dated: August 18, 1994.
