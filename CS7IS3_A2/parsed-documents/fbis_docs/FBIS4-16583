Leaders of all CIS member-countries attended the sitting with the exception of Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev who was not able to come to Moscow due to his illness. Kazakhstan's Vice President Erik Asanbayev represented the republic at the summit. Russian President Boris Yeltsin addressed the plenary sitting of the Council of the Heads of States and Council of the Heads of CIS Governments. The whole text of his speech is presented below. "First of all, let me congratulate the Republic of Moldova on joining the Commonwealth of Independent States. The corresponding documents have been signed just before the beginning of this sitting. I also want to congratulate Chairman of Belarus' Supreme Soviet Mechyslaw Ivanovich Hryb on his first participation in the sitting of the Council of the heads of CIS states. Today we are due to discuss a wide spectrum of issues. What primarily concerns us is a package of decisions aimed at the practical implementation of the treaty on economic union. Economic union is the basis of the Commonwealth. The level of integration of CIS countries in general will finally depend upon our advances in this direction. Today the sitting of the heads of states has approved two decisions of principal significance. The first one concerns the creation of a commission for the economic union. It should become a working instrument to ensure the efficient activity of the economic union of the Commonwealth's countries. Another decision gives "a green light" to the creation of a free trade zone. In accordance with this decision all customs tariffs, taxes, and non-tariff restrictions in mutual trade between CIS countries will be gradually abolished. Thanks to this we shall prepare the ground for a stage-by-stage transfer to the customs union. These moves are not the conclusion but the beginning of economic integration. We must think over how to prevent a dual threat--an uncontrolled industrial recession, on the one hand, and hyperinflation, on the other. Today we have great opportunities for this. We have also given our backing to Ukraine's joining the economic union as an associate member. I believe that given Ukraine's economic potential this decision will be of great importance both for this republic and for other members of the economic union. I'd like to specially mention the documents on the unification of Russia's and Belarus' monetary systems signed several days ago. For the first time integration has risen to a qualitatively new level in the framework of the Commonwealth. I think that this way is acceptable not only for Russian-Belarusian relations but for relations between other states of the Commonwealth as well. If they demonstrate their readiness then we shall find appropriate practical solutions. To speak about Russia and Belarus, I'd like to stress that we act in strict correspondence with the will of our peoples aimed at a maximum closening of our states. We are ready to transfer to a combination of various forms of integration. Russia is ready to determine legal dimensions of mutual relations with those who are interested in closer interaction. It will cooperate on another basis with those who adhere to another position. We put forward one major provision--any agreement should be fulfilled. Russia is ready to make certain concessions minding the pressing interests of our partners. However, any concessions should be mutual. Otherwise, we shall not be able to gain a mutually beneficial cooperations. Strengthening of economic union necessitates a close interaction in other spheres as well. First of all we must care about a reliable guarding of the Commonwealth's external borders, strengthening of stability inside our countries and their defense from any outside threat. In addition, any economic community inevitably has common interests in the foreign economic sphere too. The Council of the heads of states discussed these issues and came to a common point of view. The head of states have confirmed a new provision on the Council of Defense Ministers. It takes into consideration structural changes which happened over the last time in the field of military cooperation. The Council heard the information of the Chairman of the CIS frontier forces commanders on the state of cooperation in the sphere of CIS external borders' guarding. We have reached principal agreements on this issue. The parties have signed a memorandum on the participation of the Commonwealth's states in the guarding of the external border in the Central-Asian region. When we understood that there are certain threats to the Commonwealth's security in the Caucuses, we reached agreements with the Republic of Georgia and Republic of Armenia on Russia's participation in the guarding of their external borders. While discussing this issue, we expressed the hope that Azerbaijan would join our joint efforts aimed at guarding the Commonwealth's external border. The memorandum on join measures providing for guarding external borders of CIS states with Ukraine and Belarus is also of great importance. The documents is ready for signing. [sentence as received] We are also ready to cooperate with Moldova on this issue. We have discussed such acute problems as the settlement of the Karabakh and Georgian-Abkhazian conflict and adopted documents of political nature in order to give a serious impetus to the settlement process. Today the heads of CIS states also paid attention to the situation in Tajikistan. The sitting passed a resolution to conclude the development of a constituent agreement and charter of the Aid Fund to the republic of Tajikistan, this decision expresses our common support to the inter-Tajik political dialogue. Simultaneously the heads of states agreed to the proposals prepared by the Foreign and Defense Ministers on additional measures aimed at the stabilization of the situation on the Tajik-Afghan border. The term of the collective peacekeeping forces' staying in Tajikistan has been prolonged till the end of 1994. In response to Kyrgyzstan's address the Council of the heads of states also passed a decision to render assistance to this country which seriously suffered from natural disasters early this year. On the whole we think that we have reached a new stage in the development of the Commonwealth. The integration strives of CIS states start to be implemented by practical deeds. Russia will not oppose the creation of inter-state structures, however, we need to precisely determine their prerogatives. The Commonwealth is getting stronger and stronger as an efficient regional association of states which is interested in a close cooperation with the UN, CSCE, and other international organizations. Currently we see the need to coordinate our foreign policy as well. The Commonwealth is able to actively collaborate with our partners in the West, in the South, and in the East. The main thing is to actively defend joint interests of the Commonwealth and to participate in global and regional political problems. This is the way along which we should go forward in the interests of the peoples of our countries, in the interests of the Commonwealth as a whole. Paraphrasing the old saying, we say now the following: "Let us take as much cooperation as meets the interest of each of our states." On the eve of the summit the majority of the leaders stressed the priority of the economic block of the agenda which includes 15 issues (sees Presidential Bulletin No 72). According to many heads of the states, in particular, Eduard Shevardnadze (Georgia), Askar Akayev (Kyrgyzstan), Mircea Snegur (Moldova), Emomali Rakhmonov (Tajikistan), the Inter-state Economic Committee of the Economic Union of CIS countries can play a special role in the strengthening of the integration processes. On the conclusion of the meeting the head of the Belarussian government Vyacheslav Kebich expressed dissatisfaction with the fact that instead of signing documents on the creation of an inter-state economic committee in charge of coordination of economic work of CIS countries and adoption of decisions in this sphere, the summit has created "an amorphous" body under the coordinating-consultative committee-commission of the economic union which has purely consultative functions. Kebich believes that under the absence of the inter-state economic committee CIS economic union "has not worked and will not work."
