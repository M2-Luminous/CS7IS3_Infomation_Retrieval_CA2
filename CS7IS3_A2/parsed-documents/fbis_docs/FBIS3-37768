The Estonian Foreign Ministry departmental head expressed the country's regret at what had happened and said the Estonian authorities will do everything to find out those guilty in the incident. The regional police of the local Harjumaa country is conducting the investigation, he said. Klaar spoke about the initial results of the investigation. But he also said Estonia considered it inadmissible that Russia in its recent statements has presented the incident as standing in connection with Estonia's official policy, the Estonian Foreign Ministry press office reports. Klaar said that Russian troops staying in Estonia against the will of the Estonian people are a source of potential risk. He expressed bewilderment over the position voiced Monday by Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Krolov, who sharply denounced the pickets that took place in front of the Russian naval garrison headquarters in Tallinn. Klaar said Estonia as a democratic country was guaranteeing the freedom of expression for its people, and that it is the freedom of parliament members to take part in such pickets. He was referring to Russia's protests over a deputy speaker of the Estonian parliament and the former foreign minister having taken part in picketing. The statement by the Russian Foreign Ministry followed after Estonian Ambassador Juri Kahn had been called to the ministry in Moscow Monday to be delivered Russia's protest on the attack against guards in the gatehouse of the Amari air base, Estonia. Five armed men had attacked the guardhouse, allegedly searching for weapons and ordering a Russian officer and a sergeant to lie on the ground outside. The attackers drove away in their car after setting the house on fire. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Krolov turned over to the Estonian ambassador the protest, calling the incident a provocation and an "extremely dangerous, purposeful action that may lead to consequences difficult to predict." In the words of another senior official at the Russian ministry, Sergei Prikhodko, Russia demanded from Estonia "exhaustive explanations and punishment of the authors of and participants in the provocation." At the same time the pickets in front of the Russian naval headquarters in Tallinn were termed by the official an action of incitement. "It is namely such actions that fuel reciprocal hostility and serve as ground for provocations like the one that occurred at Amari," the diplomat said.
