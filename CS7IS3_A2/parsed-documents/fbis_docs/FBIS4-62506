The president arrived for a four-day visit to Japan on 16 May. "It appears that Moscow does not realize that Russia could be squeezed out of Uzbekistan as a result of intensifying international competition for the emergent market in our republic," the president said. "Furthermore, we are eager to win foreign investment in order to develop our economy and to establish close ties with foreign enterprises and attract them to our market." Islam Karimov stressed that Uzbekistan wanted "to retain former links with Russia, but on a new basis." The president of Uzbekistan called for the establishment of Russo-Uzbek joint ventures based on close ties between industrial enterprises in the two countries dating from the Soviet period. "We are establishing joint ventures with firms in various foreign countries. There are now about 1,500 joint ventures in our republic, but there is not one Russo-Uzbek company," the president noted. He pointed out that Russian President Boris Yeltsin also fully agreed that the two republics should set up joint ventures. Islam Karimov stressed that "the peoples of Russia and Uzbekistan are bound by close spiritual ties." "The Russian people have always stood beside us during those times in our history when things were very difficult for us, and we do not forget this," the president said.
