Nevertheless, as if the elections have already been concluded, open negotiations are now taking place to reconcile the extreme positions. Hans Van Mierlo, D66 leader, sees great chances for success if all the parties are simply willing to compromise. He is asking a lot, because the various positions, as they stand in the electoral platforms, are far apart. One point which stands out is the VVD's desire to introduce a basic system. That would mean that all social security benefits apart from the AOW [General Pensions Law] would be reduced to 60 percent of the minimum wage. The D66 wants the partial abolition of the WAO [Law on Labor Disability]. The Green Left wants to increase minimum social security benefits and the WAO by 10 percent. Even if this radical party is excluded from a "purple" coalition, the PvdA remains a stumbling block because it wants to leave the WAO untouched. However, anyone who wanted to pin a party down to its electoral platform promises would be naive. The programs are written to make differences clear to voters. They say less about what a party is willing to sacrifice of its own ideals, if it is able to realize part of its program by taking part in government. There is also agreement on some points. For example the VVD, the D66, the PvdA, and the Green Left all want a sharper selection procedure in allocating social security. The Green Left and the D66 want to abolish the WAO for people partially incapacitated for work on the assumption that they will continue to work for their company. The VVD wants to abolish the WAO for people who have not had five years of paid work. The D66, the PvdA, and the VVD want stricter WW [Unemployment Law] criteria. The PvdA wants to abolish the WW for unemployed people who were employed for a short time only. The VVD and the D66 want no WW for people who resign of their own accord or refuse suitable work. It appears that all four would also be able to quickly reach agreement about the Sickness Insurance Act. The D66, the VVD, and the Green Left favor the abolition of the Act, subject to the condition that employers are obliged to pay part of the wages of their sick employees. The PvdA has said nothing about this point, therefore has not said it is against it. The VVD's wish to reduce all social security benefits for new cases to 60 percent of the minimum wage appears to be the big problem in the formation of a "purple" cabinet. That is 1,029 guilders per month. For an average employee who is made redundant or becomes unable to work, that would mean halving his current social security benefit. The VVD also understands that things cannot suddenly change just like that. The party is assuming that every employee will take out additional private insurance. Employees themselves will decide the size of their premiums and the extent of their security. Officially, the D66 and the PvdA see little in this additional insurance system. It encroaches on solidarity, among other reasons because private insurers will not accept providing additional insurance to all employees. Nevertheless the D66 and even the PvdA are calling for more freedom of individual choice within the social security system. In addition, last year the PvdA agreed on a reduction in WAO benefits with the argument that employees could take out additional insurance. It is generally recognized that it is difficult for employees to insure themselves against the financial consequences of redundancy. In order to be completely sure, the PvdA recently made enquiries at private insurers. They all said that the risk of redundancy was too uncertain and extremely expensive in times of increasing unemployment. But it does not all have to come from insurers. Employers already tend to supplement the WW payments of redundant employees. It will be the VVD in particular which will have to swallow its own wishes in the formation of a "purple" coalition.
