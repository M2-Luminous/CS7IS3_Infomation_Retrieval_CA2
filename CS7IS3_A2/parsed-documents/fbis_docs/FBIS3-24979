(PANA)--The 59th ordinary session of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) Council of Ministers ended in Addis Ababa on Friday [4 February], with the approval of a 59.66- million-dollar programme budget for the biennium 1994/96 for the continental body. The biennial budget, the first of its kind since the creation of the OAU in 1963, reflects the priorities of the organisation at a time when it is being called upon to shoulder more responsibilities, especially in the area of conflict resolution in the continent. The meeting, which began on Monday, also adopted a number of resolutions on political and economic matters affecting some of the organisation's 52 member-states. The ministers deplored the fact that conflicts now persist in Africa and hailed the establishment of a mechanism for conflict resolution, which they said was "a step that would enable Africa to take control of its own problems, to which it should find solutions without foreign interference." On South Africa, the council appealed to each member state to send at least two observers to reinforce the OAU mission in South Africa to monitor the all-race elections scheduled to take place as from 26 April. It also urged the contries to contribute to the special fund to assist the liberation movements in the elections. On Burundi, the council endorsed the establishment of an OAU mission in Bujumbura to promote dialogue and national reconciliation following the violence and kilings prevalent in the country since the failed coup of October 1993. It appealed to the people of Burundi and all the political parties to cooperate with the OAU mission, whose aim is purely to help the people of Burundi regain peace, confidence, and security. On the situation in Angola, where renewed fighting erupted after the 1992 election won by the MPLA [Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola] government, the council said it "strongly condemns UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] for the escalation of military action and for its persistent occuptation of towns, villages, and small areas, which have undermined the peace process." It urged leaders of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) to negotiate seriously at the current talks in Lusaka and reach an agreement with the Angolan Government so that a durable cease-fire accord could be signed. The council also appealed to member states and the international community to give full political, diplomatic, and material support to the MPLA government so as to enable it to restore peace. The council adopted a resolution on Somalia where American troops serving with the United Nations peacekeeping are to withdraw by the end of March. It called on the United Nations to work in close coordination with the OAU and the Ethiopian president to facilitate political reconciliation and implementation of all agreements reached by all the Somalian factions. The council observed that "restoration of peace in Somalia remains essentially the responsibility of Somalis and that the internatimnal community can only help them in the realisation of that objective."
