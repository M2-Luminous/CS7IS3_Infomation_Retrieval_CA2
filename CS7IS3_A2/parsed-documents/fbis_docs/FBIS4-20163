So it is, and so it will be, and it is no use packaging this fact in realpolitik explanations. The nightmare in Gorazde and the humanitarian catastrophe now under way will haunt us far into the future. The responsibility for things having come this far rests, as far as the latest phases of the procession of events, not least on Russia. As the traditional ally of the Serbs, the Russians insisted on playing a quite important role in solving the Yugoslav conflict, only to find out what has long been clear to all others, namely that the Bosnian Serbs are not to be counted upon. In the process of coming to this realization, Moscow protested so loudly about NATO's two bomb attacks that this was understood by the Serbs, correctly, as it turned out, as a signal that their advance could continue without risk of a tougher international course of action. From the United States have come very contradictory statements as the situation at the front has become worse and worse. First the government in Washington denied that air attacks were being contemplated in the discussions, then these were employed to a very limited extent, and then -- when they were not as effective as intended -- the United States failed to follow them up militarily, and instead offered new diplomatic initiatives. The European Union has confined itself to a still more threadbare declaration about increasing diplomatic pressure on the attacking Serbs. The result is that the UN's credibility has received a deathblow, since it has been seen that the resolution that designated Gorazde and other Muslim enclaves as safe areas that cannot be overrun militarily has proven completely worthless. The line that was drawn in the sand could thus still be crossed. This is obviously first of all an expression of a growing cynicism from the Serbian side, but it is also a striking defeat for the world as a whole. To both present as well as potential despots everywhere a signal has been sent that the international community can be reduced to a paper tiger as long as sufficient determination is shown. What now? A minimum requirement must be that the UN's authorization be expanded so that there is no doubt about the international will to protect the other safe areas, including Tuzla, where Danish tanks are deployed. In this connection, happily, Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen yesterday on behalf of Denmark backed the demand for an expanded mandate. It is apparently too late to save Gorazde from a horrible fate, but the humiliation ought to be used to ensure that no repetitions occur.
