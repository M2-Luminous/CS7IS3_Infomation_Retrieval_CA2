FR941003-0-00013 FR941003-0-00003 DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT Office of the Secretary 24 CFR Part 791 [Docket No. R&hyph;94&hyph;1752; FR&hyph;3737&hyph;F&hyph;01] Allocation of Budget Authority for Indian Housing AGENCY: Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, HUD. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This rule amends HUD's regulations at 24 CFR part 791 on the allocation of budget authority with respect to the data to be used in determining the relative need for housing assistance in each HUD Field Office jurisdiction for the Indian housing program under 24 CFR part 905. EFFECTIVE DATE: November 2, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dom Nessi, Director, Office of Native American Programs, Room 8204, L'Enfant Plaza, Building 490 East, Washington, DC 20410; telephone (202) 755&hyph;0066; (TDD) (202) 708&hyph;9300. (These telephone numbers are not toll-free.) SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Subpart D of 24 CFR part 791 provides the procedures for allocating budget authority under section 213(d) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 among the HUD Field Offices for certain programs specified in 24 CFR 791.101(a). The regulations currently provide that budget authority for the Indian housing program under 24 CFR part 905 shall be allocated on the basis of the relative housing needs of the Indian tribal population, ``as measured by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and by data for non-BIA recognized groups served by the Indian housing program.'' (See 24 CFR 791.402(c)(2).) The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) no longer provides data upon which HUD can make its determination. This rule amends ยง791.402(c)(2) to provide that HUD will base its determination upon data from the most recent, available decennial census and, where appropriate, more recent data from the Bureau of the Census or other Federal agencies. Justification for Final Rule Making In accordance with its own regulations on rulemaking in 24 CFR part 10, the Department generally publishes a rule for public comment before issuing a rule for effect, unless to do so would be impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest. This rule is being published for effect without prior public comment because the Department believes to do so would be unnecessary. The decennial census is the source of data used in making determinations for allocating budget authority in non-Indian housing programs, and therefore, is one the Department has confidence in as a reliable and objective source. Other Matters Environmental Impact In accordance with 40 CFR 1508.4 of the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality and 24 CFR 50.20(k) of the HUD regulations, the policies and procedures contained in this rule relate only to internal administrative procedures whose content does not constitute a development decision nor affect the physical condition of project areas or building sites and, therefore, are categorically excluded from the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this document before publication and by approving it certifies that the rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The rule revises existing procedures for the allocation of housing assistance funds, but will make no change in the economic impact of these procedures on small entities. Executive Order 12606, the Family The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family , has determined that this rule will not have a significant impact on family formation, maintenance, or well-being. No significant change in existing HUD policies or programs will result from promulgation of this rule, as those policies and programs relate to family concerns. Executive Order 12612, Federalism The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined that this rule does not involve the preemption of State law by Federal statute or regulation and does not have Federalism implications. Specifically, the rule will not substantially alter the established roles of HUD and the States and local governments, including IHAs, in administering affected programs. As a result, the rule is not subject to review. Regulatory Agenda This rule was not listed on the Department's semi-annual regulatory agenda published on April 25, 1994, at 59 FR 20424, under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
