According an Infratest poll (1,117 persons polled, conclusion of poll on 14 February), support for the CDU between Ruegen and the Erz Mountains has dropped to 14 percent. Thus, the party is only sightly ahead of the successor party of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany [SED], the Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS]. At 24 percent, the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] received the best rating, but it also trails far behind the group of frustrated citizens who do not have positive feelings for any party (37 percent). A dramatic loss of confidence was also observed concerning the question of competence. Only every second east German believes that the parties can resolve major problems, including unemployment, internal security, and the adaptation of the eastern level to the western. As far as the parties are concerned, the SPD has a lead over the CDU. Regarding unemployment, the ratio is 30 to 15. On the issue of social security, the CDU trails behind the PDS. Observers view these figures, which do not yet determine the outcome of the elections, as a serious sign of helplessness. In addition, the economic and social problems resulting from the restructuring of the collapsing east German economy are not blamed on the SED but on the democratic parties. The question concerning the most convincing politician makes that clear: At 71 percent, Brandenburg's Minister for Social Affairs Regine Hildebrandt tops the list, followed by Saxon Minister-President Kurt Biedenkopf and Brandenburg Minister-President Manfred Stolpe. Ms. Hildebrandt's strategy is to present people in the new laender as those who are always discriminated against. Her often-used slogan "We must not put up with this," makes her the most popular politician in east Germany. Politicians, however, who seek reconciliation can rely on less support: Wolfgang Thierse (33), Angela Merkel (24), and Bernhard Vogel (23). Even Helmut Kohl, the chancellor of German unity, did not receive more than 23 percent.
