The Albanian democratic state and all the Albanians respected the religious feelings of the Albanian Orthodox believers. The Albanian Television devoted an expanded part of its programs to the religious ceremonies of the Orthodox Easter. But, we regret that the Greek manipulations and provocations were not absent even during this marked religious holiday. The Democratic Party of Albania denounces as groundless and niggardly the interventions of the Greek Government in affairs of the Albanian Autocephalous Orthodox Church. These acts speak of another example of the continual Greek interventions in the internal affairs of Albania. The Albanian Autocephalous Orthodox Church is independent in its activity and mission and being so it has served and serves the Albanian Orthodox believers and national interests of Albania. We avail of the opportunity, the DP press release emphasizes, to remind his holiness, Janullatos, that tens and hundreds of Albanian clergies and patriots have been tried and sacrificed their lives for the Albanian Autocephalous Orthodox Church. The Democratic Party of Albania considers as holy the independence of the Albanian Autocephalous Orthodox Church and condemns any intervention and intrusion.
