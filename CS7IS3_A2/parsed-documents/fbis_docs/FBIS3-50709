I walked toward the main entrance of City Hall, which was occupied by members of the self-styled Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN). I asked to speak with Commander Marcos. An Indian carrying a gun told me to go in. I climbed to the second floor. Everything is destroyed; only the lamps hung intact from the ceiling. [Gutierrez] Commander, your troops, the EZLN, seem a bit too weak to march into Mexico City and overthrow Salinas. Is your attitude a bit naive? [Commander Marcos] Look, if you are waiting for our arrival in the capital, it will take some time. he chuckles But seriously, I can tell you that what you see here in San Cristobal is only a very small portion of our troops; many of our men would never be recognized because they wear clothes from the mountains, where there are many more Zapatistas than you or the government can imagine. Beside, we do not expect to arrive in the capital with our men alone but with many more who will join us along the way. [Gutierrez] Your weapons are much less powerful than the Army's. Is that a great disadvantage? [Commander Marcos] Our weapons are the people and we know the mountains better than anyone. [Gutierrez] Where were you born? [Commander Marcos] I can tell you I am a Mexican, like all the struggling members of the Zapatista Army. I am not from Chiapas, however. [Gutierrez] Where did you receive your military training? [Commander Marcos] I can tell you I have military training but nothing else. I know the difference between fighting in the city, in the countryside, in the flat lands, in the mountains, in the jungle, and in the desert. A colleague of Commander Marcos addresses him and they talk for a few minutes. I look around. I see Chiapas Indians, armed with really old guns except for some 19 or 20 of them who carry better weapons. I take the opportunity to ask one of them about the reasons and risks of this uprising, and the only reply I received was: "We have been shafted, we are hungry, but we are fighting. We have no home or medicines, but we are fighting." I return to Commander Marcos who just learned that the uprising was reported on television. He stares at me and says: "Let's see if those sons of bitches continue to deny the existence of guerrillas in Mexico." [Gutierrez] Have you anything to do with Liberation Theology? [Commander Marcos] No, we have become liberated without any theology. he laughs Among our people we have evangelists, Catholics, atheists, sorcerers, etc. I am not joking about the sorcerers. There are sorcerers from Chiapas. Marcos seems well instructed and very sure of his statements. He jokes around as if his life were not in serious danger [Gutierrez] Does the EZLN want new elections after a transition government? [Commander Marcos] We are demanding real elections for the first time in many years. What we now have, what they are planning for Colosio is just a masquerade. We all know that the votes do not count and that everything follows the whim of (Carlos) Salinas, who is a usurper and a traitor. We demand real elections with a chance for all parties, not just for the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party]. [Gutierrez] Everything seems to indicate that the inhabitants of San Cristobal are not in the least happy with your attack on this city. Everyone on the street is making comments like, violence doesn't lead anywhere and other similar things. Are you not worried about this repudiation by the people? [Commander Marcos] Of course I would prefer things to be different. But I want to clarify that San Cristobal's residents and the non-Indian population are racists. If one of them boards a bus and an Indian is seated, they make him stand to allow the other person to sit. If an Indian is coming down the street, either walking or on his bicycle, they will drive their cars dangerously close, threatening the Indian. If those kind of people condemn the EZLN, you can imagine that I do not care in the least. "As for the issue that violence doesn't lead anywhere, I can answer you that we have adopted this extreme position because of the institutional violence that causes us to die of cholera, malaria, or measles; which allows the Army to permanently violate human rights; and which allows hunger and misery to prevail in the country, all because of Salinas. We do not even want to become the government. We only want a democratically elected government and respect for ethnic groups. Another thing I would like to clarify is that I am not the leader of the EZLN. We do not have a leader; we have a committee. I am only in charge of the operation in San Cristobal."
