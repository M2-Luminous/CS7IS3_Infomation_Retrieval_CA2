This aspect of the meeting, however, has been kept in the background. Neither Russian nor Belarusian papers have provided any details on the negotiations and agreements signed at the summit. Is this a military secret? [Kazlowski] Not everything is secret. The agreements, as far as I know, are not secret, and they will be made public. Journalists are simply more interested in economic, social, or national issues than in military cooperation which has recently become unfashionable. This is, as the saying goes, a matter of taste however. Two packages of military issues have been discussed at the Moscow meeting. The first one concerns measures for stabilizing the situation on the Tajikistani-Afghan border and timetables, the number, and the tasks of the peacekeeping forces in the Republic of Tajikistan. However, since Belarus had not signed an agreement on sending peacekeeping contingents, we did not participate in the debate on these issues. Also signed at the meeting were a resolution on the Council of CIS States Defense Ministers and an agreement on cooperation in mobilizing the economies of CIS countries. Documents from the second package were also aimed at strengthening the CIS collective security system. These were draft declarations of members of the Treaty on Collective Security, draft regulations regarding procedures of the Collective Security Council, draft documents regulating activities of the council's secretariat, and draft agreement on its location. The defense ministers initialed the drafts, but due to the fact that the agenda of the meeting of state and government leaders was very tight, documents from "the second military package" were not included in it. Perhaps they will be discussed at another meeting of state leaders, which is supposed to be held in early September. Even though economic issues dominated the Moscow summit and they virtually drove back military aspects, I do not see anything dangerous in this. It is important today to stabilize the situation in industry and the agricultural sector. If this is accomplished, defense problems will be resolved more successfully. [Bekhterev] Nevertheless, relations between national armies should also develop dynamically. Is it possible that this process will be slowed down, because the most important documents were not signed? [Kazlowski] Regardless of specific results of the meeting -- whether specific documents were signed or not -- the work aimed at improving cooperation and integration between national armies is continuing. First of all, the pace of this work is currently being determined by such a strictly civil process as the unification of Belarusian and Russian monetary systems. If this process, as the saying goes, proceeds, it will also be much easier for servicemen to develop relations in their area. We also lose a lot due to the disruption of economic ties. It should be enough to say that 80 percent of all Defense Ministry expenditures goes to Russia. This amounts to billions and billions of rubles. This figure is astronomically high not because we waste this money. We purchase only essential equipment without which our Army would no longer be an army. The problem is that Russian enterprises charge us three times as much as they do at Russia's internal market. If there is a common ruble and economic zone, it will be easier for us to supply the Army, train personnel, and earn experience.... [Bekhterev] Yet, Pavel Pavlovich, it is not a long way from the common ruble to a common army with Russia? [Kazlowski] Nobody says that there will be any unified CIS armed forces. The status of our Army is defined by the Constitution and the policy of neutrality, which has been conducted by our young state. There is no need to change this. While the independent Belarusian state exists, it will definitely have its own army. Another thing is that today we are unable to defend our sovereignty alone, either from military or political or economic viewpoints. Yes, Belarus is a state which proceeds toward neutrality, but not toward self-isolation! Why should we disrupt the unified antiaircraft defense system with Russia? Without Russian radars we would end up totally undefended against airstrikes by modern planes and missiles. It is technically impossible to develop any system of early warning on a small territory. I do not mention using satellites without which efficient defense and military command is unthinkable. Let us look at personnel training. To train, for example, pilots, it is necessary to create completely new structures, which would cost millions of dollars. The development of military science and new equipment... The list can go on and on. I would briefly respond to your question that Belarus needs a national army included in the CIS collective security system. The deeper the military integration the more reliable the defense of our state.
