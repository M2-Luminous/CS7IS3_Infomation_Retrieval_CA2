These lawsuits were mostly launched by overseas companies or foreign-funded ventures in China, who complained that their rights were being violated by Chinese bodies. But there were also a few Chinese who said their rights had been violated by foreign firms. These cases account for 20 percent of the total number of copyright cases which the court has accepted since its establishment last year. Cases now under investigation include a suit launched by the U.S. Disney Company who said its copyright had been violated by the Beijing Children's Publishing House, and that launched by Microsoft, Auto Desk, Lotus, who alleged that five Chinese companies had pirated U.S. computer software technology. There were also several Hong Kong and Taiwan companies seeking compensation for copyright losses through the court. "We have sealed up the software and computers in those accused Chinese companies last week for preserving evidence," said Su Chi, chief of the copyright court. He said these companies are all situated in Zhongguanchun, north-west Beijing, known as China's silicon valley. "But we cannot yet draw any conclusion at this moment," he said, adding that previously a Chinese firm was prosecuted by a foreign company based on false evidence. Professor Su, 37, who has studied law in Germany, said his court will treat overseas and Chinese parties based on the principle of fair judgement. "The judge is just a machine to execute laws at our court," he said. "We exclude any personal feelings." Judgements will be made according to China's Civil Prosecution Law and Copyright Law, which su said are in line with German laws and international copyright conventions. In the court, litigants have equal chances to air their case and no illegal interference will be allowed. Media and experts will be invited to hear the judgement if the case contains nothing confidential. According to Su, most cases were tried by his court successfully and the litigants felt satisfied. Recently, the court has tried a case concerning a Sino-French food firm and a Beijing supermarket. The supermarket illegally used the foreign-invested firm's well-known brand, "Vie de France", to sell Chinese-made bread. The Chinese firm was fined 15,000 yuan for copyright violation, though the illegal profit was only 700 yuan. "This is a warning to any copyright violators," Su said. "And the French boss told me his investment confidence has become stronger after the trial and he was preparing to set up new branches this year in China." China never favors local protectionism in court, he added. Su's court was the first copyright court in China. Now it has 16 full-time workers, including a computer software expert. All the judges have court working experience of at least five years and know English. Cases tried by the court covered the fields of patents, brand-names, publications, illegal competition, and pilfering of commercial secrets. The largest compensation stood at 31 million yuan. Copyright courts have also been established in some other major Chinese cities.
