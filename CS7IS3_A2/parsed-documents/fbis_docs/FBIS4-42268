It has been ascertained that PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, who has suffered significantly from the consecutive blows by the Turkish security forces to his organization, has put into effect an insidious plan to "cause new problems for Turkey" in northern Iraq by cooperating with Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK] leader Jalal Talabani. The PKK has persuaded many pro-PKK families in the Sirnak region to emigrate to northern Iraq. Some 20,000 people have crossed Turkey's border thus far. The emigrants moved from Isikveren and Sinath to areas known as the Seranish Fala and Seranish Islam, which are between Zakho, Kasrog, and Parak. They have established three settlements in the two areas. It has been ascertained that the majority of the emigrants are from the Guyam tribe. The officials have said that half of the tribe supports the government and many men serve as village guards. However, many of the remaining families are sympathetic to the PKK. Emigration Turkey is carefully watching the wave of emigration, which began in the latter half of February. The officials have established that several UN officials visit the three settlement every day to register the emigrants and supply them with food and clothing. The intelligence sevices have drawn up a report to inform the prime minister of the new situation. The report, which has already been submitted to Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, describes the PKK's new strategy as follows: 1. The PKK wishes to create a significant wave of emigration in order to persuade international organizations, the UN organization in particular, to take action. 2. The PKK wishes to create the impression that the operations the security forces carry out in Turkey are organized against innocent people and not the PKK. 3. Considering the fact that it has been unable to establish a foothold in areas close to Turkey's border as a result of the Turkish cross-border operations, the PKK wishes to establish safe areas for itself in the interior of northern Iraq. The PKK is aware that Turkey will not bomb the settlements in which thousands of women and children will live, so they will provide adequate shelter for the militants. 4. The PKK will move to cooperate with PUK Leader Jalal Talabani when the pro-PKK population increases in northern Iraq. The two sides will then take joint action against Democratic Party of Kurdistan [DPK] leader Mas'ud Barzani. 5. The number of settlements will be increased in time. Later, all of them will be joined together. That will create an opportunity for the PKK to place a large area under its control. Naturally, that will be the first of the steps the PKK will take to establish a Kurdish state. The DPK Is Careful The dangerous developments that have taken place during the past three months have moved the DPK into action. Mas'ud Barzani has warned the emigrants that he will "force them to return to Turkey if they cooperate with the PKK." That indicates his sensitive approach to the matter. Meanwhile, Turkish officials have explained to Barzani the objective behind the wave of emigration and urged him to help them. Ocalan's Instructions Abdullah Ocalan sent a message on 29 March ordering the establishment of settlements in various parts of northern Iraq. He also instructed his militants to put pressure on the local authorities to force them to agree that the PKK will be responsible for the defense of the settlements. Ocalan said that "the settlements will be rear bases, which the PKK will use as safe havens." He also explained that this action was to have been taken in 1990, but it was frustrated by the Gulf War. It has been established that Jalal Talabani has played a very important part in the new design. He has supported PKK's plan since securing its assurance that the emigrants in northern Iraq will vote in for the PUK in the elections of October 1994. Democracy Party's Role The PKK has achieved a certain degree of success through forcing the people in southeastern Turkey to emigrate to northern Iraq. It has been ascertained that a group of parliamentarians from the German Bundestag's Human Rights Subcommittee visited the settlements to study the situation on 4-10 May. Three Democracy Party deputies visited northern Iraq shortly after the German visit to try to convince the DPK and PUK to agree to a cease-fire. Officials in Ankara have described their visit as meaningful. It has been reported that the three deputies, accompanied by several correspondents, will also visit the three settlements. The officials are convinced that the Democracy Party has launched an initiative to draw attention in Turkey to the situation in northern Iraq.
