He expressed the hope that the substance of the magazine would serve as example to the Nigerian media in how to crusade for a viewpoint without precipitating anarchy and violence, particularly now that Nigeria is passing through its most trying period in its history. [Musa] This administration recognizes the vital role of the media in nation building. It seems competing areas of friction notwithstanding, I believe we can jointly work out a meaningful partnership for the overall benefit of our great country.
