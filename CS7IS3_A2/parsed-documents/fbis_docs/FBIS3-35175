Also stating in his report that Pakistan has not abandoned its nuclear program, the U.S. President has suggested that if Pakistan and the PRC consent to prevent the proliferation of nuclear arms, talks will be held with them, and the sanctions imposed on them will also be lifted. As is reflected in the contents of the report, the U.S. President has leveled allegations against Pakistan and India on the manufacture of nuclear weapons but has overtly exempted India from committing itself to nuclear nonproliferation and has maintained pressure on Pakistan. This indicates that the United States is openly biased on the India-Pakistan matter. Our politicians and policy makers should take note of this, and while formulating future policies, they should bear in mind that we need not look to any side or take orders on our national affairs; we should adopt a clear stand on them. Despite our repeated assurances, knowing all this full well, the only superpower has rejected our legitimate and clear stand.
