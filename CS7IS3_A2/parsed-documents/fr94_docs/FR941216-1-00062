FR941216-1-00062 FR941216-1-00010 (ii) Eligibility for integration. The debt instrument is a qualifying debt instrument because it is a variable rate debt instrument. The swap is a §1.1275&hyph;6 hedge because it is a financial instrument and a yield to maturity on the combined cash flows of the swap and the debt instrument can be calculated. Although the debt instrument is denominated in pounds, the swap hedges only interest rate risk, not currency risk. See §1.988&hyph;5(a) for the treatment of a debt instrument and a swap if the swap hedges currency risk. (iii) Treatment of the synthetic debt instrument. The synthetic debt instrument is a 5-year debt instrument that has an issue price of 0D1,000 and provides for semiannual interest payments of 0D50 and a principal payment of 0D1,000 at maturity. Under paragraph (g)(6) of this section, the semiannual interest payments are treated as qualified stated interest payments. Under paragraph (g)(7)(ii) of this section, the synthetic debt instrument's stated redemption price at maturity is 0D838 (the sum of all amounts to be received on the qualifying debt instrument and the §1.1275&hyph;6 hedge, reduced by all amounts to be paid on the §1.1275&hyph;6 hedge and the semiannual interest payments on the synthetic debt instrument). Because the issue price of the synthetic debt instrument exceeds the instrument's stated redemption price at maturity, the synthetic debt instrument does not have OID. The synthetic debt instrument, however, does have 0D162 of amortizable bond premium. The 0D162 prepayment on the §1.1275&hyph;6 hedge made by H on January 1, 1996, increases the adjusted issue price of the synthetic debt instrument to 0D1,162 immediately after it is issued. Example 4. Legging into an integrated transaction by a holder _(i) Facts. On January 1, 1996, X corporation purchases for $1,000,000 a debt instrument that matures on December 31, 2005. The debt instrument provides for annual payments of interest at the rate of 6 percent and for a payment at maturity equal to $1,000,000, increased by the excess, if any, of the price of 1,000 units of a commodity on December 31, 2005, over $350,000, and decreased by the excess, if any, of $350,000 over the price of 1,000 units of a commodity on that date. Assume that on the issue date the forward price of the commodity on December 31, 2005, is $370,000. The projected amount of the payment at maturity, determined under §1.1275&hyph;4(b)(4), therefore, is $1,020,000. On January 1, 1999, X enters into a cash settled forward contract with an unrelated party to sell 1,000 units of the commodity on December 31, 2005, for $450,000. Also on January 1, 1999, X identifies the transaction as an integrated transaction in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (f) of this section. (ii) Eligibility for integration. X meets the requirements for integration as of January 1, 1999. Therefore, X legged into an integrated transaction on that date. Prior to that date, X treats the debt instrument under the applicable rules of §1.1275&hyph;4. (iii) Treatment of the synthetic debt instrument. As of January 1, 1999, the debt instrument and the forward contract are treated as an integrated transaction. The issue price of the synthetic debt instrument is equal to the adjusted issue price of the qualifying debt instrument on the leg-in date, $1,004,804 (assuming one year accrual periods). The term of the synthetic debt instrument is from January 1, 1999 to December 31, 2005. The synthetic debt instrument provides for annual interest payments of $60,000 and a principal payment at maturity of $1,100,000 ($1,000,000 + $450,000 ^ $350,000). Under paragraph (g)(6) of this section, the annual interest payments are treated as qualified stated interest payments. Under paragraph (g)(7)(ii) of this section, the synthetic debt instrument's stated redemption price at maturity is $1,100,000 (the sum of all amounts to be received on the qualifying debt instrument and the §1.1275&hyph;6 hedge, reduced by all amounts to be paid on the §1.1275&hyph;6 hedge and the annual interest payments on the synthetic debt instrument). Example 5. Abusive leg-in _(i) Facts. On January 1, 1996, Y corporation purchases for $1,000,000 a debt instrument that matures on December 31, 2000. The debt instrument provides for annual payments of interest at the rate of 6 percent, a payment on December 31, 1998 of the increase, if any, in the price of a commodity from January 1, 1996 to December 31, 1998, and a payment at maturity of $1,000,000 and the increase, if any, in the price of the commodity from December 31, 1998 to maturity. Because the debt instrument is a contingent payment debt instrument subject to §1.1275&hyph;4, Y accrues interest based on the projected payment schedule. (ii) Leg-in. By December 1998, the price of the commodity has substantially increased and Y expects a positive adjustment on December 31, 1998. On December 20, 1998, Y enters into an agreement to exchange the two commodity based payments on the debt instrument for two payments on the same dates of $100,000 each. Y identifies the transaction as an integrated transaction in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (f) of this section. Y disposes of the hedge on January 15, 1999. (iii) Treatment. The legging into an integrated transaction has the effect of deferring the positive adjustment from 1998 to 1999. Because Y legged into the integrated transaction with a principal purpose to defer the positive adjustment, the Commissioner may treat the debt instrument as sold for its fair market value on the leg-in date, December 20, 1998, or refuse to allow integration. Example 6. Integration of offsetting debt instruments _(i) Facts. On January 1, 1996, Z issues two 10-year debt instruments. The first, Issue 1, has an issue price of $1,000, pays interest annually at 6 percent, and, at maturity, pays $1,000, increased by $1 times the increase, if any, in the value of the S&P 100 Index over the term of the instrument and reduced by $1 times the decrease, if any, in the value of the S&P 100 Index over the term of the instrument. However, the amount paid at maturity may not be less than $500 or more than $1,500. The second, Issue 2, has an issue price of $1,000, pays interest annually at 8 percent, and, at maturity, pays $1,000, reduced by $1 times the increase, if any, in the value of the S&P 100 Index over the term of the instrument and increased by $1 times the decrease, if any, in the value of the S&P 100 Index over the term of the instrument. The amount paid at maturity may not be less than $500 or more than $1,500. As of January 1, 1996, Z identifies Issue 1 as the qualifying debt instrument, Issue 2 as a §1.1275&hyph;6 hedge, and otherwise meets the identification requirements of paragraph (f) of this section.
