FR940526-2-00075 FR940526-2-00049 As described above, members who do not believe that they can execute their block-sized agency orders on the Amex currently take their orders to the regional stock exchanges, completely avoiding exposure to limit orders on the Amex specialist's book. The Commission believes that approval of the proposal will not result in incremental harm to public customers. Assume, for example, that the market in XYZ is quoted 201/4 bid, 203/8 offer, 100,000 shares by 100,000 shares. Investor A has a limit buy order on the book at 201/4 for 1,000 shares of XYZ. In today's environment, a member intending to effect a 100,000 share agency cross transaction at a price of 201/4 could go to another market to execute the cross, thereby avoiding exposure to Investor A's limit buy order of 201/4. As a result of the proposed rule change, the member would, to comply with Rule 151, bid 201/4 for 100,000 shares and offer 100,000 shares at 203/8 on the Amex floor. The member's 100,000 share clean cross of 201/4 would have priority, and the cross could not be broken up at that price. Although Investor A's limit buy order would not be executed, this is the same result as if the block was done on another market under the Amex's current rules. The commission also believes that the proposal restricts sufficiently the circumstances in which members may execute clean cross transactions on the Exchange. In particular, the Commission believes that the share size threshold of 25,000 shares or more should help to ensure that the clean cross proposal will apply primarily to larger block-sized orders where the depth of the prevailing bid or offer may be less likely to satisfy either side of the clean cross. In addition, because the proposal is limited to non-member orders only, the proposal should assist public customers in effecting cross transactions on the Amex and should not give any special advantage to members and member organizations in their proprietary trading. Finally, the Commission finds that the proposed amendments to Commentary .01 will eliminate potential confusion by specifying that the Amex's existing size precedence rule does not apply to those agency crosses of 25,000 shares which can be executed pursuant to Commentary .02. The Commission also has concluded that the Amex proposal will clarify the procedures for claiming precedence based on size, and should help to ensure that bids or offers with priority are not disadvantaged. V. Conclusion For the above reasons, the Commission believes that the proposed rule change, as amended, is not inconsistent with Sections 6(b)(5), 6(b)(8) and 11A(a)(1)(C)(ii) of the Act. 16 16 15 U.S.C. 78f and 78k&hyph;1 (1988). It therefore is ordered, Pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act 17 that the proposed rule change (SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;92&hyph;41), including Amendment No. 1, is approved. 17 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1988). For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
