In particular, according to Gogolashvili, the Department for the Struggle Against Economic Crimes is investigating a large number of facts connected with credits received by various firms and private individuals. All these processes involve serious violations. Under the pretext of purchasing food products, petrol, and so forth, firms are receiving large credits from banks (often through stooges). Then, these sums are transferred to other banks outside the republic; as a rule, these sums -- already in rubles and dollars -- are "pocketed" and, naturally, they are not used to purchase anything. In this regard, according to agreements concluded between the ministries of internal affairs of the CIS member states, power structures are carrying out joint work (sometimes with the involvement of Interpol) aimed at exposing all these facts.
