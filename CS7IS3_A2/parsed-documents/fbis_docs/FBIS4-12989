FBIS4-12989 "drnes073_l_94008" FBIS-NES-94-073 Daily Report 15 Apr 1994 ISRAEL Katyusha Volleys Land in Galilee; No Casualties Katyusha Volleys Land in Galilee; No Casualties TA1504045394 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in English 0400 GMT 15 Apr 94 TA1504045394 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el English BFN [Text] Katyusha rockets were fired during the night into the Galilee Panhandle from south Lebanon. There were no reports of injuries or damage. On the line now is reporter Alan Ben-'Ami: No one was hurt from the katyusha rockets which fell in the Galilee Panhandle twice during the night, nor were there any reports of damage. But it is only with first light that the Army has been able to begin sweeping the area to find exactly were the rockets fell. The katyusha attacks followed shelling of the Lebanese port city of Sidon by South Lebanon Army [SLA] soldiers last night, and that shooting came in the wake of two explosions yesterday in the village of 'Aramta in the security zone, explosions which killed several SLA soldiers and wounded a dozen more people, both soldiers and civilians. One of the dead SLA men is said to be Major As'ad Nasir, an SLA commander in the area. Hizballah has claimed responsibility for the bomb blasts, and Hizballah gunners also began shelling a number of SLA positions during the night. SLA gunners returned by firing a number of shells at different targets, including Sidon. Lebanese Army gunners also said to have taken part in exchanges of fire yesterday. This is the first time that this big port city in south Lebanon has come under fire in some years, and it is not clear just why it was targeted, but the SLA shellings claimed a number of lives and wounded a dozen people or so in this city, as well as setting a number of fires. Israeli military sources deny reports that the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] was involved in the shooting in any way, and it was clearly a breach in the understandings which were reached after Operation Accountability in south Lebanon last year. It's not clear now just how the situation is going to develop, whether stability will return to the north or not, but tension remains very high both inside south Lebanon and in the Israeli border towns in the north.
