Following the conference, AL-HAYAH conducted a wide-ranging interview with Eritrean President Issaias Afewerki, in which he addressed the difficult economic conditions, political pluralism, the border crisis with Sudan, Eritrea's relations with the countries of the Horn of Africa, the Red Sea, and Israel, and, finally, the reasons that Western countries failed to keep their economic promises to Eritrea on the eve of its independence. The text of the interview follows: [Dahli] What are the broad political features you have drawn up for the coming years in your recent conference? [Issaias] The country is now passing through a delicate transitional period, and so broad political lines were drawn. They will take shape in action within two years, starting now, and until the establishment of a constitutional government that will effectively end the transitional period and start a new phase in which the features of the modern Eritrean state will become clear at every political, economic, cultural, and social level. [Dahli] What, then, are the broad lines of the transitional period? [Issaias] The Eritrean Government will try, untiringly, throughout this transition period, to relieve the troubles of daily life and to plan a comprehensive economic policy that will move the country onto a constitutional path to govern and control political activity in the country. [Dahli] What is the role of the People's Front in the transitional phase? [Issaias] This is the big question, which the conference did not answer satisfactorily or comprehensively. [Dahli] What about the nature of the relations between the Front and the government? [Issaias] We will create a practical and not only a theoretical divide between the two sides, so that we do not fall into the problem of duplication in bearing responsibility, and also so that there will be no interference between Front matters and government issues. Of course, it is hard to speak of a definitive divide between the programs of the Front and the government, because of the mutual assistance and integration between the two entities. [Dahli] Will you give us some idea of the economic policy the Eritrean government has enacted? [Issaias] We have no magic formula ready that can lift Eritrea out of its bad economic conditions to the level of the developed countries. So we have decided to submit an economic working paper for discussion before the end of the first half of this year. We will submit it for inspection and revision before adopting it offficially. I don't think I need to point out that the 30-year war caused widespread destruction. Today we are trying to follow a path for the country's economic development in a local, regional, and international climate, and to say the least, things are not encouraging. [Dahli] Conference members elected no more than three former members of the politburo of the People's Front to the executive office (the highest authority) 16 commanders of the upper echelons. How do you explain this? [Issaias] The old leadership should never sit in the seats of the presidency. It is in their interest, and the interest of the organization as well, to open the way for new leadership. All there is to it, is that there must be careful renewal to prevent any upset in the balance of the organization that could have disastrous consequences. The positive thing as that everyone wanted to avoid violent shocks, so that all agencies could carry out their role normally, and in the context of sovereignty, of a wave of principled and permanent renewal for the leadership. This would be a fixed principle, limiting the candidacy of any commander of one center to a single time. [Dahli] What is the purpose of that? [Issaias] This decision, which appears to be mandatory, is intended to open the field for rising generations, so that they may in turn take up leadership positions. True, there were those who objected to this, saying, "How can we do without people who have long experience and great expertise and depend on youths who lack expertise and experience?" [Dahli] So what is the solution? [Issaias] The solution lies in not burning bridges and then jumping through the air. We do not want to find ourselves face to face with an unknown fate. The wisest thing is a compromise that provides for continuity without tampering with the spirit of the principle of specifying the leadership in all institutions, being on guard against falling into deadlock, bankruptcy, and an inability to understand events, to say nothing of the spirit of the age. Ramadan's Position Ideal [Dahli] In the context of the process of renewing the leadership to which I alluded, what is your view of (Politburo member and former minister in the local government) Ramadan Muhammad Nur's position in the conference, and his demand to be dismissed from any leadership position in the organization? [Issaias] People's selfishness often prevents them from adopting the ideal position that our brother has taken. This ideal position should not be confined to a specific individual. We must establish it as a means of action in this organization to maintain the vitality and dynamism of the body and soul of the People's Front. I am not sure that all the people understand the significance of what our brother Ramadan Muhammad Nur meant to proclaim to the Eritrean people and all the members of the conference. [Dahli] What was the significance of that message? [Issaias] Renewal is the norm in life, applied equally to him and to others. Brother Ramadan's courageous step will benefit many, including me. One distinctive thing is that one notes the unhappiness of some individuals of lower rank than Ramadan because no one nominated them, or because they did not win any leadership position. What a difference between the two positions! [Dahli] What is the meaning of the opening of the People's Front conference to the participation of most of the factions of the former Eritrean revolution, of whom we may name Muhammad Sa'id Nawid (President of the Executive Committee of the Eritrean Liberation Front-Unified Organization), Hiruy Tedla Bairu (President of the Eritrean People's Democratic Movement), Idris Galaydos, Taha Nur (member of the Supreme Council of the Eritrean Liberation Front [ELF], Muhammad Nur Ahmad (responsible for foreign relations in the Eritrean Liberation Front-Revolutionary Council), and others? [Issaias] We tried as much as possible to broaden participation. It is very unfortunate that the result did not come up to our aspirations and expectations. [Dahli] Why? [Issaias] I do not want to lay the blame on one particular side. I hope that those who did not heed our call the last time will do so the next time. The door of participation is open to whomever wishes to take part in the battle to rebuild the country. [Dahli] What will your position be towards those who differ with you fundamentally? [Issaias] From now on there must be no disputes left over from the residue of the war of liberation phase. The reopening of old disputes can only be a waste of time and effort. But if there is a difference over the method of hastening the process of rebuilding the country, or over the manner of establishing national unity, then this by any standards would be considered a kindness, because it benefits the country and its citizens. [Dahli] So that we can be clearer--is the participation you are talking about confined to the People's Front and the Eritrean Government, or does it extend outside them? I mean, to form opposition parties? [Issaias] We have a great desire to expand the scope of participation in the context of the Front, and outside it. We do acknowledge the right to establish political parties, subject to certain conditions, so that parties will not be founded without objective justifications. When I say this, I am not speaking from ignorance, but from experience, the experience of several neighboring countries and other Third World countries I am thinking of. [Dahli] In past years, the People's Front vehemently denied the existence of a secret Marxist party within it. In this conference, you revealed the existence of this party. My question is: When was this party founded, and why was it disbanded at the end of 1989, as you said? [Issaias] The party had deep roots, going back to 1966, the year I traveled to China for a training course with Brother Ramadan Muhammad Nur. [Dahli] What was the identity of this party? [Issaias] The goal of the party was to spread progressive ideas in Eritrea, which was plagued by traditional, worn-out political ideas, which hindered the process of launching the Eritrean revolution, and prolonged the suffering of the people during the war of liberation. Attempts to establish the party were met with conditions of prolonged sacrifice after our return to Eritrea before it took on its official stamp in 1970, in the city of Aden in what was then South Yemen. That event coincided, as is well known, with the appearance of the popular liberation forces, which held their organizational conference in the area of Sedduha'ila [name as transliterated] in the Dankalia region, in the extreme south of the country. [Dahli] What reasons led you to disband the party at the end of 1989? [Issaias] When we reached the firm conclusion that there were no fundamental differences dividing the members of the People's Front and those of that party, we decided to disband it, to avoid getting into the predicament of duplication, and to prevent party members and the rest of the base of the Front creating problems from nothing. [Dahli] What standards were used in choosing party members? [Issaias] We had secret cells studying the readiness of this or that person to enlist under the party's banner. [Dahli] What were your relations with the leadership of the secret Marxist Labor Party that existed inside the ELF? [Issaias] There were several secret meetings between the leaders of the two parties with the objective of uniting them as a prelude to the uniting of the two fronts, the ELF and the People's Front. It became clear in our meetings that there were no essential conflicts in our general proposals. [Dahli] In spite of that, no unity was effected between the parties. To the contrary, Eritrea was the scene of ruinous civil wars. Why did that happen? [Issaias] In my view, the leadership of the Labor Party in the ELF was dealing with Marxism on the basis of opportunism, totally unrelated to the ideology as an ideology. [Dahli] Did the dissolution of the party coincide with the fall of the Berlin Wall and the disintegration of the Soviet Union by coincidence, or was there a cause-and-effect relation between the two events? [Issaias] There was no cause-and-effect relation between the two issues. We reviewed events, and our ideological positions with the end of 1978, when the Soviet Union, former South Yemen, and the progressive forces in the Palestinian revolutionary factions aligned themselves with the enemies of our revolution. We had considered them strategic allies, and included them in our ranks in our political party schools. [Dahli] Did your ideological position change with the Soviet Union's change of policy vis-a-vis your revolution? [Issaias] No. It was not that easy or that simple. Without going into too much detail, we may say that starting that day we freed ourselves from rigid and sterile ideological positions, and adopted a realistic, pragmatic policy in our dealing both with the situation in Eritrea and with the outside world. [Dahli] Now that so many historical changes have taken place, what remains of your progressive ideas, not to say your Marxist ideas? [Issaias] I say without any hesitation: social justice. Because the liberation of territory, raising the national flag, and saluting the national anthem, despite their significance, mean nothing to ordinary Eritreans without social justice, which fills in the gap between the narrow stratum of the rich, and the broad sector of the poor. [Dahli] In the closing session of the conference, you said, "after the liberation of our nation, and still now, we notice a deficiency in the balance of members of the People's Front, prevailing doubts about them, and their loss of confidence in themselves. They stumble around at random. The People's Army, the backbone of the People's Front, still has doubts about its future and has become prey to many uncertainties and bewildered doubts. This is because it no longer has any clear vision amid the vague positions in all its movements." How did things come to this dangerous pass? [Issaias] It is a very thorny issue, and it requires study in depth by sociologists and psychologists. A 30-year war cannot pass without leaving profound effects on the individuals who emerged 100-percent safe from decades of war with all their tears, blood, and psychological wounds. Yesterday all the people were in one trench with the enemy before them and the drone of airplanes above them, with no options other than life or martyrdom. Today the situation is different, there are more things to worry about. There is a great vacuum. There are family problems: the fighters' families and the martyrs' families. The government has found itself faced with problems with no beginning or end, and has no money, because the colonialist Ethiopian regimes that had seized Eritrea destroyed not only its economy, but sucked out all the benefits this people might have enjoyed. This people has lost everything, and won peace at the end of it all. Peace makes excellent capital, beyond price, and needs time to bear its fruit. Demobilization of the Army [Dahli] Last year you demobilized the first batch of the Eritrean Army, estimated at about 100,000 men. Are the problems of the discharged men easier to bear than those of the remainder still serving in the military? [Issaias] I have no definitive answer to this question, because it goes back to the difference in problems that affected the demobilized men and the others. The ones demobilized from the army were the most recently conscripted into military service--about three years. This eased the process of their return to civilian life, compared with people who had spent long decades in the army. In addition, the great majority of those demobilized were peasants, and their problem now is that they do not want to go back to the land and resume their old trades. One may note that one cannot change his way of life without taking on something new. What made this more difficult is that the small minority of the demobilized who went back to their farms--and we provided them with modern equipment--endured profound psychological frustration when faced with the drought that swept Eritrea in the last growing season and threatened people with starvation. Despite that, the decision to demobilize them is seen as a positive one in the final analysis, not because they reduced the army's burden, but because they are no longer dependants, but are relying on themselves in overcoming life's difficulties. [Dahli] The question of land took up much of the heated discussions inside the conference before the resolution was made that "the land is the property of the state." My question is, aren't you afraid that this resolution will lead to trouble? [Issaias] That resolution was moral more than practical. [Dahli] So, what will happen practically? [Issaias] We want to review the method for distributing land in Eritrea, not with the aim of enacting superficial resolutions, but to exploit arable lands in a sensible and practical manner. The manner that people are used to gives no thought to the scope of a region's needs, or a district's, and sometimes is limited to the family. Add to that the fact that cultivation is arbitrary, passed down from father to son, primitive, and barely remunerative. So all we want to do is put the land in the service of society, after preparing an accurate scientific study, and providing modern equipment and all kinds of fertilizers, so that the Eritrean peasantry may supply his own needs as well as those of the Eritrean markets. Then we may think about what surplus produce may be exported abroad. Here I may point out that four decades ago Eritrea exported all kinds of fruits and vegetables as well as meat to several Middle Eastern countries and Europe. We can do so again, to some extent, in a short time, if we pool our efforts and get technical and other assistance from friendly countries. Merchants' Complaints [Dahli] Every single Eritrean merchant is today complaining of the tax burden imposed on him by the government, to the degree that some say their slim profits are used to pay the government tax bill. What is your respnse? [Issaias] This isn't just in Eritrea. In every country in the world merchants cry and complain about the terrible tax burden. In Eritrea's case, I firmly believe that there is a certain exaggeration in the volume of merchant complaints. I have heard the merchants' complaints because their voices are loud, and that is because they control the markets. The simple consumers, on the other hand, complain of price-gouging and hardly anyone hears them. [Dahli] A merchant might say that he is compelled to raise prices to match the increased taxes imposed on him by the government. [Issaias] I don't think so. Taxes are not imposed arbitrarily. They are calculated after a field study. [Dahli] Some merchants think taxes have hurt the country's one source of income, since there are no other sources. [Issaias] No. That is inaccurate, since taxes make up only 15 percent of the state budget. We are now in the process of considering eliminating taxes on basic commodities and raising them on nonessential goods such as cigarettes and alcoholic beverages. These ideas may help people, but will not solve their root problems. [Dahli] Why? [Issaias] Because Eritrea is still relying on old factories, using imported fuels, and using a great deal of electricity. This means high prices for our local products, which we cannot impose on domestic markets over imported goods. This is a very hard dilemma that cannot be solved overnight. [Dahli] Where have the raw materials disappeared to--the gold, oil, natural gas, uranium, and other things that the Eritrean Front's pamphlets spoke of before independence? [Issaias] I am extremely cautious about what is said about the existence of minerals in commercial quantities in Eritrea. [Dahli] Why? [Issaias] We don't want to give people ideas about things we aren't sure exist. [Dahli] But there are civil studies conducted by Italian experts between the world wars. And the Ethiopian Government gave oil concessions to foreign countries--etc. [Issaias] True, some foreign companies did surveying and exploring in the era of the Derg, which proved the existence of natural gas in substantial quantities. But with oil, no one knows now whether it's there in commercial quantities, or very limited quantities. [Dahli] Have you signed agreements with foreign companies to explore for oil? [Issaias] We are in the process now. The surveying process, then exploitation, will take some time. The trouble is that people are in a hurry. In addition, we are currently reviewing the contracts the colonial Ethiopian authorities signed with international commercial establishments, which are trying to monopolize the Eritrean market at the expense of other companies. It is in our interest to open the door to global competition among all companies before giving concession rights to this one instead of that one. The important thing, in my view, is that Eritrea possesses considerable agricultural possibilities and priceless marine resources, but, unfortunately Third World countries have a tendency to dream about oil wells as the solution to their problems. [Dahli] There appear to be many obstacles preventing foreign companies from working directly in Eritrea. [Issaias] As you can see for yourself, we don't have paved roads, or modern rapid communications, nor even electrical power--etc. All these affect the start-up of large projects. The Press and Opposition Parties [Dahli] The question of economic development is linked to political stability. Do you have a specific timetable for the implementation of political pluralism, which can open the way to broad participation in all fields? [Issaias] The important thing, the central thing, in my view, is that the conference members confirmed the principle of political pluralism. Translating it into reality requires objective terms. Thus it is difficult to specify a timetable for the formation of opposition parties. [Dahli] There are Eritrean leaders abroad expressing their desire to establish parties. Where do you stand on this? [Issaias] So far there is no desire to form parties with the people who are active in some Arab and Western countries. The whole has to do with some elements who still have mentalities of the past, stuck to the legacy of the ELF. [Dahli] What do you mean by the legacy of the ELF? [Issaias] I mean this or that group or so-and-so's group. These issues have been outrun by the historical events of the Eritrean revolution, which has changed the traditional structure of Eritrean society, which had been dominated by tribal, regional, and sectarian logic. Now it has reached a progressive phase after three whole decades of warfare. [Dahli] What would your conditions be for any party to pursue its political activity officially? [Issaias] I do not want to get ahead of events, but in general, and in order to safeguard Eritrea's national unity and Eritrean political independence, we believe it is essential for parties to be independent of direct and indirect outside influence. Nor should they be founded on religious, ethnic, regional, or tribal bases. These are the redlines that must be respected. It does not mean that there can be no discussion of this very sensitive issue. On the contrary, discussion will be initiated, so that Eritreans can give their views on every single issue. [Dahli] How can that happen, when the very few media in the country are under government control? [Issaias] MODERN ERITREA, the only official newspaper published in Arabic and Tigrinya, has worked hard from the beginning to open its columns to Eritrean writers in a limited fashion. Thus the dialogue that is underway, I think, cannot continue without a law for the freedom of the press, which will be introduced in the next few days. Only then can the provisions of the Constitution, the laws, and party rules be discussed. It will be up to the Eritreans to draw the broad lines of the modern state. [Dahli] Will there be laws regulating the freedom of the press? [Issaias] One cannot allow things to take a rambling course. There have to be rules. [Dahli] Such as? [Issaias] Not tampering with national unity; the avoidance of cursing; and avoiding vituperative and litigious methods, to the greatest extent possible. In return, we will reconsider erroneous decisions, expose negative stands, and bring citizens' complaints and expectations into the open. And, in line with neighboring countries' experiences with press freedom, we will permit no foreign funding for our local newspapers, to eliminate foreign disruptions. [Dahli] Does that mean that the government will provide material support to the independent newspapers? [Issaias] We are working on providing the needed technical equipment. The mere implementation of the law on the freedom of the press is not enough for a press free of foreign influence. Rules must be provided for their independence, to protect the role of the press, to guarantee its freedom in the service of the Eritrean people, which for long decades has been deprived of its most basic rights for an honorable life. Add to that the fact that we in Eritrea, even until now, do not have a single daily newspaper. MODERN ERITREA, as you can see, is published biweekly, on Wednesday and Saturday. How would it be when the multiparty law is enacted, with every party trying to publish its own newspapers and magazines? The"Jihad" and Sudan [Dahli] Why have the fraternal relations between Eritrea and Sudan deteriorated so badly? Why were diplomatic methods not used, to avoid the glare of the media? [Issaias] To start with, I would like to reconfirm that the stand of the National Islamic Front [NIF] led by Dr. Hasan al-Turabi, which supports the right to self-determination of the Eritrean people, and its right to armed struggle, has been clear. There is no doubt about it, compared with the positions of the rest of Sudan's vacillating parties. What is also certain is that the growth and development of the Eritrean [Islamic] Jihad Movement was thanks to the NIF, for its own mistaken sectarian calculations. [Dahli] That has not stopped you from establishing relations with the NIF. [Issaias] We had an ongoing dialogue with the NIF leadership, and we did all we could to persuade them of the futility of supporting an Islamic jihad movement in a society like Eritrea's, made up of equal numbers of Muslims and Christians. Regrettably, we got no compliance from our Sudanese brothers in this regard. [Dahli] To what do you attribute that? [Issaias] In my opinion, there are hardline factions within the NIF, which think they can use the "Islamic movement" to pressure not only Eritrea, but Uganda as well, and Kenya, Ethiopia, and Yemen. And it is not just a question of just the NIF. There are also the Ansar al-Sunnah [Supporters of the Tradition], supported by other Arabs, who are trying to use Islam for political aims here and there. To answer the second part of your question, I state that we in the Eritrean Government have provided our Sudanese brothers, whether in the government or the NIF, with the locations and names of the Jihad elements on Sudanese soil, so that appropriate measures can be taken, but to no avail. In the end, this only put a cloud over relations between the two countries. [Dahli] What was the Sudanese response to your memorandums? [Issaias] There were short-lived promises, with which we could not be patient forever, especially after the incident of 16 December, when Eritrean and foreign elements infiltrated western Eritrea from camps located inside Sudan, and fought with our forces, which wiped out every single one of them. The Sudanese regime knows better than anyone that we have held our peace over several things, and looked the other way in many instances, and at a time when the world was accusing it of supporting global fundamentalist terrorist movements. [Dahli] Do I understand from what you are saying that the Eritrean Government has lost all hope of restoring fraternal relations with Sudan to their natural state? [Issaias] Being eager not to blow this up, or get things to a point that would have bad consequences for the two countries, we brought up the subject of Sudan's interference in Eritrea's internal affairs at the United Nations, without bringing things to a head with the ruling regime in Khartoum. We hope that Sudan's rulers will come to their senses and stop playing with fire. [Dahli] Are you optimistic about this? [Issaias] Regrettably, no. [Dahli] Why? [Issaias] Because a few hours ago, I learned that one of our officials at our consulate in Kassala was perfidiously assassinated. [Dahli] What is the meaning of that incident? [Issaias] It is part of a plan aimed at escalating the crisis. [Dahli] What is the Sudanese regime's interest in that? [Issaias] Sudan has no interest in it. The problem is that the Sudanese power in Khartoum has lost its balance and lost its credibility in dealing with friends. It is acting irresponsibly, and this lowers our morale, because we were hoping to build a unified economic market including Sudan, Eritrea, and Ethiopia, to expand to the rest of the IGAD [Inter-Government Authority on Drought] countries: Uganda, Kenya, Djibouti, and Somalia. It would then bring in all the Red Sea basin countries, most importantly Yemen. Yemeni Participation [Dahli] A few days ago, you visited Sanaa and Aden, and talked to both President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, and his Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid. They, for their part, visited Asmara after signing a "pledge and accord" document last month. What is your assessment of Eritrean-Yemeni relations in light of all this? [Issaias] Relations between the Yemeni and Eritrean peoples are nothing new. They have deep roots in ancient history. The Red Sea, which separates the shores of the two countries by 14 miles, was and still is a bridge and contact point between the people of both countries. We are striving with all our power to strengthen the ties between our two peoples to serve our mutual interests. [Dahli] What is your view of the current crisis threatening to destroy the union from within? [Issaias] The union between the two parts of Yemen is a popular demand that cannot be neglected. But our brothers became swept up for emotional reasons and without serious study established a merged union, and the result was a formal, superficial unity, without the merger of the military, security, or media institutions. Etc. Now the people are enduring hardships caused by unrealistic steps. There is no shame in that, if the situation is understood before it is too late, but the unfortunate thing is that there are political forces here and there trying to incite discord to strike at the union and prevent the emergence of a strong, unified Yemeni state to play a prominent role in shaping events in the southern Red Sea, the southern Arabian peninsula, and the northwest Indian Ocean. I have great hope that our brothers in Yemen will implement what they agreed on in Oman, to emerge from the current crisis, and block the way of the enemies of unity and the Yemeni people. Djibouti, Ethiopia, and Somalia [Dahli] Djibouti, your neighbor for three years, is currently going through political and military crises. How do you view the situation there after your visit, and your talks with President Hassan Gouled Aptidon? [Issaias] Djibouti's old and new problems stem from the lack of a development plan that takes into consideration the rights and interests of the Issa, Afar, Arab, and Somali communities, and that allows them to participate in the government and the revolution on an equal footing with the country's other citizens. [Dahli] What about Ethiopia? [Issaias] Throughout the colonial era, Eritrea was organically linked to the Ethiopian economy, and, as we see, the Eritrean Government is still using the Ethiopian currency, the birr. Our policy toward Ethiopia is the same as that toward all the countries of the Horn of Africa. This is due to our conviction that the liberation of all the peoples of this region must be total, or it will not be at all. [Dahli] At the beginning of this month, General Mohamed Farah Aidid visited Asmara, and at the end of this same month the American forces will leave Somalia. How do you view the future of this Arab-African country? [Issaias] To start with, I want to point out and emphasize Somalia's role in the course of the Eritrean revolution, from its beginnings up until its triumph. Somalia is the only country that offered us all it had and never wavered one inch in its position supporting our struggle, not over long years, not when there was bloodshed. It should come as no surprise that we have tried, to the best of our ability, to relieve the sufferings of our Somali brothers. Going back to your question, I may say that the Somalis have learned a great deal from their destructive wars, nor do I think they wish to bring the former nightmare scenario back to this poor country. The withdrawal of the UN forces will leave a vacuum at first, and that might give rise to some small incidents, but those forces must leave Somalia for good. They led to the creation of problems that had no beginning and will have no end, compared with the problems they solved, or that they originally came to solve. [Dahli] The role of the UN forces in Somalia was, then, in your view, a negative one? [Issaias] It was not only negative, it actually hampered the forging of a national accord among the Somalis. [Dahli] Some Somali factions accuse the Eritrean Government of aligning with General Aidid. What is your response? [Issaias] If there is any Somali authority we align ourselves with, it is Somalia itself, and the Somali people--that is all. [Dahli] You have spoken of the problems of all the states in the Horn of Africa. Does that mean that the future of this region is murky? [Issaias] In spite of all the problems that each of the countries of the Horn of Africa has experienced, and is still experiencing, the eyes, hearts, and minds of their peoples are on the day when everyone will work side by side to build a bright future for future generations. This is the thing that never ceases to nurture hope in their hearts. [Dahli] Where do Eritrean-Saudi relations stand? [Issaias] In light of the historic relations between the Eritrean and Saudi peoples, bilateral relations between Asmara and Riyadh are developing in a very positive fashion. Saudi Arabia has great influence and a distinctive role among the peoples of the Red Sea basin. [Dahli] What are the dimensions of your relations with Israel? [Issaias] Ordinary relations between one country and another located in the same region and the same sea. I believe that after the solution of the Palestinian question, all the problems about dealing with the Jewish state will disappear. The political map of the Middle East region will see a radical change when there are routine diplomatic relations between Israel and Syria, and the rest of the countries of the region. [Dahli] We have heard about promises of Western aid, but have seen no actual projects. What happened? [Issaias] The Gulf states, especially the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, and the countries of the European Common Market, are studying practical projects whose implementation will begin very soon. [Dahli] What about the United States? [Issaias] Washington has offered us food aid, but for reasons having to do with their own policies, they are not, so far, taking part in any construction or developmental project.
