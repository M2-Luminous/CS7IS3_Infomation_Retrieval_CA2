If not, investment will decrease and access to new oil will disappear. But whether he likes Norway's position is a different matter. "We see that the burden of cuts in production is great, for Norway too. This is not what OPEC primarily wants, nor do we accept responsibility for the fact that the price of oil is low. However, we would like to cooperate with oil exporters outside OPEC to maintain a stable oil price at a level which is acceptable both to producers and consumers," [OPEC Secretary General Ahmed] Subroto told AFTENPOSTEN. We met the popular secretary general at OPEC's headquarters in Vienna, a little less then a month before he is to leave his post. This will happen on 15 June, after six years as head of the secretariat. But if the members of OPEC want it, Dr. Subroto is ready for another term as secretary general. Next week Subroto will visit Stavanager and deliver an address to the World Petroleum Conference (WPC 94). "If OPEC wants me to, I would be glad to continue," he said. And this decision will be made at the OPEC meeting in Vienna on 15 June. Both Venezuela and Iran have candidates for the secretary general post, but there is every indication that, at present, Subroto is the only candidate on whom the 12 member nations can agree, even though it could only be for a rather short period. The sociable 65-year-old from Indonesia is a well-respected secretary general whose qualities as a diplomat have greatly helped to keep OPEC together. At a time of record-low oil prices and great internal disagreement surrounding the correct methods to adopt, the rest of the world has formed the impression that OPEC is in the grip of its worst crisis. "The question being asked is how to define the word `crisis.' It is no crisis for OPEC that we are unable to control the price of oil. We want a stable oil price and see nothing to be gained from the price swinging out of control. It is only those active on the commodities markets who make money out of such swings. Today OPEC is the only organization in the world which coordinates member nations' energy policy. We try to make sure of a stable income from oil without setting concrete goals about how high the oil price should be. If we look at members' incomes and the development of oil prices, there can be no doubt that over time income would have been less if OPEC had not protected member countries' interests," Subroto said. He definitely believes that the organization has a mission and pointed out that OPEC is one of the most reliable suppliers of oil, in both the short and long terms. Even during the Gulf war, when oil production from the two major member countries Iraq and Kuwait disappeared, OPEC succeeded in maintaining oil supplies. Iraq's reentry to the oil market will sooner or later be one of OPEC's biggest headaches. As soon as UN sanctions against Iraq's oil exports are lifted, the organization will be faced with a major problem. This will mean that there will be around a further 500,000 barrels of oil on the market -- oil for which there is no room on today's market. This is great threat to a positive price development. "Iraq is a member of OPEC on a par with other members, and what we have said is that when the UN sanctions are lifted OPEC must meet in order to find room for Iraq's oil, too. With the present production ceiling there is no room for Iraq, and either the other countries will have to reduce their oil production or we will have to find a solution where Iraqi oil production will gradually meet increased demand on a world basis," he said. Even though Subroto talks warmly about stable oil prices, there are countries among OPEC members who always want to force up prices as high as possible. The price hawks, represented by countries like Libya, Algeria, and Nigeria, want high prices and the biggest possible income in the shortest possible time. Against them stands the largest OPEC member, Saudi Arabia, with oil reserves which will last for 130 years to come. This country takes a longer-term view and wants a price that remains as calm as possible. The Saudi Arabians dominate OPEC, and as a rule Oil Minister Hisham Nazir gets things the way King Fahd has told him they should be. However, there is no getting away from the fact that the low prices of the last few years have put great pressure on the OPEC countries' budgets which are dominated currently by high foreign debt. "The budget cuts will go on, in 1994 too, even though so far the price of oil has increased by $3 per barrel. We do not know what the future will bring. Even though there are positive signs, our production quota of 24.5 million barrels of oil a day will be adhered to," Subroto said. Nor is he worried by Saudi Arabia's dominant role in the organization. "In OPEC we have lived with each other for 34 years, and we will probably be able to continue to live together. Also, it is not only in OPEC that we see the mixture of small and big. Just look at the OECD. The problems are the same," Subroto said. The development of oil prices in recent years has been worrying, and the markets fear that the price rise of the last few months will tempt OPEC to exceed its production quotas again. For it is OPEC which is being given the glory for the price increase, thanks to the fact that member countries have finally shown some discipline with regard to the quotas. But OPEC still has spare capacity -- probably around 3 million barrels a day -- which could ruin oil prices completely. In this situation is it often Dr. Subroto's silken diplomacy which saves the day when member countries' individual interests upset negotiations. "I am not sure how much of a diplomat I actually am, but I often have to be the link between the parties which difficulties talking to each other at OPEC negotiations. Once arguments and problems have been explained to the parties involved, and there has been a new exchange of views, things normally resolve themselves for the best for all parties." Subroto is also the man who has to tackle a baying corps of press and analysts at every OPEC meeting. He does so on the whole with charm and humor, even though his role as information provider can often be hopeless. In the oil industry every piece of news has an effect on prices, and the battle to get hold of news which could affect oil prices goes to extremes. It has actually happened that during extremely difficult negotiations with no great measure of agreement Subroto has had to open a press conference with the words: "I have nothing to tell you; have you any questions?" Oil price movements also attract those who play the markets who, according to Subroto, are the only ones who make money from the fact that oil prices move up and down dramatically. He is worried by the power of the markets over the price of oil. The speculators are chiefly active in the unpredictable futures market, precisely because of the movement and the chance of a profit. Subroto believes that the spot market will take over a larger share of the trade in oil -- something which will reduce the influence on prices of the paper markets. "The markets do not care whether the price of oil is high or low, as long as it goes up and down. We will probably have to live with these speculators, but a stable and a more predictable market would limit their influence." [passage omitted]
