Italian fighter planes and British and Dutch ships stopped it. Massimo De Angelis interviewed Defense Chief of Staff Admiral Venturoni. [Begin recording] [De Angelis] Admiral, did the Italian forces run the risk of getting involved yesterday in the Adriatic Sea? [Venturoni] There has been such a risk, since the Italian Armed Forces are part of an international allied coalition. There was an incident yesterday: An oil tanker tried to break through the embargo. Naval forces belonging to the Serbian-Montenegrin republic intervened and our forces strongly reacted. Two Tornado planes from the Gioia Del Colle airbase also took part in the operation. They helped the NATO and West European Union ships. According to information I have, the embargo has caused great difficulties to the republic of Serbia and Montenegro. We have evidence that their being more ready to negotiate may be linked to the need to see an end to the embargo. [De Angelis] So, the international alliance in the Adriatic Sea to enforce the UN resolutions is really working. [Venturoni] Yes, it works very well. It is being coordinated mostly by commands based in Italy. They are under the command of Italian officers. It is a typical example of what cooperation should be within NATO and -- thanks to the West European Union -- also at a European level. [De Angelis] Does this mean a lot of work for Italy? [Venturoni] Well, Italy is quite involved. We have three ships which are constantly assigned to the coalition forces, maritime reconnaissance planes and also Air Force planes supporting naval forces. They are on constant alert at Italian bases. [end recording]
