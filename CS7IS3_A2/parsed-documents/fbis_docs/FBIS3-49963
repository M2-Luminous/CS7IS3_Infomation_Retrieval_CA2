This is what Adalbert Rebic, head of the department for refugees and displaced people, said at today's news conference. Included in this number are 241,492 displaced people and 252,155 refugees. According to the department's estimate, there are about 37,500 unregistered refugees and displaced persons. Rebic noted that the number of refugees increases each day, particularly refugees coming from the Banja Luka area where large numbers of Croats and Muslims are being forced by Serb authorities to flee. As regards the announced return of Croatian refugees from Germany, Rebic said he believed Germany would respect the Geneva Convention and send its refugees to safe areas in an organized, voluntary, and gradual way. Consequently, refugees would return to Croatia free, Rebic stressed, and said that this issue was being discussed by high-ranking officials from both countries. Rebic said that the EU had doubled humanitarian aid, sending 10,000 tonnes a month. Last year's quota was 5,000 tonnes. Despite this, in Rebic's words, the humanitarian situation is nevertheless grave.
