Dubnov on news conference given by LDPR leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy in the State Duma on 29 March; from the "Vesti" newscast; Zhirinovskiy remarks recorded] [Text] [Video shows Zhirinovskiy holding news conference] [Dubnov] In the State Duma building today a news conference by the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] leader took place which was devoted to the 5th Congress of the Liberal Democrats opening on 2 April. After declaring categorically that this would be the congress of the party whose line was no less than the whole of our people had chosen, Mr. Zhirinovskiy went on to boast about the two main victories of his party. The first was the amnesty: [Zhirinovskiy] We were the main instrument for passing the amnesty. The political amnesty in the first place. The initiative for a criminal amnesty did not come from us. [Dubnov, over Zhirinovskiy's voice] There is now someone we can thank for the greatest event in the history of the Russian parliament of the end of the 20th century, as Vladimir Volfovich put it. Although we will note that any criminal can now claim that he committed a crime at that moment for political reasons -- both the sniper who fired into the crowd and the marauder who robbed a savings bank. The second mighty victory of the LDPR lies in the fact that, in the words of its leader, the party has averted war in Serbia by announcing to those countries whose pilots were getting ready to bomb Serbian troops that return bomb strikes would be carried out against their capitals. Getting more and more worked up, Mr. Zhirinovskiy once again confirmed his readiness to defend the rights of Russians in the Near Abroad using highly unambiguous methods. [Zhirinovskiy] We will respond with such a terrible blow that these peoples will forget what civilization means. There will be a scorched desert there. [Dubnov] We can now put a question to the law enforcement agencies -- does this outburst come under the article on appeals to war and arousing interethnic strife?
