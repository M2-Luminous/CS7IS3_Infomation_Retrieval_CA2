The traces of the commando led to the Greek border point of Argjirohor. The government of the Republic of Albania expresses its deep indignation against this hostile act, which is a direct attack against the sovereignty and integrity of our Republic. The Albanian Government notes that the April 10, 1994 massacre is the gravest incident in the series of incidents provoked by the Greek Armed Forces, such as the violation of the Albanian territorial waters by Greek warships, which opened fire on January 4 and 10, 1994, by a Greek minesweeper on March 10 1994, the killing of the Albanian citizen, Alfred Muco on March 21, 1994 by Greek Armed Forces on patrol in the vicinity of Kosturi after detaining him, and other incidents taking place during this year alone. All these have been doubled with an anti-Albanian propaganda by the radio stations installed in northern Greece, which testify to territorial claims by Greek chauvinistic circles against Albania. The policy of the terrorist acts and massacres conforms the Greek new policy of defence which, as it is declared, extends from Cyprus to the so-called "Northern Epirus", as Athens calls southern Albania. Let us mention here the frequent statements with territorial claims towards Albania by Greek Government members and high politicians such as those by former Premier Mitsotakis, who, on July 14, 1993 speaks of north Epirus' annexation by the Albanian state in 1913, that by the government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos, who in October 1993 considers Albania as the Greek Northern Epirus, the statement by the minister of the presidency Kuvellos, who on August 10, 1992 in the stadium of Athens publicly speaks of Himara as an "unliberated" land, or the statement of the leader of the current opposition Miltiadhis Evert, who goes so far as to say in January 1994 that Northern Epirus is northern Greece. The Balkans and Europe know well the policy and morale of the Greek bands. Many a time, in the first half of this century, Greek armed units have penetrated into the Albanian territory, committing massacres, setting fires, and carrying out destructions and many other terrorist acts. The Albanians will forget neither the massacres of the Greek army and pre-military bands of General Damianos, Colonel Santos-Vardas, Sub-lieutenant Stratos, Captain Cyprus and others in the years 1912-1914 in the Korce-Kolonje region, nor the massacres and barbarisms of Deljanaqi in 1913 and of Zerve in 1944 for the ethnic cleansing of the Albanian population of Cameria. The Albanians will also not forget the fact that even today, the Greek Government refuses to recognise the Protocol of Florence on the southern borders of Albania. Following the same policy also in the present days is both strange and shameful in this century end, especially now that the European Union has bestowed its presidency on Athens. The Greek authorities, instead of working for the consolidation of bridges of friendship and cooperation with the neighbours and stability of the tense region of the balkans, they are imposing blockade against Macedonia, setting up and training terrorist bands and organizing terrorism against Albania. Such a policy, which intends to create facilities to the allies, Serbian aggressors, is also embodied in the exchange of visits and meetings in Athens, Belgrade and Pale, as well as in the statements by the Serbian criminals that "only the God in heaven and the Greeks on earth are our allies". The statements of the Greek officials that Greece is "a factor of peace, security and stability in the Balkan region" do not respond the reality. Regarding the April 10, 1994 massacre, the spokesman of the Greek Government, not only does not express regret for the victims, but voices no commitment on the part of his government to find out and punish the authors of this massacre, who after committing the criminal act, left in the direction of the Greek border point. On the contrary, he tries to invent nonexistent contradictions in the note of the Albanian Government. On its part, the Albanian Government will undertake steps to react with determination against any hostile act against Albania, as well as reserves the right to undertake the necessary measures in response to this policy of provocation.
