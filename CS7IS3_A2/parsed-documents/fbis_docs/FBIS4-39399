The conference was initiated by the State Party [Derzhavnaya Partiya] led by Terekhov, the Communist Party of Russia, the Officers Union, and the Public Committee for Legality and People's Power. Apart from politicians, the `struggle' class was attended by AL-QUDS publisher Sha'ban, who rented the Central Travelers House. Various points of view were aired at the meeting but Dr. Sha'ban left everybody else behind. He stated that he had personally recruited Russian guys to send to Israel on a reconnaissance mission. And now he has incontestable evidence that in the south of Israel there are secret bases with chemical and bacteriological weapons. Allegedly, tests on humans are also conducted there. Another speaker explained to the audience that Rutskoy's mother is Jewish. In Israel, therefore, he would never be elected even to a lousy municipality, let alone the vice presidency. Officers Union leader Stanislav Terekhov explained to MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS's correspondent that the aim of the conference is to work out a political course and an ideological program for the State Party. Terekhov does not intend to affiliate with Rutskoy's State [Derzhava] political movement. His decision is final and irrevocable.
