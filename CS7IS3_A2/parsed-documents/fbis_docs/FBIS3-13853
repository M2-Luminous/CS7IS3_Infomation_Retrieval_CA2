In a statement today marking the Arab League's 49th anniversary, which the League will celebrate tomorrow, Tuesday, 'Abd-al-Majid said the challenges require our nation to rise above its wounds and pain and restore Arab solidarity on firm foundations based on frankness and openness with the eagerness to stick to the goals and principles of the Arab League Charter. He asked the Security Council and the two countries sponsoring the peace conference to quickly implement Security Council Resolution 904 denouncing the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. He also called for providing the necessary international protection for the Palestinian people in the occupied territories, applying the Fourth Geneva Conventions to them, disarming the Jewish settlers, and removing the Israeli settlements, which form a new impediment to the peace talks. He appealed to the Security Council not to use two yardsticks and to quickly implement the UN Charter's provisions so that peace, development, and fruitful cooperation in the Middle East will materialize. He reiterated the Arab identity of Jerusalem and the commitment to implement international legitimacy Resolutions 242, 252, 338, 425, and 465 on the Arab-Israeli conflict. He said last year's events have shown that seeking the arbitration of the UN and Arab League Charters is the ideal way to resolve numerous conflicts that face our Arab nation. He also stressed his confidence that the restoration of Arab solidarity and joint action forms a firm basis to enhance Arab capability to face up to the current challenges and ambitions. 'Abd-al-Majid called for unifying the will of Arabs toward enhancing and strengthening the Arab League structure by setting up an Arab court of justice as an effective tool to peacefully resolve conflicts involving Arab countries. He noted that had such a court existed before 2 August 1990, the Arab nation would have avoided the serious ramifications of the Gulf crisis the effects of which we are still suffering. He said he hoped the Arab League Council could, at its next session on Saturday, achieve this mechanism--an Arab court of justice--so that the Arab nation might handle the dangers and challenges it is facing and that affect the structure of pan-Arab security. The Arab League secretary general said: The anniversary of the Arab League, which was founded in 1945, the oldest regional organization set up after World War II, represents an important stage in Arab history. This requires us to consider being frank and open so that we may learn a lesson that will help us to sense the steps to take at a time when the Arab nation faces developments of a strategic nature in the international arena, primarily reorganizing economics on new bases.
