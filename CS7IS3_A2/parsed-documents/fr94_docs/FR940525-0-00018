SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the animal drug regulations to reflect approval of a supplemental new animal drug application (NADA) filed by Miles, Inc. The supplemental NADA provides for the oral use of a 90-milligram (mg) Proban ® (cythioate) Tablet in addition to the currently approved use of the 30-mg tablet. EFFECTIVE DATE: May 25, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Marcia K. Larkins, Center for Veterinary Medicine (HFV&hyph;112), Food and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855, 301&hyph;594&hyph;0614. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Miles, Inc., Agriculture Division, Animal Health Products, P.O. Box 390, Shawnee Mission, KS 66201, filed supplemental NADA 132&hyph;337, which provides for the use of a 90-mg Proban ® (cythioate) tablet in addition to the approved 30-mg tablet for control of fleas on dogs. The supplemental NADA is approved as of April 25, 1994, and the regulations are amended in 21 CFR 520.531 to reflect the approval. Approval of this supplement does not require submission of new safety or effectiveness data. This supplement provides for use of a larger tablet with increased drug concentration to be given at the currently approved use level. However, in accordance with the freedom of information provisions of part 20 (21 CFR part 20) and §514.11(e)(2)(ii) (21 CFR 514.11(e)(2)(ii)), a freedom of information summary is provided for the revised labeling. Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b(c)(2)(F)(iii)), this approval does not qualify for marketing exclusivity. The additional studies submitted with the supplement were conducted as requested by FDA to correct deficiencies in the original data supporting safety and effectiveness of the 1968 approval, and they were not essential to the approval of this supplement. The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(d)(1)(iii) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required. List of Subjects in 21 CFR Part 520 Animal drugs.
