His statement came after the 40th session of the Srpska republic people's assembly, which adopted conclusions on topical issues of foreign and domestic policy. Members of the public were not present at the assembly's discussions. "The latest attack by Muslim forces on Brcko rules out any possibility of their having any part of Brcko," Karadzic stressed. "Brcko has been and will remain a Serb town." The Srpska republic president called on the people in Serb Posavina to be vigilant and strong and to remain in this territory "to defend it well and be convinced of their own victory." "There can be no discussion about the territory, which is vital for the Serb people," the Srpska republic president said. In his statement for journalists, Karadzic reaffirmed the stands contained in the negotiating platform of the Srpska republic adopted in March this year, which is still in effect and according to which "no negotiations on the former Bosnia-Herzegovina can be possible if there is no peace."
