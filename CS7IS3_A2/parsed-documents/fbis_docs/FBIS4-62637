This was stated by Russian president's envoy to the Middle East Viktor Posuvalyuk at a briefing in Moscow today. He said this would create real conditions for the partial lifting of the international sanctions against Iraq. "It is necessary that Iraq define its position on disarmament and let international observers in. Baghdad also must recognize the independence of Kuwait and inviolability of its borders," Posuvalyuk pointed out. Commenting on a settlement in the Middle East, Posuvalyuk stressed that relations between Syria and Israel were the main direction there. "Contradictions are very serious here. Damascus demands that Israel liberate the Syrian territories occupied in 1967 and Israel demands complete normalization of the situation on the border and security," he said. Posuvalyuk emphasized that this issue was being discussed at direct talks between the parties and through mediators. He said that encouraging progress had been achieved. He announced that he would go to Damascus in the next few days where he would hold consultations with representatives of Syria and other Middle East countries involved in the peace settlement in the region. Posuvalyuk spoke on the situation in Yemen in details. He announced that 696 Russian citizens had been evacuated from Yemen by May 15.
