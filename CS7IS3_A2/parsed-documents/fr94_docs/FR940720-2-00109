Operation of this facility under the proposed Technical Specifications change will not create a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. Reduced boron concentration in the boric acid storage tank (BAST) is offset by increasing the volume of boric acid solution that must be contained in the tanks. The heat tracing requirements are used to ensure that the dissolved boric acid is maintained in solution and available for injection into the RCS to adjust core reactivity throughout core life and to meet GDC requirements. Chemical analyses of boron concentrations of >4.0 weight percent have shown that the boric acid does not crystallize at temperatures above 57 â—‹F. Ambient temperatures in the areas of the primary auxiliary building where these components are located will normally remain above this temperature. Hence, heat tracing will no longer be needed for boric acid concentrations with corresponding solubility temperatures less than ambient temperatures. The proposed Technical Specifications requirements for boron concentration, volume, and temperature of the BASTs and boration paths ensure that the capability to inject boric acid is maintained. Since the components (and their function) necessary to achieve a safe shutdown have not been changed or modified, this change does not significantly increase the probability or consequences of any accident previously evaluated. The proposed changes to the boric acid system Technical Specifications requirements for the chemical and volume control system (CVCS) do not affect the requirements for the emergency core cooling system (ECCS). The original design of the high head safety injection (SI) system used the BASTs as its initial suction source. Westinghouse WCAP&hyph;12602, ``Report For The Reduction of SI System Boron Concentration,'' and a 10 CFR 50.59 Safety Evaluation Report performed by Wisconsin Electric justifies the design change to use the refueling water storage tank (RWST) as the initial suction source of SI fluid rather than the BAST. The affected FSAR Chapter 14 accident analyses include the Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA) events and the Steamline Break (SLB) events. The LOCA events are affected with respect to the large-break post-LOCA long-term core cooling subcriticality requirement. The SLB events are affected with respect to core integrity. The events were analyzed assuming the elimination of the logic which automatically opened the valves in the flow path from the BASTs to the SI pumps upon the receipt of a safety injection signal. The results show that we remain within the acceptance criteria of the aforementioned FSAR Chapter 14 accident analyses. Therefore, the proposed changes will not create a significant increase in the probability or consequences of a[n] accident previously evaluated. 2. Operation of this facility under the proposed Technical Specifications change will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The reactivity control function of the boron in the CVCS and SI systems is not being changed. Therefore, the proposed changes will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 3. Operation of this facility under the proposed Technical Specifications change will not create a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The intent of the proposed Technical Specifications is to ensure that two independent flow paths from the borated water source(s) (BASTs and/or RWST) to the reactor coolant system are maintained whenever a unit is taken critical. This requires that sufficient quantities of boric acid be stored in the tanks, and that this borated water can be delivered to the reactor coolant system when required. Although we presently require diverse sources of borated water (BAST and RWST), the proposed reduction in diversity will be offset by the significant increase in reliability of the boric acid system due to operation with lower boric acid concentrations and, hence, a much lower probability of boron precipitation and system ``freeze-up.'' Reducing the boric acid concentration in the BASTs has been compensated for by increasing the required volume of boric acid. The proposed Technical Specifications requirements for boric acid concentration and volume include the additional specification of minimum temperature that must be maintained to assure boric acid solubility. The minimum temperature requirement is more appropriate than the requirement for heat tracing because it is a more precise means of verifying and assuring solubility. Therefore, the proposed boric acid concentration table, which includes the volume and temperature requirements, is an appropriate substitute for the heat tracing requirements. Although the heat tracing requirement is being eliminated, the boric acid heat tracing system will be available during our transition to the lower boric acid concentration to assist in maintaining boric acid system temperature if necessary. Since our analyses have shown that the existing FSAR Chapter 14 accident analyses remain bounded under the proposed specifications, the margin of safety for the plant is not significantly reduced. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
