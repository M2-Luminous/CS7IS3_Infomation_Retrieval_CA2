Duma's Time Limit Dictates That"] [Text] Despite all the disappointments of the last few years Russians still expect positive changes from new laws. However, people should not harbor excessive illusions about everything to do with the parliament's lawmaking activity. Since such unwarranted expectations may subsequently form a basis for confrontation between society and parliament and a source of mutual recriminations between the executive and the representative authorities. The Constitution enshrines a complex system for lawmaking in the Russian Federation. All draft laws are submitted to the State Duma. After they are adopted they are sent to the Federation Council for examination or "silent approval." Only a few laws are liable to mandatory examination by the Federation Council. The latter has the right to approve or reject a law. The Duma can "overcome" such a rejection by a two-thirds vote and then send the law to the president. The president is also entitled to send the law back to the Duma for further consideration and thus increase still further the time it takes to examine and adopt the said law. Only after all these procedures is the law signed by the president and comes into force as soon as it is published. Thus months may elapse between the time of the Duma vote and the law's coming into force. In view of all these factors let us take a look at the Duma's work "schedule." Its standing orders envisage that the Duma takes a vacation twice a year -- in August-September and for a fortnight during the winter. Deputies spend the last week of each month working in their own districts. Thus three weeks in every month are allocated for work in the Duma proper. In December 1995 new members of the State Duma and the Federation Council will be elected. Thus, the Duma, which meets for plenary sessions twice a week, really has just 96 plenary sessions left. That also means that it has time to subject to qualified examination, adopt, and bring "to life" no more than 30 laws. What is more, after the budget has been ratified all newly adopted laws can only be enacted as of the new fiscal year, 1995. That is a reality with which one must come to terms. On the one hand, this procedure guarantees society against the adoption of rash and thoughtless decisions. The law is both the result of the coordination of interests in the Duma and consensus between this chamber, which represents the interests of the whole state, and the interests of components of the Russian Federation, whose representatives sit in the Federation Council. This combination of statewide interests with the interests of every component, enshrined in the actual lawmaking procedure, is extremely essential. But, on the other hand, this actual procedure imposes a number of moral-political obligations on all parties to the lawmaking process. In order to ensure that the legislative process does not become a "bone of contention" between society and parliament and also between the representative and executive authorities, a complex system of conciliation procedures now has to be thought out and "cranked" into action. Moreover, there are problems which require laws to be adopted very rapidly. I think that experts and deputies from both chambers of parliament should begin working together at the stage where draft laws are prepared by Duma committees and commissions. At the same time government experts should be involved in the work on the drafts since no law requiring financial outlay can be adopted without a ruling from the government. It is necessary to take a calm view of the situation that has developed in the "sphere of lawmaking," but in order to obtain even a minimal result one should now ponder the optimum means of organizing the lawmaking process. Therefore the main tasks today are as follows. First, it is necessary to precisely decide the list of 30-40 priority laws relating to the most urgent economic, political, and social issues. This does not incidentally mean that the Duma should stop the work it has begun in other areas. But deputies and the public must realize at the same time that they are working on legislative material for the next parliament. Second, many deputies must abandon the illusion that they have come to the Duma to write laws "themselves" rather than organize this work like all developed countries do. Lawmaking is just as complex a matter as any professional activity. The legislative process is strictly subordinate to the laws of formal logic. It must not allow the adoption of laws that are not written in legal language or lack financial validation. The laws must also be accompanied by packages of delegatory acts. The world has rules whereby a law is simply not examined in the absence of a package of delegatory acts and the requisite instructions. Third and last, the texts of draft laws should be produced by professionals and submitted to parliament in 99 percent of cases by the government. Deputies should monitor this activity in the right sense of the word and voice the group interests of the voters. Their task is to "pass" the content of the draft law in line with their professional experience and knowledge. They have to check whether or not it reflects the urgent requirements of society. And in this connection voters should not make excessive demands on deputies either. They should not force them to immediately "produce" a particular law. There are some public illusions on this point too. The former Supreme Soviet adopted hundreds of laws like this, whose implementation was known in advance to be impossible. No good came of this. While creating a semblance of concern for Russia's citizens, these acts really deceived voters. The Duma may "devise" the kind of voting machine that puts law making on a mass footing. But no political structure in the parliament today has an absolute majority and, to be honest, that is a boon for Russia. At the moment laws can only appear in our country as the result of sociopolitical compromise and accord. And that is the best result in the current conditions. Now a few words about the priority laws. In my view the following should be part of the compulsory "30." In the political sphere -- a law on political parties and laws on elections of Russia's parliament and president. In the economic sphere -- a new Civil Code, amendments to the legislation on enterprises, on joint-stock companies, on the banking system, and on taxation. In the social sphere -- a package of laws on protection of impoverished groups, including new (or amendments to) pension legislation. Lastly, it is very important to amend criminal legislation and the legislation on criminal procedure. A new Criminal Code and a package of laws on fighting crime are needed. That may be everything that the Duma realistically has time for during this very short period.
