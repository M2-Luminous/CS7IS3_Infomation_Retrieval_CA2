FR940728-1-00035 FR940728-1-00012 40 CFR Part 81 [Region II Docket No. 132, SIPTRAX # NY14&hyph;1&hyph;6563, FRL&hyph;5022&hyph;5] Clean Air Act Promulgation of Reclassification of Ozone Nonattainment Area; States of New Jersey and New York AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to reclassify the Poughkeepsie ozone nonattainment area from a marginal nonattainment area to a moderate nonattainment area. This action also proposes a determination that the Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton, NJ-PA; Albany-Schenectady-Troy, NY; Buffalo-Niagara Falls, NY; Essex County, NY; and, Jefferson County, NY ozone nonattainment areas classified as marginal have attained the ozone air quality standard by the attainment date of November 15, 1993. These actions are based on monitored air quality readings for the national ambient air quality standard for ozone during the years 1991&hyph;1993. DATES: Comments must be received on or before August 29, 1994. ADDRESSES: All comments should be addressed to: Jeanne M. Fox, Regional Administrator, Environmental Protection Agency, Region II Office, 26 Federal Plaza, New York, NY, 10278. Materials relevant to this rulemaking are located in Rm. M&hyph;1500, First Floor, Waterside Mall, 40l M Street SW., Washington, DC, and may be inspected at this location during the hours from 8:30 a.m. to 12 noon and from 1:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, except for legal holidays. A duplicate copy of the materials are located in the EPA Regional Office previously listed. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William S. Baker, Chief, Air Programs Branch, Environmental Protection Agency, Region II Office, 26 Federal Plaza, Room 1034A, New York, NY, 10278, (212) 264&hyph;2517. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background A. Clean Air Act Requirements and EPA Actions Concerning Designation and Classification Section 107(d)(4) of the Clean Air Act (the Act) required the States and EPA to designate areas as attainment, nonattainment, or unclassifiable for ozone as well as other pollutants for which national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) have been set. Section 181(a)(1) (table 1) required that ozone nonattainment areas be classified as marginal, moderate, serious, severe, or extreme, depending on their air quality. In a series of Federal Register (FR) notices, EPA completed this designation and classification process. The reader is referred to 56 FR 58694 (Nov. 6, 1991); 57 FR 56762 (Nov. 30, 1992); and, 59 FR 18967 (April 21, 1994), in which, EPA designated and classified all areas of the country for ozone. Areas designated nonattainment for ozone are required to meet attainment dates specified under the Act. For areas classified marginal through extreme, the attainment dates range from November 15, 1993 through November 15, 2010. A discussion of the attainment dates is found in the General Preamble, 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992). The Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton, NJ-PA; Albany-Schenectady-Troy, NY; Buffalo-Niagara Falls, NY; Essex County, NY; Jefferson County, NY; and, Poughkeepsie, NY areas were designated nonattainment and classified marginal for ozone pursuant to 56 FR 58694 (Nov. 6, 1991); 57 FR 56762 (Nov. 30, 1992); and, 59 FR 18967 (April 21, 1994). By this classification, their attainment date became November 15, 1993. B. Act Requirements and EPA Actions Concerning Reclassification Section 181(b)(2)(A) requires the Administrator, shortly after the attainment date, to determine whether ozone nonattainment areas attained the NAAQS. This provision states: Within 6 months following the applicable attainment date (including any extension thereof) for an ozone nonattainment area, the Administrator shall determine, based on the area's design value (as of the attainment date), whether the area attained the standard by that date. This provision further states that, for areas classified as marginal, moderate, or serious, if the Administrator determines that the area did not attain the standard by its attainment date, the area must be reclassified upwards: Except for any Severe or Extreme area, any area that the Administrator finds has not attained the standard by that date shall be reclassified by operation of law in accordance with table 1 of subsection (a) of this section to the higher of_ (i) the next higher classification for the area, or (ii) the classification applicable to the area's design value as determined at the time of the notice required under subparagraph (B). Finally, subparagraph (B) of Section 182(b)(2) mandates that the Administrator publish a notice in the Federal Register identifying each area that failed to attain the NAAQS. As quoted previously, the determination of attainment status is based on the area's ``design value.'' EPA interprets this provision generally to refer to EPA's methodology for determining attainment status. See generally, H Comm. Rep. 101&hyph;490 pp. 197, 232 (1990) (House Energy and Commerce Committee Report). For ozone, EPA determines attainment status on the basis of the expected number of exceedances of the NAAQS over the three-year period up to, and including, the attainment date. This procedure is described in 57 FR 13506 (April 16, 1992). Under these requirements, for marginal ozone nonattainment areas, EPA considers air quality during the years 1991&hyph;1993 to determine whether the area met its attainment date.
