This new proposal follows the Twelve's decision last June to promote wide-screen television in the HDTV action program and abandon any reference to a single, mandatory transmission standard. Initially, the Commission had planned to make the D2-MAC and High Definition-MAC (HD-MAC) standards obligatory. The new proposal, to be submitted to member states on 7 December, provides that television services transmitted to viewers by cable, satellite, or ground-based broadcasting stations must utilize either D2-MAC or a transmission system 100 percent compatible with PAL or SECAM standards. Among other things, that should permit use of the German "PAL Plus" standard now under development. For services not fully digitized, the Commission proposal endorses the HD-MAC transmission system. Experts expect digital transmission standards to evolve rapidly in the coming years. The Commission stipulates however that digital transmission systems will have to be "standardized by a European standardization body." The proposed directive also says that "any wide-format (16/9) television service that is picked up and rebroadcast by cable systems must be rebroadcast in the wide (16/9) format."
