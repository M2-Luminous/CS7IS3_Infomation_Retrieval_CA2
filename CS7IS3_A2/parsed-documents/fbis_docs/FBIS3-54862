Central Electoral Commission Chairman Ivan Yemets handed representative of the above political parties the relevant registration certificates. A total of 17 political parties have so far been registered by the Central Electoral Commission. None of them have expressed any desire to form a bloc at national level. Commenting on this phenomenon, the Central Electoral Commission's secretary, Ihor Tseluyko, explains: "The point is that it is disadvantegeous for parties to form a bloc at the level of the Central Electoral Commission, since in accordance with the law a bloc can only enter one candidate. It is only at the regional level that blocs declared at party congresses are likely to appear, which will at least enable them to bring through a deputy from a friendly camp, if not one of their own."
