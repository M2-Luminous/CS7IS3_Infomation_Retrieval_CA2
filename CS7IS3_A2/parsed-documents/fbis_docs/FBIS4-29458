Among topics of the draft plan, which was formulated from the viewpoint of nonproliferation of nuclear weapons and Japan's security system, are: 1) Necessary domestic conditions will be created to enable Japan to respond to the United Nations' and the international community's decisions, including sanctions against North Korea; 2) Japan will closely cooperate with the United States and South Korea; and 3) the domestic crisis-control system, including legal measures, will be promptly established, and if necessary, the legislation of a "basic security law" will be considered. The coalition intends to submit the plan to both the LDP and the SDPJ early next week. A policy study group, the "Committee To Discuss Japan's Security and Future," worked out the draft plan for the purpose of discussing it at policy consultations with the LDP and the SDPJ and preparing for future legislation by House of Representatives members. The committee (chaired by Yukihisa Yoshida, Democratic Socialist Party vice chairman) is comprised mainly of ruling coalition members. With regard to concrete measures such as economic sanctions, the draft plan says Japan should cooperate not only in UN sanctions but also in "multilateral" actions such as those taken during the Gulf War. As for cooperation with the United States and South Korea, it stipulates: "Japan will manage the Japan-U.S. security system flexibly depending on changes in the situation, and will provide support and cooperation to the United States within the framework of the system. On the other hand, Japan will positively promote cooperation with South Korea. To that end, legal and other arrangement will be made." Regarding the establishment of the domestic crisis-control system, the draft plan points out: "An emphasis will be attached to national security; protection of Japanese people's lives, assets, and welfare; and maintenance of order in the Japanese society." It also notes the need to improve laws and regulations in anticipation of rescuing Japanese people living abroad and accepting refugees.
