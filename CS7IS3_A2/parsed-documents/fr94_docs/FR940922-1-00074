FR940922-1-00074 FR940922-1-00009 Estimated Annual Burden for Reporting 1Section 1Center 1No. of respondents 1No. of responses per respondent 1Total annual responses 1Hours per response 1Total hours 54.4 Biologics 20 11 220 .5 110 ␣ Drugs 246 120 29,520 .5 14,760 ␣ Devices 125 10 1,250 .5 625 n,rn,s Total reporting burden1 15,495 1In calculating this burden respondents are assumed to be sponsors of marketing applications. On average, 20 sponsors submit marketing applications for biologics each year, 246 submit applications for drugs, and 125 submit applications for devices. Responses are broken down into the number of investigators certifying and disclosing for each sponsor's application. The average number of clinical investigators conducting studies related to a marketing application for a biologic is 11; for a drug, 120; and for a device, 10. It is estimated that the sponsor for a marketing application for a biologic will submit certification statements for 10 investigators and a disclosure statement for 1. It is estimated that a drug sponsor will submit certification statements for 115 and disclosure statements for 5. It is estimated that a device sponsor will submit certification statements for 8 investigators and disclosure statements for 2. Finally, it is estimated that .5 hours (30 minutes) will be required per submission. In the absence of a firm basis for estimating the frequency of either certification or disclosure, the agency is using the conservative estimate of .5 hours per response, although it is estimated that .25 hours (15 minutes) will be required for the preparation and submission of a certification statement and .5 hours (30 minutes) will be required for the preparation and submission of a disclosure statement. Estimated Annual Burden for Recordkeeping 1Section 1Center 1No. of recordkeepers 1Hours per recordkeeper 1Total recordkeeping hours 54.6 Biologics 20 5.5 110 ␣ Drugs 246 60 14,760 ␣ Devices 125 5 625 n,rn,s Total recordkeeping burden1 15,945 1In calculating this burden, recordkeepers are assumed to be sponsors. It is assumed that each sponsor will submit one application. The hours per recordkeeper are arrived at by multiplying the average number of clinical investigators involved in each sponsor's submitted application (11 for biologics, 120 for drugs, and 10 for devices) by the time estimated for filing the financial information received from each investigator, which is .5 hours. This is considered to be a one-time burden and one that would not be repeated on an annual basis.
