FR940630-1-00052 FR940630-1-00012 Fee Computation Proposed fixed fees and hourly rates have been derived based on the standard methodology used in FAA cost allocation studies. A single, average hourly billing rate for all Flight Standards Aviation Safety Inspectors (ASI'S), both domestic based ASI'S and foreign based ASI'S, was derived using the methodology discussed in this section. Domestic based ASI'S perform certification services, in addition to foreign based ASI'S. While domestic based ASI'S are employed at a much lower rate than foreign based ASI'S ($85.4 thousand annual difference) it is beneficial, and consistent with international treaties, to have one average hourly billing rate for ASI services, rather than have multiple rates based on ASI location. To determine the average hourly rate the FY94 Flight Standards operations budget of $270,515,400, excluding direct ASI travel, Sunday, holiday and overtime pay, was used as the base. The annual appropriations for facilities and equipment and research and development were also not used in the rate base. The operations budget contains the following items. (1) Personnel compensation and benefits, budget code series 1100 (excluding codes 1151 and 1152_overtime, Sunday and holiday pay), 1200 and 1300. (2) Travel and transportation of persons, budget code series 2100 (excluding code 2100_site visit travel). (3) Transportation of things, budget code series 2200. (4) Rental, communications, utilities, budget code series 2300. (5) Printing and reproduction, budget code series 2400. (6) Contractual services, budget code series 2500. (7) Supplies and materials, budget code series 2600. (8) Equipment, budget code series 3100. (9) Lands and structures, budget code series 3200. 10. Insurance claims and indemnities, budget code series 4200. In order to recover overhead costs attributable to providing safety services, all costs are assigned to the inspector. This is accomplished by dividing the operations budget of $270,515,400 by 2,694 ASI's on board at the beginning of FY94. The number 2,694 is taken from the Flight Standards monthly staffing report and is the total number of ASI'S in the OMB position series 1825. This division results in an annual ASI cost of $100,414.03. The annual ASI cost of $100,414,03 is divided by 2,087 hours, which is the annual paid hours of each federal government employee. This results in an hourly cost of $48.11 per ``paid hour'' (the actual amount paid by the FAA for each hour of work performed by an inspector), based on 2,087 paid hours per inspector year. This cost of $48.11 per hour does not ensure full recovery of costs. Inspectors spend a significant amount of time in indirect work such as training and the preparation of administrative reports, to support their inspection activities, much of which cannot be allocated to any one client. In addition, not all 2,087 annual paid hours are available as work hours. Training, providing technical assistance, leave, and other factors reduce the work hours that may be directly billed. Consequently, it is necessary to increase the hourly ASI government paid amount of $48.11 by an indirect work factor of 1.66 to arrive at the full cost recovery hourly ASI billing rate. The indirect work factor of 1.66 is derived as follows. The Flight Standards Staffing Standard (FAA Order 1380.28B, dated January 15, 1985) uses an indirect work rate of 0.43 to project the amount of time an ASI spends in indirect work activities, as opposed to certification and surveillance work, during the year. The indirect work activities are: (a) Development of master minimum equipment lists on Flight Operations Evaluation Board (b) Development of aircraft training documents on Flight Standardization Board (c) Development of Maintenance program documents on Maintenance Review Board (d) Providing technical assistance (e) Assisting legal counsel (f) Evaluation of technical documents (g) Leave (all types) (h) Training (i) Administrative time
