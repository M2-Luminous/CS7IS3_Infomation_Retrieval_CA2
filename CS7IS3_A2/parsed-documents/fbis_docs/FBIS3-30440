From their post, located 15 kilometres (nine miles) from the airport of this major northern Bosnian town -- which the United Nations plans to reopen, by force if necessary -- the Swedes were able to determine the exact position of Serb artillery which shelled the airport and the nearby NORDBAT 2 Scandinavian battalion base Tuesday [1 February]. Seated high in his sandbag bunker, in front of an enormous pair of binoculars, Private Fredrik Thorgren, 26, explained Wednesday what the peacekeepers witnessed. "Yesterday, we saw shooting behind this hill, near Borogovo. We didn't see the detonations," he said. "There were speculations that it was near the base. One hour later we heard on the radio that it landed on the airport and 100 metres (yards) from the camp." Serb artillery controls access to the Tuzla airport from three different positions, with several hundred artillery pieces at its disposal. Tuesday afternoon, nine shells fell on the airport zone, including one within one kilometre of the main runway. There were no casualties. "The nearest Serb position from the airport is 10 kilometres (six miles), so they could shoot with guns, mortars or tanks," said Tango 2 platoon leader Lieutenant Jan Almgard, 28. [passage omitted] "A grenade landed on the roof. The Serbs are aiming at us, it's obvious. We have a blue flag with a light on it, it can't be a mistake," Almgard said, pointing out the blown-away tiles on their UN-leased villa. "The soldier on duty at the binoculars had time only to jump down. It's a miracle we had no casualties." [passage omitted] "The problem is that the Serbs here think that we fight with the Bosnian Army and that we're part of their defence system," explained Almgard. "We tried to establish a radio link with them but they refuse to use it." [passage omitted]
