He believes that western diplomats must now show more resolution in the Geneva talks because, he says, this is the last straw. General Jean Cot was interviewed on the phone by Bertrand Vannier this afternoon: [Begin Cot recording] The last straw is that I have the feeling, indeed the conviction, that the Bosnian Serbs reckon that we are pawns in their political game. This seems totally unacceptable to me. It must be understood that if the international community is indeed totally at the service of the warring parties to find a solution, it cannot agree to all the humiliations that are inflicted on it. We will have to make choices. Mr. Stoltenberg and Mr. Owen cannot act in Geneva as if, here on the ground, we did not have 30,000 soldiers subjected to pressures by all and particularly by the Bosnian Serbs. I believe that we will have to choose and that we cannot act as kind go-betweens in Geneva, in the UN conference halls, while abandoning the force, which after all is the armed tool of the international community, in its current situation here on the ground.
