Private mining increased 41 percent in 1993, the highest growth in the past 50 years. This increase was prompted mainly by the expansion project implemented by the Inti Raymi Company, which invested $150 million to improve gold production. The Mining Association reported that gold registered a record production of 6.56 metric tons in 1993. Silver production increased 38 percent, and lead 14 percent. (Santa Cruz EL MUNDO in Spanish 28 May 94 National Section p 1) Central Bank statistics show that gold exports generated 21 percent of the total value of mining exports in 1993, when they amounted to $76.3 million. They represented only 2 percent of mining exports in 1985, 11 percent in 1989, and 21 percent in 1993. Exports went from $21.9 million in 1992 to $76.3 million in 1993. (Santa Cruz EL MUNDO in Spanish 28 May 94 National Section p 2) The National Statistics Institute, INE, reported that exports amounted to $216 million in the first quarter of 1994, an increase of 33.7 percent; imports totalled $253 million, a drop of 1.6 percent. Mining increased 18 percent, hydrocarbons 10.5 percent, and nontraditional exports 72 percent. (La Paz LA RAZON in Spanish 1 Jun 94 p B2) Integration Under Secretary Victor Rico on 30 May reported that Bolivian exports to Chile dropped "dramatically" from $30 million to $12 million in the past three years. The commercial deficit, which totals $100 million, is caused by the restrictions imposed by Chile on some Bolivian products; by the export of certain products to other markets; and by the poor diversification of products offered by Bolivian exporters in the past few years. (Cochabamba LOS TIEMPOS in Spanish 1 Jun 94 p A8) The Chamber of Exporters reported that Santa Cruz's exports totalled 73,103 metric tons at a value of $29.305 million in the first quarter of 1994, almost double the figure registered in the same period in 1993. This shows that the volume of exports increased by 75 percent, and its value by 98 percent. Peru is Santa Cruz' main market with $12.4 million, Argentina with $5.1 million, and Colombia with $4.9 million. (La Paz PRESENCIA in Spanish 3 Jun 94 p 4) On 31 May the INE reported that economic activity increased 4.3 percent in the year's first four months as compared with the same period in 1993. Hydrocarbons increased 11 percent; oil and gas production 19.8 percent and 10.7 percent respectively; mining 9.6 percent; manufacturing production 4.4 percent; services 7.4 percent; and energy 8.7 percent. (La Paz PRESENCIA in Spanish 1 Jun 94 p 1) The National Chamber of Industries reported that industry continues to decline. A survey on industrial performance results in the fourth quarter of 1993 showed that sales dropped 6.0 percent; financing 3.7 percent; and production 0.4 percent.
