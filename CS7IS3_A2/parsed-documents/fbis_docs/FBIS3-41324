They had arrived in Guayaquil on Wednesday, 11 January, driving a white Ford 350 truck with license plates PFS-293, on which they were carrying 500 packages of drugs (cocaine hydrochloride), with a gross weight, including their wrappers, of 541,976 grams. The shipment was camouflaged in boxes containing Colcafe [Colombian coffee], cookies, candy, lollipops, chocolates, etc. The report adds that, when the aforementioned vehicle reached Guayaquil, it was kept in a garage located on Nicasio Sadafi Avenue, at the La Atarazana housing complex. They left the truck in the care of those residing there who served as guards of the premises, several of whom were witnesses to the seizure of the drugs and the arrest of Mejia Tarupi and Benavidez Medina. The Interrogations During the preliminary interrogations conducted, Luis Mejia Tarupi claimed that the drugs were intended for Kleber Delgado Delgado, following a telephone call to be made to the Hotel Internacional Orquideas, No. 2, room number 205. Hence, several agents went to the aforementioned room with the subject in custody, to wait for the call, which was made. During the conversation, an unidentified speaker told the subject to remain there, so that they could call him back to give him the respective instructions for delivering the merchandise (drugs). At 1500 on Sunday, 16 January, the Colombian citizens, Juan Carlos Gamba Garcia, Alberto Alfredo Benavidez Coral, and Mario Fernando Jurado Portilla, arrived at the hotel, located on Olmedo Avenue between Chile and Chimborazo. They were accompanied by the Ecuadoran, Kleber Delgado Delgado, riding in a white Chevrolet Vitara without plates. The report stresses that only Alfredo Benavidez got out of the car, heading for the room where Mejia Tarupi was waiting. He made contact with the latter and was arrested. The police acted immediately to capture the rest of those implicated who were still in the vehicle. During the search of those arrested, Kleber Delgado was found to have a Ruger make pistol with two loaders and 29 9-mm caliber shells. This evidence was stored at the Interpol warehouses. Those arrested, except for Luis Mejia Tarupi, were taken to the police headquarters lockup, together with the vehicles and the confiscated drugs. Luis Mejia was detained in the hotel room, because it was known that he must have had other contacts, and might possibly be visited by other members of the "narco"-criminal organization. Customs Police Captured As the investigations progressed, the Interpol agents captured two active members of the Customs Military Police who were participating directly in the shipment of cocaine from Guayaquil to the United States, through the Challenger air freight company. Those under arrest, Corporals William Oswaldo Rivera Cabezas and Hugo Segura Hurtado, admitted their association with the drug traffickers during the preliminary interrogations. Since the two PMA members were working outside Guayaquil, arrangements were made with that institution's general headquarters to have them taken into custody and sent to the principal port. Drugs at the Airport As a result of these arrests, the agents determined that the "narco"-criminal organization was not only using this city's seaport for shipping out drugs, but might also have been doing so from the airport, thanks to the cooperation of the customs policemen who were captured. Both Rivera and Segura, who were working at the air terminal, maintained contact with Delgado who, after packing the drugs in bales of T-shirts printed with Galapagos Islands tourist advertisements, was storing the merchandise in the Challenger air freight firm's warehouses. There, the dishonest policemen were pretending to make a counternarcotics check of the cargo to be put aboard the planes. For their purposes, however, they knew in advance which boxes contained the drugs, because the name Jose Heredia was being used to identify them. This made it easy for them to locate the boxes that they were supposed to send through without the checking and inspection procedure. Moreover, these individuals were objecting to the counternarcotics check being made by the National Police, through their agents.
