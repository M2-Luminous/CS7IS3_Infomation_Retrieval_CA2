As has been revealed to the world, the South Korean ruling bunch has been developing nuclear weapons ever since it manufactured atomic reactors for military purposes a long time ago under the guise of commercial use and use in research. Today, the rascals are going so far as to talk openly about nuclear sovereignty. South Koreans involved in nuclear development have also confessed that the heavy-water reactor in Wolsong and the multipurpose research reactor in Taedok were introduced for purposes of nuclear weapons development. And, publications in South Korea have also revealed that plans to produce nuclear weapons have been pushed ahead endlessly by South Korea. As is known, the South Korean ruling bunch made it a policy to develop nuclear weapons by the early 1970's. They imported a heavy-water reactor from Canada with a view to securing fissionables and installed it in Wolsong. The South Korean puppet clique publicized that the Wolsong heavy-water reactor was for power generation purposes. But, a publication in South Korea revealed the truth by saying that the Wolsong heavy-water reactor that was imported from Canada was for manufacturing nuclear weapons and for producing plutonium. The South Korean ruling bunch has also been introducing in a legal way, enriched uranium from a foreign country after having designed and manufactured the Taedok multipurpose research reactor suitable for using enriched uranium. By installing a new test laboratory for irridation materials, they established a semi-reprocessing facility where they can produce plutonium directly from used nuclear fuel. In South Korea, the development of nuclear weapons has been carried out in a more earnest way since the Kim Yong-sam puppet regime was inaugurated. Already a year ago, the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique called on the National Assembly to raise its voice against the possession of nuclear weapons as it nullified the principle of the South-North Joint Declaration on Denuclearization. Some time ago, traitor Kim Yong-sam himself even concluded an agreemeent aimed at pushing ahead with nuclear development hand in hand with Japan. This fully shows how enthusiastic the South Korean puppets are in their maneuvers to develop nuclear weapons. South Korea's nuclear weapons development, which has actually reached a dangerous stage, was possible because of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]'s double standard of not publicizing and overlooking the results of nuclear inspections there, while finding fault with our peaceful nuclear facilities. It is by no chance that THE INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE, a U.S. publication, revealed that South Korea is implementing its ambitious nuclear plans with the connivance of the IAEA. Not satisfied with having made South Korea the Far East's largest nuclear powder magazine by introducing some 1,000 U.S. nuclear weapons, the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is maneuvering to frantically accelerate its own nuclear weapons development. Such an act is a downright breach of faith nullifying the joint declaration on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and an implacable, serious crime aimed at annihilating the nation. As is known to the whole world, in the second round Korea-U.S. talks, we put forth an epoch-making proposal of replacing the graphite-moderated atomic reactor with a light-water reactor. Thus, we showed the transparency of peaceful nuclear activities and have made all sincere efforts to find a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. Therefore, if the South Korean ruling bunch has a sincere intention to make the Korean peninsula a nuclear-free, peace zone, it should make clear, and beg forgiveness, at home and abroad, even now, that the heavy-water reactor, the multipurpose research reactor, and the fast-breeder reactor are for developing nuclear weapons, and should take measures to scrape them. If the South Korean puppets continue to accelerate nuclear weapons development that will cause tremendous catastrophe to the nation, despite strong protest and denunciation of people at home and abroad, they will not be able to avoid the rigorous judgment of the times and history. The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique should clearly understand this and act with discretion.
