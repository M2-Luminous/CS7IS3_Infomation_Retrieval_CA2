The rally in Seoul was attended by 15,000 farmers, dissidents, citizens and students under the South Korean Federation of General Student Councils (Hanchongnyon). The ralliers said the South Korean countryside would be ruined by the Uruguay Round of world trade talks in which the authorities fully accepted the brigandish demands of the United States. They urged the "National Assembly" to refuse to "approve" farm market opening. In his address at the rally, Yi Ki-taek, president of the Democratic Party, urged the authorities not to attend the signing ceremony of the Uruguay Round accord scheduled in Morocco on April 15, saying that South Korea's agriculture and countryside were standing on the edge of a cliff due to the humiliating diplomacy. After the rally, the participants continued their protests for a long time in front of the "National Assembly building," shouting "check with death the parliamentary endorsement of the Uruguay Round accord." Prior to the rally in Seoul, 3,000 students of Seoul National, Korea and Hanyang Universities under Hanchongnyon held meetings to check the Uruguay Round at their universities and dispatched a group of 200 hunger strikers to Myongdong Cathedral in Seoul. Hanchongnyon announced that a hunger strike against farm market opening will be organised from April 9 to 15. Rallies and demonstrations also took place in ten other cities including Pusan, Taegu, Kwangju and Taejon, attended by 10,000 people of different strata. On Friday, 3,000 students held a rally and protests in Seoul, shouting "Down with Kim Yong-sam" and "Oppose foreign rice."
