Despite Rabbani's plea, most people expect more fighting. Countless cease-fire agreements have collapsed and the current fighting is perhaps the most intense since the ousting of the communist government in 1992. The latest cease-fire plan has been negotiated by military and political leaders from southwestern Afghanistan who recently arrived in Kabul. Since the fighting started 1 January, at least 1,000 people have been killed, more than 12,000 have been wounded, and some 600,000 have been driven from their homes.
