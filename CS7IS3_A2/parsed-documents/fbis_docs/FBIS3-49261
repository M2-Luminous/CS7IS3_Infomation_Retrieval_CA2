[Walesa] Because it wants to protect and defend Europe, seeing European snobbery--seeing that it has not learned any lessons from history. Today Poland is trying to save Europe from mistakes like the ones made in 1939. We must not allow dangerous situations to develop. There are moments which have to be taken advantage of and not left till tomorrow. We did that in 1939, and we all paid the price. This again is one of those moments when we must not do that. We have achieved great victories, and these must be transformed into structural realities--political and military, as well as economic. [Cells] What do you mean by European snobbery? [Walesa] Europe thinks only of itself, only about the present. It has no sense of perspective, and it hasn't learnt anything from history. That's all very well for today. Tomorrow we'll all pay a high price as Europeans. I've learned from the past and look at what is happening now. I don't want us to make the same mistakes all over again. [Cells] President Yeltsin changed his mind about Polish entry into NATO last year. Why, do you think? [Walesa] He sensed the West's indecisiveness and its snobbery. He saw its lack of vision, and that is why he feels able to set conditions. You can set conditions for the weak, not the strong. You can set them when there is no vision, no direction. Yeltsin saw this and has taken advantage of it. [Cells] What about domestic influences, the results of the elections, the rise of Zhirinovskiy? [Walesa] Oh, that proves me right. Demons emerge when a country has no vision or direction. Mr. Zhirinovskiy is just such a demon. [Cells] What do you think is wrong with President Clinton's offer of a partnership for peace, the gradual development of contacts between Poland and NATO? [Walesa] It's a good idea, but you have to combine it with what I'm talking about: ideas and a vision for the future, but with a possibility of true partnership. You cannot be a real partner without being a shareholder. [Cells] Aren't you afraid of there being a Russian sphere of influence in the East, and an American one in the West? [Walesa] It's going exactly that way. We're heading toward recreating that confrontational system. We want to get out of it. We don't want to wake up the old demons. The American proposals are all very well, but at the moment, they're just proposals.
