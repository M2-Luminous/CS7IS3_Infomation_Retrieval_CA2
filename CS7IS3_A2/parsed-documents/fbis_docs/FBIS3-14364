He said that al-Shar' briefed the president on the latest developments in the peace process, the Arab League meeting, several issues of joint Egyptian-Syrian interest, and the coordination of Egyptian-Syrian political moves in the context of collective Arab action and the resumption of the peace negotiations. Asked about Syria's position on the U.S. President's recent remarks on Jerusalem, al-Shar' replied: Our views on this issue are known. Jerusalem is an inseparable part of the occupied Arab territories and is subject to the same principles governing the rest of the territories. Al-Shar' affirmed that Israel must withdraw from all the occupied territories because the peace process began with the understanding that the pertinent UN resolutions would be implemented. He noted that these resolutions refer to Jerusalem. Asked about Syria's position on resuming negotiations, al-Shar' pointed out that Syria's position on peace is clear and no international doubts remain about the necessity of attaining a just and comprehensive peace. He added that resisting the occupation is a nation's legitimate right, which is only terminated by ending the occupation and is not subject to bargaining. Asked why no meeting of the Arab cordon states was held on the sidelines of the Arab League Council session, the Syrian foreign minister remarked that actually no invitation was issued for such a meeting, but bilateral discussions were held on the sidelines of the Arab League conference. He added: We will continue these bilateral contacts and when the need for a meeting of the cordon states arises, we will use diplomatic channels to arrange one. In response to a question whether any new developments had occurred in connection with the Syrian-Israeli negotiations, al-Shar' said there have been no new developments but there is now a better understanding and recognition of the importance of the Geneva summit between Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President Clinton in January and its results. He explained that this means there is now a better understanding of Syria's leading role in the peace process. In connection with the recent U.S. announcement that it received a Syrian response about resuming the Syrian, Jordanian, and Lebanese negotiations with Israel in April, the Syrian foreign minister was asked to comment on the fact that the PLO was not mentioned in this announcement. He was asked if this meant a separation of the PLO's negotiating track from the other three. Al-Shar' replied: Syria has no plans, and I believe our Lebanese and Jordanian brothers have no plans either, to separate our negotiating tracks from the Palestinian track. The Syrian foreign minister continued: Regrettably the opposite happened. Those in charge of the Palestinian track separated it from the other Arab tracks. This affair is well-known to the Arab citizens and in international circles too. Al-Shar' pointed out that negotiations between the PLO and Israel have actually been resumed in Tunis and then in Cairo and will continue. He said the Palestinians did not coordinate this resumption of the talks with the other Arab parties concerned with the peace process. He added: In Syria, of course, we attach great importance to coordination and will maintain our bilateral communications, especially with our Lebanese and Jordanian brothers. Responding to a question on Israeli Prime Minister Rabin's recent statement on the need for Syria to show its genuine desire for peace to the Israeli people so that Israel may define the line from which it will withdraw from the Golan, al-Shar' said that withdrawal from the Golan is a lawful, legal, and binding demand according to Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 and Article 25 of the UN Charter, which expressly calls for member countries' commitment to implementing Security Council resolutions. He stressed that Israeli withdrawal from the Golan is not negotiable and, consequently, total withdrawal is a requirement that must be met in accordance with Resolutions 242 and 338. He said: Despite this, Syria called for total peace in return for total withdrawal and we are waiting to hear similar talk from the Israelis, that is, to declare that they are ready for total withdrawal in return for total peace. In reply to a question on Syria's position on the Arab boycott of Israel, al-Shar' said that the Arab boycott of Israel is a legal action and is in accordance with the Arab countries' declaration made as a result of the state of war between the Arab countries and Israel and Israeli occupation of Arab territories. He said that as long as the reasons for the boycott are valid, the Arab boycott will remain binding to the Arab countries collectively or individually. He stressed that it is wrong to request the Arabs to cancel the boycott while Israel continues to occupy Arab territory. Such a demand, he said, gives the impression that you ask me to cancel a legal and lawful decision to support an illegal and unlawful position, namely the occupation of land. He said: The boycott of Israel is legal and lawful but the occupation is illegal and unlawful.
