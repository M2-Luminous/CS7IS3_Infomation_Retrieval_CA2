There are many opinions regarding the possibility of implementing it within a short period of time, due to the lack of enough resources for the necessary purchases of modern equipment. The highest ranking military officers are also concerned about the reorganization's social and geopolitical aspects, which means that today you cannot depend on a single strategic line, or maintain a strict subordination to certain world hegemonic powers which are always changing. Commanders are also studying the diverse effects of the deep political changes in the world with the disappearance of the Soviet Union and communism. Many people do not hesitate to affirm that these changes have deeply affected our Armed Forces. We no longer have the "cold war" or the "East-West axis" and have again begun to speak about the importance of the "North-South axis," "which seeks to maintain countries such as Uruguay in strict dependency of the North." High-ranking military sources told LA MANANA that the affair raises questions not only about the future equipping of our Armed Forces, but also about its "acting philosophy and its professional morale and ethics," the sources said. Confirming their well-known resistance "to be merely used as border forces," the spokesman ratified that "we will never, no matter the order, replace the police. Before we are required to intervene in internal problems, we need an appropriate law protecting soldiers following orders, officers giving those orders, citizens who should be protected from probable abuse, and "the institutions." The Cost of the Reform Confirming the real Armed Forces vision on the need to modernize the institution and on the concrete economic reality of the country, the sources said: "We are well aware of our real needs. If we ask for a brigade with significant firing power, adequate deployment speed, safe communications, and modern equipment, we know we will need millions of dollars. But we are also aware of the real situation of the country, and of the social and political priorities. What, then, should we do? That question seems to be at the center of the delay in producing the report that President Luis Alberto Lacalle had requested within the next 90 days. The sources do not hesitate to say that the report will be presented in time, and in the correct form, "because we will fulfill the order." There is no doubt, however, that the country's and the Armed Forces' reality will require "another time and a different focus" to be able to also answer to the deep changes in regional, continental, and world political geography. The Reorganization The internal Armed Forces reorganization has begun principally in the Army. Many services have been "grouped under a single command," while many other offices have not been touched. In some cases they even returned to their former department heads. The Air Force has very few planes still operating, but it will be receiving various kinds of planes, including two Hercules transport planes that will be donated by the United States. Our ground forces have the greatest problem. This is the branch with the largest number of personnel who "will not be separated from the institution. They will be redistributed within the Defense Ministry. Reliable sources said that the institution is studying new incentives for the voluntary retirement program. The situation is being analyzed carefully because it might affect the financial situation of the Military Retirement and Pensions Fund, the organization that will be responsible for paying pensions to those who retire. According to government sources, the president wants the Armed Forces reorganization ready for August in order to implement the mechanisms approved by the high-ranking military commanders during October at the latest.
