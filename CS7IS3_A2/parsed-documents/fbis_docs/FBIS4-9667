FBIS4-9667 "drlat062_m_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-062 Daily Report 30 Mar 1994 Brazil Minister Cardoso: Economic Plan `Established' Minister Cardoso: Economic Plan `Established' PY3103000494 Brasilia Voz do Brasil Network in Portuguese 2200 GMT 30 Mar 94 PY3103000494 Brasilia Voz do Brasil Network Portuguese BFN [Text] Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso is leaving his post to run for president. His last act as finance minister was to present the bills for the new Brazilian currency, the real, which will take effect in the economic plan's third stage. Minister Cardoso today presented to the public the one-, five-, 10-, 50-, and 100-real bills as well as the one-, five-, 10-, and 50-real cent coins. The Central Bank is coordinating the printing of 1 billion bills, some of which are being printed abroad. During the presentation Minister Cardoso said the new currency needs credibility, and for this purpose the government must be austere. It would have been easier, he said, to have begun the economic plan with the creation of the real, but the government chose the most difficult path, which was to create the appropriate conditions by streamlining public accounts. Minister Cardoso said he left the economic plan ready and that he is sure it will work: [Begin Cardoso recording] I am totally sure that the plan is perfectly established and coordinated and that it will work. It will not be affected in the least. Brazil has now found its path, which it must follow. That is also the conviction of the president. Therefore, I am leaving this ministry with absolute calm. [end recording] Minister Cardoso reported that the people must not worry because the government will announce the measure at least 35 days before the new currency goes into circulation. During a news conference, Minister Cardoso assessed what has done so far with the stabilization plan. He expressed thanks for the economic team's dedication, Congress' cooperation, and President Itamar Franco's support. He said the president always encouraged the plan and has been the main pillar of the economic policy. Minister Cardoso said it has not been decided yet who will be his vice presidential running mate. He said his party, the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party], is open to conversations with all parties but nothing has been agreed on alliances so far.
