How do you view Mercosur's immediate future? Will it be a free-trade zone, a united customs system, or a common market? [Sandoval] About Mercosur's immediate future: Officially, the schedule established at Las Lenas is being fulfilled. That schedule established the creation of a common market as of 1 January 1995. However, the decisive item in the creation of a common market, the establishment of a common external duty system, has been delayed. According to a decision made during the 28 December 1992 presidential meeting in Montevideo, the common external duty system will have levels between zero and 20 percent, although "a reduced list of products will have different rates, which will reach up to 35 percent, with the understanding that this special rate will be reduced to a maximum of 20 percent over a period no longer than six years beginning on 1 January 1995." On the other hand, the Asuncion Treaty gives Paraguay and Uruguay one year, or until 1 January 1995, for the total elimination of the list of exceptions that is included in the remaining 20 percent of that list. We can infer from all I said above that if products and duties in the reduced list mentioned in the 28 December 1992 presidents declaration are not many, we will have a "limited customs union" on 1 January 1995. [ABC COLOR] Considering the difficulties encountered among member countries during the negotiating process, what are Brazil's proposals for breaking the deadlock and establishing a common external duty system for products called sensitive, such as capital goods, pharmaceutical chemistry [quimica fina], computers, etc.? Will the date for the establishment of an extended market, which was set for 1 January 1995, be delayed if it is not possible to find common ground for an agreement? [Sandoval] According to what was said in the last economy vice ministers' meeting in Montevideo on 12 November 1993, as well as during the previous meetings of the technical subgroup 10 (to coordinate macroeconomic policies), the Brazilian position on one hand, and the Argentine, Paraguayan, and Uruguayan positions on the other, are irreducible when referring to products such as capital goods, computers, and pharmaceutical chemistry. Brazil wants to protect its industries in these areas, while Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay need to equip themselves, want the freedom to freely chose technologically advanced products from third countries at a reasonable price, and do not want to be forced to purchase Brazilian machinery which is competitive simply because of the zero duty between Mercosur countries. Brazil has made a concrete proposal. They proposed applying a 35 percent duty on these products at first, then lowering the rate gradually until it reaches 20 percent in six years starting in 1995. But this position was categorically rejected by Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Evidently this is a very difficult point because it not only deals with a difference in criteria on duties, but also affects the macroeconomic policies of these countries. The media has reported two bilateral meetings between Argentina and Brazil at the level of the economy vice ministers and economy ministers during December, to discuss these points. Paraguay and Uruguay were excluded from those meetings. Decisions in Mercosur must consented to by the four member countries. We can assure you that Paraguay will not yield its position of demanding reduced duties for these products. There is no doubt that a stalemate on this point will be an obstacle for the establishment of the Mercosur as of 1 January 1995. But it is better to wait and see. [ABC COLOR] The schedule for the gradual elimination of tariffs has been strictly fulfilled. But very little progress has been made in the area of coordinating macroeconomic policies. We can almost say that talks on this matter are stalemated. What is being done to correct the asymmetries regarding trade, foreign exchange, tariffs, and even some protectionism that is still noticeable in the national economic structures of member countries? [Sandoval] Here we must say that Brazil is the member country that must correct its economic policy in order to move its position closer to that of the other countries. According to macroeconomic indicators such as inflation rate, devaluation, fiscal balance, and custom tariffs, there is a great difference between Brazil and the other three member countries. The indicators mentioned above are not too different in Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay, and the gap can, therefore, be closed. But Brazil, with a 30 percent monthly inflation rate, correlative devaluations, and protectionist tariff policies in general, is too far out and will have difficulties in closing the gap. This country must establish the mechanisms to substantially reduce those rates. No one can ask the other three countries to increase their indicators disproportionately. Uruguay's case is somewhat different because, although it does not have an incredibly high inflation rate nor devaluations (between 30 and 60 percent per year), its indicators do not match those of Argentina and Paraguay, but there are greater possibilities of adjusting them. This issue, obviously, is Mercosur's "Achilles tendon" because the respective economic plans are subject to the domestic policies, and in order to become attuned with other countries it is necessary to make changes which in some cases may represent great detours from the chosen path. But we must also bear in mind that there is still a year ahead of us before Mercosur is implemented, and that the Brazilian delegations, during the economy ministers' meeting held in Asuncion on 1 July 1993, made a proposal to study the possibility of a maximum exchange rate band for the real exchange rate. This proposal is being assessed by the working subgroups. [ABC COLOR] In the case of a possible link with NAFTA, what do you think Brazil will do if it has to choose between NAFTA and Mercosur? [Sandoval] Although the Asuncion Treaty does not specifically mention the linking of member countries with other economic blocs, with the exception of ALADI [Latin American Integration Association], it can be deduced from what is established in Article 8 that any advantage granted to a member country is extended to the other Mercosur members. Therefore, Brazil or any other Mercosur member country's link with NAFTA would automatically mean the link of the entire group with the NAFTA bloc. Another possibility is that Brazil leave Mercosur, as established in Articles 21 and 22, to independently join NAFTA. We do not believe this will happen because it was precisely Brazil and Argentina that promoted Mercosur. Moreover, in the hypothetical case that it has to choose between Mercosur and NAFTA, we believe that Brazil as the country with greater economic development in the region will be more interested in Mercosur for competitiveness and leadership reasons.
