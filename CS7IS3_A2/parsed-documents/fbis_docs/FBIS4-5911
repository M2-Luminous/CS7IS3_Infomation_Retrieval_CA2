On the supply list will be 440,000 statistics regarding about 500 areas, including income, health, industry, labor, money, foreign exchange rates, inflation, economic growth and international statistics, NSO officials said yesterday. The only exceptions from the free release will be such statistical figures that may infringe on individuals' privacy or private businesses' trade secrets, they said. To gain access to the official statistics, one has to have a personal computer and subscribe to related computer network systems run by private information suppliers, the officials said. For instance, Korea Securities Computer Corp. has already been providing stock market information through its Stocknet network from March and Dacom plans to supply a statistical service through its Chollian network from June. Other than the computer network services, the statistics can be sold in the form of diskettes and magnetic tapes at the request of individuals and corporations with certain fees for using computers. The NSO will also operate an ARS (audio response system) in the fourth quarter of this year, by which time it will provide ready answers on 1,000 basic statistics with only one phone call.
