A northern military statement published here said northern forces had captured all the tanks and artillery of the pro-south 25th mechanised brigade based at Haraz. An unspecified number of the 1,200 soldiers had surrendered to the northern side, according to the statement published by the SABA' news agency here. Southern leaders told AFP Wednesday that the north was attempting to open up a new front in the Strait of Bab el-Mandeb region to the west of the main southern town of Aden. A statement published in Sanaa said northern forces inflicted "heavy losses" on southern troops in the al-'Anad and al-Hutah areas 50 kilometres (30 miles) north of Aden. The northerners were "moving towards their objectives" in the al- Dali' sector. In the Abyan province, east of Aden, southern forces had attempted to launch a counter-offensive but had been "forced to beat a retreat," the statement said. At Abyan, a southern spokesman said their forces were concentrating their attacks on northern pockets in the Zinjibar region, on the coast and in Ja'ar and Bakis to the east. Al-Bid, stripped of the office of vice-president by the northern- dominated parliament last week, said a ceasefire was dependent on a withdrawal of northern forces from the southern part of the country. "The return of forces to their positions (before the north and south were united in 1990) is an important condition for the end of fighting," al-Bid, looking relaxed and smiling, told reporters at his home overlooking Aden. "There are no longer southern forces in the north after they were destroyed" by troops loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, al-Bid said. He said the war had been "imposed by the dictator 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and the family" of parliamentary speaker Shaykh 'Abdallah al- Ahmar. "We did not start the war. It was forced on us. And we continue to resist the invasion forces. We will not allow the al-'Amaliqah (northern) forces to progress one inch towards Aden," he said. Al-Bid said "to date there is no sign of a political dialogue or mediation," with Salih and ruled out a meeting with the northern leader. "We sat together with Salih to agree on unity (in 1990) but after the blow he has struck we cannot sit around the same table," he said. The civil war in Yemen has pitched the socialist south, led by al-Bid, against the conservative Islamic north, four years after the two were united. Yemeni Muslim fundamentalists "are in league with fundamentalists abroad who are attempting to prevent the Arab nation from getting into the 21st century," al-Bid said Wednesday. [passage omitted]
