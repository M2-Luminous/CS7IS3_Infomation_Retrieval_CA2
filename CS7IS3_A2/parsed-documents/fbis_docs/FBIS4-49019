Mr. Chen said that the serious problems at present were the worsening of inflation and a too fast increase in prices. The retail sales price index continues to rise based on last year's increase of 13 percent, a situation seldom seen since reform started. In particular, soaring prices for daily necessities, basic services and basic production means which were close to people's living and national economic development were intolerable to certain sectors. Mr. Chen said that the issue of inflation had drawn the closest attention of the central authorities and the State Council had taken a series of measures recently to control prices. These were first, strict control over the speed of increase in fixed assets investment and the over-expansion of consumption fund. Second, much attention paid to agricultural production and the "food basket" project aimed at increasing supply. Third, strengthened government supervision and administration over prices including the establishment of price risk funds for grain and non-stable food, supervision over prices of 20 kinds of daily necessities and basic services, marked prices for commodity goods and services and price inspections throughout the country. Fourth, certain economic measures to control prices had been adopted to strengthen transportation of goods and materials and guarantee market supply. Authorities at various levels had also adopted a series of such measures. Mr. Chen said that government must control and administer prices under the situation of the socialist market economy which was the common experience of all countries practising market economy. In the situation where most commodity prices had been formed by market forces, there was a pressing need to set up and improve a price control system.
