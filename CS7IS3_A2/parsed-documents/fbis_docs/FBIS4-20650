But how to calculate the environmental impact of, say, a car or a refrigerator or an entire building? That is a problem which has just recently begun to be addressed in a process called life-cycle assessment. It is not just a matter of measuring the environmental impact of a product while in use. The entire life cycle of the product must be considered, embracing the acquisition of natural resources, the production of materials, the manufacture of goods, the distribution of goods, the use of those goods and finally their disposal, including recycling wherever possible. Moves are afoot to establish international standards for the assessment of the environmental impact of various products. In the meantime, government, academic and corporate groups are grappling on their own with the problem of how to devise valid evaluation methods. Since global warming and destruction of the ozone layer are foremost in the minds of people worried about the environmental impact of industrial activity, many efforts at life-cycle assessment focus on the generation of carbon dioxide and chlorofluorocarbons. Life of a Building A life-cycle assessment for buildings was made by researchers from Waseda University and Nikken Sekkei Ltd., the largest architectural designing company in Japan. They asked how carbon dioxide emissions would change if the building were designed to be more energy efficient and to last longer. For their study, they considered every stage in the life of a building, from construction through operation and renovation to final demolition. According to their calculations, if the building were designed with state-of-the-art air conditioning and other systems to reduce energy consumption by 50 percent during operation, more carbon dioxide would be generated during the construction of the building. Nevertheless, emissions could be reduced by 18 percent over the entire life of the building. A similar life-cycle assessment for automobiles was carried out by the University of Tokyo and the National Institution for Environmental Studies. They calculated that carbon dioxide emissions equivalent to 8.3 metric tons of carbon are released for each car. The calculation takes into account the manufacture, use, maintenance and disposal of cars. Fuel consumption accounts for 70 percent of the lost carbon, which should not be surprising. But another 10 percent comes from the construction and maintenance of roads for the cars to drive on. The researchers note that this is a significant amount and argue that roadway infrastructure is a factor which cannot be ignored when evaluating the environmental impact of cars. At the company level, Canon Inc. recently calculated the amount of carbon dioxide released during the life cycle of the replaceable toner cartridges used in its photocopiers. The company's assessment took into account overseas transport of the toner and looked at how recycling could cut down on emissions. Life-cycle assessments are not limited to evaluations of greenhouse gas emissions. IBM Japan Ltd., for example, is studying ways to design computers that are easier to recycle. The process involves evaluating how easily machines can be dismantled. Meanwhile, the Plastic Waste Management Institute is investigating plastic materials and evaluating how the conservation of raw materials and energy would cut down on the emission of environmental pollutants. Unravelling the Knot Despite such efforts, life-cycle assessment is still a young science and many problems still need to be resolved. For example, carbon dioxide is not the only harmful substance produced during product life cycles; solid wastes and nitrogen oxides are also released. It is difficult to untangle all the factors and decide which have significant impact on the environment. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry wants to collect more data on the subject. It feels that none of the evaluation methods have been fully substantiated yet. For this reason, government agencies including the Science and Technology Agency and the Environment Agency are working to develop new methods while keeping a close eye on efforts by researchers elsewhere in the field.
