The plan was drawn up at a recent annual municipal economic work conference for 1994. Zhang Lichang, mayor of the municipality, pointed out at the conference that state-owned firms could only become more competitive in both international and domestic markets after being restructured. According to sources from the conference, most of the well-run large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises in the city will be transformed into companies with limited liability or limited liability stock companies. Meanwhile, systems of shareholding, joint stock, contracting and leasing will be expanded in small-sized enterprises. Zhang is also encouraging well-run firms to form groups by means of merging and integration and said that in place of the single- product and single-sector operation, a diversified economy should be adopted and spread in state-owned enterprises, especially loss- making ones. According to official statistics, there are now nearly 600 large and medium-sized enterprises in Tianjin, which involve the industries of textiles, machinery, automobiles, metallurgy, electronics and automobiles.
