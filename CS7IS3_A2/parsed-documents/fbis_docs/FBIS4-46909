Considering the present desire of Russian politicians to achieve harmony on the territory of the entire Federation, it makes sense recalling the events of those revolutionary days. In 1991, the official elite of the Russian autonomies (and Doku Zavgayev, leader of Checheno-Ingushetia, was no exception) supported the USSR center in exchange for the right to sign the USSR Treaty. The national movements of the autonomies, on the other hand, supported the Russian democrats headed by the chief fighter against party privileges--Boris Yeltsin. The chairman of the Russian parliament reciprocated the support of the national leaders: it was the Russian parliament that in June 1991 sent a telegram of greetings to the National Congress of the Chechen People (NCCP), which had by that time proclaimed the sovereignty of the Chechen Republic of Nokhchi-cho and announced the republic Supreme Soviet's loss of its legitimacy. The official leadership of Checheno-Ingushetia reacted to the August putsch in the same way as the leaders of the majority of administrative and national-state units of the ex-USSR, that is, remained in session for three days. The National Congress of the Chechen People, like the informal movements in other regions, organized a demonstration in Groznyy's main square and then demanded that the "continuous-session" Supreme Soviet be dispersed. By that time, the NCCP was supported by thousands of unemployed persons (merely according to official figures, there were approximately 100,000 of these in the republic) and representatives of the "shadow economy" hoping with the help of Dudayev's group to squeeze out the clan of Supreme Soviet Chairman Doku Zavgayev from the main sources of revenue (oil) and take control of these sources themselves. Some Things From Recent History Representatives of the Russian leadership--General Aslanbek Aslakhanov, member of the RSFSR Supreme Soviet Presidium, and Inga Grebesheva, deputy chairman of the RSFSR Council of Ministers--warned Zavgayev at the emergency session of the Checheno-Ingushetia Supreme Soviet Presidium of the impermissibility of the use of force for breaking up the demonstration and the national guard of the NCCP demanding parliament's resignation. Especially since at that moment General Dudayev was declaring that "only the laws of the Russian Federation are valid on the territory of the Chechen Republic of Nokhchi-cho." The Checheno-Ingushetia Supreme Soviet resigned, and guardsmen of the NCCP broke up the parliamentary presidium following an assault on the House of Political Education on 3 September 1991. Power in Groznyy passed to the NCCP Executive Committee. Russian politicians made an attempt to take control of the situation in Groznyy. State Secretary Gennadiy Burbulis, Information Minister Mikhail Poltoranin, RSFSR Supreme Soviet Chairman Ruslan Khasbulatov, and Vice President Aleksandr Rutskoy flew to Groznyy for this purpose. But, the Russian authorities' attempt to form a provisional supreme council made up of deputies of the RSFSR Supreme Soviet and Checheno-Ingushetia and political organizations ended in failure: Hurt by the role of extra, the Congress of the Chechen Peoples Executive Committee broke up also in the early hours of 8 October the Supreme Council that had been consecrated by the supreme Russian authorities. The Russian leadership's subsequent attempts to intervene in the "Chechen revolution" led to Groznyy's isolation from Moscow, the general mobilization of the male population, and the declaration of a "holy war" against Russia. The elections of President Dzhokhar Dudayev and the parliament of the Chechen Republic were held on 27 October, and independence was proclaimed on 2 November. A decisive role in Dudayev's victory was performed by the Russian presidential edict on the imposition of a state of emergency in Checheno-Ingushetia of 8 November 1991: The opposition, which had opposed Dudayev's usurpation of power and had divided the republic, was forced to remove its demands and go underground. The cancellation of Boris Yeltsin's edict two days later could not by this time have changed anything: The arms stores had been ransacked, and the population was armed. The Chechen and Russian leaderships said scurrilous things about one another, but in January 1992 still embarked on long and absolutely fruitless negotiations on the status of Chechnya. Dzhokhar Dudayev and His Opposition The opposition to Dudayev is diverse: The political and economic interests of various opposition groups and parties are interwoven with clan inequality and territorial demarcations. The first opposition to Dudayev arose back in the "pre-revolution" times, when some of the new politicians headed by Lechi Umkhayev, unhappy with the radicalism of Chairman Dzhokhar Dudayev, who had originally been assigned the role of "wedding general" in the NCCP, walked out of the National Congress of the Chechen People. The next opposition--the Democratic Reform Movement, the Movement for a United Checheno-Ingushetia--was formed at the time of the "Chechen revolution" and consisted of parties and movements unhappy with the usurpation of power on the part of the NCCP. But the "political" opposition was small and did not constitute a threat to Dudayev's power even at that time. The territorial opposition, which has as of this time embraced the valley areas, arose primarily in Nadterechnyy Rayon, the birthplace of Doku Zavgayev, the ousted chairman of the Checheno-Ingushetia Supreme Soviet. The mayor of this rayon, Umar Avturkhanov, heads an opposition that calls itself "constructive" and lays claim to a particular role in the Russian-Chechen negotiations. The next opposition group--that of Yaraga Mamodayev, "vice premier of the first Dudayev intake"--arose in the spring of 1993. As local observers believe, the main motive for Mamodayev's move into the opposition was the loss of control of the trade in petroleum products. The rift between the prime minister (Dudayev) and vice prime minister (Mamodayev) signified the formation of a territorial opposition in Urus-Martanovskiy Rayon also, in which the leading parts are being played by representatives of the Chankhaya Clan (to which Mamodayev belongs). The political crisis in Chechnya and the growth of corruption led to the "political" opposition's demand for a limitation of Dudayev's power being supported by both parliament and the Constitutional Court. But, the lesson of neutralization of the opposition with the aid of an external threat had been well assimilated by Dudayev back in 1991: The struggle against the opposition has invariably been conducted to the accompaniment of the imposition of a state of emergency in order to defend the fatherland against Russian encroachments. Parliament, the Groznyy Municipal Assembly, and the Constitutional Court were broken up in May-June 1993, and criminal proceedings were instituted against parliament in January 1994 "for having undermined the sovereignty of the republic." But, despite everything, General Dzhokhar Dudayev's positions are quite stable in Groznyy. This is connected not only with the fragmented nature of the various opposition groups but also with the lack of a common policy in respect to the "former Russian colony" on the part of the Russian political establishment. Elections Optional? The general's enemies in Chechnya, and in the Caucasus also, explain the president's stable positions by the fact that the republic long since became a joint venture of the president of Chechnya and certain Russian generals in the sale of weapons to "flash points." And, cited as proof of this version is the geography of the general-president's unimpeded trips--Bosnia, Libya, Somalia.... And the absence of the signing of any documents enshrining the republic's new status. Negotiations between the Russian leadership and Chechnya have been under way since 1992, for that matter. Both sides have in fact deemed these negotiations to be illegal. First, Chechnya broke up parliament, accusing it of collaboration with Russia, and then Russia's deputies this March adopted decrees of the State Duma and the Federation Council "A Political Settlement of Relations of the Federal Authorities and the Authorities of the Chechen Republic," which, according to Shakhray, were essential for overcoming the legal vacuum after General Dudayev's regime had at the Fifth Congress of People's Deputies of the RSFSR been deemed illegal. The documents adopted by the Russian leadership were based on the "Shakhray concept." They provide for consultations with all political forces of Chechnya and the signing of a treaty on the mutual delegation of authority following "free elections to the organs of power of Chechnya and to the Russian Federation Federal Assembly." This wording suits that part of the Chechen opposition that calls itself "constructive" (Avturkhanov's group). But such a concept is not to the liking of another part of the opposition or Groznyy officialdom. First, because the Chechen authorities do not consider the republic a component of Russia and Sergey Filatov, leader of the Executive Office of the Russian Federation President, had already let slip in an interview with Radio Ekho Moskvy that he regarded Chechnya as a republic within the Russian Federation. Second, because the Chechen leadership is unwilling to conduct multilateral negotiations with the participation not only of the "constructive" but also other oppositions to Dudayev. Switching Off the Electricity--Telling Argument On the other hand, Groznyy officialdom has as of this time no other way but Russian-Chechen negotiations. The republic is on the verge of a social explosion: Wages at the oil fields have not been paid since last October; and, on 12 April, according to an Interfax report, power in the republic was switched off for the nonpayment of arrears--approximately R20 billion. Even the traditional deployment along the republic's borders "on the threshold of an emergency situation" was no help under these conditions. With the switching off of electricity on 12 April, the vocabulary and tone of the highest echelon of the Chechen Republic changed. In an interview with INTERFAX, Dzhokhar Dudayev agreed with the position of the current Russian establishment: "The sole way out of the current imbalance of forces in the world is a revival of the defense might of the CIS and the sovereign status of Russia." The ideologist of the "Chechen revolution" and Movladi Udugov, Chechen minister of information, cited as the most acceptable position of Russia for them that of Valeriy Fateyev, Russian deputy minister of economics, who called for recognition of the legitimacy of President Dudayev and termed the attempts to make the question of the signing of a treaty dependent on elections in Chechnya the "imperial policy syndrome." But, Valeriy Fateyev's words can hardly be considered decisive, and there is also opposition to this approach not only in Chechnya but in Russia also. But, in any event, Russia and Chechnya are condemned to seek an accord. Especially since this course has today been proclaimed official doctrine in Russia.
