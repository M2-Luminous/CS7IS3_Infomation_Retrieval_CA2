FBIS3-9720 "dreeu060__a94005" FBIS-EEU-94-060-A Document Type:Daily Report 28 Mar 1994 ANNEX Czech Republic Opposition Rejects Agreement AU2803175594 Prague CTK in English 1441 GMT 28 Mar 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU2803175594 Prague CTK Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Prague, March 28 (CTK) -- Although the government coalition has agreed on the mechanism for senatorial elections, the opposition continues to oppose the filling of the Senate, the upper house in the Czech Parliament which is defined in the Constitution but has not yet been filled. The coalition parties -- the Civic Democratic Party (ODS), the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA), the Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL), and the Christian Democratic Party (KDS) -- adopted a compromise proposal on Friday [25 March], according to which in this year's election 27 large constituencies will each elect three senators. Each electoral district will be composed of three smaller ones, so that the total number of districts in the Czech Republic will be 81. Representatives of the deputies' group of the Left Bloc (LB), the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM), and the Czech Social Democratic Party (CSSD) today told CTK they opposed the decision. LB deputies' group chairman Jaroslav Ortman said the proposal was politically aimed and legally problematic, as it was not defined in the Constitution. He said the proposal testified that the coalition parties are pressing for the establishment of the Senate primarily to safeguard their power, adding that controversies between the coalition parties were ensuing from mutual fear. The LB still holds the view that the provision providing for the establishment of the Senate should be struck from the Constitution, Ortman said. He said that the opinions of the president and the Constitutional Court were a sufficient safeguard against parliamentary decisions. The KSCM still considers Senate elections an attempt on the part of the right to preserve at least part of its power in case the distribution of forces between the right and left changes after Chamber of Deputies (lower house) elections, KSCM spokeswoman Vera Zezulkova told CTK. She said the KSCM rejected the Senate, but should a senatorial election be held it considered it more democratic to define the length of senators' terms of office through the election but not through casting of lots. The Communists consider the majority electoral system to be discrimination against opposition parties, she added. CSSD Chairman Milos Zeman considers the discussion on different variants for senatorial elections "unrealistic," since the parliament has not yet decided whether or not it would exist. Zeman told CTK that the Social Democrats had submitted a bill on the abolition of the Senate to parliament and they intended to discuss the coalition's proposal only if their bill is rejected.
