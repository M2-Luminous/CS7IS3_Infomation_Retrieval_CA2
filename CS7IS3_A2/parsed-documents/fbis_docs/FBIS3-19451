He also said that the parity of the U.S. dollar will be established in accordance with supply and demand in the money markets. Stressing that the Central Bank must not be weakened, Toruner asserted: "The Central Bank is one of Turkey's most unique establishments. It must not be weakened, even for the sake of elections." [passage omitted] Toruner described as unfounded rumors that bank deposits in foreign currency will be placed under control and revealed the amount of foreign currency reserves in the Central Bank. He said foreign currency reserves total around $4.640 billion. He also said that $3.549 billion of that amount can be used "in 15 minutes." Toruner noted that accounts in the Dersdner Bank are not included in the amount. Toruner asserted: "Any other figure that may be mentioned will be wrong. The amount of foreign currency the banks hold is enough to meet 80 percent of their commitments. They have moved to increase the amount to 100 percent. The banks have the equivalent to every deposit account in foreign currency."
