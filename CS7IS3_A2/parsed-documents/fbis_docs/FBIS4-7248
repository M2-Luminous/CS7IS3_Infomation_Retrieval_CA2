He said Foreign and Defense Ministries are having close talks with their respective Russian counterparts based on the agreement. "As part of cooperation in the military area, the two countries are currently studying the possible joint production of Russia's ultra-modern weapons," the official said. He elaborated that in joint production, Russia will furnish expertise and South Korea necessary capital and marketing. The official added, however, that such cooperation would hardly be endorsed by a formal agreement. He reasoned that Russia's defense industry is different from Korea's in technological style and therefore their weapons and knowhow in some areas cannot be transferred to South Korea as they are. "It also is almost impossible at this stage for Korea to introduce Russia's military expertise in return for the debts Russia owes to South Korea in economic cooperation credits," he said.
