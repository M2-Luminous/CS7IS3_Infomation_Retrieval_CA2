Those observers say that Pedale lacks universal democratic values. Instead, he prefers to sacrifice the national interest in exchange for the benefits he receives from Luanda's Futungo de Belas. Those observers see Pedale as a real criminal. They say that the special forces which concluded their military training yesterday were not trained to kill more South Africans or Zairians. They have been trained to attack the people and the opposition. They invited Pedale to define the type of democracy pursued by the MPLA-PT as its air force continues to kill Angolan people. Those observers also said that the MPLA-PT is waging war against the very people it claims to represent and they add that such a war can never be regarded as democratic.
