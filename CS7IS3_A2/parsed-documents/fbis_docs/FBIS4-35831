In an exclusive interview with our correspondent, he explained the outcome of these visits. Regarding the status of the Nonaligned Movement, Dr. Velayati said: The Nonaligned Movement has found its true identity. The consensus that currently exists among most of the members on important international issues can steer the movement toward true political independence. This could make the Nonaligned Movement a fulcrum for strengthening the position of Third World countries in combating the influential powers of the world. [Begin Velayati recording] Of course, these are relative matters. When we say that the movement is nonaligned, the concept is that influential powers will not be able to infiltrate. However in general, the movement should be maintained as a tribune [preceding word in English] for the countries of the Third World or countries of the South. This was the unanimous view of all the members of the movement. In fact, with countries such as South Africa joining the movement and the acceptance of new members with observer and guest status, we are witnessing a new peak for the Nonaligned Movement in the aftermath of the dissolution of the former Soviet Union. When the Soviet Union disintegrated, there was a sort of aimlessness and ambivalence in the movement. After two or three years, I can say that the movement has once again found its niche. [end recording] Referring to the other matters which were discussed at the Nonaligned Movement foreign ministers' session in Cairo in addition to important international matters and the future of the movement, Dr. Velayati said that discussions were also held on the structure of the United Nations and on human rights. He said: During this session, most of the members stressed that Colombia should host the Nonaligned Movement's next summit. Commenting on the most important decision on regional issues made at the session, Dr. Velayati said: [Begin recording] [Velayati] Regarding regional issues, extremely appropriate decisions were made in favor of Lebanon and against Israeli attacks. By consensus, Israel was denounced by 109 countries for its savage attacks on Lebanon. Some valuable decisions were approved in favor of Bosnia-Herzegovina and against the Serbs. This marks a development in the Nonaligned Movement. Approximately two and a half years ago, when we raised the issue in Indonesia, it was difficult to get even a tepid decision adopted against Belgrade. [Unidentified correspondent] Were there any discussions about the expulsion of Serbia from the movement? [Velayati] The Belgrade delegate was not even accepted at this session. In view of the fact that former Yugoslavia was one of the founding members of the Nonaligned Movement, it was a given that the Serbia-Montenegro delegate would not be considered a representative of the former Yugoslavia. [end recording] It may be recalled that on his way back to Tehran, Dr. Velayati met the Syrian President, Hafiz al-Asad and other high-level Syrian officials and conveyed a message from President Hashemi-Rafsanjani to President Hafiz al-Asad. During this visit which took place in the aftermath of the Zionist regime's attack on southern Lebanon, Dr. Velayati met Sayyid Hasan Nasrallah, the secretary general of the Lebanese Hizballah and conveyed the sympathies and renewed support of the Islamic Republic of Iran for the oppressed people of Lebanon.
