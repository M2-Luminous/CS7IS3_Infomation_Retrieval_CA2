In a communique forwarded to MTI on Monday [2 May], the MSZP announced that it will lodge a complaint against Hungarian State Television to the National Election Committee. According to the MSZP, Hungarian Television ensures publicity for unverified statements, unfounded accusations, and unmerited slander in some of its political programs. The MSZP asks the National Election Committee to take a stand on the public service media carrying out independent political campaigning during the election campaign period. It also asks the Election Committee to call on the deputy chairman of Hungarian Television to immediately take the necessary steps to ensure the cleanness of the elections and the impartiality of the public service media he leads.
