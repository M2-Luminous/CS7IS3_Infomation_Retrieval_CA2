Zimbabwe's Foreign Affairs Ministry said the embassy was being headed by a Charge d'Affaires Chitsaka Chipaziwa, who was previously in charge of the ministry's Africa and Middle East Desk. The Johannesburg consulate replaced the trade mission which was in place during the apartheid era. It would be responsible for issuing visas and travel documents and for attending to the welfare of Zimbabwean citizens in South Africa. The Cape Town consulate would, among other things, follow parliamentary sessions. Zimbabwe was one of the harshest critics of South Africa's racial policy and refused to establish full diplomatic links with its southern neighbour until after democratic elections.
