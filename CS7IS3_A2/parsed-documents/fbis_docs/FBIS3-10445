Robaina reiterated that 200 emigrants living in 17 countries will attend the meeting, scheduled for 22-24 April. While speaking at a Higher Education Ministry seminar, Robaina said not all the existing sectors will come to the meeting, and not all the topics will be covered, but regarding the organization, there will be a breadth that may surprise many. The minister reiterated the nonattendance of those he termed hysterical, when he referred to the fact that critics had laid wagers the meeting would not be held, and he added, now they say only our friends have been invited. Robaina pointed out that among the topics on the agenda, in order of importance, are matters that concern the Cuban community, and he announced the creation of a system in the ministry for dealing with the emigres. He admitted that for many years in Cuba the topic of immigration was very politicized, and said that recently, departures from the country have increased due to economic and family problems. He pointed out that the most recalcitrant of the immigration sectors have announced the collapse of the Cuban Government for 35 years and that message has wearied other residents living abroad. Referring to human rights, Robaina said that the United States is preparing a new offensive on the topic, which is debated in Geneva, and he said Cuba will not allow the entry of any UN rapporteur. Nevertheless, Robaina added that 14 Nobel Peace prize winners are invited to tour the length and breadth of the country.
