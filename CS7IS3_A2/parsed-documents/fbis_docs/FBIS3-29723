FBIS3-29723 "dreas035_d_94010" FBIS-EAS-94-035 Document Type:Daily Report 22 Feb 1994 South Korea DPRK To Explain to IAEA Position on Inspection SK2102002294 Seoul KBS-1 Radio Network in Korean 2305 GMT 20 Feb 94 SK2102002294 Seoul KBS-1 Radio Network Language: Korean Article Type:BFN [By Cha Man-sun from Vienna] [Text] The positive [kungjongjok] assessment of North Korea, made when it allowed an overall inspection [chonmyon sachal], is being hampered because the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspection team's entrance to North Korea is being delayed. IAEA Director General Hans Blix will report at the IAEA Board of Governors regular meeting, which will open at 1830 [0930 GMT] on 21 February, that although North Korea allowed an overall inspection, the agency is unable to start the North Korea inspections due to the delay in issuing visas to the inspection team members. Director General Hans Blix will stress, in particular, that in order to give an entire picture of North Korea's nuclear development, it is necessary for North Korea to provide additional information and allow special inspections [tukpyol sachal] of the two unreported facilities, and that he will continue to promote the solution to these matters as a separate issue while watching how North Korea will implement the Nuclear Safeguards Accord. After receiving the director general's report today [21 February], the IAEA Board of Governors will discuss the North Korean nuclear issue as a main agenda item on 22 or 23 February and will urge North Korea to take appropriate steps to allow the overall inspection as soon as possible. It seems that the IAEA Board of Governors will discuss, in particular, ways to help North Korea become a sincere member of the international community after smoothly solving the special inspection problem with the IAEA and ultimately return to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] since it has allowed the overall inspection. It has been learned that North Korea will send a new three-member delegation from Pyongyang to the IAEA Board of Governors meeting to explain its position on the overall and special inspection issue and the issue of its return to the NPT.
