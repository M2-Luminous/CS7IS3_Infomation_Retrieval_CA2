They are the initials of Lieutenant Brigadier Hugo de Oliveira Piva, the father of the Brazilian space program and of half a dozen domestic missile projects. His name stirred a great deal of controversy in the 1980's when he went to work for Iraq's Saddam Husayn with Brasilia's concurrence, although such concurrence was never fully assumed. Well, the man behind these three letters is back. At 67, and retired since 1987, Piva is quietly serving as an informal adviser -- although without pay -- for two of his old projects, which were resuscitated in recent months through new doses of government funds. These projects are the MAA-1 Piranha (an air-to-air missile) and the MSS 1.2 (surface-to-surface missile). Piva knows that his name, or just his initials, has been at the center of one of the worst controversies in the history of Brazilian-U.S. relations. The fact is that Uncle Sam has never forgiven him for his cooperation with Saddam Husayn, who was thrashed in 1991 during the Gulf war on an initiative of the White House. To avoid further friction, "the brigadier" -- Piva's nickname -- has not put his signature on any of these projects and, officially, he continues to work as an international dealer of a large number of products ranging from black pepper to machine tools. This is a rather sad job for someone having two doctorate degrees -- in aeronautics and applied mathematics -- from foreign universities and who had become known as "Brazil's Dr. Von Braun," in reference to German scientist Wernher von Braun, the pioneer of aerospace research in the United States. Yet, Piva's dream is to be able to come back through the front door to the field of arms manufacturing or to the Brazilian aerospace program. Speaking to ISTOE, he said that he might be able to do that during the next government "if it is favorable to resuming the materiel, aeronautics, and nuclear industries given their role in promoting development and national sovereignty." Piva said: "I view the resumption of Brazilian missile projects with satisfaction and reassurance because these projects will promote advanced technology -- which is essential for the progress of any nation -- in every area." He added: "After all, I regard these projects as my children whom I used to hold on my lap." To a certain extent, he still holds them. The Aeronautics Ministry has entrusted the development of the Piranha project -- under an $8.8 million contract -- to the Mectron Engineering Company, which is based in Sao Jose dos Campos [Sao Paulo State], without a prior bidding process in light of its being highly specialized in the field. Working for Mectron are Piva's "scientific children," that is, a handful of researchers who worked with him after graduating from the tough Aeronautical Technology Institute (ITA) and participated in the early stages of the Piranha project. They followed the brigadier to two missile factories: Orbita, a mixed company, and Avibras [Avibras Aerospace Industry, Inc.] a private company. Then, in 1989, they left for Iraq. Their mission was to develop an air-to-air missile. Those who turned to the dictionary to look up the word for piranha in Arabic -- if there is one -- made the right move. They all had a humiliating return to Brazil as the Brazilian Government was aligned with the anti-Saddam alliance and denied any responsibility concerning the work of the scientists. Piva said: "The Collor de Mello government was dominated by foreign interests and needed a scapegoat." Following the Iraqi affair, the leading members of the team of researchers created Mectron while Piva announced his retirement. In 1992, Mectron obtained a contract with the Army to complete the MSS 1.2 surface-to-surface missile, which is now being tested. Piva helped them secretly. Now, Mectron -- which has a little more than 30 employees -- is grabbing a slice of the Piranha project. Mectron Technical Director Renato Zanetta declines to comment on his ties with his mentor. According to Major Brigadier Nelson Taveira, director of the Aerospace Technical Center (CTA), "Piva has nothing to do with this project." Yet, the man whose initials are H.0 P. has given Mectron -- in addition to his expert advice -- papers, sketches, and diagrams of the Iraqi Al-Piranha. All this was done secretly because Hugo de Oliveira Piva, a retired lieutenant brigadier earning the equivalent of $1,400 monthly, continues to quietly run his company Spaceplus from an office located above a lingerie store in downtown Sao Jose. The award of contracts to Mectron, a company that is very close to Piva's heart, would then be a well-earned acknowledgement of the work of somebody who has been racking his brain to produce missiles, wouldn't it? This is what the majority of the military involved in the project believe. But insiders in the military hardware industry, who are already "hot-tempered" by nature, are even more troubled. The sharpest thrusts come from Avibras, at present the only manufacturer of rockets in the country, also located in Sao Jose. Avibras Vice President Rubens Porto contends that "our advice has not been sought for the development of the Piranha missile, but if we were consulted we would have alternative projects." Major Brigadier Jose Marcone, deputy chairman of the Brazilian Commission of Space Activities, adds that "Avibras was not interested in the Piranha." An engineer satirizes: "The truth is that Avibras was never able to recover from the killing off of scientists made by Piva there." Piva and Avibras have not been on speaking terms for a long time. In 1991, when the company entered into composition with its creditors, Piva was hired by a bank to make an estimation of the equipment offered by the company as collateral for the payment of its debts. When Piva went to the Avibras' facilities, which have very strict security control, he presented himself as "engineer Hugo de Oliveira." When Avibras managers saw their rival on the premises they got the fright of their life. From there to pressing charges of industrial espionage there was only one step. Piva smiles when talking about this incident. His smile vanishes when he recalls that in spite of being the father of the renaissance in the Brazilian missile industry, the latter is far from being the apple of his eye. His real pet answers to the name of V.L.S., satellite launching vehicle, a project that goes back to the 1970's but that was hamstrung by lack of funds. Last year, however, the project was revived because the government promised to invest $40 million in the sector in the next three years. It is estimated that the V.L.S. will be launched in 1995 carrying a satellite that will also be of Brazilian make. The only thing is that the acronym V.L.S. -- as well as the initials H.O.P. -- is tantamount to having problems with the United States because Brazil is not a signatory to the international treaty on the control of missile production. The Brazilian Government guarantees that the V.L.S. project -- which is being developed by the newly set up Bahia Space Agency since the end of January -- is a purely civilian endeavor -- green and yellow [the colors of the Brazilian flag] and not olive green. Notwithstanding this, the White House mistrusts Brazil given the fact that whoever has the know-how for launching satellites may very well launch a military missile having a range of 1,000 km. The United States is also suspicious of all the other countries that have refused to sign the aforementioned treaty, namely India, Pakistan, South Africa, and Iraq itself. U.S. military have gone as far as hinting that Piva may have used the V.L.S. technology to upgrade Iraq's Scud missiles. By using its clout, the U.S. Government did its utmost to delay the Brazilian aerospace project. Its last bid for delaying it was to ban Brazil from having access to inertial platforms, the devices that guide the rocket. Piva and Brigadier Taveira from the CTA argue that the problem has already been overcome. A CTA official notes, in a state of euphoria that "we have even managed to buy a computer for the rocket from the United Kingdom, a faithful ally of the United States." "We thought that they were not going to deliver it," he added. The most skeptical ones, however, contend that the satellite launcher still has many shortcomings and that the frequently claimed self-sufficiency is all but designed to lure possible suppliers of the necessary equipment. If the Brazilian aerospace program is already facing difficulties, one can very well imagine how it fared after Piva's signature. Even though he has many friends and disciples at the CTA of Sao Jose dos Campos, Piva tries to avoid even coming close to the center. As a friend of his notes, "his face shines when he talks about the V.L.S.." As soon as he starts working on exportation and importation, Piva's thoughts wander to what is in store for him. He does not rule out the possibility of wearing a researcher's overall. H.O.P. says he does not support any candidacy in particular, but concedes that "Lula's [Luis Inacio da Silva] PT [Workers Party] has supported the development of the military hardware industry, which is precisely what I have always defended." In conclusion, he says: "I could go back to that area if I were asked to do so by a government that follows those guidelines, whether it represented the PT or any other party."
