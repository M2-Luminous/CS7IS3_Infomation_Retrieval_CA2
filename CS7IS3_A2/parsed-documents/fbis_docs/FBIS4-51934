ASAHI SHIMBUN has conducted a survey of 47 prefectural governments and 12 municipal governments with a population of more than 500,000 each and the survey showed that almost all of the prefectural and municipal governments surveyed had experimented with an open competitive tender system with some conditions attached, and 20 prefectural and six municipal governments had already adopted, or had decided to adopt, the open competitive tender system. The survey found that many local autonomous governments had set prices for public works project at below the standard amount set by the central government and they have had the problem of a heavy workload with their offices understaffed in dealing with the open competitive tender system. In January this year, the central government decided on "the action plan for improvement in the procedures of bids and contracts for public works projects" in an attempt to shift from the conventional designated tender system to the open competitive tender system for the public works projects. The central government and its agencies intend to put the action plan into effect within this year, at the latest and the prefectural and municipal governments are in the process of reviewing their conventional designated tender systems in accordance with the action plan. According to the action plan, the standard amount for the prefectural and municipal governments to adopt the open competitive tender system for public works projects is more than 2.43 billion yen, far higher than "more than 730 million yen" for the central government. Explaining the reason for the difference, the Construction Ministry says if the standard amount is set at a low level from the beginning for the prefectural and municipal governments, it would create a heavy workload and confusion for the governments. Twenty prefectural governments, including Hokkaido, Kanakawa, Osaka, and Kumamoto, have already adopted the open competitive tender system or decided when to adopt the new tender system. Of the municipal governments, Sendai, Niigata, Kyoto, Sapporo, Kawasaki, and Fukuoka have decided to adopt the new tender system. Twenty-five other prefectural and five municipal governments, including Tokyo, Chiba, and Nagoya, are experimenting with the open competitive tender system. Of the 20 prefectural governments, 10, including Hokkaido, Osaka, and Saga, have decided to adopt the open competitive tender system for public works projects worth more than 2.43 billion yen in accordance with the action plan, with the exception of Akita Prefecture that has decided to adopt the new tender system for public works projects worth more than 2.5 billion yen. The remaining 10 prefectural governments have decided to lower the standard amount to about 0.5-1 billion yen, citing the small size of their public works projects. They have vowed to "increase the transparency of their biddings." Of six municipal governments that have already adopted the open competitive tender system or decided to adopt the new tender system, Sapporo, Yokohama, Kawasaki, and Fukuoka have decided to adopt the new tender system in accordance with the action plan, but Sendai has decided to lower the standard amount. Of 25 prefectural governments that are experimenting with the new tender system, only four -- Iwate, Fukuoka, Miyazaki, and Kagoshima -- have decided to apply the open competitive tender system to public works projects worth more than 2.43 billion yen and the remaining prefectural governments have lowered the standard amount at the experimental stage. Almost all prefectural and municipal governments pointed out the high cost of handling the new tender system when they experimented with it. In the case of the prefectural governments: "It took 60 days for them to announce biddings and hold them, and the amount is about four times that taken under the conventional designated tender system" (according to Iwate Prefecture). Osaka city says: "The cost of printing bid materials was high because a large number of construction firms participated in bids for the public works projects." Ehime Prefecture points out that "in the past, four staff spent only 15 minutes handling the designated tender system, but 14 staff members have to spend as long as one hour handling the open competitive tender system." Many prefectural governments point out: 1) the need to deal with grievances by construction companies that fail to win contracts; 2) substandard work resulting from underbidding; and, 3) the monopoly of contracts by financially powerful construction firms based in other prefectures.
