An agricultural bank official said that in the first 70 days of this year, bank savings in the rural areas increased by 6.2 billion yuan. The drastic increase in rural bank savings was attributed to the favorable development of rural industry, government measures to reduce the burden of farmers and improvement in bank services in rural Jiangsu. Last year the funds which Jiangsu's rural enterprises distributed to their employees amounted to 9.5 billion yuan. Meanwhile, the provincial government took measures to reduce the burden of the farmers, and the tendency of illegally collecting funds in rural areas was checked, so farmers are willing to deposit their surplus money in banks. Last year the agricultural bank branch in Jiangsu Province set up 1,178 computer-controlled bank savings offices all over the rural areas.
