He made the remark prior to the opening of the finance ministers meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. He said that he did not wish to see a confrontation between the United States and China. Bentsen said that if the United States cannot exert pressure on China on the issue of human rights while ensuring that there will not be a breakdown of relations, then "we have to explore other methods." He said that "viewed from the economic angle, the divorce of the United States from China will be harmful to both countries."
