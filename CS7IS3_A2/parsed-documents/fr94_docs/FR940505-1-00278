FR940505-1-00278 FR940505-1-00012 VOC 1 =The VOC emission limit specified in units of kg VOC/liter (lb VOC/gal) of coating solids as applied. (vi) Volatile Organic Compound Gas Phase Source Test Methods. The methods in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, delineated below shall be used to determine control device efficiencies. (A) 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, Methods 18, 25, 25A, or 25B, as appropriate to the conditions at the site, shall be used to determine VOC concentration. Method selection shall be based on consideration of the diversity of organic species present and their total concentration and on consideration of the potential presence of interfering gases. Except as indicated in paragraphs (a)(4)(vi)(A) (1) and (2) of this section, the test shall consist of three separate runs, each lasting a minimum of 60 min., unless the Administrator determines that process variables dictate shorter sampling times. (1) When the method is to be used to determine the efficiency of a fixed-bed carbon adsorption system with a common exhaust stack for all the individual adsorber vessels, the test shall consist of three separate runs, each coinciding with one or more complete sequences through the adsorption cycles of all the individual adsorber vessels. (2) When the method is to be used to determine the efficiency of a carbon adsorption system with individual exhaust stacks for each adsorber vessel, each adsorber vessel shall be tested individually. The test for each adsorber vessel shall consist of three separate runs. Each run shall coincide with one or more complete adsorption cycles. (B) 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, Method 1 or 1A shall be used for sample and velocity traverses. (C) 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, Method 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D shall be used for velocity and volumetric flow rates. (D) 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, Method 3, 3A, or 3B shall be used for gas analysis. (E) 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, Method 4 shall be used for stack gas moisture. (F) 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, Methods 2, 2A, 2C, 2D, 3, 3A, 3B, or 4 shall be performed, as applicable, at least twice during each test run. (G) Use of an adaptation to any of the test methods specified in paragraphs (a)(4)(vi) (A), (B), (C), (D), (E), and (F) of this section may be approved by the Administrator on a case-by-case basis. An owner or operator must submit sufficient documentation for the Administrator to find that the test methods specified in paragraphs (a)(4)(vi) (A), (B), (C), (D), (E), and (F) of this section will yield inaccurate results and that the proposed adaptation is appropriate. (vii) Leak Detection Methods for Volatile Organic Compounds. Owners or operators required by the various subparts of this regulation to carry out a leak detection monitoring program shall comply with the following requirements: (A) Leak Detection Monitoring. (1) Monitoring shall comply with 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, Method 21. (2) The detection instrument shall meet the performance criteria of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, Method 21. (3) The instrument shall be calibrated before use on each day of its use by the methods specified in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, Method 21. (4) Calibration gases shall be: (i) Zero air (less than 10 ppm of hydrocarbon in air), and (ii) A mixture of methane or n-hexane and air at a concentration of approximately, but no less than, 10,000 ppm methane or n-hexane. (5) The instrument probe shall be traversed around all potential leak interfaces as close to the interface as possible as described in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, Method 21. (B) When equipment is tested for compliance with no detectable emissions as required, the test shall comply with the following requirements: (1) The requirements of paragraphs (a)(4)(vii)(A) (1) through (5) of this section shall apply. (2) The background level shall be determined as set forth in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, Method 21. (C) Leak detection tests shall be performed consistent with: (1) ``APTI Course SI 417 Controlling Volatile Organic Compound Emissions from Leaking Process Equipment'' EPA&hyph;450/2&hyph;82&hyph;015 (which is available from the National Technical Information Services, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, Virginia 22161). (2) ``Portable Instrument User's Manual for Monitoring VOC Sources'' EPA&hyph;340/1&hyph;86&hyph;015 (which is available from the National Technical Information Services, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, Virginia 22161). (3) ``Protocols for Generating Unit-Specific Emission Estimates for Equipment Leaks of VOC and VHAP'' EPA&hyph;450/3&hyph;88&hyph;010 (which is available from the National Technical Information Services, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, Virginia 22161). (4) ``Petroleum Refinery Enforcement Manual'' EPA&hyph;340/1&hyph;80&hyph;008 (which is available from the National Technical Information Services, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, Virginia 22161). (viii) Bulk Gasoline Delivery System Test Protocol. (A) The method for determining the emissions of gasoline from a vapor recovery system are delineated in 40 CFR 60.503. (B) Other tests shall be performed consistent with: (1) ``Inspection Manual for Control of Volatile Organic Emissions from Gasoline Marketing Operations: appendix D'' EPA&hyph;340/1&hyph;80&hyph;012 (which is available from the National Technical Information Services, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, Virginia 22161).
