People in Hong Kong have increasingly attached great importance and attention to the PWC because the role it plays has a close bearing on the smooth transfer of power when China resumes exercising its sovereignty over Hong Kong, and also on how Hong Kong will carry out the policy of "one country, two systems" and enjoy a high degree of autonomy after 1997 on the basis of the Hong Kong Basic Law. People of all circles fully endorse the work the PWC has accomplished since it was established nine months ago. An organization whose establishment was authorized by the state's highest power organs, and the members of which are representative personnel in Hong Kong and China, the authority of the PWC is unquestionable. At this stage when the British have demonstrated no sincerity for cooperation, the PWC has taken up the formidable task of taking part in drawing up the blueprint for the development of Hong Kong--the "Pearl of the Orient"--after 1997. The various measures the PWC has taken following its establishment show that it is pragmatism it underscores. Ever since its establishment in July 1993, it immediately proceeded to draw up plans in five areas--administrative, economic, legal, cultural, and social and security. Later, its members travelled between Beijing and Hong Kong, meeting one or two times each month since the beginning of the year to discuss issues ranging from the convergence of Hong Kong's current political system and economic framework with the Basic Law, to issues about how to expedite communications and transportation services between Shenzhen and Hong Kong. The PWC has been proceeding with its operations in an orderly and earnest manner: It has been "screening" one by one the hundreds of regulations and statutes currently in effect in Hong Kong, based on the principle that they should be converged with the Basic Law. It has also started examining certain major issues concerning the economy and people's livelihood, and it has placed on its agenda the ways and means of stabilizing the ranks of Hong Kong's civil servants. Some people have said that while this important consultative organ has Hong Kong's future in its view, it also has taken Hong Kong's situation into consideration; and that while what it ponders upon and plans are major and imminent issues relevant to Hong Kong's final transitional period, all the issues are associated with Hong Kong residents' vital interests. Hong Kong's media can see from the region that the PWC's work is an "indication that Hong Kong's political development has henceforth stepped into a new era." To build a new "kitchen" according to the Basic Law, PWC members who have accepted this great trust have pooled the wisdom of even more people in Hong Kong while releasing their own energy. As a result of their lobbying efforts in Hong Kong, many legal experts have taken part in consultations, and the discussion of revising textbooks has started within educational circles. While the PWC has reflected the wishes of more Hong Kong people through rallying the strength of various quarters, the efforts the PWC has made have also proved its representative nature and credibility. This new-born organ is now taking root among the public. Since the end of last year, the PWC Secretariat, which is located in Peddar Street on Hong Kong island, has sent 280 letters to various social groups to solicit their views on its subcommittees' planning. Thus far, over 60 groups have replied to express their views, over 60 people of various circles have expressed their views through telephone calls, and 123 people have expressed their support for the work done by the PWC and hailed PWC members for having "stepped forward for Hong Kong's smooth transition in 1997." A retired principal has sent 12 letters consecutively to state his views, and a friend from cultural circles visited the PWC, offering to do "something concrete and practical" for the PWC. Over 10 groups, including different political organizations and nongovernment institutions, have also directly stated their views while meeting with the PWC's Hong Kong members. What they think and worry about coincide with the PWC's on-going projects, namely the convergence of laws, issues about the right of abode, as well as exit and entry after 1997, education on state and national concepts, and change of housing policies--issues ranging from macroscopic understanding to suggestions on minuscule matters -- and they have also urged people to watch out for the "moves" of the British side during the remaining few years. Although the PWC's history has been short, its role cannot be underestimated. More and more countrymen in Hong Kong have expressed confidence in it and placed great trust in it. Shouldering the expectations of the people in the country, including the people in Hong Kong, the PWC has been carrying on with its glorious mission through soliciting constructive proposals, working earnestly, and following the historical tides and the will of the people.
