He told the WESTDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG, which is published in Duesseldorf, that the temporary directive of the Federal Constitutional Court does not cover participation in combat missions outside the NATO area, even though AWACS serve only an observer function. The Karlsruhe ruling must come first, he said.
