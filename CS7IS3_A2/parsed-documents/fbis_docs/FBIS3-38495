The way the PKK attack was carried out indicated a new tactic on the part of that organization. The PKK guerrillas forced the women and children into a house and killed them with hand grenades in Ormancik. What was left behind was a few tearful people, who escaped from the attack by coincidence, and a strange odor that could be detected regardless of the sharp smell of smoke in the burning village. The enigma of the strange odor was resolved when State of Emergency Governor Unal Erkan and several experts arrived in that village. The fact that several people suffocated to death as a result of the smoke in the burning village raised significant anxiety. The truth was that the PKK used chemical weapons. The preliminary reports on the attack mentioned that chemical weapons may have been used. The final decision was to be made in light of the autopsy reports. However, the main question was the source of the PKK's chemical arms. Ascertaining that source was not difficult. The matter was clarified through the study of the "geographical anatomy" [cografi anatomi] of chemical arms. An authority vacuum has existed in northern Iraq for a long time. That is an indisputable fact. That region is controlled by the Hammer Force. Another indisputable fact is the existence of large quantities of various types of arms in northern Iraq. Many of the basic foodstuffs are sold at exorbitant prices in that region. However, arms are very cheap to buy, so much so that a dozen hand grenades may cost as much as $9 or $10. Even the chemical grenades, the type that the PKK used in its attack on Ormancik, are sold at low prices. Dumping also exists in the chemical arms market in northern Iraq. For example, the local cost of a chemical weapon, which can affect any living creature in an area of three square kilometers, is about 200,000 dinars--that is, nearly 70,000,000 Turkish lira. Four types of "gas-based" chemical arms, which are sold over the counter, are in great demand in northern Iraq. A great demand exists for the type that contain mustard gas, a toxic substance that was tested on the Kurds in Halabja in the past. They are the most expensive in the market. How can such extremely effective arms be easily acquired in that region, where no one dares to turn his back on anyone? The minority peoples and terrorist groups have greatly benefited from the authority vacuum in northern Iraq after the Gulf War. The Iraqi military forces abandoned large quantities of various types of arms, including chemical weapons, in that region. In fact, the amount of arms left in the area was enough to arm a medium-size army. Obviously, forces other than the Saddam administration in the region possess various types of arms, from light and heavy arms to chemical weapons, at the present time. Nearly all the arms the Iraqi military forces abandoned in the past are in the hands of the Kurdish leaders, most of whom we know very well. Democratic Party of Kurdistan Leader Mas'ud Barzani and Patriotic Union of Kurdistan Leader Jalal Talabani, who are among the "legal" leaders of the Kurds in northern Iraq, top the list of leading Kurdish officials who control the chemical arms in the region. Chemical arms are stored in more than 10 small and large residential areas. Zakho and Irbil are the largest and most important among them. The surrounding areas of the two towns provide an opportunity for the Kurds to store and sell their chemical arms. Depots and Sales The arms depots in Irbil are located in four areas. The largest depots are in Sheyhulla and Hasankaya Districts. The entire basement of the bus station in Irbil, which is known as the Karkuk Bus Terminal, is a chemical arms depot. Another depot is known to be in Diyana, which can be reached after three hours of driving from Irbil. The Kurds sell their chemical arms in those depots. Anyone can buy chemical arms from them, provided that he has the cash to pay it. The situation in Zakho, which is an important settlement in northern Iraq, is no different than that in Irbil. A large amount of chemical arms exist in that town. The area adjacent to the Abbasi Bridge is a well-established chemical arms depot and sales center. Meanwhile, various types of chemical arms can be purchased in Izza, which is not far from Zakho. However, the depot in Izza is smaller than those in the other areas. The Karkuk Bus Terminal in Irbil and the depot in Zakho are regarded as storage centers for chemical arms. Small chemical arms depots also exist in Hajj 'Umran and Chamchamal. Jalal Talabani is known to be the patron of the chemical arms depots in and around Irbil. He decides who should buy chemical arms and the amount to be sold. Talabani retains the profit made from the sales. The chemical arms depots in and around Zakho are under the PKK's control, that is, with the exception of those in a few small settlements. The most noticeable of them are those in Cisri Abbasi and Izza. In fact, the chemical grenades the PKK militants used against the people in Ormancik Village were acquired from those depots.
