FBIS4-53776 "dreas099_m_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-099 Daily Report 20 May 1994 Thailand Further on U.S. Allegations of Drug Dealing Further on U.S. Allegations of Drug Dealing Chuan To `Get Rid' of MP's Involved BK2005122494 Bangkok BANGKOK POST in English 20 May 94 p 1 BK2005122494 Bangkok BANGKOK POST English BFN [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai told Parliament yesterday some MPs were suspected of involvement in drug deals and he vowed to get rid of them. He said he had a list of suspected drug dealing politicians, including MPs and provincial and local politicians, but declined to reveal who or how many there were. Mr Chuan said the list was not updated and those who had been in previous governments for the past several years would know as much as he did. But the list of suspected drug dealing politicians was not provided by Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri, according to the Premier. The Premier pledged to take action against all drug dealers no matter if they were MPs or other politicians. "Don't ask who they are or how many. That's useless. We don't have any evidence to pin them down. We only have suspicions." Mr Chuan said he did not have any evidence which could lead to the arrests of any MPs and disclosure of their names would not be of any help. "It's the duty of my Government to suppress all vice and I believe no party wants to have bad MPs." But the Premier did not confirm or deny news reports that Sqn Ldr [Squadron Leader] Prasong had claimed in a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday that 17 MPs were allegedly drug dealers. Sqn Ldr Prasong dismissed the reports during his testimony before the House Committee for Parliamentary Affairs as well as during the full House meeting yesterday. The minister said he was doing the right thing for the prestige of Parliament and the country. "It's a shame on us all. If you wore a bucket to hide your face, I would wear a bucket to hide my face, too," he said referring to drug claims against MPs. Mr Chuan said Cabinet meetings were supposed to be secret but admitted it was his Government's fault some information was leaked to the press. Chat Phatthana MP Sophon Phetsawang and a few other MPs insisted the Premier tell the House whether or not Sqn Ldr Prasong had made such a claim during the weekly Cabinet meeting. The Premier said the foreign minister had shown documents provided by United States authorities through the US Embassy in Bangkok on allegations that Chat Thai MP Thanong Siriprichaphong and Chat Phatthana MP Mongkhon Chongsuthamani had been involved in drug deals. The US authorities seized Mr Thanong's home and car in California, lodged criminal charges against the Chat Thai MP for his alleged marijuana smuggling and revoked in March a visa for Mr Mongkhon, also suspected of having dealt in drugs. The foreign minister reported this to the Cabinet, Mr Chuan said. Mr Thanong was suspected to be a marijuana smuggler between 1977 and 1987, the period during which he was not a Chat Thai MP, but the information pertaining to the claims was only recently exposed to the press, according to Mr Chuan. He did not think there was any conspiracy outside Parliament which might want to sabotage the House; only some MPs who might want to discredit other MPs or tarnish the entire House. "I don't think there is any conspiracy. It's only among us. Don't blame anybody else." His comment followed several MPs' claim that drug dealing charges against the 17 MPs might have been made as part of a conspiracy outside Parliament aimed at destroying the entire House. Mr Chuan dismissed criticism that drugs claims surrounding the Opposition MPs were designed to pre-empt a no-confidence motion the Opposition had planned to launch against his Government.
