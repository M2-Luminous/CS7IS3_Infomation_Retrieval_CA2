The Amsterdam-based company is owned by the Muscovite A.V. Nenachov (age 27) and has at least "paid a considerable part of the campaign costs for the Russian parliamentary elections." This was reported in the SEGODNYA [TODAY] newspaper. The paper said that the "sub-criminal GMM," which launders illegally earned money for Russians in the West, also bought a place on the electoral list for Aleksej Soejev, Nenachov's 23-year-old adviser. The journalist Michail Leontjev did not dare reveal his sources out of fear of legal action, "or worse." For the same reasons he did not want to dwell excessively on the evidence which he says he has. One and One-Half Million Zhirinovskyi's campaign cost approximately 1.5 million guilders. The Russian media has speculated for months about who paid the money. The Iraqi leader Saddam Husayn and the ultraright German millionaire Gerhard Frey are also said to be sponsors of the popular Russian nationalist. Other rumors tell of the information services and the army. Zhirinovskiy was the big winner in the elections. In the run-up to the vote he bought a huge amount of broadcast time on television to present his extreme views. He seeks the expansion of the "Russian Empire" and wants to revive the KGB secret service. Zhirinovskiy maintains that his campaign was paid for by thousands of individual supporters. In Moscow an answer machine explains in Russian and English that the GMM company is closed. The Amsterdam office was closed "for Christmas" so that it was not possible to obtain any comments on the claims. Previously the company has said that it has been active since 1969, but the registration with the Amsterdam Chamber of Commerce dates from 29 January of this year. The share capital of the limited company, which is based in offices on the Herengracht canal, stands at 200,000 guilders. Director Nenachov is the only shareholder. `Zhirinovsky's Party Gives Criminals a Chance of Power' Amsterdam/Moscow -- Nearly every day Global Money Management (GMM) presents itself on Russian television as an international investment company. Director Nenachov says that his company -- which has placed and paid up share capital of 42,000 guilders -- has invested nearly 20 million guilders in Russia and that GMM has not taken one cent out of Russia. GMM's Netherlands head office is not registered with the STE [Share Dealing Monitoring Foundation]. The STE's spokeswoman said that the company probably does not operate on the Netherlands market. "GMM cannot provide any security-related services in the Netherlands, because it does not have a license to do so," the spokeswoman said. Warning However, the Dutch central bank (DNB)is acquainted with GMM. In a recent letter to the company, the central bank referred it to the rule that nonbanks are prohibited from taking savings from the public. "GMM is not a bank or a financial institution and therefore is not under the supervision of the central bank. But as a Netherlands limited company they are obliged to respect Netherlands law." The central bank said that at present there was no question of GMM having committed an economic crime, but the letter should be seen as a warning. Financial circles revealed that ABN AMRO [General Netherlands Bank -- Amsterdam/Rotterdam Bank] in Amsterdam had been GMM's company bank. The bank would only reveal that ABN AMRO has no (further) relationship with GMM. It is not known which financial institution is now GMM's company bank. [passage omitted].
