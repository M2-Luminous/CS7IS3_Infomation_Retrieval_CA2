"Father is in excellent health. He has a very good appetite and walks three kilometers every day -- longer sometimes," said Deng Nan today when she, as vice-minister of the State Science and Technology Commission, was on her way to solicit opinions from deputies to the National People's Congress (NPC) now in session here. When asked whether her father still likes swimming, Deng Nan said: "Father loves swimming in the sea; he never swims in a swimming pool." The senior leader is following closely the progress of the ongoing sessions of the NPC and the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, according to Deng Nan. "Father certainly knows what is going on. Every day, he reads newspapers, watches TV, and is very much concerned about domestic and international affairs," the daughter said. In response to a reporter's concern that Deng Xiaoping seemed thinner when he appeared on TV during the Spring Festival, Deng Nan said: "It's good to be thin. Haven't you heard of the Chinese saying `a thousand taels of gold cannot buy thinness in one's old age'?" Asked whether Deng Xiaoping will again spend the Spring Festival in Shanghai, Deng Nan said: "I think he will. He has also said that he will spend a Spring Festival in Hong Kong after 1997."
