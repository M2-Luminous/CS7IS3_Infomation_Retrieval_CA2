Is your only task now to fulfill those points? [Frei] My first task is to continue this process. For the first time since 1915 there is continuity in the government in Chile. This is a sign of stability and support for the previous administration. By supporting my presidential candidacy for the coalition (the coalition of government parties made up mainly of Christian Democrats and Socialists) Chileans were judging an administration. The people judge a successful administration by electing a new government from the same group. This is very important for Chile, and defines my task. That is why I have been saying that my proposal is continuity and change at the same time. Continuity because we will maintain the economic policy, with the necessary corrections to fight poverty, concentrating on political stability. [Waack] What will the changes be? [Frei] This government has a different task. The Aylwin administration replaced an authoritarian regime that had lasted 17 years. My program wants to solve the concrete problems of people. That is my emphasis. [Waack] You have been talking about modernizing the Chilean Government, and you just asked your close aides to declare their assets, which will be compared with the assets when they leave the government. Are you concerned with corruption and the ineffectiveness of the state system? [Frei] One of the main problems we have in Latin America is the gigantic state apparatus. In a modern democracy we want to further delegate decisions to the people. They should resolve their problems by themselves, while the state is opening more room and creating more opportunities. This is how the issues of honesty and administrative ability are handled. Fortunately in Chile, as a nation, we did not have generalized corruption in the public administration. But there are some signs of that evil. We are part of the world, and this is a world problem. From the first day, however, I would like to make clear signs of administrative honesty. Politics become discredited especially when the sense of ethics is lost. There are other basic values to be defended: the family's sense of public service, and the sense of our national identity. We don't want to build a society based only on consumerism. [Waack] Do you believe Chile is becoming the first South American country to no longer be considered underdeveloped? [Frei] That would be a great aspiration. We are making a great effort, but there is still a long way to go. World experience shows that the countries capable of defeating underdevelopment did so by maintaining long-term economic and social policies for more than 20 years. And this is what we are doing here in Chile. [Waack] Is Chile defeating the vicious circle of poverty and misery? [Frei] We are on the way, but we have not yet succeeded. When Aylwin was inaugurated, about 40 percent of the population lived in poverty and misery. Now the figure is about 27 percent. Continuing the policy we are carrying out, I believe we will eliminate extreme misery within six years. [Waack] Are you saying that Chile will be the first Latin American country to fully pay its social debt? [Frei] We are working on it. My government's priority is to eliminate poverty. This purpose will be clearly noticeable in the decisions I will make during the first months of my administration. The country will feel the difference. But it is not only a government task, it is the entire country's responsibility. We will invite entrepreneurs, workers, and public servants to participate. It is a national goal much more than a government objective. [Waack] Chile wants to join NAFTA. Are you concerned about Brazil's economic instability and the fact that Brazil is Latin America's largest country? [Frei] Chile is prepared to negotiate a free trade agreement with the United States and to participate in NAFTA because the country has made a very great effort to correct all its macroeconomic indicators. We should understand that if we fail to achieve Latin American integration soon, we will not be able to compete with larger world conglomerates such as the Pacific group, the European Union, or NAFTA. We, Latin Americans, must unite in order to be able to compete with these conglomerates. We must align our economies, and in this respect I think Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso's economic policies are very positive. We must converge our monetary, fiscal, customs, and ecological policies. That will permit us to advance in the integration process. [Waack] Are you thinking of some kind of understanding or concrete steps to promote this type of integration with Brazil? [Frei] I have been following Brazilian political situation, particularly Cardoso's career. I know him personally. Fernando Henrique lived in Chile for four years. He made many friends. He is a very respected political figure. This is why I care about his economic stabilization plan so much, and I wish him all the luck possible. [Waack] Did you know that Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso is considered a virtual candidate for the presidency? [Frei] I am perfectly aware of that. It would be very good if he becomes president. Fernando Henrique is a man of great vision. We could easily understand one other on a number of matters. An understanding with him would be very easy. [Waack] Many people say that the person who is truly responsible for Chile's present stability is General Augusto Pinochet. Do you agree with that? [Frei] I think we must depersonalize those aspects. The whole of society participated in the effort. It was an effort made by political parties and workers who understood what was important and relevant at certain moments. It was also an effort on the part of entrepreneurs, who trusted in the country and invested there. Last year we had the highest rate of savings and investment. The Armed Forces also participated in this effort. They understood that once a democratic government was elected they had to return to their barracks and to their constitutional role. All actors, therefore, contributed to the stability we enjoy today. [Waack] Gen. Pinochet will continue to be a very important figure in Chile, just as he has been during the past 21 years. Will you be able to ignore him? [Frei] I think... [pauses] I mean, it is not a matter of ignoring anyone. It is a matter of respecting the reality in which we are living. Our political situation is characterized by respect for the institutional system and the legal path we chose in 1989 to discuss democratic questions. We are changing the system from within. One of our tasks is to recover the president's prerogative to name the Armed Forces commander, who according to the Constitution currently in effect will stay in his post until 1977. The president must have the responsibility to appoint Armed Forces commanders, which has always been the case in Chile in the past -- just as it is established in all democratic countries in the world. This does not depend on individuals, preferences, or personal opinion. It is a matter of principle. [Waack] Is your first political goal aimed at amending the Constitution to allow you to appoint the military commanders, and change the system for the election of members of the Constitutional Court and the organization of the National Security Council? [Frei] I do not think we have different goals. The main, and most important, objective is that right from the beginning we are going to focus our attention on the peoples' real problems, that is, the crisis affecting the education and health systems. We are going to tackle the poverty problem that still affects a large percentage of our population. The people must feel that we, politicians, are concerned about their daily problems. Simultaneously there is a pending constitutional issue to be solved in Chile. It refers to the mechanism used to appoint the members of the Constitutional Court and the National Security Council (the current method favors the opposition). I do not think the current method to appoint the Constitutional Court members is democratic. I am not against a court of this type, which exists in every country. The problem is the method used to elect the Constitutional Court. The same goes for the National Security Council that was elected under the previous administration. [Waack] What about the military? [Frei] Those amendments to the Constitution will have to be made within the framework of a nationwide agreement, and not only through an agreement between the political parties and the government. We are going to negotiate in a responsible manner with the opposition, without taking into account the year 1997, which is when the mandate of the designated senators expires. We want to make these changes, and are seeking a political balance to do so. [Waack] Aren't you worried about the fact that your predecessor was unable to solve the military issue? [Frei] We can't say that President Patricio Aylwin did not solve that problem. This is, undoubtedly, a pending issue, but compared to the situation in 1989 the current situation is quite different. The Armed Forces respect the civilian power. The day after I was elected president, several authorities came to congratulate me. Among the representatives of the most varied sectors there were also the military commanders. They thus respect the elected and legally established civilian government, which, in turn, respects the professional role of the Armed Forces. [Waack] Do you feel comfortable with the idea of having to coexist with a former dictator who still feels himself the judge of national issues? [Frei] When you are elected president of the Republic you must focus your attention on the real problems that exist. Those real problems are what are important, not one's personal choices. There is a Chilean reality that must be respected. That is what is real. But in my opinion, the president of the Republic must recover his power, as in any part of the world, to appoint the military commanders. This problem does not depend on this or the other person. It is a matter of principles, and I stick to that principle. [Waack] Do you think that there are still pockets within the security forces that are out of your control, such as in the case of the Brazilian psychologist who was arrested and tortured in a Santiago police station? [Frei] I do not want to specifically refer to that case, because I did not follow nor am I aware of the legal procedures followed, but it is quite clear that it was a security problem, because she was involved with a terrorist group. A state of law prevails in Chile now. Therefore, if a person is arrested only the courts can decide whether or not that person is guilty of a crime. Neither the government nor the policy, only the courts. [Waack] Your father governed Chile 30 years ago. Have you ever felt you were his political heir? [Frei] No, definitely not. I feel very comfortable saying that. I have never in my life planned to become my father's political heir. His political heritage must be understood in the broadest sense of the word. He founded the Christian Democratic Party in Chile and, in that sense, gave us a reference framework of values and ideas which we have always followed. This is the path I am treading now, but I definitely do not feel myself to be his political heir. There are many Chileans who worked with him, belonged to his government, and can legitimately feel themselves to be his political heirs. I obviously carry his name with great pride. [Waack] Chileans seem to be fond of traditional names, of political dynasties. Doesn't this seem a paradox in a society that many consider politicized? [Frei] Well, there are many sons of presidents who never engaged in politics nor became president. There are also sons of well-known intellectuals or scientists who took other paths. I undoubtedly benefit from the great popularity my father's government enjoyed, but the people judge me for what I am doing today and not for what my father did 40 years ago. Chileans are interested in the future, and not the past. [Waack] You started your career as a politician rather late in life. Was it a personal decision, or did circumstances get you involved in politics? [Frei] As a famous Spanish poet said, men are always subject to circumstances. My decision was a personal decision. I accompanied my father during many years in campaigns, when I was young, but my decision to drop my work and engage in politics was entirely personal, and was made after my father had died. [Waack] Your election is interpreted as the end of an important generation of politicians, of those who personally experienced the 1973 military coup. Do you feel you are closing an era in Chile? [Frei] I don't think so. But there is an importance change in generation. Many of the ministers and secretaries who are going to accompany me are but 40 years of age or less. They were at school or in the university in 1973. [Waack] Will discussions regarding human rights, which have steered politics over the past two decades, also end in Chile? [Frei] Discussions regarding human rights will never end. Respect for human rights is a basic value of modern societies, and this is why it is a subject that can never be dropped. All cases of human rights violations have been brought before the courts, which is experiencing a crisis and must be reorganized, as the opposition itself admits. But the cases that are still being heard in court are still pending, that is a fact.
