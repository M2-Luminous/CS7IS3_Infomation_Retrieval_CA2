According to the RMK [Republic of Mountainous Karabakh] defense army headquarters, the Azeri units continue shelling the Karabakh defense positions in the Mardakertskiy and Agdamskiy districts. The Karabakh units have been refraining from returning the fire. RMK military reconnaissance reports significant concentration and movements of the Azeri manpower and equipment in the direction of the settlement of Agburun in the Martuninskiy district. "The RMK National Security Department has reliable information about a new offensive, being prepared against Karabakh by Azerbaijan," said Chairman of the department Kamo Abrahamyan. He reported that new army summons have started in Azerbaijan a few days ago. Men of different age groups are called up to the army. At the same time, new batches of weaponry, ammunition and food are being received from Turkey and Ukraine. This all, as well as regrouping of enemy forces at the fronts is evidence that the Azeri Government is not serious about CSCE and Russian peace projects.
