The fact is that this initiative, promoted by the current administration since December 1990 and approved by the World Bank last June, will be sent to Congress on 14 February and will be buried. That is what we gather from President-elect Jose Maria Figueres' remarks to LA NACION yesterday. He expressed surprise over the Executive Branch's decision to send the package of state reforms to the Legislative Assembly, "because everyone knows full well that I and the National Liberation Party deputies will oppose it in its current form." Figueres reiterated that his opposition to the program -- which includes loans totalling $300 million -- stems from the fact that it requires the approval of a series of laws which, in his opinion, have not been closely examined and would compromise the country. Presidency Minister Rolando Lacle announced the night before last that the PAE III would be sent to Congress. Social Democratic Deputy Federico Vargas supported Figueres' position, stating that "we are about to witness the burial of the PAE III." Despite that assertion, Social Christian Legislator Gerardo Bolanos said his faction will do everything possible to pass the reform package. President Rafael Angel Calderon hopes the same. "The PAE III is advantageous for the country," he said. Planning Minister Carlos Vargas Pagan reiterated that opinion: "What we are sending (to Congress) is what the country needs and what will allow it to become a developed nation." Javier Sandoval, assistant director of public credit at the Finance Ministry, announced that the only thing certain about the PAE III is that as of this month the country has lost $1.43 million (almost 220 million colones) which must be paid -- regardless of whether the program is approved -- by way of loan commissions to the World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank. A loan commission clause is customary in contracts with international organizations. It establishes that 60 days after signing an agreement, the debtor country must pay between 0.75 and 1.25 percent on the sums it has not received.
