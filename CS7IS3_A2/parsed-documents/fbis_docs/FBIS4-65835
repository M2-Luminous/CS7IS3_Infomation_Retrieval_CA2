They are looking to the Premier to block Euro moves aimed at bullying Britain into a single currency and greater integration. And in a glimmer of light for the Tories, the survey suggests they will lose 13 of their 32 Euro-seats on June 9, nothing like as bad as the party's worst fears. There is also a personal boost for Mr Major. Fifty-seven per cent of Conservative supporters want him to stay as Prime Minister even if the Tories are hammered. Only 38 per cent say he should go. Labour are on course next month to win 61 seats, up from 46, and the Liberal Democrats three, their first ever in Strasbourg. Voting intentions for the Euro-poll are Labour 46 per cent, Tory 27 per cent, Liberal Democrats 22 per cent and others five per cent. If there was a general election Labour would collect 48 per cent, the Tories 26 per cent, Lib-Dems 23 per cent And others four per cent. The poll, carried out by ICM [International Communications and Marketing Research] coincides with the launch of election manifestos by the three main political parties in London today. Last night Mr Major underlined how polarised they will be in the campaign, with the Tories increasingly Euro-sceptic and Labour and the Liberal Democrats pro-federal. In a letter to voters in key constituencies, he declared: "Some people say, `Does it matter who runs the European parliament?' Yes, it does and now more than ever before." He pointed out MEPs [members of the European Parliament] would have a say in choosing a successor to Commission president Jacques Delors and had new powers to make laws. "By voting Conservative you will be voting for a strong Britain in a strong Europe," said the Prime Minister. "And what will you be saying if you vote Labour or Liberal? "You will be saying you are in favour of a United States of Europe. You will want more powers to pass to Brussels." Launching the Lib-Dem manifesto, Paddy Ashdown said: "We want a Europe which provides practical opportunities or people, not grand theories for politicians. "We won't want Europe for Europe's sake. We want Europe for Britain's sake." His party's document says: "We want a European Union [EU] which is democratic, decentralised and diverse, a federal Europe that works for Britain." Worryingly for the Tories, four out of five voters say domestic politics rather than Euro issues will influence how they vote. Among Conservative voters who want a new leader 46 per cent favour Michael Heseltine, 24 per cent Kenneth Clarke, 17 per cent Michael Portillo, seven per cent Virginia Bottomley and six per cent Michael Howard. The poll suggests that a new Prime Minister could cut Labour's 22-point lead over the Tories in a general election to 14 points. Under a new Tory leader, Labour would poll 46 per cent, the Tories 32 per cent, Lib-Dems 19 per cent. The ICM survey was taken among more than 1,019 voters in 52 constituencies last week, after the death of Labour leader John Smith. Though it predicts the Conservatives holding only 19 Euro seats, it suggests they could reduce their losses if they can get their supporters out during the campain. Two-thirds of those determined to vote but still undecided, voted Tory in the 1992 general election and two-thirds of those live in Conservative-held seats. But if all the don't knows stay at home or vote Labour or Lib- Dem, the Tories could be annihilated, holding only 11 seats. Asked what would be the most important influence on how they would vote, 79 per cent said the political situation in Britain and only 14 per cent Europe. When ICM asked voters which party best represents Britain in the EU, 37 per cent said Labour, 27 per cent Conservative and 15 per cent the Liberal Democrats. Fifty-nine per cent of all voters want Mr Major replaced if there is a Tory election disaster next month. But although 52 per cent said he should regard the polls as a verdict on him as Premier, the figure was only 42 per cent among Tory supporters. Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd yesterday played down Tory divisions on Europe and promised a positive manifesto message. The twofold theme of the Conservative campaign will be Put Jobs First, highlighting opposition to the social chapter and Keep The Veto, a pledge to fight Britain's corner in Europe.
