FR940819-1-00049 FR940819-1-00011 FRA does not have data on the specific breakdown of railroad accident damage repairs, thus the proposed weightings are subject to adjustment should commenters choose to offer information that could provide the basis for refining the proposed formula. The current weightings represent the general assumption that damage repair costs, at levels at or near the threshold, are split approximately evenly between labor and materials. G. Miscellaneous Amendments Many of the proposed changes in the rule text are self-explanatory or have been elucidated in the previous portion of the preamble. This segment of the NPRM outlines a number of proposed amendments to various sections of the rule text. 1. Applicability (ยง225.3) Section 225.3 defines the applicability of the accident reporting regulations. FRA's delegated regulatory authority under 49 U.S.C. 20101 et seq. (formerly contained in the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 (the ``Act'') (45 U.S.C. 431 et seq. ) permits FRA to amend the current applicability sections of its various regulations so as to contract the populations of railroads covered by a particular set of regulations or to expand them to the full extent of that authority. FRA, as the Secretary's delegate, has had jurisdiction over all ``railroads'' since the Act was enacted. There is a very wide range of operations that could be considered tourist railroads under the broadest reading of the term ``railroad.'' Tourist railroads have written several letters to members of Congress questioning the basis for FRA's assertion of jurisdiction. Additionally, in 1992, FRA received a petition from a scenic railway requesting the need for legislative and regulatory action for new regulations tailored specifically to the tourist rail industry. In an effort to clarify the proper extent of the exercise of FRA's jurisdiction, FRA settled on several principles that will be used as current guidelines. FRA will exercise jurisdiction over all tourist operations, whether or not they operate over the general railroad system, except those that are (1) less than 24 inches in gage and/or (2) insular. To determine insularity, FRA looks at various criteria that measure the likelihood that a railroad's operations might affect a member of the public. FRA has concluded that a tourist operation is insular if its operations are limited to a separate enclave in such a way that there is no reasonable expectation that the safety of any member of the public (except a business guest, a licensee of the tourist operation or an affiliated entity, or a trespasser) would be affected by the operation. An operation is not considered insular if one or more of the following exists on its line: (a) a public highway-rail crossing that is in use; (b) an at-grade rail crossing that is in use; (c) a bridge over a public road or waters used for commercial navigation; or (d) a common corridor with a railroad, i.e., its operations are within 30 feet of those of any railroad. Thus, the mere fact that a tourist operation is not connected to the general system does not make it insular under these criteria. While these criteria tend to sort out the insular theme parks and museums, a need to do case-by-case analysis in certain close situations still exists. Therefore, FRA has concluded that part 225 will apply to non-general system, non-insular tourist operations confined to an installation that is not part of the general system ( i.e., it is a stand-alone with no freight traffic but has one or more features that preclude its being considered insular). 2. Definitions (ยง225.5) Section 225.5 lists definitions applicable to part 225. Section 225.5 would be reorganized so that definitions would appear in alphabetical order and without paragraph designations. The definitions of ``accident/incident,'' ``employee human factor,'' ``medical treatment,'' ``occupational illness,'' and ``railroad'' would be revised, and the definitions of ``day away from work,'' ``day of restricted work activity,'' ``establishment,'' ``first aid treatment,'' ``FRA representative,'' ``non-train incident,'' ``person,'' ``qualified health care professional,'' ``volunteer,'' ``work environment,'' ``worker on duty,'' and ``work related'' would be added. The definitions of ``lost workdays'' and ``restriction of work or motion'' would be deleted. a. Revised definitions. ``Accident/Incident'' as currently defined, is the term used to describe the entire list of reportable events including fatalities, injuries and illnesses, collisions, derailments, and similar accidents involving the operation of on-track equipment causing reportable damage above an established threshold as well as impacts between railroad on-track equipment and highway users at grade crossings. A ``train accident'' is reported only when reportable damages exceed the reporting threshold. In contrast, an ``incident'' is an event that results in a reportable casualty, but does not cause reportable damage above the threshold established for train accidents. In order to minimize any confusion concerning the ``accident/incident'' distinction and to bring about consistency between the FRA Guide and other rail safety regulations, FRA proposes to define ``train accident,'' ``train incident,'' and ``non-train incident'' separately. Thus, a `` train accident '' would be defined to include any collision, derailment, fire, explosion, act of God, or other event involving operation of railroad on-track equipment (standing or moving) that results in reportable damages greater than the current reporting threshold to railroad on-track equipment, signals, track, track structures, and roadbed. A `` train incident '' would be defined as an event involving the movement of on-track equipment that results in a reportable casualty but does not cause reportable damage above the threshold established for train accidents. In the definition of `` employee human factor ,'' the reference to ``cause code 506'' would be removed as obsolete and replaced by the term ``train accident cause codes pertaining to non-railroad workers.'' Additionally, the term ``employee human factor'' would be changed to ``worker human factor.'' The definition of `` medical treatment '' would be revised to include any medical care or treatment beyond ``first aid'' regardless of who provided such treatment. Medical treatment does not include diagnostic procedures, such as X-rays or drawing blood samples. In the definition of `` occupational illness ,'' the reference to ``his or her railroad employment'' would be replaced with the phrase ``worker's railroad employment.'' `` Railroad '' would be defined as it is in 49 U.S.C. 20102 (formerly contained in the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 (45 U.S.C. 431(e)). b. Proposed new definitions. A ``day away from work'' would be defined as any day subsequent to the day of the injury or diagnosis of occupational illness that a railroad worker does not report to work for reasons associated with his or her condition. A `` day of restricted work activity '' would be defined as any day that a worker is restricted (as defined below) in his or her job following the day of the injury or diagnosis of occupational illness. An `` establishment '' would be defined as a physical location where business is conducted or where services or operations are performed. `` First aid treatment '' would be defined as being limited to simple procedures used to treat minor conditions, such as abrasions, cuts, bruises, or splinters. First aid treatment is typically confined to a single treatment and does not require special skills or procedures. `` FRA representative '' would be defined to include the Associate Administrator for Safety, FRA; the Associate Administrator's delegate (including a qualified State inspector acting under part 212 of this chapter); the Chief Counsel, FRA; or the Chief Counsel's delegate. A `` non-train incident '' would be defined as an event that results in a reportable casualty, but does not involve the movement of on-track equipment nor cause reportable damage above the threshold established for train accidents. In the definition of `` person ,'' independent contractors and their employees and workers, as well as volunteers would be added to the current list of entities.
