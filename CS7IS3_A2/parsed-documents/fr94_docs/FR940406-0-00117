FR940406-0-00117 FR940406-0-00011 IV. Regulatory Impact Analysis As part of the assessment and decision making process regarding ORVR controls, EPA has prepared an in-depth Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA). This RIA is available in the public docket. The RIA assesses the environmental impact, costs, and cost effectiveness of ORVR controls, as well as other associated benefits, for the combined LDV and LDT program described above for a number of scenarios. It also includes a sensitivity analysis for several key parameters. It should be noted that the RIA was completed prior to EPA's decision to delay the requirements for LDTs and to exclude HDVs. These controls were included in the analysis and were assumed to begin in 1998. EPA expects that inclusion of these items in the analysis has no significant effect on the results and does not affect the conclusions which are based on the analysis. The major findings of the RIA for LDV and LDT ORVR controls are presented below. Before discussing these key findings, it is important to note that EPA analysis has assumed that ORVR controls will apply nationwide to all vehicle classes. However, the scenarios analyzed focus not only on the overall nationwide control program, but also on the control in the ozone NAAs. Furthermore, since Stage II controls are in place or expected in most of the ozone NAAs, the incremental impacts of ORVR controls relative to Stage II are assessed as well. A. Environmental Impact While refueling emissions control has value whenever it occurs, it is most critical during the ozone season. The five month ozone season refueling emission inventory is about 200,000 tons per year; when annualized, this value increases to approximately 475,000 tons per year. Refueling emissions vary directly with fuel use and fuel RVP/temperatures. Approximately 52 percent of refueling emissions occur in AAs and 48 percent occur in NAAs. Of this 48 percent, about 33 percent currently are, or are expected to be, subject to Stage II control equipment. The percentage of gasoline consumption in the NAAs and covered by Stage II is slightly higher (55 and 44 percent respectively) than the contribution to the refueling emission inventory, primarily due to RVP controls. The emission reductions achieved by ORVR controls depend on the in-use efficiency of the control system and the area in which the control is applied. Based on the stringency of the test procedure the full life useful life certification requirement, and the salutary effect of Inspection/Maintenance (I/M) programs and onboard diagnostics, EPA expects very high in-use efficiency from ORVR systems. In the ozone NAAs, where RVP control and basic and enhanced I/M are prevalent, EPA expects in-use efficiency of over 95 percent, with a somewhat lower value in attainment areas due to lack of RVP control and I/M. In the ozone NAAs, EPA expects in-use efficiency of approximately 97 percent. The in-use efficiency in attainment areas (which would lack RVP control and enhanced I/M) is somewhat less, and in some cases is predicted to be less than 95 percent. The Agency notes, however, that this prediction is skewed because data for the southeast U.S. indicate that average dispensed fuel temperature in that region is seven fahrenheit degrees higher than anywhere else in the country. EPA is basing its predictions on this information because it is the only available data. However, the Agency knows of no reason why dispensed fuel temperatures should be so much higher in this region. If the same range of dispensed fuel temperatures were used for the southeast region as for the southwest U.S., the in-use efficiency of properly operating systems in all areas would be predicted to average 95 percent.
