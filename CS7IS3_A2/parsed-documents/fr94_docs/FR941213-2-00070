FR941213-2-00070 FR941213-2-00045 Since both the badges and hand geometry would be necessary for access into the protected areas, the proposed system would provide for a positive verification process and the potential loss of a badge by an individual, as a result of taking the badge offsite, would not enable an unauthorized entry into protected areas. For the foregoing reasons, pursuant to 10 CFR 73.55, the NRC staff has determined that the proposed alternative measures for protection against radiological sabotage meet ``the same high assurance objective,'' and ``the general performance requirements'' of the regulation and that ``the overall level of system performance provides protection against radiological sabotage equivalent'' to that which would be provided by the regulation. IV. Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 73.5, an exemption is authorized by law, will not endanger life or property or common defense and security, and is otherwise in the public interest. Therefore, the Commission hereby grants an exemption from those requirements of 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) relating to the returning of picture badges upon exit from the protected area such that individuals not employed by the licensee, i.e., contractors, who are authorized unescorted access into the protected area, may take their picture badges offsite. Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that the granting of this exemption will not result in any significant adverse environmental impact (59 FR 62753). This exemption is effective upon issuance. Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 7th day of December 1994. For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Herbert N. Berkow, Acting Director, Division of Reactor Projects_I/II, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;30542 Filed 12&hyph;12&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7590&hyph;01&hyph;M
