True, the blow is severe both on the Left and on the Right; the emergence of a force that claims over 12 percent of votes is not to be taken lightly. Tapie and De Villiers cannot be ignored, and their presence is made all the more clangorous by the fuzziness of the policies they stand for. However, while Tapie is snapping at the heels of the PS [Socialist Party] leader [Michel Rocard], being outdistanced by the latter by less than 3 percentage points, De Villiers has only gone half the distance, as it were, covered by the leader of the RPR-UDF [Rally for the Republic-French Democratic Union] list. Therefore, the Left is becoming truly fragmented, while the Right is merely divided. As for Europe, the stands taken by the newcomers are completely opposite: Tapie is a staunch defender of federalism, while de Villiers demands nothing less than the elimination of the "pernicious" Maastricht Treaty. Should we compare their moral behavior? While the latter calls for a crusade for "values," an acknowledged component of his success, the scandals surrounding the former demonstrate that his electorate is hardly concerned with integrity: It is as though this was not an issue at all. As for the "populist" tag they have often been saddled with, it does not appear to have been taken seriously: Indeed, it hardly explains anything. Are they populists, those people who wanted to vote for the majority but who were intent on confirming their radical rejection of the Maastricht Treaty without giving their vote to [National Front leader] Le Pen, whose list stagnated? Are they populists, those who previously voted for Mitterrand or those young people who, because they can no longer identify with the PS, favor either more left-wing lists or vote for [Mr. Tapie's] "Radical Energy" list in southern regions which traditionally favored a moderate brand of Socialism? Both on the Left and the Right, there is something else which counterbalanced the "useful vote" notion which Rocard and Baudis had been betting on, in an election with no immediate or tangible political usefulness. A protest vote, no doubt, stemming from a craving for a new rhetoric, for some intensity of conviction. As far as the European framework is concerned, let us listen to Alain Juppe: "The French do not understand the integration of Europe as it stands," as well as the prime minister, starkly noting that the public is "preoccupied." Shattered What to do? And what will the two troublemakers do? The disruption is such that presidential election strategies will have to be revised or at least postponed, be it only to take the time to comprehend the new phenomena. How simple a situation it was in which Rocard used to be the obvious candidate of the Left, while right-wing candidates, certain they would beat him, only had to take the measure of their attractiveness or repulsion! The first effect of Bernard Tapie's victory was to shatter the obviousness of Rocard's candidacy. "What we need, is a Mitterrand," Tapie said. This statement had a devastating effect, intended to open up the game without it going any further. True, Rocard had favored a strategy based on alliances, first between the PS' various factions, then beyond them, in a last-ditch attempt which failed to offer anything new with respect to society, his party, or even his own presidential ambitions. His electoral rout gives further confirmation that we are confronted with an empty shell. The triumph of the energetic, dynamic, vibrant Bernard Tapie -- all characteristics not associated with Michel Rocard -- forces the PS leader into self-criticism: He lacked "boldness" in his style and his choice of objectives. Back to square one, in other words. PS leaders have now ended their silence and, without censuring Rocard, seem to tell him that politics is way too serious a matter to be left in the hands of a single man, even if this man is the agreed candidate, or an excessively elitist team. The way the Socialists are dealing with the concerns of the French population, be they unemployment or Europe, must be defined through a general debate. This is the approach favored by Jospin, for instance. We will witness a return of political tradition, the choice of the presidential candidate being deferred for the time being. This is a way of playing for time while avoiding personality issues as much as possible. Shall we witness among the Right the same recourse to the various political groups, the same recognition of their rights, either to shape a platform, to choose the presidential candidate, or to engage in a process of planning strategy? True, the political parties hardly had a say in the European campaign, their views being made subordinate, not to say being abandoned, for the sake of unity. This principle of unity, freely scorned by the talented and dissident De Villiers list, did not bring the expected results. What exactly does de Villiers mean, aside from the fact that he occupies [Interior Minister] Charles Pasqua's spot on the political spectrum or that he operates in the margins of [RPR leader] Jacques Chirac's domain, and that, like them, he does not offer a broad alternative European platform such as that recommended by [Assembly Speaker] Philippe Seguin, for instance? However, his is a force that categorically rejects the government's European policy while being part of the majority, and which demands to be heard without saying (nor knowing?) what its stipulations will be. Playing for Time Does Edouard Balladur's axiom -- "United we stand, divided we fall" -- retain all of the formal relevance it had before the election? Already, RPR Secretary General Alain Juppe, condemning Pasqua for supporting de Villiers, is wondering aloud whether it would not have been preferable to "compete with one candidate for each political family," since the single list strategy, including in a presidential election, "favors dissenting voices." This is exactly the opinion of Charles Millon, the president of the UDF caucus in the National Assembly, when he suggests that the RPR and the UDF should enter into a "contract" of conduct. Meanwhile, Chirac, who is in Bayeux today together with Balladur for a strictly Gaullist commemoration (the arrival of General de Gaulle on French soil on 14 June 1944), keeps silent. So does [former president] Giscard d'Estaing. For all of them, what matters now is playing for time.
