In this way, it will benefit both our macroeconomic management and the healthy development of the automobile industry. Li Lanqing said: In our automobile industry, the development of medium-sized cars is quite healthy and the production of heavy vehicles has no big problem either. The production of light cars has many problems. There are 125 light automobile plants in China. They are too dispersed in production, using only a small proportion of Chinese-made parts, and they are disorderly in operation, low in technological level, and poor in quality. They have taken a great deal of investment, but they have not yet been able to engage in large-scale production. Had the investment been made in a more concentrated way, we could have built some very good large automobile production bases. Li Lanqing said: Automobile industry is a pillar industry and China attaches high priority to its development. Since the departments concerned have already formulated the policy for the development of the automobile industry, we should promote its healthy development with the policy henceforth. Since imported cars are just a supplementary to Chinese-made cars, we should pay attention to import of technologies. The China Import Automobile Trade Center, as the main channel of our country's automobile import, should offer a good service. Its business policy should be one of earning small profits, not big profits. It should avoid bureaucratic ways in business operation and should create the image of an honest and reliable enterprise. The China Import Automobile Trade Center is an economic entity with a legal person's status, set up with the approval of the State Council. Its main tasks are to participate in market regulation, stabilize automobile prices, import both technology and automobiles, and promote the healthy development of automobile industry. Since its establishment in June 1993, it has handled the marketing of 14,000 automobiles which the Chinese Government bought from the United States. It has helped the government departments concerned in the sale and management of confiscated smuggled automobiles and in formulating relevant procedures for the sale and management. It also conducts legitimate bonded car import and barter trade. Vice Premier Li Lanqing affirmed its business achievements.
