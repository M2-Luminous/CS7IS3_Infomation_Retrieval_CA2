The officials said the ministry screened textbooks for fiscal 1995 to be used at senior high schools so as to reflect its view that there is room for considering compensation problems. A growing number of people, including women who say they were forced to become "comfort women," have filed a series of suits against the Japanese Government, seeking compensation for damages inflicted during the war. Many of the textbooks which mentioned the compensation issue in more detail than in the past passed the ministry's screening and will be used by students starting next fiscal year, the officials said. The ministry's move reflects the government's earlier statement that problems among states were settled legally after the war, but it "reserves the right to treat the women's claims on an individual basis," a government source said. Then Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's remarks last August that Japan waged a "war of aggression" against its Asian neighbors also seems to have had an influence in the ministry's stance on the issue, government sources said. One publisher shows a list of contents of compensation demands from war victims in South Korea, Indonesia and the Philippines, and the Japanese Government's reaction toward each of the suits. Another textbook said there could be problems in the future if individuals seeking compensation for war damages are ignored on the basis that the issue was settled after the war. One author said he was surprised that the ministry did not ask him to cut out or rewrite notes on the compensation issue in his textbook. The issues of compensation and "comfort women" are only mentioned as facts in some of the textbooks that are currently being used for fiscal 1994, which started last month.
