Is such promotion really a good idea? Don't know is the response of 23 percent of French-speakers and 24 percent of the Flemish. A perfect balance (33 percent) between the north and south of the country for those who believe it would "be a good thing for Europe." Just 19 percent of French-speakers and 24 percent of the Flemish believe this move by the prime minister "would be a bad thing for Europe." And the consequences for Belgium? Eighteen percent of French-speakers and almost twice as many Flemish believe the appointment would be good for Belgium and respectively 17 percent and 22 percent believe the contrary. How should we interpret these results? We could cheerfully assume that 18 percent of French-speakers and 33 percent of the Flemish believe that Belgium will be better defended at European level. Whereas 17 percent and 22 percent believe the opposite. We should bear in mind, however, that of the respondents who answered the two questions, 75 percent of those who said that it would be "a good thing for Belgium" believe that it would also be good for Europe. The other 25 percent see it as "a bad thing for Europe." We can assume that the latter are not committed supporters of the prime minister and that he should, in a way, "go anywhere as long as he goes." But there is another way of reading the figures. Eighteen percent of French-speakers and 33 percent of the Flemish are delighted at the prospect of Jean-Luc Dehaene's departure. Or, on the contrary, 82 percent of French-speakers will regret his departure, as will 67 percent of the Flemish. When we said he was popular.
