Morozov, Tynda: "Rails to Yakutsk"] [Text] The administration of the BAM [Baiykal-Amur Mainline] held a conference which was participated in by D. Trofimov, Minister for AYaM Affairs [Amur-Yakutsk Mainline] in the government of the Sakha Republic (Yakutia). They discussed questions of organizing the Yakutsk Department of the BAM. A new department is going to appear on the BAM. At first it will be a section between Bestuzhevo and Neryungri. Later on it will have spur tracks added to it and, of course, sections of the AYaM, in particular the Neryungri-Aldan section. Where is the department itself to be located? Without a lot of debate, the Yakutsk delegation decided in favor of Berkakit instead of the original intention to locate it in Neryungri, which already has a fairly well developed production and social infrastructure. True, economic problems of the Berkakit hub are taking on new coloration. Because of the chronic shortage of funds, the hub has yet to reach its projected size, and when the department is created, urgent tasks will arise, including construction of a communications facility, the main locomotive depot, railcar facilities, and servicing facilities at the Neryungri Passenger Station. Housing will also be needed. Finally, for two years now the Berkakit station's industrial zone has lacked a reliable source of heat--a scaffold bridge needs to be built, but there are no funds; they have all been channeled into the completion of housing. Participants stated that if we want to get a fully-fledged, effectively operating department we need to open a commercial station at Aldan, which means that a whole complex of work will have to be done on the right-of-way, in particular track work and, in addition, work on a permanent communications link, a power line and substations, not counting other infrastructure facilities. Having decided to create the Yakutsk Department of the Railroad, participants had apparently set their priorities in the organization of the work of the construction units on the right-of-way. But how are the financial problems to be solved? There were no specific answers to this question. But, first of all, Prime Minister V. Chernomyrdin has signed a decree affirming the status of the socioeconomic development program of the Sakha Republic (Yakutia), in which the construction of the AYaM is given high priority. A special account has been opened in Yakutia to accumulate funds coming in from export and import duties (Russia's share in the completion of the AYaM). Second, measures have been taken to pay off debts to the construction workers. According to present data, the debt on the Berkakit hub has been reduced from 4.8 to 2.8 billion rubles, and on the main Berkakit-Tommot section it has been liquidated altogether. Finally, the government of the Sakha Republic (Yakutia) intends to allocate 80 billion rubles this year to complete the AYaM; moreover, Switzerland and Austria will be taking part in the financing for the first time. But many problems still remain to be solved. We would like to know the amount of contributions for the development of the Berkakit hub (according to our information, they range between 18 and six [as printed] billion rubles), also when the account can be used. Summer is short in the North, and if you let it slip by, many problems will remain unsolved. This places many obligations on the clients. There are two clients, as we know. Participants in the conference once more affirmed the "division of spheres of influence" between the board of directors of the BAM project (responsible for the Berkakit hub) and the general board of the AYaM project (responsible for the main section of the road). There has not been any talk of a third client, although it is known that the Amur-Yakutsk Railroad Joint Stock Company is going to be one. As for the first two, participants in the conference decided to set up a coordination center staffed by the chief engineers of the services of the BAM administration. The center's task is to inspect construction projects regularly and issue the appropriate recommendations, which the General Board for the AYaM project pledges to carry out. It is a complex system, of course, but what can you do when the government of the Sakha Republic has decided to keep the construction of the new railroad in its own hands. It can be said that the organizational structure of the administration of the project has been decided. Optimists see this as a good sign, while pessimists are inclined to refrain from rejoicing--they know that the fairytale is finished quickly, but not the job. In the case of the AYaM, so far there is no reason to doubt the truth of that maxim.
