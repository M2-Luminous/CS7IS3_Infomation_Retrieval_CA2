In his view, this decision made by the Federation Council "has not created any new realities or complex problems." "I will work. What kind of problem can that be? Because the upper house did not endorse the presidential decree on my resignation, I remain Russia's prosecutor general and that is all there is to it. Under Article 102 of the Constitution this issue is to be decided by the upper house. I appreciate the Federation Council's respect for the Constitution and the Law. This will be the first swallow of the 'legal spring'," Kazannik said. "I would have been grateful to the Federation Council even if it had accepted my resignation," Kazannik continued. "The very fact that this issue was discussed in parliament proves that our law makers respect the law and legality. People understood that it was impossible to live in a legal vacuum." Kazannik said that "when the decision made by the Federation Council is formulated, this will be a legal act which cannot be resisted. In this way, there will be no question of Aleksey Ilyushenko staying in office as an acting prosecutor general." Kazannik recalled that he had been dismissed from the prosecutor's office on February 15 by order of an acting prosecutor general. "I understood then that the situation was awkward and did not even withdraw my job records from the prosecutor general's office," he said. "The upper house's decision changes my plans. Now I am not thinking of any political parties. I am sure that President Yeltsin and I will have good business relations in the framework of the Constitution of which he is the guarantor as head of the Russian state," Kazannik said. He emphasized that he would concentrate on fighting crime when he resumed his duties.
