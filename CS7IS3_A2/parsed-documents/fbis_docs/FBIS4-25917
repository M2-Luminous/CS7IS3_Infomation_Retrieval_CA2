The president opined that the fact that the U.S. President Bill Clinton's envoy to Sudan Melissa F. Wells did not raise issues such as terrorism and human rights during talks with Sudanese officials here was a step towards better relations between the two governments. Bashir, in an address to a regular get-together with Sudanese media leaders here, described the U.S. envoys visit as the first direct dealing between the Sudanese and U.S. Governments. He welcomed the approach, saying that the U.S. envoy came to discuss concrete issues of peace (in south Sudan) and relief measures. The U.S. presidential envoy, who arrived here on June 11, concluded a four-day visit to the country.
