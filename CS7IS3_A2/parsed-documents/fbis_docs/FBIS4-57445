The Association believes the government should take advantage of those circumstance to adjust coffee prices to a point more equitable than that existing when the world quota agreement was interrupted. Association sources reported Finance Minister Rudolf Hommes as saying that if this price holds for at least 30 days, the government would consider a new adjustment. In addition, the Cooperative of Caldas Coffee Growers has reported a drop in local reserves and that the marketing of the mid-season crop has been reduced by 500,000 arrobas compared to the same period last year.
