The leaders of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party [DLP] and the main opposition Democratic Party [DP], however, did decide to meet again Wednesday. In addition to the Uruguay Round, the Democratic Party wants to talk about invoking parliamentary rights to investigate the "three major suspicious affairs." These affairs include an opposition allegation that a large slush fund created by a construction company for a buddhist temple may have flowed into the political sector, to be used by the ruling party during the 1992 presidential campaign. The DP also wants to investigate the ongoing power struggle at the nation's largest buddhist sect, the Chogye order, and suspicions over political surveillance of the residence of former DP leader Kim Tae-chung. As for the Uruguay Round, the Democratic Party has joined with student activists and farmers at "outdoor" rallies and demonstrations protesting the government's weak-kneed negotiating tactics at the round, which led to the opening of Korea's market to rice and other foreign farm products. The opposition party has vowed to block ratification of the Uruguay Round accord unless the government renegotiates it. But sensing a lukewarm public response and drawing sharp criticism from the ruling party, the DP appeared to agree Friday to bring the Uruguay Round issue "indoors" and discuss it at the National Assembly. After Tuesday's meeting, DP Floor Leader Kim Tae-sik indicated that talks with his DLP counterpart, Rep. Yi Han-tong, had made some progress toward holding an extra session. Kim said, "I shared the opinion with Rep. Yi that the National Assembly has to play a role in resolving all national issues. When it can't, the nation is left with only one way to go -- toward a crisis." Yi also acknowledged that he had "detailed talks" with Kim, but no conclusion was reached because his party had yet to set clear policy goals on all pending issues. "But in any event, we agreed that the National Assembly should not proceed toward a dead-end," he said. Yi is expected to consult with DLP Chairman Kim Chong-pil and Secretary-General Mun Chong-su Tuesday afternoon, then rejoin the opposition floor leader Wednesday morning to resume their discussion. Yi hinted that the ruling party might go along with opposition moves to investigate pending issues, saying, "we will study their (opposition) proposals positively, depending on their attitude."
