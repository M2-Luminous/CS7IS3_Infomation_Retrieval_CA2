We were astonished when the raiders appeared at Rabbi Levinger's door with a warrant for his and his wife's arrest. The alacrity shown by the police and the security forces is very surprising. If they had incriminating evidence against the residents of Jewish Hebron, then why were they silent until now? The excuse commonly given yesterday, that the government could not arrest suspects before it outlawed the Jewish terror organizations, is unacceptable. This explanation is not only implausible, it is also fundamentally wrong. The police are entitled to arrest suspects, even without a warrant issued by the government against the Kakh and Kahana Hay activists, and if they have not done so to date, the only reason can be that they apparently did not have enough evidence to convict anyone. There is also reason to believe that even today they do not have incriminating evidence against the suspects. Therefore, there is no alternative but to view this raid as a deliberate attempt to mollify certain elements, whether among the left-wing partners of the Rabin government or elements linked to the PLO and its associates, who do not conceal their demand to run the Jews out of Hebron. It is worth recalling that at the cabinet session two days ago, Minister Ya'ir Tzaban demanded to apply the orders issued against Kakh and Kahana Hay on Rabbi Moshe Levinger since he is suspected of having carried out actions ostensibly bordering on terrorism. The prime minister, however, objected to this proposal, noting that it would not hold up before the High Court of Justice. This apparently, did not stop the police from raiding Hebron and arresting Jews, even those who have no direct or indirect links to the "Jewish terror organizations." Anyway, it is doubtful that Jewish terrorist organizations really exist. Nevertheless, even if there are suspicions to that effect, there is no room to mention them in the same breath with Hamas and the PLO, as Attorney General Mikha'el Ben-Horin did when he presented the decrees issued by the Rabin government against Kakh and Kahana Hay. The raid on the Jewish settlement in Hebron takes us back to the darkest of times. It recalls the days of the British Mandate, when British policemen would frequently arrest Jews to protect, as it were, public law and order, instead of arresting Arabs who murdered Jews. If two days ago, when the government decision was issued, people could be found to justify it, the next day, when the raid in Hebron to arrest "Jewish suspects" began, it suddenly transpired that this was a totally new direction in the government's policy which is meant to hurt Jews without first checking whether arrests without a court warrant, as is customary in democratic regimes, are necessary. Hence, we would not be overstating our case if we said that the recent steps adopted by the government jeopardize Israeli democracy. The State of Israel might become a police state. Perhaps it is only symbolical that it was the police minister who replied to the no-confidence motions in the Knesset yesterday instead of the prime minister, who by all logic should have responded to them rather than send a proxy.... To sum up, the raid in Hebron should give democracy supporters in the State of Israel cause for concern. The government should be deprived of the right to carry out "administrative arrests" of its political rivals. In a democratic state, decisions are made by the courts, even when reference is to supposedly terrorist activities.... It is about time the Rabin government understood this!
