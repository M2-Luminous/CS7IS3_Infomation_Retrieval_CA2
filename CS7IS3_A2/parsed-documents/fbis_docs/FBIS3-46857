Lacson] [Text] Jolo, Sulu -- The joint national government-Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) cease fire committee decided that MNLF gives security to the government panel during the peace talks in Timbangan, Indanan, Sulu. MNLF chairman Nur Misuari had earlier requested the town of Indanan be made the next venue of the talks by the mixed committees. The MNLF controls the town of Indanan. There are no military men seen in the town. Brig. Gen. Guillermo Ruiz, chairman of the joint national government-MNLF cease fire committee, said that the government will allow only 15 security escorts for the government panel for the duration of the talks. He said that the rest of the military forces in Mindanao will be alerted on stand-by basis. Ruiz also said that the MNLF has agreed to keep its forces at least one kilometer away from the conference site. However, he said, the MNLF will allow the members to get closer to the conference site on condition that they do not carry firearms. Meanwhile, the joint cease fire committee had also agreed in principle to hold its next meeting in Zamboanga City on 5 January next year. The meeting will finalize the ground rules and guidelines for the immediate implementation of the cease fire agreement in Mindanao. The committee will establish a cease fire monitoring station in Zamboanga City after both parties agree on the ground rules for the cease fire. A similar monitoring station will be established in 13 provinces in Mindanao.
