FBIS4-52843 "dreas094__a94016" FBIS-EAS-94-094-A Daily Report 12 Mar 1994 ANNEX Japan Transportation Policy Under Pressure To Change Transportation Policy Under Pressure To Change International Hub Airports Urged 942A0160A Tokyo SHUKAN TOYO KEIZAI in Japanese 12 Mar 94 pp 62-66--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942A0160A Tokyo SHUKAN TOYO KEIZAI Japanese CSO [By former Transportation Minister Shigeru Ito] [Text] Half a year has passed since I assumed duties as minister in charge of transportation administration and I have finally acquired a vague glimpse of a portion of my responsibilities. As is widely known, the Ministry of Transport is the largest licensing agency, handling 1,966 of the 11,000 licensing functions administered by the government. Recently, this licensing authority has suddenly become the target of criticism for its abusive nature and, in reality, is the subject of a variety of problems. "Conversion to a policy agency" is the earnest desire of the Ministry of Transport, but adequate debate has not taken place on how to implement such a change. The numerous licensing functions symbolize the significance of bureaucratic ties to industry and conversion to a policy agency involves the question of how to relax direct and specific controls over industry and convert to a system of indirect supervision. Today, the Ministry of Transport has arrived at a juncture where it must study methods of actively proposing policies and regulations from a fresh perspective with a view to promoting the internationalization and integration of Japan's transportation systems, while nurturing the growth of the recreation industry so that it is responsive to the needs of the public. However, more than just a few aspects of today's transportation administration obstruct the growth of industries over which it exercises jurisdiction. The Ministry of Transport has no future as long as it remains protective about the benefits realized by the ministry in terms of such aspects. Now is the time that specific proposals must be developed in terms of what is necessary and what is not necessary for the growth of traffic and transportation in Japan. Transportation Administration Reaches Stalemate I believe this particular weakness is common to a varying degree among other ministries and agencies, but the foundation for today's administration, formed immediately following the end of World War II, was designed primarily for addressing domestic issues and must be categorized as being weak in handling today's international issues. Transportation administration is not compatible with today's transportation industry services deployed on an international level, because government administration was designed to address issues of protection and guidance of the transportation industry in the domestic environment. And, despite the fact that vertical administrative services go beyond the framework of the past, I believe that the absence of decisions concerning ministerial and agency handling of such vast new areas has caused delays in administrative responses to new problems. Now, the question is, what are the basic issues which must be dealt with in the area of transportation administration? First, greater efficiency and economies in Japan's transportation industry must be attained by converting the current land, sea and air traffic net into a three-way system of cooperative relationships. Second, we must take positive measures responsive to the issues of providing services on an international scale and attain growth in the overall transportation system in Japan with airlines playing a key role. And, third, we must evaluate the new role to be played by tourism and recreation which serve as a basis for bringing genuine affluence into the lifestyles of Japan and the Japanese, relax regulations which pose obstacles to such change and actively implement partial alliances with other interested ministries and agencies and launch new administrative services. In this article, I would like to engage in a special discussion of the aviation issue. Construction of Regional Airports Completed The aviation issue also entails international and domestic issues. Japan lags in the handling of such issues. Specifically, it has failed to fully address the issue of planning for international hub airports. Currently, air passengers in Japan total about 135 million a year, of which 34.49 million are international passengers. It is obvious that domestic passengers are large in number, but the growth rate in international passengers is high and international routes are expanding annually. Airport administration in Japan in the past was focused primarily on construction and maintenance of domestic airports. This was because, after all, airplanes provide the best means of traveling long distances, and a strong desire was expressed for the establishment of airports in each prefecture. Airports are essential to isolated islands and remote areas. And, efforts by governors and elected politicians have resulted in the construction of airports in almost all prefectures. Prefectures without airports are currently limited to those surrounding major metropolitan areas such as Kanagawa, Saitama, Gunma, Yamanashi, Shizuoka, Mie, Gifu, Kyoto, and Shiga, because they are located near international airports in nearby urban areas. I believe we can say that domestic airports have been developed to an essential level. Currently, about 500 scheduled overseas flights are flown out of the 17 international airports located in Japan. There is no need to mention that such international flights will increase in the future. Of those international flights, 95 overseas cities are covered by flights operating in and out of Narita and 107 overseas cities are covered by flights operating in and out of Osaka and Nagoya. Currently, 63 percent of passengers destined for overseas flights depart from Narita. 60 Percent of Travelers Fly Via Seoul However, the problem is that connections between Narita and Japanese domestic airports are extremely bad. Presently, connecting flights to domestic airports out of Narita are limited to 12 daily. Because of this factor, many travelers must spend two hours lugging their heavy baggage to move to Haneda for connecting flights to their domestic destinations. This situation has caused about 60 percent of travelers going to overseas destinations from western Japan to depart via Seoul. This situation, in turn, is a reflection of the fact that, of the 17 international airports in Japan, all except Nagasaki have scheduled connecting flights with Seoul and such flights now total 49. If Seoul is used as a connecting point, transfers are simple and enable use of air transportation to overseas areas directly from an airport near one's residence. Narita is being disregarded by the Japanese public itself. Further, another crisis is approaching in the form of a national effort by South Korea to build a huge international hub airport on the outskirts of Seoul. The project envisions the construction of a major airport with a four-lane, 4,000-meter runway and 2,500-meter auxiliary runway to provide for connections between long- and short-distance international flights and domestic flights for the convenience of travelers, increase the utilization rate of aircraft, reduce costs and energy consumption, and contribute to improvement of environmental factors, thus enabling South Korea to successfully address the issue of modernization of the aviation industry. Logically, the international hub airport will be welcomed by aviation firms and passengers alike. As already mentioned in this article, in actuality, an international aviation network has been established with Western Japan via the Seoul airport. International carriers are currently engaged in fierce competition. The three Japanese airlines are unprofitable at the present time and U.S. and European firms are all facing difficulties with only a few exceptions. International airlines are desperately undertaking restructurings and reengineerings. They are taking rapid action on measures such as reductions in international routes, efficient use of aircraft, joint use of maintenance facilities, energy conservation, reduction and internationalization of flight crews, and curtailment of fringe services. Increases in international passengers or increased popularity of international flights has been accompanied by a logical welcoming of lower passenger tariffs. Recently, we have witnessed spreading acceptance of the concept that low fares are the most valuable service extended to air travelers. A common desire of airlines and international travelers is the ability to use "international hub airports." As an example, the concept would call for all U.S. airlines destined for Asia to concentrate at Seoul and for flights beyond Seoul to be handled by connecting Korean Airlines flights to airports in other Asian countries. In reverse, the concept would provide for concentration of passengers from Asian countries at Seoul, movement to a U.S. hub airport and further travel to U.S. destinations aboard domestic air carriers. Moreover, this concept is already being launched with the participation of Korean Airlines, United Airlines, and Aeroflot. The future will probably witness the implementation of a variety of programs by international air carriers. Present projections indicate that the international hub concept will improve aircraft use by 40 percent, enable a significant reduction in fares, and improve the financial performance of air carriers. Needless to say, South Korea will control the rights to use Seoul Airport and will limit its use by Japanese airlines. That will threaten the viability of Japanese airlines and may result in the situation where "passenger airlines carrying the `sun' symbol will disappear from Japanese skies." Issue of Grave Concern to Japan's Future There is little political will to build an international hub airport in Japan and, if the situation remains unchanged, Japan will deprived of a key role in international aviation. Japan faces options that will determine whether it can survive in the international aviation industry. Japan urgently needs to build an international hub airport exceeding the scale of that planned for South Korea. I say urgent because Seoul is proceeding with a plan which it intends to implement beginning in 1997. And, aside from South Korea, Beijing, Hong Kong, and Singapore are building major international airports with a view to making them hubs for Asia. This means that Japan lags behind all of these competing concepts. The issue of international airports is not restricted to a question of what should be done in the area of aviation administration. It is a major issue which will determine Japan's future. Ours is an "information age" and if Japan should be excluded from the principal international air routes, it will mean that Japan will be excluded from progress in the development of international information systems. Moreover, Asia is an economic growth region commanding the attention of the world. Lack of a hub airport will mean that the center of Asian information systems will be located in a country other than Japan. This issue is very important in terms of Japan's future. In view of the foregoing discussion, Japan's policy of emphasing regional airports is an anachronism. We have arrived at a point where Japan's Transport Ministry bureaucrats must shift course and place highest priority on the conduct of a study to determine where the aviation industry should focus on this age of internationalization. Conversion to a Bold Aviation Policy Two new issues await evaluation. First, we must embark on the construction of an international hub airport. Second, the project should be implemented with government funding. If the situation is neglected, Japan will not be able to participate in the progress occurring in terms of internationalization. Since the movement of people and the flow of information move in tandem, we must devise ways in which Japan serves as the center of people movement. The reason why airport construction fails to make progress in Japan is attributable to the very high land prices. Construction costs are also high. It is difficult to acquire existing land necessary for airports, and reclamation of tidal basins for airport construction involves development costs. Even if an airport is built, we must face noise pollution and social issues associated with concentrations of people. Further, operation of an international hub airport precludes the suspension of night flights. Further, one condition that must be satisfied relative to international hub airports is the enhancement of provisions for concentration of information systems. Accordingly, there is a need to build a major airport near principal urban centers, especially Tokyo. Recent proposals made by the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry refer to such a concept. However, Tokyo lacks surplus land that can be used for such a purpose. We can visualize futuristic concepts such as building runways in Chiba Prefecture and moving aircraft to Haneda via underwater tunnels, but in terms of infrastructure and using existing services, we should seek a viable concept in locating the airport near Haneda, Yokohama, or Kawasaki in Tokyo Bay. Residents of Tokyo, Kanagawa Prefecture, Kawasaki City, and Ota ward will probably take issue with any such location, but it is indispensable that a major international hub airport be built at an early date to provide for Japan's future. Needless to say, many issues await resolution. The air zone issue is one of them. We now face the need to readjust flight patterns in air zones around Tokyo with the U.S. Air Force and the Self-Defense Forces. However, now that the confrontation between East and West has been dissolved, this issue should be relatively easy to solve. The noise pollution issue can probably be resolved by building runways on reclaimed land located some distance from the existing shores. Recently manufactured jumbo passenger planes have engines that produce less noise, and those with noisy engines can be subject to restrictions on night flights. Access to the airport via freeways and railways in the case of Haneda or Kawasaki can be placed underground. We will be faced with the need to modify navigation routes for ships, but I believe such modifications can be minimized. Moreover, a concept linking Haneda and Kawasaki for use by international and domestic flights to provide for an integrated international hub airport would produce efficiencies that defy the imagination. Such a concept would enable Tokyo to become a base for linking the world and Asia in name and reality. Having conceptualized a hub airport, the full-scale airport should include a major four-lane runway and an auxiliary runway. The airport can be considered for use as a base for operating the information highway, to connect with new JR [Japan Railways] trunk lines leading to various parts of Japan and for development into a concept visualizing the development of a comprehensive transportation and information center. Fortunately, there is a new trunk line operations center near Haneda which should facilitate linkage of Haneda and the new trunk line. Narita can be considered for use as a major base in handling rapidly increasing local air flights and air movement of high-technology products. Needless to say, Narita was plagued with a long history of difficulties associated with its construction and the Ministry of Transport's emotional ties thereto can be understood, but if conversion of Narita to a hub airport is difficult, it would be in the best interests of the country to undergo a bold conversion of concepts and to establish a new approach. In reality, Narita is in a remote location and in this age when international travelers have increased, use of Narita as an international airport translates into a waste of time and resources of a magnitude that should not be disregarded by Japan as a nation. Major Airport as a National Project Another issue is that Japan should take up the airport issue as a national project. Under the current "Special Program for Airport Construction" system, the construction and maintenance of airports are almost entirely treated as a cost to be shouldered by airport users. The principle of user liability can be allowed. The reason is that we should not provide for special treatment of the aviation industry. However, Japan's international airport landing and take-off fees are excessively high on an international comparison basis as they reflect the high land and construction costs. The fees are becoming unbearable for air line companies, while most of the high fees are shouldered by the passengers and translate into higher fares for flights departing from Japan. Some time ago, only a segment of the population used air line services. However, if we think of today's usage running at the rate of 130 million individuals a year, I believe we should alter the current accounting system that focuses on increasing passenger fees to one which envisions the use of government funds for the construction of airports. I believe we can treat the construction of international hub airports as an exception to provide such government funding. This is an issue which should enjoy serious consideration by the government and resolution through a high-level political decisions. Reduction in Landing Fees Further, referring to landing fees, we must admit that Japan's airport landing fees are the highest in the world. In comparison to Haneda's 840,000 yen, fees at foreign airports include 150,000 yen for New York's Kennedy Airport, 40,000 yen for Los Angeles, 250,000 yen for Seoul, 520,000 yen for Frankfurt (the highest in Europe), and only 90,000 yen for London's Heathrow Airport. These conditions have imposed difficulties on the operation of Japan's airlines and are one cause for increasing costs for travelers. The take-off and landing fees for the new Kansai Airport are also high and will exceed 900,000 yen. Therefore, it is only a matter of time before international airlines, which want to abandon Japan, will, for example, leave Japan when the new international airport in South Korea is completed. The high take-off and landing fees have already become an international issue. For example, there is a strong possibility that this issue will be presented in the Japan-U.S. talks as an item of economic friction. If the center of international air routes shifts to another country, Japan will be the one to lose out. This is why we must confront the problem directly as a long-term strategic issue rather than as a matter of near-term interests. Now that internationalization has progressed to this point, Japan should devote more government funds to the operation of airports. Since the high take-off and landing fees are already pose a major cost, if adequate repayment prospects can be identified, provisional measures can be made to divert fiscal investment and loan program funds and reduce landing fees to levels used at Seoul Airport. I believe we have reached a stage where government can cover certain aviation costs with public funds or fiscal investment and loan program funds if air fares are reduced about 10 percent. At a time when licensing fees are being hiked across the board, if a policy reversal can lead to lower fares in aviation, they may have a beneficial impact on other public utility rates and inspire the initiation of widespread rate cuts. Presently, the aviation industry is most advanced in the United States. The growth of the U.S. aviation industry can be attributed to conditions which favored the growth of aviation such as the availability of spacious lands enabling the construction of airports and the spread of urban growth in numerous regions throughout the country. However, there were other reasons including the implementation of aviation administration reform through deregulation of route and fare structures in 1978. Such conditions led to aggressive management efforts to include new airlines entering the market, routes being established on an unregulated basis and cost reductions. One of the basic reasons for the effectiveness of such developments was that airports throughout the country had plenty of extra capacity. Even in Japan the construction of regional airports exclusive of international hub airports has been completed. The remaining tasks include a fundamental change in aviation policies, enhancement of the political status of aviation administration and the establishment of a new integrated aviation administration for the age of internationalization.
