Prior to this war exercise, EA-6 electronic jamming planes of the 7th U.S. Fleet based in Japan and EH-60 electronic war helicopters based in South Korea flew the skies over Yongwol, Hoengsong, Paju, and Pochon and did full electronic jamming. After this, in cooperation with formations of pursuit-assault planes and vertical take-off and landing assault planes, which had taken off from the U.S. overseas bases, fighter-bombers and assault planes of the U.S. Air Forces occupying South Korea and the puppet Air Force flew by surprise to areas, where electronic jamming was on, and frantically conducted a bombing exercise simulating a surprise strike against the northern half of the Republic. This reckless war exercise was conducted with the support of the OA-10 observation plane [kwanchukki], and approximately 350 military planes of various sorts were mobilized in the war exercise. This game of fire was conducted for military planes of the 7th U.S. Fleet and air corps of the U.S. Air Forces occupying South Korea and the puppet Air Force to improve their capability to jointly launch surprise strikes for northward aggression with the support of electronic jamming. As incited by the U.S. imperialists, the South Korean puppets frantically conducted war exercises for northward invasion in a frontline area close the DMZ. On 2 March, large-caliber artillery units which are deployed in Yulli-ri, Chorwon-up, Chorwon County of South Korea, and Hapsu-ri, Yonchon County, Kyonggi Province, fired tens of cannon balls on areas close to the DMZ. On 1 and 2 March, the armed villains of the puppet Armed Forces who are based in combat camps in Nosang-ri and Chomwon-ri of Paju County and Koang-ri of Yonchon County launched an attack in the direction of the Military Demarcation Line and frantically fired large-caliber machine guns and automatic rifles at random. On 1 March, formations of armed helicopters and transport planes of the puppet Armed Forces flew the skies over frontline areas in Yonchon, Pochon, and Hwachon and frantically conducted an exercise to provide support to ground attack units and airlift troops and equipment to frontline areas. On 2 March, tens of transport planes of the puppet Armed Forces conducted an exercise involving raids and special-purpose airlifting operations in the skies over Yanggu County, Kangwon Province, and promoted a warlike atmosphere. The tension on the Korean peninsula is further aggravated, because the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets are frantically kicking up futile war commotions against the northern half of the Republic one after another.
