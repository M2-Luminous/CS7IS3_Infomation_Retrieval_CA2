There are curious similarities between now and the years after the second world war when Russia and the West were not yet adversaries and the fate of East Europe was still unclear. The ghosts of the statesmen who failed to head off the cold war, and who then created and extended the alliance--of Bevin and Eden, of Truman and Dulles, of Eisenhower and Adenauer-- seem to hover behind today's leaders in the group photographs with which every summit, like a school reunion, begins and ends. We can imagine their expressions as far from benign for, in spite of appearances, the present NATO leaders have agreed nothing in Brussels that adds to the security of North America, of Europe, or of the states of the former Soviet Union. Of the four "achievements" associated with the meeting, three--the Partnership for Peace proposals, the agreements on strengthening the European side of the alliance and on flexible task forces, and the deal on Ukrainian nuclear weapons--were put together in advance and one, the resolution on possible air strikes in Bosnia, was cobbled together on the spot. None of the four could be described as worthless, yet there is a lack of substance, a sense that the real objective has been to avoid the issues concerned rather than to tackle them, that must give deep cause for concern. The conjunction of the Ukraine deal and the Partnership proposals is particularly ironic. Ever since the Soviet Union broke up, it has been an eminently worthwhile object of American policy to persuade all the successor states except Russia to give up their nuclear weapons. If the Ukraine deal is not upset by local extremists that has now been achieved. For President Clinton, it must have seemed like a piece of perfect political geometry--the kind that works from every angle. It would please the European members of NATO because it gets rid of a heap of nuclear weapons on the continent's doorstep. It would please Americans, because some of the weapons are still targeted on them, a fact which Clinton emphasised, even though he knows that the only conceivable targets for Ukrainian nuclear weapons are now in Russia. And it would please the Russians, because a Ukraine without nuclear weapons is likely to be more open, to put it mildly, to Russian influence than one which retains them. Yet in the light of the Partnership for Peace proposals what does that mean? In effect the two taken together consign the Ukraine, and by extension most or all states of the former Soviet Union, to a Russian bloc while not in any certain way gathering in the East Europeans to the West. This is the problem with the argument for a cautious NATO and European Union approach to the East Europeans. It ignores the fact that rightly or wrongly there already is a Russian bloc, a Russian sphere, wanted by the Russians and already conceded by the Americans, and that the question is what is in it and what is not. If NATO can only bring itself to offer the Poles, Hungarians and Czechs a vague right of future entry, we can be sure that the Baltic states, the Ukraine and Belaurus will never enter the organisation as full members. That is probably right, practical, and even proper. But it shows that there already is a line of demarcation between the states on the "Russian" side and those on the "European" side; and it underlines the fact that we have unwisely left the status of the East Europeans unclear as between the two. Neither the so-called strengthening of the West European "pillar" nor the flexibility that the proposals on joint task forces appears to offer are what they seem. The first registers the fact of American troop withdrawals and represents a success in the long French campaign to diminish American influence in Europe. That is a campaign which the French have waged for so long during years when it was impossible of achievement that now, when it perhaps can be achieved, they have long ceased to examine whether the objective is either worthwhile or realistic. Flexibility, meanwhile, simply means arrangements for European members of NATO to do things without the Americans. But the whole strength of NATO in the past was that, exemptions for France and one or two smaller members aside, it always did things together. Doing things together in fact became its main purpose. Sometimes the things were illogical or trivial or even dangerous, but that was less important than the fact that they were done. To end this often painful tradition of unanimous action is not an achievement but a defeat. Which brings us to the Balkans. Can it be that something finally, is about to be done, by NATO, working together, in Bosnia? Unhappily, the threat of air strikes which was revived in Brussels is not a policy or even part of a policy. It is the product, again, of the French determination to display leadership in Europe, and to satisfy a French public opinion which has lately become more interventionist. The British have joined in for tactical reasons. Both countries are contemplating an eventual withdrawal and a display of firmness now might make that both a little safer and a little less undignified. The chances are that the threat will make the Serbs more co-operative in both Srebrenica and Tuzla, and may also reduce the firing on Sarajevo. If not, there might even be a strike or two to produce the same effect. Such benefits are not to be sneezed at, but air strikes would only be genuinely worthwhile if they were part of a larger intervention, now an exceedingly remote possibility. NATO was never just an alliance against the Soviet Union. It represented an internationalisation of military force in the industrialised world, wrapping armed forces together in a web of common purposes, common action, and common weaponry in such a way that they could never fight one another again and in such a way that most of them, with the exception of the United States, were incapable of fighting anybody outside the alliance on their own any more. It is for these reasons that it was and is worth preserving. Such assets do not come down to us in logical ways--as an expression of European separateness, as the French would like, or as an instrument of Russian and American partnership, as Moscow perhaps thought in the days when it too spoke of NATO membership. They come down to us in the package in which they have been bundled by history. All the more reason to worry when that package, in spite of superficial successes, threatens to unravel.
