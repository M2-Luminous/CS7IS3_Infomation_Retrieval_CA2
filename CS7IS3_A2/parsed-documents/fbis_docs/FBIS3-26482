With the publication of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping in November last year -- a book imbued with the distinctive spirit of the times and glittering with shining Marxist truth -- and the "Decision on Certain Issues Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist Economic System" made by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, China's socialist construction during the new period began to have a powerful ideological weapon and a great program for action. Seizing the opportunity to accelerate reform, opening up, and development as well as finish building a socialist market economic system by the end of this century is both a great historical mission for people throughout the country and a distinctive feature of the new period. Journalism is the voice of the party and the people, and the vanguard of the times. At a time when China's socialist construction is undergoing historic and profound changes and the Chinese are confidently heading toward a new century, journalism must be in close touch with the pulse of the times, energetically promote the spirit of the times, fully reflect the development of the times, clear the way for reform and opening up, serve the socialist market economy, and praise the great achievements of the socialist modernization drive. To be in touch with the pulse of the times, journalists must persist in emancipating their minds and seek truth from facts. The drive for socialist modernization and developing a socialist market economy is an unprecedented great cause, and we cannot possibly succeed in this cause and build a new world unless we dare to probe and explore. To keep pace with this situation, journalists must emancipate their minds even further, change their mindsets, break with outmoded ways of thinking, explore ideas, broaden the vision, and come up with new ideas. Anything conducive to developing socialist productive forces, to increasing our socialist country's overall strength, and to improving the people's living standards should be publicized in a big way and reported promptly. Under the premise that journalism must uphold the party's basic line, display party spirit, and safeguard stable social development, the intensity of journalistic reform must be greater. Through reform, there should be more subject matters to report, news reporting must be more flexible and diverse, and the capacity for information must be greater so that journalism can truly guide ideological emancipation and truly become the propagator of the main theme of the times. To seek truth from facts, journalists must report fully and truthfully, and must uphold dialectics and the theory of one divides into two. While they should depict beautiful prospects in order to boost people's morale, they should also describe the formidability of reform and opening up as well as the problems of speeding up reform. While they must make great efforts to publicize the significance of building a socialist market economy, they must also remind the people that the market needs the government's scientific and rational regulation and control. Journalism will play a more significant role during the new period when journalists report comprehensively and truthfully. To be in touch with the pulse of the times, journalists must go deep into the realities of life to understand the new situation, study new issues, and report new things. The great cause of reform and opening up is an inexhaustible source for journalism, and it is journalists' noble responsibility to capture social hot points; study the new issues appearing during economic development, reform, and opening up; and promptly report the masses' great accomplishments. This being the case, journalists must be more aware of their historical missions and must be determined to work on the front of socialist construction to produce honey from the prettiest flowers [sentence as published]. Journalists must keep in mind the overall interests, make use of the typical cases and first-hand material in their hands, be good at speaking with facts, and describe things with the language of the masses. In order to go deep into the realities of life, journalists must selflessly dedicate themselves to their profession, disregard personal gain and loss, and defy hardships so their diligence will yield fruitful results and their fortitude will turn out brilliant reports. To be in touch with the pulse of the times, journalists must maintain close ties with the masses and respect their initiatives. Building socialism with Chinese characteristics is a cause which has to be accomplished together by millions of people; the interest of the masses is the basic objective of this cause, and the masses are also the source of its strength and creativity. Comrade Xiaoping stated that our starting point and the objective of all our work should be measured by "whether the people embrace and endorse it, whether the people are happy with it, and whether the people approve it." During the new period characterized by reform and opening up, journalists should do an even better job in building a bridge between the party and the government on the one hand, and the people on the other, so that the vast number of people will be informed of all ongoing construction and reform projects; so that the people will understand them, take part in them, and support them; and so that the party and government can understand the masses' aspirations even better and hear their voice more clearly. During the new year, when many new reform measures will be introduced and new construction projects will be launched, the masses need time to understand these measures and projects, and the interests of some people will be affected. This requires the press to give the masses proper guidance, promptly reflect their problems, and do a good job in protecting the masses' initiatives and bringing them into play so as to boost their morale, arouse their vitality, stabilize social order, and speed up modernization as well as the building of a socialist market economic system. To be in touch with the pulse of the times, journalism needs a contingent of highly proficient and capable journalists. The most important requirement now is to organize journalists to study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and arm journalists' minds with Comrade Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics so they will be able to handle the assignments presented to them by the new historical period and the new situation. Meanwhile, during the course of developing the socialist market economy, journalists must set even higher requirements for themselves and firmly resist the inroads of money worship, nihilism, and ultraindividualism; must reject compensatory journalism; and must seek no personal interests. However, they will be qualified journalists who will discharge their lofty responsibilities and accomplish their sacred missions.
