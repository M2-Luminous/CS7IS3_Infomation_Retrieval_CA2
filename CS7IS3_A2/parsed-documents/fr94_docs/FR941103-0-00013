FR941103-0-00013 FR941103-0-00003 (vi) The temperature was raised to 16 ○C to 26 ○C (60.8 ○F to 78.8 ○F) and the relative humidity reduced to 55 to 85 percent, for a minimum of 90 days. (vii) Finally, with the relative humidity raised to 60 to 90 percent, the temperature was lowered to 12 ○C to 22 ○C (53.6 ○F to 71.6 ○F) and maintained at that level for a minimum of 115 days, until at least 365 days after the start of the curing process; Except that: In a country where swine vesicular disease exists, the ham must be maintained at that level an additional 195 days, until at least 560 days after the start of the curing process. (4) Iberian pork shoulders. Iberian pork shoulders were processed as follows (240-day minimum curing process): (i) If the pork shoulder is received frozen, it was thawed at a room temperature of 12 ○C to 13 ○C (53.6 ○F to 55.4 ○F), with the relative humidity between 75 and 85 percent, for approximately 24 hours, until the internal temperature reached 3 ○C to 4 ○C (37.4 ○F to 39.2 ○F), at which point the blood vessels in the scapular region were massaged to remove any remaining blood. (ii) The pork shoulder was covered in salt and placed in a chamber maintained at a temperature of 0 ○C to 4 ○C (32 ○F to 39.2 ○F) with the relative humidity between 75 and 95 percent, for a period of no less than 0.65 days per kg and no more than 2 days per kg of the weight of the pork shoulder. (iii) The pork shoulder was rinsed with water and/or brushed to remove any remaining surface salt. (iv) The pork shoulder was placed in a chamber maintained at a temperature of 0 ○C to 6 ○C (32 ○F to 42.8 ○F) and a relative humidity of 70 to 95 percent for not less than 40 days and not more than 60 days. (v) The pork shoulder was placed for curing in a chamber at a temperature of 6 ○C to 16 ○C (42.8 ○F to 60.8 ○F) and a relative humidity of 60 to 80 percent for a minimum of 90 days. (vi) The temperature was raised to 16 ○C to 26 ○C (60.8 ○F to 78.8 ○F) and the relative humidity was changed to 55 to 85 percent, and those levels were maintained for a minimum of 90 days. (vii) Finally, the temperature was reduced to 12 ○C to 22 ○C (53.6 ○F to 71.6 ○F) and the relative humidity was raised to 60 to 90 percent for a minimum of 45 days, until at least 240 days after the start of the curing process. (5) Iberian pork loins. Iberian pork loins were processed as follows (130-day minimum curing process): (i) If the pork loin is received frozen, it was thawed at a room temperature maintained at 11 ○C to 12 ○C (51.8 ○F to 53.6 ○F), with the relative humidity between 70 and 80 per cent for the first 24 hours, then between 75 and 85 percent, until the loin's internal temperature reached 3 ○C to 4 ○C (37.4 ○F to 39.2 ○F), at which point the external fat, aponeurosis, and tendons were cleaned from the loin. (ii) The pork loin was covered in a pickle preparation (25&hyph;30 grams of salt for each kilogram of pork loin) and placed in a chamber where it was maintained at a relative humidity of 75 to 95 percent and a temperature of 3 ○C to 4 ○C (37.4 ○F to 39.2 ○F) for 72 hours. (iii) The pork loin was removed from the pickle preparation (25&hyph;30 grams of salt for each kilogram of pork loin), externally cleaned (brushed or rinsed), placed in an artificial casing, and fastened shut with a metal clip.
