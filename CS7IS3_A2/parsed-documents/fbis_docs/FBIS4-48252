In a statement issued at the end of the first cabinet meeting of the State Council and its cabinet, (?it called on) the United States Government, the European Community, and other countries to extend full diplomatic recognition to the Liberian Government. The government said this will strengthen the LNTG and advance the peace process. In a related development, the LNTG is calling on the leaders of warring factions and armed combatants to unconditionally surrender all their arms and other implements of war to ECOMOG. The Liberian Government's call is in consonance with its recent declaration of full authority over the entire country made at its first cabinet meeting on Friday [13 May]. The cabinet's statement has pointed out that with all components of the transitional government -- that is, the State Council, the Transitional Legislative Assembly, the Judiciary, and the ad hoc Election Commission -- fully constituted and functioning, the LNTG is now the governing authority of Liberia, effectively ending all factional claims to territory. Meanwhile, the cabinet has expressed appreciation to the leaders of parties to the Cotonou Accord for the cooperation and sense of compromise that led to the creation of the LNTG and also leaders of armed factions not signatories to the accord for their recognition of, cooperation with, and commitment to the LNTG and the peace process.
