Concerning the financial problems of Swiss companies, a solution is to be achieved before the end of the summer. Delamuraz continued his talks with the Russian leadership on Friday [13 May]. As he pointed out during a brief news conference at the Swiss Embassy, he met with a high degree of mutual trust, remarkable openness, and particularly clear concepts. His talks were never characterized by naivete or uncertainty, Delamuraz stated. He is convinced of the willingness of the Russian Government to continue the reforms. The Russian side was aware of the numerous existing problems, it wants to tackle them, and showed no signs of discouragement. On Friday Delamuraz held talks with, among others, Deputy Prime Minister Chubays, who is responsible for privatization, central bank leader Gerachenko, and Duma chairman Rybkin. During his meeting with Chubays, Delamuraz was assured that the work that has been commenced will be completed successfully. The head of the Department for Public Economy had the impression that the Russians know that important decisions still have to be made. Delamuraz inquired about the possibilities and conditions of foreign participation in the privatization and stated that Switzerland believes that access for interested foreign companies should be facilitated. The head of the economic delegation that accompanied Delamuraz to Moscow, Andres Leuenberger, stated that he has the feeling that privatization has now become irreversible. However, he does not believe that there will be a boom of Swiss investments in Russia in the near future. The specific issues that Delamuraz discussed with the Russian leadership included unsettled claims by Swiss suppliers and Yeltsin's decree which canceled a decision by the government last November and which limited the activities of Western banks to business with so-called nonresidents. A total of 83 Swiss companies have reported claims vis-a-vis the former Soviet Union that are not covered by the export risk guarantee. The unsettled sums involve a total of approximately 320 million Swiss franks. However, it can be assumed that the real claims are even higher because not all Swiss companies have contacted the Swiss Embassy in Moscow. According to Delamuraz, progress has been achieved concerning a solution to this -- old -- problem. He was assured by the Russian side that the issue will be tackled before the end of the year. A decision on the bank decree is expected by June.
