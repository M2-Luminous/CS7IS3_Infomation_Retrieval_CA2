"I am grateful that you have maintained yourselves as a nation, and thanks to Moldovan leadership we have met as a mother with her son," said Demirel. He sent the regards of the Turkish people and mentioned that Turkey will continue to cooperate with Moldova to assist all ethnic groups. "I hope that the Gagauz people will really appreciate this historical act and our common efforts." Demirel appealed to the people: "Gagauz brothers, do not confine yourselves in your own shell. By supporting Moldova's territorial integrity, for which you voted on 6 March, you acquired the support of Turkey and many countries. The Moldovan leadership offers you possibilities for development. Do not forget this and do not forget the international right that must be above all other rights. Be correct and analyze the essence of things, because dialogue and only dialogue will help you." In Demirel's opinion Gagauzians must be a bridge of friendship between Turkey and Moldova. Stepan Topal president of the self-proclaimed Gagauz Republic expressed gratitude to Presidents Snegur and Demirel for the possibility offered to Gagauzians to develop their culture traditions and for contributing to the Gagauzians national rebirth. "I am grateful to the current Moldovan leadership for its willingness to grant the `Gagauz-Eri- Gagauzia' special juridical status to Gagauzians. The fact that a representative of the Council of Europe called Moldova `a country of wisdom' proves this," said Topal. He stated that this project will be presented to the Moldovan Parliament to be confirmed. This way of settling ethnic problems could serve an example for other regions. Snegur pointed out that Chisinau officials are aware that Gagauzians have much in common with the Turkish people who support them spiritually and financially in their national rebirth. This has become possible only after Moldova declared its sovereignty said Snegur. "Gagauzian is studied now in Southern Moldova in 48 schools and Comrat university and college, it can be heard on the Moldovan Television and Radio and local television and radio stations. The current Moldovan leadership supports Gagauzians' aspirations to develop their culture and traditions. The `Gagauz-Eri-Gagauzia' project was recently finalized. It will open new prospects in this regard. Moldovan republican organs grant the districts densely inhabited by Gagauzians much empowerment." The friendship and cooperation agreement to be signed tomorrow by Moldovan and Turkish presidents, will consolidate the relations between the two countries, the development of democracy and support the rebirth of national minorities, mentioned Snegur. He mentioned that Turkey will grant Moldova credit worth $35 million to be invested in the development of the Southern Moldovan districts. Dionisie Tanasoglo, rector of Comrat University handed President Suleyman Demirel diploma of honorary doctorate. The Turkish President said that Comrat University will be the 59th university alongside 57 in Turkey and one in Middle Asia, where Turkish is studied.
