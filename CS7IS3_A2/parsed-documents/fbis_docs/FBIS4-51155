Davydov made the statement during a recent interview with this XINHUA reporter. While reviewing the past, Davydov said: Since 1992, both Russia and China have been implementing measures that encourage bilateral trade. Consequently, Sino-Russian bilateral trade value in 1992 was $5.862 billion, up 50 percent on the trade value between the former Soviet Union and China in 1991. In 1993, Sino-Russian trade continued to grow, reaching $7.679 billion, an increase of 30.9 percent over that of 1992; out of the total, Russian exports to China increased 41.4 percent, and imports from China rose 15.2 percent. He said: In 1993, China became Russia's second largest trading partner; Germany topped the list. The foreign economic relations minister frankly admitted: In the first quarter of 1994, Sino-Russian trade value has slid temporarily, down 43.5 percent over the same period of 1993. Analyzing major reasons for the declined trade value, Davydov said: Russian industrial output has been dropping; commodity prices have been rising; and transportation expenses have increased. All these factors have adversely affected the commercial organizations' enthusiasm to export. Meanwhile, fewer Russian resources for exports, higher customs duties, and governmental supervision over the export of raw and semifinished materials are other contributory factors that have led to the lower trade value. Additionally, Russian consumer markets have been relatively saturated with commodities imported from China. Minister Davydov believed: The downward trend in Sino-Russian trade is temporary, because further expanding bilateral economic cooperation suits the mutual benefit of both countries. He proposed: Bilateral trade issues that need to be resolved most urgently at present are as follows: Both countries should ensure smooth traffic on transportation routes. In accordance with changed circumstances, both countries should amend the original Sino-Russian bilateral trade agreements so that they will be compatible with the new conditions. The central banks of both countries should reach an agreement whereby some trading transactions, other than state-level trading transactions, can be settled with their own currencies. Both countries should improve policies on bilateral trade that is state-regulated. Furthermore, both countries should provide reliable information for entrepreneurs and traders in the two countries. They should also resolve debt issues remaining between them from the past. Davydov expressed his belief: Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin's upcoming visit to China will facilitate Sino-Russian economic and trade cooperation to develop in a healthy and stable manner.
