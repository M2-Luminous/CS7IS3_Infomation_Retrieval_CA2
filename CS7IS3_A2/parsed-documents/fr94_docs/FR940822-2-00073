(i) For purposes of this exemption, the time as of which any transaction, acquisition, or holding occurs is the date upon which the transaction is entered into, the acquisition is made or the holding commences. In addition, in the case of a transaction that is continuing, the transaction shall be deemed to occur until it is terminated. If any transaction is entered into, or acquisition made, on or after January 1, 1975, or any renewal that requires the consent of the insurance company occurs on or after January 1, 1975, and the requirements of this exemption are satisfied at the time the transaction is entered into or renewed, respectively, or at the time the acquisition is made, the requirements will continue to be satisfied thereafter with respect to the transaction or acquisition and the exemption shall apply thereafter to the continued holding of the securities or property so acquired. This exemption also applies to any transaction or acquisition entered into or renewed, or holding commencing prior to January 1, 1975, if either the requirements of this exemption would have been satisfied on the date the transaction was entered into or acquisition was made (or on which the holding commenced), or the requirements would have been satisfied on January 1, 1954 if the transaction had been entered into, the acquisition was made, or the holding had commenced, on January 1, 1975. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this exemption shall cease to apply to a transction or holding exempt by virtue of section I(a) or section I(b) at such time as the interest of the plan in the insurance company general account exceeds the percentage interest limitation contained in section I(a), unless no portion of such excess results from an increase in the assets allocated to the insurance company general account by the plan. For this purpose, assets allocated do not include the reinvestment of general account earnings. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as exempting a transaction entered into by an insurance company general account which becomes a transaction described in section 406 of the Act or section 4975 of the Code while the transaction is continuing, unless the conditions of the exemption were met either at the time the transaction was entered into or at the time the transaction would have become prohibited but for this exemption. (j) The term ``reserves'' has the same meaning as the term ``life insurance reserves'' as described in section 816(b) of the Code. Section VI_Effective date. If granted, the exemption would be effective January 1, 1975. Signed at Washington, DC, this 17th day of August, 1994. Ivan L. Strasfeld, Director, Office of Exemption Determinations, Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration, U.S. Department of Labor.
