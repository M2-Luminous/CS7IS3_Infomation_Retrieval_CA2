He said that the U.N. Security Council was making a great error and bringing the two communities together by a superficial agreement would lead to an `inevitable disaster.' He was welcoming a delegation of 30 journalists in his office at the TRNC capital. He recalled that Greek Cypriot leader Glavkos Kliridhis, in his speeches to the world, spoke as if they were the sole and legal government of Cyprus. `This shows that we are just losing time,' Denktas said. `We have arrived at a turning point and we are obliged to make an evaluation of the situation, together with Turkey,' he said. Denktas also recalled that former Cyprus envoy of the U.N. secretary-general, Hugo Gobi had also said that if the two communities are forced to come together under a federation, Cyprus would to be another Bosnia-Herzegovina. `The Security Council is trying to bring together, by superficial means, the two communities, on an island which has been in peace for 20 years,' he said.
