The government has now adopted the goal of simplifying procedures. The steps it has taken to reform the economy have helped to reaffirm the government's policy of encouraging the private sector, with investment now registering growth of 15 percent. Although figures show that nearly 60 percent of the total volume of investments in Egypt were made by Egyptians, and that they own 853 projects, of which 229 are in the free zones, providing 6.5 billion [Egyptian] pounds, there is $70 billion in investments from Egyptian citizens abroad. In order to attract more assets to assist in the country's development, the second conference of Egyptian businessmen abroad has been held in Cairo, presided over by Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi. It was attended by 150 expatriate Egyptian businessmen residing in Europe, America, and the Arab countries. What are the views of these Egyptians, absent for long years, on the investment climate? What are their thoughts about further encouragement of participation in development projects? At the outset, Dr. Mahmud Wahbah, Chairman of the Board of the Societies of Egyptian Businessmen Abroad, asserted that the investment climate in Egypt was excellent, and that "we are one of the world's five most investment-attractive countries, but we lack clarity of vision, in the sense of not setting clear and specific goals for the type and volume of investment at a given time, then setting out to achieve them. And there is another negative point: the absence, or nonexistence, of coordination among ministries in the area of investment. But I emphasize that evolution towards betterment has been a major characteristic in recent years, since the first conference of Egyptian businessmen living in America was held in Cairo three years ago. The proof of that is the establishment of 30 projects for the production of textile and fabrics, wood, leather, computers, television screens, eyeglasses, and photocopiers. These were all funded in full by a group of Egyptians living in America. We also joined up with officials to prepare a financial market law, a financial leasing law, freeing cotton and selling cotton stocks in foreign markets, in cooperation with the New York Cotton Exchange, which is the world's only specialized market for dealing in cotton, both buying and selling." Mechanic for reforming companies: "Due to our confidence in the future of the Egyptian economy, I will take part, with a group of Egyptian investors in America, in buying some of the business sector firms offered for sale, for restructuring. We are, in America, specializing in buying faltering companies, then rebuilding their economies, and putting them back on the road to success and profit. I am called a `mechanic for companies' because I recently bought 10 failing companies in various industrializing sectors and returned them to profitability." "For Egypt's Sake" Businesswoman Dr. Zaynab Karam, owner of a medical instrument and equipment export company in England, who has been outside the country for 15 years, said that she was participating for the first time in an investment conference, and that she was attending out of love for Egypt, and to see what projects could be established to serve the citizens of the nation. "They are people with integrity among whom I refuse to believe there are those who would bear arms against one another or be deceived into joining terrorist groups that damage Egypt's reputation. I am confident that the terrorist events we are now seeing are only fleeting crimes and will stop sooner or later, even if they do affect the feelings of some Egyptians abroad; but they do not in the least affect our determination to work and invest in our country in order to raise the standard of living of Egyptian citizens. I call for a greater media effort inside and outside Egypt to explain the advantages and guarantees granted to investors, both Egyptian and foreign, and to present the success that investment companies have achieved in the free zones and inside the country." Evolution of the Financial Market Dr. Wahid al-Mantawi, Egyptian oil expert in the United Arab Emirates, says that he and a group of Egyptians working in the UAE [United Arab Emirates] established in 1987, "a holding company for investing in Egypt. Capitalized at 20 million pounds, in the early years of the open-door economic policy it faced various bureaucratic and routine problems, which we are aware can happen in any country in the world. But we overcame the problems and the company achieved a general success in just a year, with actual investments in Egypt of 40 million pounds." Turning to his suggestions for encouraging investments, Dr. al-Mantawi says that the stock market should be further developed and activated, "as a stock market is a key instrument for attracting capital. On this front, I seek the granting all exemptions for stock investment returns that are granted to other deposit facilities." "Investment Promotion" Needed Dr. Murad al-Damasi, an Egyptian businessman resident in Ireland for more than 20 years, has this view of a means for attracting the deposits of Egyptians working abroad: "Why doesn't the government facilitate the purchase of desert land by investors, and grant incentives to reclaim and farm it? If that were the case, Egyptians abroad would be able to bring in advanced technology and provide a high level of expertise, which would supply agricultural products to local markets, plus exports. It would bring in national economic revenue, in addition to offering job opportunities to citizens. "No one denies that the government has recently offered many facilities and incentives to encourage investment, espcially with regard to small investors. But we still say that so far Egypt has not worked hard enough to promote its available investment opportunities abroad and offer each project's statements." "The Problem Is Management" Shakir al-Khayat, an Egyptian businessman living in America, and one of the major investors in 6 October City, says that: "We have many relative privileges for making great investments in Egypt. We can compete with many countries of the world for which investment has become very important. The only problem, in my view, is management; and then management again. It must be developed. Training centers should be set up to graduate technical and specialized workers. I'm not saying this in a void, but based on my practical experience setting up a factory to produce photocopiers and typewriters." Businessman Musa Ahmad Abu-Jabal says, "We have great confidence in the Egyptian economy. It has all the elements needed for global launch, especially the ability and qualifications of Egyptian workers to work with advanced technology. We have come to Egypt with open hearts and minds, hoping to take part in achieving a better economic future. The global changes and political events in the Middle East region, after the comprehensive peace, impose a new regional role on Egypt. This means that we must all prepare ourselves, as Egyptians, to carry out this role at home and abroad." More Facilitation Measures In the end, AL-AKHBAR met with Dr. Muhi-al-Din al-Gharib, president of the executive council of the Investment Commission for promoting and attracting Egyptian businessmen residing abroad, who have been successful in various investment areas throughout the world. He said, "We welcome Egyptian businessmen residing abroad. We expect much of them, because we know that Egypt can be built only by its own people. We want to convince every Egyptian investor to invest in his own country; the success of his project is the greatest gain, and the best advertisement to attract foreign company owners and investors to establish more projects in Egypt." Dr. al-Gharib adds that a number of steps are now being taken to broaden investment horizons in the near future. Some of these are the establishment a number of new industrial zones in various governorates in which projects would enjoy tax exemptions for 10 years. Investments in them would be limited to small and medium-sized, nonpolluting projects. The amount of credit earmarked for the expansion of the vocational training programs will be increased. Training centers at production sites will also be provided. The government welcomes investment in the areas of manufacturing investment devices, transport and passenger vehicles, and on modern technology projects in the electronics, computer, and systems and programming areas. The government is also encouraging investors to go into projects involving the reclamation and cultivation of large expanses of desert land, through leasing. Long-term leasing, of up to 50 years, would be permitted, and land can be offered now in several regions of Egypt. The Investment Commission has also completed a regulation for the inner work system of the free zones in order to simplify measures. It will come into effect in the middle of this year.
