The suspicions were directed at the United States and despite Washington's denials, the US was perceived as preparing to exploit the occasion to exert pressure on various countries, including Thailand, to open their financial services markets. ASEAN delegates therefore resisted anything that might be construed as commitments. APEC finance ministers' meetings should not be "institutionalised" and the document issued at the end of Saturday's meeting should be a "chairman's statement", not a "joint declaration". In the end, no binding commitments emerged but even Malaysia's finance minister and deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim was reported as saying the meeting was a success. In several respects, the Honolulu finance ministers' meeting was a repeat of last November's informal APEC summit in Seattle when US President Bill Clinton (with the help of a media circles totalling 2,000) charmed away all the doubts of ASEAN and other Asian countries. This time it was US Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen's turn. Mr Clinton, in checked shirt and leather jacket, had brought bright sunshine to a traditionally rainy Seattle autumn. Similarly in Hawaii, Mr Bentsen, in his red-mauve shirt and deep yellow slacks, succeeded in calming a 40 mph tempest so that the finance ministers could play golf and speak to the Press standing casually on a lawn with coconut trees and the ocean as a backdrop. Even reporters were instructed to dress casually, and their press cards were printed in a seablue with pictures of the Hawaiian islands and bright green coconut trees. The result was just what the United States wanted. All APEC ministers turned up as invited -- even the Malaysians -- and the informality and total absence of any of the feared pressure turned the event into a highly successful confidence-building exercise. Mr Bentsen carefully avoided contentious issues. As Thai finance permanent secretary Aran Thammano put it the United States has plenty of other forums where it can be aggressive such as meetings of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the World Bank. Now, however, after only one meeting of APEC finance ministers, the group faces a problem: Where can it go from here? It cannot continue to hold casual get-togethers at this level showing no concrete results, without reinforcing accusations that it is a waste of time. But if concrete results are the objective, then controversy may be difficult to avoid. At the same time, the coordination of macroeconomic policy might not be a realistic objective for so diverse a membership. This time, the US was not alone in agreeing that the meeting took place at all was in itself a concrete result. Mr Aran said he found it beneficial to meet his counterparts and other ministers from APEC countries to establish a personal relationship as a foundation for future negotiations. "Institutionalization" turned out to be the most controversial word at the meeting. ASEAN was at the centre of the discussion and even within ASEAN the cracks were scarcely covered up. Indonesia and Malaysia were most strongly against "institutionalisation", which mainly meant committing APEC's finance ministers to regular annual meetings, and generally tightening a loose relationship. Thailand's position was more relaxed. Finance Minister Tharin Nimmanhemin said that institutionalisation might be possible since the economies of APEC represent one of the most important economic centres of the world. He had no objection to the idea of closer cooperation on macroeconomic policy and added that by his definition, the mere fact that they were meeting was already a step towards institutionalisation. ASEAN members quickly closed ranks, fearing that if it remained divided it would weaken its position as a major group representing six of APEC's 17 countries. The ASEAN position was informally defined at a dinner hosted by Mr Tharin, representing Thailand's current chairmanship of ASEAN. For reasons of protocol, he stressed that the gathering was simply a "chat" and not a meeting. Also emerging from the ASEAN dinner was the group's opposition to a joint declaration and preference for a non-binding chairman's statement -- again with Indonesia and Malaysia assuming the strongest positions. According to Thai sources, this made ASEAN appear intransigent and unwilling to cooperate, particularly in the eyes of Australian Treasurer Ralph Willis, who sought an unscheduled meeting with Mr Tharin. The result was a linguistic compromise that satisfied ASEAN's doubters even if most nondiplomats would have difficulty in working out the difference -- the final document was neither a joint declaration nor a chairman's statement but a "joint statement". ASEAN's linguists also succeeded in changing a reference to "integrating" economies into "interlinking" economies. ASEAN's concerns are not difficult to understand. When joining a body with such large partners, smaller members are naturally suspicious of being dominated, particularly at a time when trade issues are becoming more contentious. For many in Asia, the feeling remains that APEC should remain a consultative forum. The smaller countries believe that anything beyond that would leave them vulnerable to pressure from larger members. The United States understood this and tried its best to avoid pressuring fellow-members. It has achieved another step in its objective to draw closer to what it sees as an Asia Pacific community. Washington estimates that by the year 2000, even excluding Japan, seven million Asian households will have an income comparable to middle-income Americans. For the future, the question remains for APEC finance ministers whether their meetings can achieve more substantive results. More importantly is the question of whether APEC and ASEAN organisations can remain unified.
