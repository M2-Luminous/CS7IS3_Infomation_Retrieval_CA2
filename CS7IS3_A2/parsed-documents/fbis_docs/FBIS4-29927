FBIS4-29927 "dreas120_m_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-120 Daily Report 22 Jun 1994 Thailand Opposition `Ready To Serve' if Called Opposition `Ready To Serve' if Called BK2206055694 Bangkok THE NATION in English 22 Jun 94 p A3 BK2206055694 Bangkok THE NATION English BFN [Text] The two biggest opposition parties, Chat Thai and Chat Phatthana, have expressed guarded interest in joining a new Democrat-led coalition government in the event the current crisis facing the Chuan administration leads to a Cabinet shake-up. Chat Thai Secretary-General Sano Thianthong said yesterday the Chat Thai Party and its opposition allies are "ready to serve" and prepared to discuss the possibility of joining the government. Chat Phatthana Deputy Leader Kon Thappharangsi insisted yesterday that Chat Phatthana would not "go it alone" in joining the Democrat-led coalition but said his party would consider becoming part of a future government only if Prime Minister Chuan Likhpai resigned as prime minister to pave the way for the formation of a new government. Sano said although opposition parties had not anticipated becoming part of a coalition government led by Chuan, "anything is possible" under present circumstances. "We are prepared to serve the country. Politicians, regardless of their political affiliation, have the responsibility to serve," Sano said. However, he said Chat Thai and other opposition parties had not been approached by the core of the present coalition government regarding a possible Cabinet shake-up to replace any existing coalition parties with opposition parties. "Anything is possible. We only need to talk," Sano said. It was still not clear whether Sano was speaking on behalf of the Chat Thai Party alone or was voicing a common stance of the opposition bloc which includes other major parties like Chat Phatthana and Social Action. Chat Thai, which controls 77 seats in the House of Representatives, is the biggest party in the opposition bloc and is second only to the Democrat Party. Senior members of Chat Phatthana which commands 60 seats in the House, have in recent weeks also expressed interest in joining the Democrat-led coalition government. Asked about the possibility of the Democrat Party replacing its foul current coalition partners with members of the opposition bloc, Sano said the opposition parties had not been waiting to join the Chuan government. "In fact, opposition parties have agreed not to join the coalition government under any circumstance," he said. But asked whether the opposition parties would insist on a total Cabinet shake-up as precondition for joining the coalition, Sano said they would not make known their position until they were approached by the coalition government. "The opposition is prepared for discussions with the coalition government. We are politicians and we don't discriminate against our colleagues because of their political affiliation," Sano said. Asked to comment on the likelihood of a new alliance of Democrat, Chat Thai and New Aspiration in a coalition government, Sano said: "Whether such an arrangement would work out depends very much on whether the (future) coalition government could forge unity among its partners." "I am in no position to boast about our (Chat Thai's) capability in administering the country. We have been in the government several times before. The public is the judge," Sano said.
