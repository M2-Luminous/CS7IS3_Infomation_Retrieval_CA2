In the Atlantic, the Russian Navy has also resumed missile launching exercises, long-term exercises of aircraft carriers, and patrol operations. In connection with the rise of "Russian nationalism" observed in the last parliamentary elections, Western nations are concerned about these Russian moves. Operations of a Russian submarine were observed twice in early and late December. Both operations lasted for about a week, with the operations being undertaken in the Sea of Japan to a point 100-kilometers north of Ishikawa Prefecture's Noto Peninsula, which is within Japan's economic waters. The type of submarine has not been confirmed since it never surfaced during the operation, but judging from various signs, it is believed to be a Victor-III class (with a displacement of 4,800 tons), which is regarded as the "backbone" of Russia's fleet attack submarines. The source added: "Such activities of nuclear-powered submarines were quite usual in the period of the former Soviet Union, but have not been observed during the last couple of years since the Russian Federation took over control of the Navy." In addition, the source noted: 1) a Udaloy-class destroyer (6,700 tons), an Alligator-class landing ship (3,400 tons), and a Boris Chilikin-class replenishment ship (23,400 tons) passed through the Korea Strait on 18 November and conducted exercises in waters near the gulf after stopping in Cam Ranh Bay; 2) a Ropucha-class landing ship (3,600 tons) also passed through the strait on 2 December, apparently unloading supplies in Cam Ranh Bay; and 3) airplane operations are becoming active around Japan. In analysis, the source concluded: "The Russian Navy may be resuming full-fledged activities after restructuring its lineup through the disposal of superannuated ships." In particular, the source said it is noteworthy that such operations are observed not only in the Pacific but also in the Atlantic simultaneously. On this basis, the source stressed that Japan should carefully determine whether the operations are based on a new strategy by President Boris Yeltsin or are signs of the rise of military authorities after the attack on the Russian White House.
