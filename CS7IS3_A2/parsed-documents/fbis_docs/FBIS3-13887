Both leaders simply urged the PLO to resume peace talks without making any reference to the security needs of the Palestinian people in the occupied territories. What brought the peace process to a halt was the simple fact that the two million unarmed and unprotected Palestinian civilians in the territories are prey to the whims of Israeli terrorists. The statement of the Israeli border guard commander in front of the Israeli Commission of Inquiry that soldiers have clear orders not to open fire at Jewish settlers even if the latter were in the act of shooting at unarmed Palestinian civilians underscores the danger facing the Palestinian population and Israel's reluctance to deal with it. This revelation did not come as a surprise to the Palestinians, who knew it existed long before the border guard commander announced it publicly. They have had enough experience with settlers opening fire at them without the soldiers or government doing anything about it. The Israeli government's reluctance to deal with settlers shooting at Palestinians, as well as the light sentences given to Israelis for killing Palestinians without reason, is what encourages Israeli terrorists to continue with their murderous acts. They know that in the end they will be treated like heroes among their people and may even become members of the Israeli parliament or even ministers in the government. They do not have to worry about the consequences of their acts on their families, property and compatriots like Palestinians do. If it was a Palestinian who killed an Israeli, then his home would be demolished and his family dislodged; his village and maybe the whole town would be placed under curfew for days and weeks and harassed on a daily basis by the army and settlers; several hundred Palestinians would be rounded up and sent either to prison or exiled; and the person who committed the act would get a life sentence plus many more years for every death or injury he brought about. Israeli justice is far from being just. It assumes the Israeli idea of right or wrong. For this reason Palestinians demand international intervention, and rightly so, for their sake and for the sake of the peace process on the whole.
