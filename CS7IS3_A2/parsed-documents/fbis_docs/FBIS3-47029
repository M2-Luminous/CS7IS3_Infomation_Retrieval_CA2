The five, who were among thousands of Japanese left behind in northeastern China in the chaos at the end of the war, were accommodated at a government facility for war-displaced Japanese in Tokorozawa, Saitama Prefecture, following their arrival at Narita Airport. The five women from Heilongjiang Province in northeastern China have nobody to sponsor them in Japan and came to Japan at their own expense, Health and Welfare Ministry officials said. The new arrivals, aged between 59 and 78, brought the total number of war-displaced Japanese women who have sought residency since September to 39. A group of 12 Japanese women came to Japan on September 5, followed by a team of 17 women on November 26 and another group of five women on December 6. The Japanese Government said last month it will accept some 1,000 Japanese women left behind in China at the end of World War II if they express a wish to return to Japan. Health and Welfare Ministry figures show there were 1,759 war-displaced Japanese women in China as of the end of March last year, of whom some 1,000 are believed to want to return to Japan permanently.
