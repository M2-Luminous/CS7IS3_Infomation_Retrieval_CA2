Although the letter states the resignation is effective 8 May, Ambassador Facio told LA REPUBLICA he will leave his Washington post "late in April or early in May." Facio is currently in the country. He participated in the elections here and will return to the U.S. capital on Sunday. Facio explained he met with President-elect Jose Maria Figueres on Thursday to review Costa Rica's relations with Bill Clinton's administration, and to review challenges the next government will have to face in this regard. The meeting was requested by Figueres, to whom Ambassador Facio explained that discussions on the laws concerning the Uruguay Round are still pending and are "extremely important." Furthermore, the next government must follow up the proposal to extend the free trade agreement between the United States, Mexico, and Canada to include the Caribbean zone. The dispute with the U.S. Embassy over expropriations of U.S. citizens' properties will be another inheritance for Figueres, Facio emphasized.
