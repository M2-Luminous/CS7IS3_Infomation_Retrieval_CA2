Cape's Manne Dipico MB0205220194 Johannesburg SABC TV 1 Network in Afrikaans 1800 GMT 2 May 94 MB0205220194 Johannesburg SABC TV 1 Network Afrikaans BFN [Interview with Northern Cape Premier-elect Manne Dipico by correspondent Charl Pauw on 2 May; place not given--recorded, in English; italicized passage in Afrikaans] [Text] The premier designate for the Northern Cape, where the ANC currently has a lead of 11 percent, discussed the possibility of cooperation with other parties in the future. Charl Pauw spoke to Mr. Manne Dipico. [Begin recording] [Dipico] There is no party that is going to dominate, and to us it is really a blessing. Other people are not happy about it, others will be happy; but to me I see it as a positive step because it will force all other parties, compel us to speak to one another, to bring us into a coalition; and we believe that through negotiations the Freedom Front and the National Party will have to come up with a system which can take this province forward. [Pauw] So these are in fact the kind of people you are looking toward to bring into this coalition? [Dipico] These are the kind of people who we are going to bring into the coalition, Freedom Front. We are going to start discussing earnestly with the National Party and even the DP [Democratic Party], which also could maybe get a seat. [Pauw] It was always said, and you said it yourself, that the Colored voters will determine who's going to win here, but that somehow hasn't materialized. [Dipico] Yes, it's true. What really happened because our people in our province understood the message of the National Party, others understood the message of the ANC, and to that extent, the Colored vote -- when we look at it -- was really a split between these two parties and that really determined the destiny.
