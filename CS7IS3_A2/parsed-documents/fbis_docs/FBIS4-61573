A delegation of the Russian parliament upper chamber he heads was here on a fact-finding mission to inspect combat preparedness and every-day life of units of land troops and the Baltic Fleet stationed here. The delegation visited the main naval base in Baltiysk where legislators were guests of the Nastoychivyy destroyer sailors and marines and participated in an anniversary meeting of the region's veterans and the public, which was devoted to the V-Day. Delegation members discussed problems of combat training and social programmes for troops at meetings with the leadership of the region, the Baltic Fleet, the Army, Border Guards and Air-Defence Forces. Shirshov said that his trip was a followup of the recent visit to the Kaliningrad Region by parliament's upper chamber speaker Vladimir Shumeyko who came forth with an initiative to set up here a combined group of troops of limited strength. The idea was backed by the Russian Defence Ministry and is to be formalised legislatively. "The task of this group is to ensure adequate combat preparedness of this Russian territory," Shirshov stressed. "Nobody should doubt that it is an inalienable territory of our country, a successor of the former Soviet Union, to which it was transferred according to the decision of the Potsdam Conference 50 years ago," Shirshov stressed. The delegation departed from Kaliningrad for Moscow on Sunday.
