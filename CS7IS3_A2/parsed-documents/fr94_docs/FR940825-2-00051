FR940825-2-00051 FR940825-2-00028 [Docket No. MT94&hyph;18&hyph;000] National Fuel Gas Supply Corp.; Notice of Tariff Change August 19, 1994. Take notice that on August 17, 1994, National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation (National) submitted for filing, pursuant to §§284.286, 250.16 and 161.3 of the Commission's Regulations, certain tariff sheets to revise Paragraph 22 to the General Terms and Conditions of National's FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1, in order to establish the provisions required by Order No. 497 to govern the sales of gas that may be made from time to time, under National's blanket sales certificate. In the alternative, National requests a limited waiver of the requirements of Order No. 497 with respect to such sales in order to dispose of gas that is in excess of National's operational requirements. National requests that the Commission act expeditiously on this filing and make the revised tariff sheets effective on August 18, 1994. National states that waiver of the 30-day notice period is necessary because National will offer the gas for sale on August 18, 1994, in order to maintain the integrity of its system. National states that a copy of this filing has been served on National's jurisdictional customers an interested state commissions. Any person desiring to be heard or to protect said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C., 20426, in accordance with Rules 214 or 211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211). All such motions to intervene or protest should be filed on or before August 26, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
