As is known, the Federation did not support the general political strike set for 15 February. Let us remind you that the question is open as the strike was postponed to 22 February -- the day when the Belarusian Supreme Soviet will resume its session. The official trade unions, too, may join the strike movement. Explaining the position of Belarusian unions and, so to say, dotting all the i's and crossing all the t's, Vladimir Hancharyk, the Council chairman, commented on the current situation. [Begin recording] [Hancharyk] The political strike did fail. That is a fact. But the fact also is that public discontent is extremely high. The reason why the strike has not taken place -- and we have repeatedly stressed this -- is that it was premature and poorly prepared. The main emphasis was put on spontaneous rallies rather than well organized ones. Generally speaking, the issue of strikes should be handled based on a good preparation, and not on reasoning. Let us hold up traffic, or something to this effect. This is especially conspicuous when we take a look at the strike participants. There were very few workers. Most of the strikers included intellectuals, students, and some of our activists. People avoid going to extremes. They are afraid to lose their jobs. This is why people decided to stay out of it. [Announcer] To stabilize the social and economic situation of the Republic, the union Federation presented its demands. First, the Belarusian Supreme Soviet should call early legislative elections no later than this October. Second, the Cabinet of Ministers should urgently revamp and reconstruct the government during the ongoing session. Unless the above demands are not met, Hancharyk said the reaction of trade unions will be firm. [Hancharyk] We have come to the conclusion that the Federation's position should be pretty tough. The clock will start ticking from 22 February, the session's first day of work after a break. The Federation's Presidium is to convene on 23 February to determine our further actions. If the Supreme Soviet does not examine the above issue, we will have to cast a secret ballot, as provided by law, in our local organizations, followed by massive rallies in early March. But this time, these will be organized rallies. I am talking about a warning strike. According to the law, we have three hours. As for the laws, all of them have a distinct anti-union orientation. The issue of political strikes is still not settled in our country. So whether they want it or not, all protesters and strike organizers will violate the law. I would like to emphasize that what we did not like about the political strike is the very principle of resolving this issue. It boils down to the following [word indistinct]. The government should resign, while the Supreme Soviet sets a date for early elections and dissolves itself. Following this plan, we would end up with a caretaker government, which is not legitimate, as a matter of fact. Of course, there are no guarantees that this process will unfold in a civilized way. [Announcer] So, it is clear that the official trade unions are going to (?find a common language) with the government in the beginning of [words indistinct]. Asked about the political role of the Federation in Belarus, its chairman said the following. [Hancharyk] We do not want to play any political role. Our Statute limits our political activities to participating in the elections. At present, however, it is impossible to solve economic problems in isolation with the political ones. Willy-nilly, trade unions cannot stay away from politics today. [end recording]
