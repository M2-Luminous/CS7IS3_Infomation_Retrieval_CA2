To learn more about today's hearing on the appeal of these defendants, let us hear the report by our correspondent Armir Shkurti: [Shkurti] The examination of the criminal case of the defendants Fatos Nano, Robert Gjini, and Hasan Hallko began in the Appeals Court this morning. Following the decision of the Tirana Court on 3 April this year, on the basis of the law, today the three defendants and their defense counsel presented the reasons for their complaints against the verdict of the Tirana Court. Fatos Nano and Robert Gjini were present in court, while defendant Hasan Hallko was in the hospital with a serious case of depression. Perparim Sanxhaku, counsel for defendant Fatos Nano, declared in front of reporters that he had no complaints against the bench of this court, made up of Prele Martini, chairman of the Appeals Court, Koco Mano, and Mergim Dragushi. The prosecutor is Petrit Duka. Mano read the verdict of the Tirana Court. In a 70-page statement, Counsel Sanxhaku brought forward arguments that the verdict of the court of first instance was unjust. The defense case appears to be based on reports referring to the actions and documentation prepared in Italy. According to Sanxhaku, an approximately 500-page report contained in the file is in Italian and has not been translated in Albanian. Some 200 of the approximately 470 pages of the Italian experts' report are missing, the counsel said. Sanxhaku insisted that the Italian aid amounted to 20 and not 23 billion lira, as stated in the verdict. Sanxhaku asked that the indictment be addressed to Pergniola, as he has directly profited from the money. The counsel asked the court to rescind the arrest warrant against defendant Fatos Nano, include in the file the documents that are missing, and translate those that are in Italian. Sanxhaku also requested that the case be returned to the Tirana Court for completion of the investigation. Defendant Nano began his statement with a political discussion in which he called himself a victim of the political struggle. He said the trial was a point of reference for international states and organizations considering Albania. Nano believes that financing from these organizations would depend on the position that the judicary maintained toward him. The chairman of the court warned the defendant several times that if he continued the political discussion rather than present his evidence, his speech would be interrupted. This appeared to convince Nano and he continued by defending himself, essentially with the same arguments as his counsel, but again from the position of a politician. Roland Permeti, counsel for defendant Robert Gjini, used almost the same arguments and logic as put forward in the defense in the court of first instance. The statement is not a document of payment and material responsibility. Albkontrol was the one that checked the items and Workshop No. 101/K of the State Reserves was directly responsible for receiving the items. Defendant Robert Gjini added few things to the defense of his counsel. The counsel for defendant Hasan Hallko defended him in almost the same way. His client had authorized the counsel to speak on his behalf, as he himself was in hospital. Gjini and Hallko pleaded innocent. Nano's counsel submitted 10 requests to the court. The court turned down the request to requestion 11 witnesses, reexamine the experts' report by experts Telegrafi and Shkreli, produce the minutes on the interrogation of Fatos Nano at the Investigation Office, and produce the price bulletin from the Chamber of Commerce in Milan, as well as the request to translate 500 pages from Italian and produce the reports of petitions, letters, and demands to release Fatos Nano. They acceded to the request to produce all the documentation that has not been produced so far and investigate all the documentation that the counsel thought was not assessed in the trial of first instance. Counsel Sanxhaku presented several documents not produced so far, which the court will consider. Prosecutor Duka asked for time to consider the documents, while the counsels of the defendants said they would condition their final statements on the prosecutor's statement. The hearing was interrupted and will continue at 0900 tomorrow.
