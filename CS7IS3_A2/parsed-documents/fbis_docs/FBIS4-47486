D. Mukhamedyarov, doctor of technical sciences, and G. A. Krasnov; UDC [621.384.32:629.78]:574] [Abstract] Methods for computing the characteristics of thermal imagers, especially their resolution, applicable to test objects in the form of line test patterns, which in some cases makes possible approximate extrapolation of the results to an evaluation of the possibility of identifying specific objects on the basis of empirical expressions, continue to be improved. An analysis is based on computation of the signal-to-noise ratio when resolving a three-element test pattern. A merit of this form of analysis is that it is possible to use analytic expressions for determining the intrasystem parameters of IR instruments from the measured values of the characteristics of the complex in which it is a component part when solving the direct problem or determining the characteristics of the complex from the measured values of the parameters of the IR instruments when solving the inverse problem. The proposed method for determining the probability of resolution makes it possible to evaluate the admissible design errors in IR instruments attributable to technological constraints. In accordance with the described method the probability of resolution of a three- element test pattern by an ensemble of aerospace instruments under ground conditions can be determined when using an experimental test stand (an annotated block diagram accompanies the text). This resolution is 0.8 for a spatial frequency of the mires _u_ = 0.0333 m[.sup]-1[/] and a radiation contrast of the scale and test pattern _D_T = 3 K. In this case the discrepancy between the experimental and computed data does not exceed 4%. Figures 3; references: 3 Russian.
