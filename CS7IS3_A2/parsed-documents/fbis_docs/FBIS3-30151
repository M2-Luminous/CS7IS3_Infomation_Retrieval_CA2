Commission on Human Rights held in Geneva. Noting with indignation that the present Japanese authorities are still unwilling to admit to the issue of "comfort women for the army", he said such attitude of theirs proves that they too are little different from their predecessors who had committed a crime by contriving the system of "comfort women for the army". Pointing out that the sexual slavery forced upon Korean and other Asian women by the Japanese Army is a criminal act against mankind and it showed that Japan could not evade its responsibility for it either in view of the international law or in view of morality, he continued: The Japanese authorities must comprehensively and quickly probe the truth behind the "comfort women for the army", such as the total number of "comfort women", their composition of nationalities and lists of victims and make public its results. Japan must make adequate compensations to victims and their families as the greatest token of its will to clearly liquidate its past, its will not to repeat such crimes. At the same time, it must be accompanied by criminal punishment upon those who are responsible for it.
