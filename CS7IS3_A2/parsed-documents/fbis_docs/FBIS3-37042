Addressing coal-mining managers and trade union officials in Moscow on Friday, he said, "There have been fewer deputy premiers. I think that there could be still fewer of them." Chernomyrdin explained that, "there are now four deputy premiers, but their number will be reduced even more." IF Note: After the Cabinet reshuffle, the deputy prime ministers in place are: Oleg Soskovets -- first deputy prime minister, and Yuriy Yarov, Aleksander Zaveryukha, and Anatoliy Chubays -- deputy prime ministers. Chernomyrdin called for enhancing the role of ministries, federal departments, and large industrial companies. "If we make the government free of the duties that are alien to it and transfer them to ministries, major companies and regions, questions will be solved in a more prompt fashion," Chernomyrdin remarked. In his words, the time when only Moscow decided whether to build an enterprise or close one has gone and will never return. He recalled that as the USSR Gas Minister he cut the number of his deputies from 11 to 2 with no adverse effect on the industry.
