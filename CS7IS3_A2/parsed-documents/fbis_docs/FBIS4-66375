Its neutron flux levels rank among the world's leaders and it is number one in Asia. It attained criticality for the first time on 27 December 1979 and has now operated safely for more than 13 years. This reactor is used primarily for nuclear fuel and materials irradiation tests, but it also is used for neutron irradiation technology services and the production of isotopes. The laboratory has 70 engineering and technical personnel including 30 engineers and three senior engineers, and it has 22 senior operating personnel and four operating personnel who have received state reactor operation licenses. Since its completion, this reactor has conducted a series of tests and research on the special types of materials used in nuclear power devices, on UO[.sub]2[/], ThO[.sub]2[/], and UO[.sub]2[/]-Gd[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] fuel samples and UO[.sub]2[/] fuel microsphere samples, on reactor pressure vessel steel, and on special types of materials used in high-temperature gas-cooled reactors, fast reactors, hybrid reactors, and other types of advanced reactors. It has carried out development and production of industrial [.sup]60[/]Co sources, [.sup]60[/]Co flaw detection sources, [.sup]192[/] Ir flaw detection sources, [.sup]60[/]Co therapy sources and afterloading sources, molybdenum-technetium generators, tin-indium generators, and other radioactive isotopes and R&D on neutron irradiation monocrystalline silicon doping, precious stone irradiation coloring, and other things and produced rather high social and economic benefits. With the need for rapid development of China's national economy, this laboratory will be playing an ever more important role in nuclear fuel and materials irradiation testing, isotope development and production, neutron irradiation processing, nuclear engineering, radiation chemistry, nuclear medicine, and other high-S&T fields.
