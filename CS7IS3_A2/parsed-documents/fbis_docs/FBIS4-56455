FBIS4-56455 "drlat086_m_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-086 Daily Report 2 May 1994 Brazil `Antidumping' Tax Levied on Russian, Ukrainian Alloy `Antidumping' Tax Levied on Russian, Ukrainian Alloy PY0305232694 Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in Portuguese 2 May 94 p 20 PY0305232694 Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL Portuguese BFN [Text] The Brazilian Government has decided to impose a 27.19 percent "antidumping" surcharge on Brazilian imports of low-carbon ferrochromium alloy from Russia, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine, in accordance with Decree No. 233 dated 27 April and published in the DIARIO OFICIAL DA UNIAO on 28 April. The decision came in response to a complaint lodged by the Ferro-Ligas da Bahia Company (Ferbasa) with the Foreign Trade Secretariat in November 1992, on the grounds that these imports were hurting Brazilian production. Ferbasa is the only Brazilian manufacturer of low-carbon ferrochromium alloy, and its factory in Pojuca, Bahia State, can produce 11,000 metric tons annually. Rising imports have since 1990 been causing Ferbasa to sharply reduce its production, to the point of shutting down one of its furnaces. Based on a preliminary investigation into "dumping," the Brazilian Government decided to impose in September 1993 a provisional surcharge of 18.97 percent. In accordance with the Finance Ministry decree, the prices of imported alloy from the above coutries are now 27.19 percent lower than prevailing market prices. The surcharge will be in force for five years.
