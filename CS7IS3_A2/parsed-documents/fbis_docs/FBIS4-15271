Safronov; from the "Vesti" newscast] [Text] A number of ministers in charge of social issues, led by Yuriy Yarov, deputy chairman of the government, held a news conference today. They revealed some very interesting facts. For example, Labor Minister Gennadiy Melikyan said that the number of people in Russia with incomes below the poverty line nearly halved in February. The reason for this is that people working in the public sector had a pay rise in that month, the child allowance was increased, and pensioners began receiving compensation for inflation. However, the current year does not hold any bright prospects in store. According to Yuriy Prokofyev, head of the Federal Employment Service, the country today has 989,000 registered unemployed, which amounts to one percent of the able-bodied population. As for the real unemployment figure, currently estimated at about 4 million, it could reach 6.5 million by the end of the year, accounting for eight percent of the able-bodied population. To prevent this category of the population from sliding into extreme poverty, public works such as street cleaning are to be organized, which will be paid for from the federal budget. The 100 percent unemployed will receive an unemployment benefit and those who would like to change their profession will be offered retraining schemes, with grants higher than the unemployment benefit.
