Police in Zhaoqing carried out an undercover action on November 2 last year after learning that drug traffickers from Hong Kong had gone there with a big amount of money for trading drugs with a local drug-dealer at his luxury residence. The police launched a raid on the drug-traffickers early the following early morning when the four suspects appeared outside the house carrying bulging bags. They were arrested and 7,500 grams of heroin were found in the bags. The police also captured three other suspects inside the house and discovered RMB 620,000 in cash which had been brought there by the Hong Kong suspects as well as 8,700 grams of heroin. The police went on the same day to arrest two other suspects who had sneaked into Shenzhen from Hong Kong and were found to be accomplices in the drug-trafficking. Two more hideouts for the drug trade were smashed in the urban area of Zhaoqing with five drug-traffickers arrested. Further raids were later carried out in Yunnan, Guangxi and Luoding in Guangdong with the ring-leader together with six suspects being captured. The drug ring was wiped out with the elimination of the drug route by which the drugs were first brought in from Yunnan and transported to Zhaoqing in Guangdong via Guangxi for later shipment to Hong Kong drug dealers.
