Like a ghost without a face and without a voice, who, from one of his 25 safe houses in Belfast or his bomb-proof office on Falls Road, would terrorize Britain with the mere mention of his name, which was synonymous with fear, bombings, and mysteries. Now Gerry Adams has come out of the shadows. The charismatic leader of Sinn Fein (the Northern Irish party that is in practice the political wing of the IRA), the man who has survived dozens of attacks by Protestant Unionists and the innumerable diplomatic traps of the oldest conflict in Europe, has started showing his beard and his open smile around the world. Like a real statesman. First America, last week the Basque Country. Yesterday, he arrived in Italy, where he will visit Venice, then Turin, for the presentation of his book -- surprisingly, a narrative work. It is called, "The Road and Other Stories." It is all set in the poor and desperate streets of West Belfast, the Catholic ghetto of the Northern Irish capital, where Adams was born and where the guerrilla warfare is fiercest. "To describe it as a diplomatic offensive is perhaps going too far," he said dismissively, persuasive, and polite. "But when the American Government granted me a visa, I accepted invitations from organizations and friends. The visit was a great success for Sinn Fein and for the cause of the Republican movement. I was invited to visit the Basque Country a year ago, and at last I accepted. I visited Italy in 1987 and I pledged to return if ever one of my books were to be translated. Of course, this has all happened at a rather busy time for the negotiations on Northern Ireland, but I could not refuse." [Orizio] On 15 December 1993, there was the historic London and Dublin agreement on "the Northern Ireland people's right to self-determination." Sinn Fein asked for clarifications on 20 points. First, London said "no," then it changed its mind. Yesterday evening you received a partial reply: a "yes" to a referendum in Ulster. Is this a victory? Does British Prime Minister John Major accept you as interlocutors now? [Adams] Yes, of course. But relations between Sinn Fein and the British Government began in secret three years ago and have never ceased. If there were not the Maastricht Treaty to approve in Westminster, and therefore if a John Major with problems had not needed to keep his Unionist votes safe, he would have officially recognized us as a partner in the dialogue much sooner. So yesterday's acknowledgement is nothing new. [Orizio] But now Major is talking openly about a referendum, to determine the future of Northern Ireland. This is something new. [Adams] Before making an assessment of the substance of the British document, we will have to analyze its 21 pages thoroughly. Permit me to say, however, that a 21-page reply to just one of the points that we raised shows that we were right to want to look into the matter more thoroughly and that we were in good faith. Of course, we are clear about how the "right to self-determination" would express itself, but we believe that the entire people of Ireland, and not just of Northern Ireland, are entitled to express themselves. Be that as it may, if this British reply helps the dialogue to continue, it really is welcome. [Orizio] Are Major's domestic political problems influencing the negotiations? [Adams] Yes, and in a very negative way. Major's position is so precarious that the prime minister is effectively being held hostage by a group of members of parliament of the Tory Right, who are holding him for ransom precisely over the Northern Ireland issue. Without this problem, the negotiations would be much further advanced. [Orizio] But there is again more shooting going on in Ulster than before. Why? [Adams] It is the Protestant terrorists that are responsible for almost all these bloodthirsty incidents. The other day they killed two Catholic workers, 10 days ago an old lady who was watching television. They are trying to frighten people. But the worst thing is that they shoot with weapons supplied by the British Government, as we have proved with documentary evidence. These weapons came via South Africa and were brought in by a British agent. [Orizio] The British Government, however, accuses you Republicans of having taken weapons from Iran, in exchange for the elimination of political adversaries of the Ayatollah. [Adams] It also accuses us of managing a drugs racket to finance the struggle. It is all lies. Ridiculous stories. Tehran has denied it, the IRA has denied it, and the Dublin government has denied it. The fact is that it is all British propaganda. After the support gathered during my visit to America, London decided to respond by trying to discredit us. But no one in Belfast believes these things. [Orizio] Leaving these accusations aside, is there a hope of peace now? [Adams] I believe so. People want peace and the international climate is favorable. Dialogue has resolved two crises that seemed insoluble -- the Middle East and South Africa. Now it is up to us. The political process of dialogue must be started. We republicans believe in it.
