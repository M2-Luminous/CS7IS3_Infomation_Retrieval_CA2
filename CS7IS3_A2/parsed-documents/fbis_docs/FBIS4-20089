You also agreed to abide by all the decisions of the conference. Why? [Ocalan] I felt a need to repeat this cease-fire offer to clear ourselves of responsibility. It was mostly addressed to the Western public, rather than Turks; and was announced partly at the request of our friends. I told them our views were consistent, that nothing had changed. But they asked: "Could you not put it in writing?" I told them I was not afraid to do that, and in an act of modesty, I went as far as to say I would abide by the decisions made by the conference. The Western alternative shows interest in a democratic solution, even a limited one. The West does not fully accept the renunciation of our national identity, it is impossible for them to deny a people's cultural identity. Therefore, do not disparage my pledge that "right now I accept any decisions you make." The result was clear from the start and I had to respect it. I asked if it would have any practical results and could it lead to other developments? It seems the decisions of the conference will have a significant impact on the Western public. Already, parliamentarians are increasing their support for our proposals. Influential people from various parliaments participated in the conference, and I hope it will influence their governments. Diplomatic channels have already been opened, including ties with the big powers. France and Germany Will Backtrack [OZGUR GUNDEM] Germany and France joined Turkey last winter in declaring your organization illegal and terroristic. Do these new developments mean those countries are retracting their statements? [Ocalan] There will be a clear renunciation of these statements, and that will not be all. Why were such statements made in the first place? Because they had an important place in the plans of the United States and the West. At one point, Mitterrand told Ciller: "We will make your star shine." The meaning of this is very clear: "You take certain steps and in return we will boost your popularity." Do you know when France made this statement? A day before the True Path Party Congress. Ciller needed some success, a great victory to win over the congress. The West expressed their support for her, and this is how the "star wars were won." Soon after that, France and Germany made certain joint decisions with the knowledge of the United States. They expected things of Ciller; she had to take certain steps on the Kurdish problem. We were aware of the West's inclination, and therefore we wanted to show that we were not opposed to their policies as far as values are concerned and that we were not opposing this on the battlefield. Now, the West is returning to its original policy and is abandoning the idea of "giving moral support Ciller's shining star." Why? Because "she failed to fulfill the promises she made." Ciller had long been under the influence of the special warfare forces, and was acting as their mouthpiece. The West realized this and asked: "What does that finger wagging by Gures mean? Can he raise his finger against a prime minister?" [reference to a newspaper photo of Chief of General Staff Dogan Gures raising an admonishing finger over a sullen Ciller] The West noticed this. Of course, this symbolically reflects a reality -- she has come under the control of the Army. The promises have come to naught and there is nothing to show for it! Now, the West is angry at this. In addition to backtracking, it has also withdrawn its support. As the system requires, NATO still generally supports Turkey, but that is a different matter. Here I am talking about this government. Something new has arisen; my proposals had an enormous impact. Just the way the cease-fire proposal last year created an extraordinary effect in Turkey, the present one has generated a far greater impact on the international level. I think that this will put a lot of pressure on Turkey. [OZGUR GUNDEM] The concluding statement of the conference links the intractable Kurdish problem to the West's policy of dividing up the Middle East and Kurdistan during and after World War I. Is this new attitude linked with the PKK's diplomatic initiatives, or with the democratization of the West? [Ocalan] Undoubtedly, Turkish realities foiled the West's policies; this is evident. They are unable to carry out their policies and have nothing left to say on the Kurdish problem. In the past the approach was: "The Kurdish problem cannot be solved by the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan]." For the last ten years, a Kurdish solution without the PKK was the most fashionable. The United States spearheaded this policy. The great difference is that now they say: "This cannot be accomplished without the PKK." This is a dramatic development; it is the achievement of the year. The fact that the PKK has been accepted as a factor in the solution will have repercussions. Another assessment of the conference was: "We have made a great mistake by seeing the PKK in this light thus far, we have had a mistaken view of it. We should have realized that the problem cannot be solved without the PKK. Our governments wanted to isolate the PKK and they supported the war, which has led to much bloodshed. The West -- France, Germany, and the United States -- are responsible for the bloodshed. We will pressure our governments to repent of their historic sin on the Kurdish problem and for supporting the 12 September regime [the Turkish Government since the 1980 coup d'etat]. Seeing that this job cannot be done without the PKK, we will stress the importance of establishing contact with it." The conference adopted decisions in line with this assessment. We Are Not Controlled by the West [OZGUR GUNDEM] What path will your party follow after the conference? [Ocalan] A period of diplomacy has now begun. The friendly parliamentarians, influential persons, professors, thinkers, and ministers are participating in developments and will be able to meet with all the ambassadors. This is a new trend, and I think it will intensify in April. This does not mean that the PKK has fallen under the control of the West. No! We are protecting our identity! We are really attached to our independence and freedom. There are no concessions on this issue! But on the other hand, we are sure it is senseless to make enemies out of the West for no reason at all. The West has its own values. Logic and democracy require that these values be taken into account and unity be achieved around them. The fanatical Turkish leftist and rightist circles consider that "the PKK is collaborating with the West." No! The conference decisions show the degree of Western support for Turkey. The West is equally responsible for the bloodshed. It is a fact that the West fought against us bitterly, and the United States was the leading force in this war. Again, it was the United States which supervised the tortures in Diyarbakir [reference to Kurds detained in Diyarbakir prison after the 1980 coup]. For many long years the United States supported plans to eliminate the PKK. The October 1992 attack against us during the war in the south [northern Iraq] was guided by the United States. The West also kept silent during the latest bombing of the Zhalah camp. As soon as four [Serbian] planes take off in Bosnia the West shoots them down; but when 50 planes raided Zhalah they approved of it. The region now is under Poised Hammer's jurisdiction. This raid shows the extent of the support given to Turkey. But now the West sees that it is responsible for the bloodshed. We proved their responsibility, and now they now want to back away from this policy. This backtracking is not a bad thing. Naturally, we will again announce that we are ready if they want to promote democratic and cultural rights and a political solution to the problem. We will say: "We express our agreement and compliance in advance" with any possible solutions, as logic and democracy require, not as an act of surrender or collusion as some claim.
