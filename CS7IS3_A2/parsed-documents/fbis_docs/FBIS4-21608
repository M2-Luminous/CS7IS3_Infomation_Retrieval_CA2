The draft contract also deals with the security of the payment. The product concerned is compact containers for spent fuel pools at the Rivne nuclear power plant. According to the company director, Vaclav Lobovsky, Ukraine has expressed an interest in purchasing $150 million worth of nuclear equipment from Skoda Jaderne strojirenstvi over the next five to eight years. Cooperation is subject to the complex solution to the problem of payments. According to Lobovsky, there is the possibility of barter -- the trade for Ukrainian electricity or perhaps some other goods. "Ukraine is trying to reduce its undesirable dependence on Russian monopoly suppliers, whose products allegedly are not of as high quality as ours. Cost advantages are losing attractiveness," Lobovsky claims. Ukraine has the largest number of AVER 1000 [Water-Moderated Water-Cooled Power Reactor] reactors (10 in operation and four under construction). Only nuclear power plants are economically capable of producing electric power in Ukraine. Skoda Jaderne strojirenstvi introduced itself already in November by successfully completing a one-year test run at the Ukrainian power plant of its own modernized inching drive [krokovy pohon] for the reactor, in which even the Russians expressed interest. Ukraine is now beginning to replace its outdated control and security systems. Ukrainian nuclear power plants are therefore most interested in Skoda's inching drives including the electronics, compact grids [kompaktni mrize], hermetic cable bushing, and also maintenance inspections, which Skoda allegedly offers at a price 10 times lower than Siemens, for instance. Ukraine is also deciding now from whom to purchase spent fuel containers. Skoda Jaderne strojirenstvi is not without chances. So far, it has been producing them under a German license, but as early as September it will introduce its own container prototype, which could become, according to Lobovsky, the most promising product of Skoda Plzen.
