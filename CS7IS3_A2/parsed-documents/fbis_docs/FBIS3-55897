According to the minister the current call-up to active military service is going successfully. At the same time, he noted that the army should be run along professional lines and stressed the importance of further improving the reserve system. With respect to relations with the national guard, which was set up during recent events in western Georgia, Karkarashvili said those events had justified its existence at that time. However, the guards status has still not been clarified. At this point the minister stressed that his main aim is to create a unified, disciplined, mobile and well armed army as a symbol of the independent state. Turning to the development of relations with Russia, Georgia's minister of defense stated that they should be defined on the basis of a treaty [Russian: na dogovornoy osnove]. As for maintaining public order, mercenaries may come into the picture but not units from the Russian Federation's ministry of defense, as they do not have the appropriate status.
