The Latvian Government in fact legalized the Russian occupation by initialing the agreement, according to the statement. The organizations urge the Saeima (parliament) to decline the agreement's ratification because the document is evidently hostile to the intersts of the Latvian nation. It may also provoke unpredictable consequences in the future. The group also calls on President Guntis Ulmanis not to sign the document. The statement is signed by the Latvian National Independence Movement's Swedish department, the Latvian National Fund, the Swedish-Latvians Central Council and the Swedish Daugavas Vanagi organization.
