Present at the reception were provincial leaders Gu Jinchi, Yue Qifeng, Zhang Guoguang, Wen Shizhen, Zhang Rongmao, and Guo Tingbiao; and leaders and reporters of XINHUA news agency, RENMIN RIBAO, the Central People's Broadcasting Station, and the Central Television Station.

After the convocation of the second session of the eighth National People's Congress, we will work out new development targets according to the guidelines of this session.

I hope that the comrades of the press units will develop more opinions and share suggestions on Liaoning's development. At the reception, Governor Yue Qifeng made a speech in regard to the 1993 ideas for readjusting the economic structure and doing the second pioneering work as well as the new changes in Liaoning's economic pattern. He said: First, the backward agricultural and rural economic situation was changed. Last year, the grain output reached 16,960,000 tonnes. The province not only became self-sufficient in grain and major nonstaple foods but also started to export some farm and sideline products. Second, the situation where local industries developed slowly was changed. The provincial party committee and the provincial government clearly set forth the ideology of having large industries to guide the development of small ones and [words indistinct]. At the time of enlivening state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises, we have concentrated great efforts to develop local minor industries. The output value realized by the local minor industries in 1993 reached 111.23 billion yuan, an increase of 68.4 percent over the previous year. Third, the unitary ownership structure was changed. Non-state economy, as a new economic growing point in Liaoning's second pioneering work, develops at a fast speed. Fourth, the unitary form of revenues was changed. Due to the step-by-step formation of new financial resources, such as town and township enterprises, district and neighborhood economy, tertiary industry, individual and private economy, and three kinds of foreign-funded enterprises, the revenues increased each passing year. Yue Qifeng said: With these new changes, Liaoning's economic structure is more suitable to the needs of the market economic development and more conducive to bringing into play various advantages and [words indistinct]. All this has brought prospects for rejuvenating Liaoning's economy.
