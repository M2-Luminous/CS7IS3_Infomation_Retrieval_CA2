Corro R.] [Text] Panama's credibility and good intentions in the fight against drug trafficking are being questioned internationally due to the indifference of the National Assembly, which for all practical purposes will be unable to hold a third debate on the reforms to Law no. 23 of the Penal Code. Despite the efforts of the public prosecutor's office, the opinion held by U.S. agencies--that Panama is not complying with its international commitment against drug trafficking--is being justified. Attorney General Jorge Ramon Valdes deplored the situation in a statement to LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA and he said that "one cannot fight against drug trafficking without the necessary legal instruments." Valdes added that the skepticism--mainly on the part of the United States--concerning Panama's will to meet in earnest its commitments to various agencies throughout the world is understandable. On 11 April, a bill to reform the law, which dates back to 30 December 1986, was submitted for a second debate. Among the reforms being considered is the creation of two prosecutor offices specializing in drug-related crimes. The prosecutor offices will have authority and jurisdiction throughout Panama. The reforms also would permit the use of a legal framework for adequate procedures to be used in the fight against drug trafficking, such as undercover operations and drug exchange surveillance. All indications are that with the end of the regular session of the legislative assembly only 15 days away, it will be almost impossible to discuss the bill, which would amend the current law to conform with the Vienna Convention. We should mention this reform is the same one Panama presented before the OAS, the UN, and other agencies dedicated to the fight against drugs. On 9 March, during the 15th ordinary session of the OAS Interamerican Drug Abuse Control Commission [CICAD], which was held in Argentina, Attorney General Ramon Valdes, speaking on behalf of Panama, promised to take action in that respect.
