This bill returns power to municipal governments. Financial resources will be reallocated following a new population distribution criterion. The bill charges municipalities with the management of health care and education, while the central government will retain overall responsibility for these two areas. The bill will be submitted to Congress in the next few hours and come into force one month after its promulgation. Although it had been announced that a financial bill was to be submitted to Congress yesterday, Sanchez de Lozada reported that he will not do so until 24 February. Some 50 people, including members of the press and citizens selected at random by a public opinion poll company, went to Government House to inquire about the subject. Presenting the bill, Sanchez de Lozada stated that it is one of the most important steps since the 1952 revolution. He said: "This is not a panacea for all our problems, but it is a significant step toward a true participatory democracy." The government's initiative does away with old projects on administrative decentralization and seeks to favor regions proportional to their populations. The bill intends to incorporate indigenous, peasant, and urban communities into the country's political and economic life by acknowledging their legal status. It establishes grassroots organizations -- made up of directly elected provincial leaders -- to appoint representatives to the so-called "Overseeing Committees," which will supervise the work done by municipalities. Their main responsibility will be to prevent more than 10 percent of resources appropriated for municipalities being spent on current expenditures and to allocate the remaining 90 percent for public investments. The popular participation bill has an important economic component. It is based on a new income distribution system. It provides, for example, a modification to the revenue-sharing scheme: 20 percent of funds will be appropriated for municipal governments (up to now it was 10 percent) and 5 percent for universities. The 10 percent that was allotted to development corporations has been eliminated. Municipalities will thus have real control of regional funds. Once the new law is enacted, municipalities will have local governments to control a section of a province -- based on the German system of political organization. The centerpiece of the president's proposal is the VAT [value-added tax] on hydrocarbons, which directly affects La Paz Department. He announced that taxes -- especially the VAT on hydrocarbons -- will no longer benefit the locality in which the company is headquartered, but will be apportioned according to the new population criteria. La Paz Department's share of the VAT collection on hydrocarbons is one of the most important resources to finance its development. The president also announced the establishment of a $20-million compensatory fund for "poor" departments, which will be disbursed by the National Treasury. With regard to education and health care, grassroots organizations will monitor officials' work, but it is clearly established that the government will not shirk its responsibility for providing this services. Therefore, while each grassroots organization will be in charge of the maintenance of hospitals, the central government will pay the salaries of teachers and physicians. The president added that the country's smallest villages will have more resources at their disposal. He failed to say how big cities will fare as they will allegedly have to give up part of their resources to finance the development of poorer villages. "The main focal point -- La Paz, Cochabamba, and Santa Cruz de la Sierra -- will no longer monopolize everything," he said. Despite all this explanation and because he failed to jointly present the financial bill, it is still not known how much money will be allocated to the regions for division between provinces and districts.
