FR940927-0-00061 FR940927-0-00008 UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;28(2)(a) does not include the specific date provided in section 408(a) of the SMCRA. The apparent deficiency in the Utah plan would render Utah's plan less stringent than section 408(a) of SMCRA, but OSM notes that Utah has proposed to address this deficiency in a separate amendment dated April 14, 1994 (administration record No. UT&hyph;914). In order to address this additional proposal prior to making a final determination, the Director has decided to defer decision on proposed UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;28(2)(a). IV. Summary and Disposition of Comments Following are summaries of all substantive written comments on the proposed amendment that were received by OSM, and OSM's response to them. 1. Public Comments OSM invited public comments on the proposed Utah program and plan amendment, but none were received. 2. Federal Agency Comments Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i) and 884.14(a)(2), OSM solicited comments on the proposed amendment from various Federal agencies with an actual or potential interest in the Utah program and Utah plan (administrative records Nos. UT&hyph;903 and UT&hyph;952). The Bureau of Mines responded in telephone conversations on March 27 and July 29, 1994, that it had no comments (administrative record No. UT&hyph;906 and UT&hyph;964). The Bureau of Mines responded in telephone conversations on March 27 and July 29, 1994, that it had no comments (administrative record Nos. UT&hyph;906 and UT&hyph;964). By memorandum dated June 8, 1994, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service stated that it had reviewed the proposed changes and has no comment on them (administrative record No. UT&hyph;938). The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers responded on August 10, 1994, that it found the changes to be satisfactory to the agency (administrative record No. UT&hyph;963). By letter dated August 15, 1994, the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) stated that it had reviewed the (administrative record No. UT&hyph;966). No revisions to the proposed amendment were suggested. 3. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Concurrence and Comments Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(ii), OSM is required to solicit the written concurrence of EPA with respect to those provisions of the proposed program amendment that relate to air or water quality standards promulgated under the authority of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 12512 et seq. ) or the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq. ). None of the revisions that Utah proposed to make in its amendment pertain to air or water quality standards. Therefore, OSM did not request EPA's concurrence. Pursuant to 732.17(h)(11)(i), OSM solicited comments on the proposed amendment from EPA (administrative record Nos. UT&hyph;903 and UT&hyph;952). It responded on March 31 and July 28, 1994, that it had no comments and did not believe that there would be any impacts to water quality standards promulgated under authority of the Clean Water Act, as amended (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq. ) (administrative record Nos. UT&hyph;909 and UT&hyph;957). 4. State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(4), OSM solicited comments on the proposed amendment from the SHPO and ACHP (administrative record No. UT&hyph;903). Neither the SHPO nor ACHP responded to OSM's request. V. Director's Decision Based on the above findings, the Director approves, with certain exceptions and additional requirements, Utah's proposed amendment as submitted on March 7, 1994, and as supplemented with additional explanatory information on July 5, 1994. The Director defers decision on, as discussed in: finding No. 5, UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;20(3), concerning contest of violation or amount of civil penalty; finding No. 7, UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;28(1)(a)(ii), concerning recovery of abandoned mine land reclamation costs; and finding No. 9, UCA 40&hyph;10&hyph;28(2)(a), concerning liens against reclaimed abandoned mine land.
