Gen. Kolesnikov Has Not Resigned"] [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Observers do not rule out that the rumors of Mikhail Kolesnikov's resignation have a connection with the intentions of the presidential entourage to go ahead with the so far postponed reorganization of the military agency envisioning the transfer of some of the defense minister's functions to the General Staff chief. In this event, the head of state would like to have a different general filling the position of General Staff chief, who will be subordinated directly to the president. Besides, news of differences among the top command may help discredit the military agency, thus providing an opportunity to reorganize the Defense Ministry and carry through shakeups there even despite the resistance of Pavel Grachev, whose relations with Boris Yeltsin have clearly soured of late.
