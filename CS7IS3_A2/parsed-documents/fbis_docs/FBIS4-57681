The regional proposal will be presented to U.S. Vice President Albert Gore on Tuesday, when he will meet with the Central American presidents in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, diplomatic sources added. Sources told NOTIMEX that the area presidents will propose an interdependence relationship "between a program for peace and an agenda for development" to Gore. According to a preliminary document yet to be discussed by the presidents before presenting it to Gore, a renewed international solidarity, "that goes beyond traditional assistance," will be demanded. The sources said the Central American presidents will propose that the United States negotiate a "parity" or a "full rights" incorporation into NAFTA, whose members are the United States, Mexico, and Canada. The draft document says the presidents will ask the United States to expand access of Central American products to the U.S. market, particularly within the context of the Caribbean Basin Initiative [ICC]. ICC is a U.S. Government program that provides tariff exemptions for Caribbean basin countries. In addition, Rodolfo Doughterty, coordinator of the Central American Parliament's Export and Investment Commission, said that the Central American governments will demand recognition of their countries' productive capabilities. "Central America's incorporation into international markets is the highest priority in the presidents' agenda," he said. Central America is on its way to becoming a "model" region for the solution of conflicts. It is a region interested in consolidating peace and democracy through overall development, a diplomatic source commented. In the 1980's, Central America suffered armed conflicts that resulted in the deaths of thousands and the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people. The region seems to have attained political stability in this decade, however. In 1993, the 14th Regional Presidential Summit stated: "Decades of suffering and sacrifice have left the Central American people with deep scars but also with the necessary political maturity to admit that we need each other and that we cannot develop by excluding others." Nevertheless, the document "Commercial Relations Between Central America and the United States," issued by the UN Program for Development [PNUD], admits that the world market does not operate in the region according to the perfect competition rules. The Central American governments expect NAFTA to yield to them benefits similar to those obtained by Mexico, official sources said. The benefits that Washington grants Central America through ICC are less than those obtained by Mexico because, while Mexico does not have to pay tariffs for the export of its products to the U.S. market, the Central American countries still do, the sources pointed out. Central America's trade with the United States is worth nearly $5.6 billion, with Mexico it is $556 million, and with Canada it is nearly $195 million, according to official sources. Rodolfo Prez, president of Guatemala's General Association of Farmers [AGA], said there is interest in learning what will be the U.S. position regarding Central America. "We desire an opportunity with the United States. We do not want NAFTA to leave us out," he said. According to the Central American countries, NAFTA could divert the trade or the investments of its most important member, the United States, toward Mexico, particularly regarding the export of agricultural products, textiles, and clothing, according to experts. A document issued by the Central American Integration Secretariat, to which NOTIMEX had access, proposes to expand the area covered by ICC and the General Preferences System [SGP] so that more products of the region can receive special treatment. SGP is a system whereby the industrialized countries give a non-reciprocating preferential treatment to developing countries' products. Trade between Central America and the United States deals mostly with agricultural products. This aspiration for preferential treatment was voiced recently by Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon Carpio, who said: "With the end of the Cold War, we have a chance to become incorporated into the region, strengthen the democratic process, combat poverty, ensure respect for human rights, and advance toward modernization."
