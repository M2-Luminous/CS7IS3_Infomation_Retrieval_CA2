Martic conferred in Knin with Deputy Co-chairman of the Conference on the Former Yugoslavia Kai Eide and Russian Ambassador in Zagreb Leonid Kerestedzhiants at a preliminary meeting ahead of the second-round RSK-Krajina talks, opened in March. The republic of Serb Krajina was proclaimed in 1991 by the local Serbs in their ancestral lands within Croatia's Communist-era arbitrary borders, in response to Croatia's violent secession from the former Yugoslav Federation and its attempt to downgrade the local Serbs' status to that of a national minority. Krajina became a U.N.-Protected Area in March 1992. In two referendums so far, the RSK Serbs have voted against their return to Zagreb's jurisdiction. On March 30, RSK and Croatian representatives signed a ceasefire agreement in the Russian embassy in Zagreb. The agreement took effect on April 4. The RSK Parliament believes that the second phase of the talks, which is to include economic, humanitarian and political issues, could be held in any Russian embassy, except the one in Zagreb, said Martic. After the talks, Martic assessed them as very useful and voiced his satisfaction with the degree of Eide's and Kerestedzhiants's understanding for RSK stands. He added that only an impartial stand towards the relations in the area could bring about solutions acceptable to all. Eide, for his part, said that the ceasefire agreement was reached and observed by both sides, adding that the international community was very well prepared for the second-round RSK-Croatia talks which should open as soon as possible. The international community platform on RSK-Croatia humanitarian relations gives priority to the re-opening of traffic and communications. Also to be discussed in terms of priority are: Industrial cooperation, cooperation in the field of energy and water supplies, trade and agriculture and lastly, social welfare policy and humanitarian relations issues. It has been confirmed that the RSK is soon to submit a list of its own priorities. Eide said that if both sides showed good will and readiness to cooperate, the way they did with the ceasefire agreement, the results would soon follow. Kerestedzhiants said that it was all up to Knin and Zagreb, adding that reaching a political settlement would also depend on both sides.
