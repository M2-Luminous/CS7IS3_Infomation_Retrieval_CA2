FR940328-0-00013 FR940328-0-00007 21 CFR Part 558 New Animal Drugs For Use In Animal Feeds; Salinomycin, Bambermycins, Roxarsone AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the animal drug regulations to reflect approval of an abbreviated new animal drug application (ANADA) filed by Hoechst-Roussel Agri-Vet Co. The ANADA provides for using approved single ingredient Type A medicated articles to make Type C medicated broiler feeds containing salinomycin with bambermycins and roxarsone. EFFECTIVE DATE: March 28, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Charles J. Andres, Center For Veterinary Medicine (HFV&hyph;128), Food and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855, 301&hyph;594&hyph;1602. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Hoechst-Roussel Agri-Vet Co., P.O. Box 2500, Somerville, NJ 08876&hyph;1258, filed ANADA 200&hyph;080 which provides for using approved single ingredient Type A medicated articles to make Type C medicated broiler feeds containing 40 to 60 grams per ton (g/t) salinomycin sodium activity, 1 to 2 g/t bambermycins, and 45.4 g/t roxarsone. The Type C feed is used for prevention of coccidiosis in broiler chickens caused by Eimeria tenella, E. necatrix, E. acervulina, E. maxima, E. brunetti , and E. mivati , including some field strains of E. tenella that are more susceptible to roxarsone combined with salinomycin than salinomycin alone; and for improved feed efficiency. ANADA 200&hyph;080 is as a generic copy of Agri-Bio's NADA 134&hyph;185. ANADA 200&hyph;080 is approved as of March 28, 1994. The regulations are amended in 21 CFR 558.95(b)(1)(xi)(b) to indicate that Hoechst-Roussel is an approved source for salinomycin in the combination and in 21 CFR 558.550(a) to indicate that Hoechst-Roussel has an approval for the combination. This approval is for use of single ingredient Type A medicated articles to make Type C medicated feeds. Roxarsone is a Category II drug which, as provided in 21 CFR 558.4, requires an approved form FDA 1900 for making a Type C medicated feed. Use of salinomycin, bambermycins, and roxarsone Type A medicated articles to make Type C medicated feeds requires an approved form FDA 1900. In addition, FDA published a rule in the Federal Register of March 11, 1992 (57 FR 8577) which reflected the change of sponsor of NADA 007&hyph;891 (3&hyph;NITRO (roxarsone) Type A medicated article) from Solvay to A. L. Laboratories. Inadvertently, the references concerning roxarsone in §558.550 were not amended to reflect the new sponsor. At this time, the references are amended accordingly. In accordance with the freedom of information provisions of part 20 (21 CFR part 20) and §514.11(e)(2)(ii) (21 CFR 514.11(e)(2)(ii)), a summary of safety and effectiveness data and information submitted to support approval of this application may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. FDA has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(d)(1)(ii) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significant impact on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required. List of Subjects in 21 CFR Part 558 Animal drugs, Animal feeds.
