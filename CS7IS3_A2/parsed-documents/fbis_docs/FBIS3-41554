Yoshio Hironaka, head of the agency's guidance division, will articulate Japan's wish to tackle forest depletion at home as well as abroad, the sources said. Hironaka will explain that sustainable timber management continues to be a prime conservation goal of the government, they said. Such management involves protecting existing forests and replanting felled areas while still making economic progress. The ITTO member countries agreed at a meeting in June last year to promote sustainable forest management worldwide and not just in tropical regions. European countries, the United States and Canada have already pledged to act on the agreement, the sources said. The agency hopes that Japan's commitment will facilitate stalled talks between advanced and developing countries over revising the international tropical timber agreement which expires next March, they said. The ITTO meeting in Yokohama started November 10 and continues until Wednesday with government and nongovernment representatives from countries producing or consuming tropical timber.
