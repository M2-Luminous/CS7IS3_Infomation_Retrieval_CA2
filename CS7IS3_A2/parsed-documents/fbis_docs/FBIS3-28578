The Nepalese paper DRISTI February 2 noted the United States has been keeping its forces and nuclear weapons in South Korea, always bringing the military importance into relief. The "nuclear issue" of the DPRK is, in fact, a lie and its settlement can be found only through dialogue and talks, the paper said. The Yemeni paper AL-RA'Y AL-'AM said the nuclear capability of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea poses really no threat. The big threat to that country is actually the U.S. nuclear weapons deployed in South Korea, it added.
