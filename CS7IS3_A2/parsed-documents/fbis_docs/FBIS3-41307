Both agencies estimate that returns on the illegal business with alevins (newly-hatched fish) amount to $2.4 million per week. The Pastoral for Indigenous Communities of the Upper Solimoes contends that former members of the gang of Colombian drug kingpin Pablo Escobar, who died recently, might be members of the band of fish smugglers. According to Father Joseney Lira, the Colombians leave their country through the city of Leticia, enter Brazil through Tabatinga, and go to the cities of Atalaia do Norte and Benjamin Constant, Amazonas State, using the Javari River. Lira said: "Most smuggling occurs in these two municipal districts. The Colombians purchase alevins at puny prices and resell them for 600 real cruzeiros each." The smuggled fish reportedly enter Colombia through Leticia, are flown by airplane to Bogota, and then to Miami (United States of America). Amazonas PF [federal police] Superintendent Mauro Sposito said the smuggled fish are also used to camouflage cocaine shipments from Leticia to the United States.
