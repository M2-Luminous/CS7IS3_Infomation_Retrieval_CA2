Slavisa Zabic reports: [Zabic] The strongest offensive of the Bugojno Muslims so far has been going on for three days now. Hundreds of shells of all calibers have hit villages around Srbobran and the city itself, in which civilian targets came under fire today. Very strong and exceptionally well armed Muslim forces, accompanied by -- as Serb military sources report -- many foreign mercenaries yesterday captured Serb villages on the Goles plateau on Mount Komar and razed them to the ground. Today however, the Serb fighters are repelling the assaults by Izetbegovic's extremists, the most powerful so far on the Srbobran battlefield. Both sides have many dead and wounded in the fighting which is gaining impetus hour by hour. In addition to Srbobran, the final aim of the Muslim offensive on this part of the battlefield of the Srpska republic is Jajce. This is why a fresh regrouping of the enemy forces was observed today on roads west of Bugojno.
