Its developers--the firm's owners, the Degermans, father and son--are currently involved with manufacturing a prototype of this chair, which has received the designation RTS (Raise To Standing). The RTS wheelchair can be gradually adjusted for height. Instead of ordinary belts to secure the position of the body, a disabled person can use front and side supports. Electric drives, control of which is carried out using switches located on the armrests and at the chair level, are used to change position and other operations. A person can stand in the chair not only straight up but also with a slight forward incline: that position is recommended as promoting strengthening of the skeletal system. The inventors say that "this is not the first wheelchair that permits a disabled person to assume a vertical position, but it is the first one in which a disabled person can move in the vertical position." To do that, wheels equipped with hand rings which permit a disabled person to rotate the wheels have been made in such a way that they are accessible from any of the disabled person's body positions. These wheels are comparatively small in diameter in order to permit the wheelchair to be maneuvered in a restricted space. The fact that the chair's armrests are retractable downward and the disabled person can leave the chair from one of its sides is another advantage. The RTS wheelchair is specifically recommended for patients who are paraplegics, polio sufferers, or people suffering from rheumatic diseases. A user of the wheelchair obtains greater independence, thanks to which a person's self-confidence increases. From the medical point of view, breathing is eased and digestion and blood circulation improve when the body is in a vertical position. After some refinements, the RTS wheelchair will be ready for testing at the Swedish Institute for Problems of Disabled Persons and then for series production. The item has been patented; its development was financed by the Swedish National Committee for Industrial and Technical Development (NUTEK). Rollei AB has already previously developed and produces several models of special wheelchairs. One of them, "Partner," facilitates accomplishment of various labor operations for the user. It is comfortable, height-adjustable using an electric drive, and has small dimensions. The other chair helps a disabled person to perform his natural hygiene needs.
