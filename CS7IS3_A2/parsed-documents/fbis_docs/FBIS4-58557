"The Hebron massacre, followed by those in 'Afula and Hadera, drastically worsened the situation," Sha'th admits, "but that was just when dialogue proved the winning option: We and the Israelis realized that the only way to defeat the enemies of peace was to force the pace of the negotiations. The agreements are the fruit born of this shared awareness." "We are at the beginning of a journey to freedom. There are still a lot of obstacles to be removed, because 27 years of military occupation have left their mark on every aspect of the life of our community, but now we can look forward with greater optimism: A new dawn is breaking for Palestinians." [De Giovannangeli] What significance does the PLO attribute to the agreement reached in Cairo? [Sha'th] It is the beginning of a journey to freedom that will lead to the constitution of a Palestinian state. Not now, of course, but sooner than envisaged even in the Washington agreement. In this respect, in spite of the issues that it still leaves open, the Cairo agreement marks a point of no return. [De Giovannangeli] On what do you base your optimism? [Sha'th] In the months following the handshake between Rabin and 'Arafat, the messages coming out of the occupied territories all had a common denominator: Demonstrate, immediately, that peace was not only a signature. Well, even though we are running behind schedule, we can now show that life in the territories really can change. Thousands of Palestinians detained for years in Israeli jails can return to their families, and there will be Palestinian police to ensure peace. In a nutshell, peace begins to take a visible shape. And this can only have a positive impact on the attitudes of Palestinians in the territories. [De Giovannangeli] You have called it an agreement that paves the way for a future Palestinian state. On what do you base this assessment? [Sha'th] On a number of factors that, taken together, give the impression of "sovereignty in the making." We will have our airline and the right to fish in Mediterranean waters off the Gaza Strip, where the Israelis have been barring our fishing boats to date. We will have our stamps, an international dialing code different from Israel's, and, above all, identity documents bearing the word "passport." People will begin to see Palestinian harbors, airports, television channels, and economic institutions. Two million people will realize that, for the first time in their lives, they can write the agenda for their own future. We will have full powers over the legislature, over our basic laws, we will be able to decide on our own on the nature of our civic and social life. This is why I refer to a "new dawn" for the Palestinian people. One thing is certain: Jericho and Gaza will not be self-governing ghettos. [De Giovannangeli] Your talk about a "new dawn," but the Hamas fundamentalists could darken it with further terrorist attacks. [Sha'th] Creating peace is the best way to curb extremist tendencies; we have succeeded in concluding the first stage of the negotiations in the light of this awareness. Hamas' strength was enhanced by people's disappointment about the lack of visible signs of change. But now things will change, of that I am convinced, and they will change faster and more visibly if the international community gives our efforts to establish peace concrete support. Massive economic, technological, and scientific investment in the territories is essential to strengthen our autonomy and train a new governing class. This is what we now need, not just words of encouragement. As far as Hamas is concerned, I would add that these last few weeks have seen signs of a new readiness to talk on the part of the movement's leaders. [De Giovannangeli] And what is the PLO's reply? [Sha'th] The unity of the Palestinian people is a valuable asset and, as such, it must be safeguarded. But from now on, all our energy must be channeled into building up our autonomy and achieving prosperity and freedom in the territories. We have to turn over a new leaf, moving on from fighting against the occupying troops to creating our state. If Hamas intends to share in this project, it is welcome. But should it prejudice the outcome with acts of terrorism, we are ready to use any means to put a stop to it. [De Giovannangeli] When may we expect to see 'Arafat in the "autonomous territories"? [Sha'th] It is only a question of weeks, now; it all depends on how long the Israeli withdrawal takes. They are preparing the premises where 'Arafat will have his offices and residence in Jericho. He is due in at the beginning of June, and his arrival will enable us to begin our journey toward our ultimate goal: the Palestinian state.
