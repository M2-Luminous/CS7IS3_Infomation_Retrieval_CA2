The 11 French aid workers, members of the "Premiere urgence" humanitarian group, were detained by Bosnian Serbs on April 8 on charges of trying to smuggle arms to Bosnian Moslems. The workers "did their humanitarian duty and nothing else," the minister told parliament, adding that they had been "set up," with weapons purposefully put aboard their convoy. Their arrest and detention in Bosnian Serb barracks followed a warning by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation that it would bomb Bosnian Serb forces if they did not remove their heavy weapons from around Sarajevo.
