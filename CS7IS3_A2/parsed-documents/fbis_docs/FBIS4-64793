And so, on the day of the interview by means of which [Democratic Party of the Left, PDS, Secretary] Achille Occhetto suddenly jumped into the race to the PDS secretariat, it was above all the majority of the leadership's silence which betrayed the sort of impression produced at the Botteghe Oscure [PDS headquarters] by the secretary's move, by the peremptory way in which the man who ferried the party [from communism to social democratic values] staked out the field for a confrontation which is bound to flare up again after the European elections. However, the silence hardly concealed the concern felt at the tense atmosphere within the PDS -- an armed truce inviting many to postpone any further comment, thus adopting, basically, an attitude which [PDS official] Gavino Angius summarized on everyone's behalf in the following terms: "I would rather not say anything for the moment." [L'UNITA editor] Walter Veltroni kept rigorously silent, taking up the position of a spectator, and so did [PDS Deputy Leader] Massimo D'Alema, the main addressee -- according to the unanimous interpretation at Montecitorio [Parliament] -- of the messages from a secretary who flatly rejected the idea of "transition" being round the corner, and who was prepared to throw down the gauntlet of a congress with opposing motions, in the event that the request for a change of the guard at the Botteghe Oscure were motivated by policy considerations. Inevitably, within the next few days problems will arise in connection with the debate on the reshuffle of the secretariat, as already apparent from a number of venomous remarks, bordering on bad taste, which were leaked here and there. However, nothing was known -- everybody agreed -- about the role that Occhetto intended to assign to the "member for Gallipoli [D'Alema]," although the latter's return to the party leadership was a foregone conclusion. For his part, D'Alema was watching developments like a bystander, saying only that he had started working on an article for L'UNITA, in which he will summarize his political platform "in a more structured way," and without attempting to cash in on the success of an operation which bears his distinctive signature (on the same day that Occhetto welcomed the entire Socialist contingent into the progressive group in the Chamber of Deputies, and Francesco De Martino was elected as the progressive senators' "guarantor" in the upper house). It was [PDS official] Fabio Mussi who stressed that "what should have been done immediately is now being done belatedly," explaining that unity was the prerequisite for the progressives "to be able to carry some weight in this period, which is still transitional in nature, and in which the Right's victory has not closed the game." However, the progressive deputy floor leader did not refrain from commenting on Occhetto's interview: "As regards the method," he said, "Occhetto, quite rightly, is not ruling out any solutions. As regards the substance, clearly we find what may be called a strong vindication of his own merits. In short, the pot is boiling, albeit still slowly, and we will have to wait and see what comes out of it. The main point is that the leadership issue has finally been raised, which is as things should be -- provided that this does not interfere with the need to resume the debate on political issues, to replenish our fuel tanks: Otherwise we will end up with a referendum, and we run the risk of a debacle. Instead, we must go back to the climate of the transition, when political choices and men were closely linked." Mussi's concerns are shared by the party's most significant local leaders, regardless of their position in relation to the fixed stars in the Botteghe Oschure's firmament. However, from Sergio Sabattini's words, Occhetto obtained confirmation that the Emilia PDS's "armored tanks" were siding with him: "I believe the interview in L'UNITA signals a turn for the better," said the secretary from Bologna. "Honestly speaking, this year I did not see any disagreements emerge within the majority that led the party. Am I wrong? Are there any? If there are, it will be a good thing if they are expressed, if majorities and minorities are formed at the congress, and if a leadership is defined on this basis. Otherwise it makes no sense to speak of renewal: Occhetto may not be a secretary for life, but the task of guiding the completion of the PDS's formation, and of opening up a stage of broader alliance, falls to him." Sabattini, one of the staunchest advocates of a "federal party," had a further message for the Botteghe Oscure: "They must realize in Rome," he stressed, "that organizations with a strong membership and strong support from the voters, such as the Emilia PDS, are no longer prepared to passively accept choices that do not involve the real party. Occhetto is accused of being a centralist? All right then, the answer to that, if we want to prepare for the congress, is for at least three regional secretaries to join the new Secretariat, and of course I have in mind those from Emilia, Tuscany, and one of the southern regions in which we won. If we carry on along the old path, I believe a very firm reaction can be expected from the stronger organizations."
