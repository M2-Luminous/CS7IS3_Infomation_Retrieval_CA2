All the measures will be put into effect starting this year. The Ministry of Finance believes this move tallies with the requirements of building a socialist market economic structure, conforms with the international practice, and can help enterprises compete with each other on a fair and equal footing. Major measures are as follows: --Rates of income tax collected from domestic-funded enterprises will be standardized at 33 percent, while the regulatory business tax levied on state-owned large and medium enterprises will be abolished. However, in consideration of the poor economic efficiency and inability to submit more profits to higher authorities, the Ministry of Finance has introduced two preferential tariff rates: Enterprises with an annual tax and profit amounting to less than 30,000 yuan can enjoy a reduced tax rate of 18 percent, while enterprises with an annual tax and profit of between 30,000 and 100,000 yuan can enjoy a reduced tax rate of 27 percent. --The practice of repaying loans before paying taxes will be abolished. Enterprises are required, without exception, to use their own retention funds to repay the principal of loans they have borrowed for fixed assets investment and no deduction will be made before they pay tax. --A system of after-tax profit distribution on state-owned assets investment will be set up gradually, featuring distribution of dividends in proportion to shares, allotment of profits according to capital ratio, and submission of after-tax profits. In view of the realistic situation in enterprises and according to the state industrial policy, enterprises' task of technical transformation, and other realistic conditions, the Ministry of Finance is considering the possibility of putting into effect in most fully state-owned old enterprises (with the dividing line drawn at 31 December 1993) a practice by which such enterprises will not submit profits to higher authorities after paying income tax; at the same time, income tax paid by enterprises with narrow profit margins will not be returned to the paying units. --Budget readjustment funds levied on state-owned enterprises by key construction foundations, including energy and communications foundations, will be abolished. The increased financial revenue should be earmarked primarily for the repayment of enterprise fixed assets investment loans. --Loans borrowed by enterprises long ago can be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. We need to study and resolve the issue of "changing allocation of funds into loans" in line with the structural reform of the investment system. Those enterprises which really lack the ability to repay can be allowed to postpone their repayment upon examination and verification by the banks. Meanwhile, banks can check their bad debts through careful examination and verification and then offset them with reserves for bad loans according to relevant stipulations; at the same time, they can also raise the rate of extraction of their bad debt reserves. --Farming [bao shui 0545 4451] of taxes as well as tax exemptions not stipulated in the state's Taxation Law will be abolished. --Preferential tax policies granted to foreign-invested enterprises will remain unchanged.
