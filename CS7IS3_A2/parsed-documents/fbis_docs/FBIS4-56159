Marijuana and cocaine continue to be sold at a rapid pace despite state attorneys' revelations that numbers game people are linked to drug trafficking. Last week, a truck coming from Bolivia ensured a 30-day supply of cocaine to all the southern districts of Rio de Janeiro and to some of the northern districts. The truck, which carried hardwood, brought 100 kg of the drug from the Chapare Region, where there are large coca leaf plantations. Drug trafficker Joao Matuto, a narcotics trade leader in the Rocinha slum, was responsible for this shipment. Matuto sent a message to the state attorneys: "This business about Castor de Andrade has political roots; it will end up as nothing." Half of the cargo that arrived in Rocinha is enough to supply the slum for one month. The other half will be stored or resold to drug traffickers linked to Joao Matuto. The drugs were purchased for $1,500 per kg in Bolivia, but will reach consumer's hands at a price almost seven times higher. It will be sold for an average of $10 per gram. A drug trafficker linked to Matuto asserted: "If there are indeed links with the numbers game people, it must be in relation to international drug trafficking. It has nothing to do with us." Without worrying about defending the numbers game people, the drug traffickers explain that the retail sale of the drugs does not require financing to reach the streets. "Those who are trusted can simply take the drugs and pay for them later. The sales profits guarantee that those who sold the drugs will pay for them," he added. Drug traffickers Joao Matuto, Jorge Luis of the Acari slum, and Miltinho da Ilha are considered the Rio de Janeiro State drug trafficking barons. One step below are drug traffickers Orlando Jogador from Leopoldina District and Pedrinho Maluco of the so-called Western Zone of the city. They are the only ones capable of ensuring the arrival of large shipments of drugs, similar to that which arrived in the Rocinha slum last week. The rest of the drug arrives in the country thanks to mules (or matutos) who travel to Bolivia or Colombia, which are drug producing countries, and then bring the drugs to the slums in their backpacks. There are nearly 300 of these small drug traffickers in Rio de Janeiro. They always carry drugs, but never more than 5 kg of marijuana or cocaine. According to arms traffickers, the weapons market functions in a slightly different manner. Most of the arms enter the country through the airport, and depend on federal police cooperation. Arms circulation, an illegal weapon can change hands between policemen and drug traffickers several times, makes it less necessary to import arms than drugs. Policemen seize AR-15 rifles, HK submachine guns, and 9 mm pistols from criminals. Policemen then sell these arms, and they end up in the hands of the criminals again. Currently an AR-15 rifle is worth $4,000, an HK submachine gun $3,500, and a pistol $1,500. The arms that do not arrive on planes are brought to the country by the mules (or matutos) and follow routes similar to those followed by the drugs. They can come from Paraguay, Bolivia, or Colombia. The number of arms mules is much smaller than that of drug mules. In the Rocinha slum, for example, there are only four or five arms mules. To reach the slums with marijuana or cocaine, the drug traffickers must duck policemen at the control posts along the highways connecting Rio de Janeiro to foreign borders, and count on the policemen's cooperation to do so. Today, the highways that are used most often to bring drugs or arms into the country begin at the Bolivian, Colombian, and Paraguayan borders and cross the states of Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Parana, and Sao Paulo. Bolivian cocaine crosses to the Brazilian side through the town of San Matias. From there on, the trucks follow a dirt road up to the city of Caceres, 180 km from Cuiaba (Mato Grosso State). There they find the first obstacle: a Federal Highway Police control post that has to be eluded with the help of the local farmers, who allow the mules to cross their land. The route then crosses Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul State, along the BR-163 highway. The route then follows BR-262 highway up to Tres Lagoas on the Sao Paulo State border, and reaches Rio de Janeiro through the Presidente Dutra Highway. The strategic points in the most used highway arms route are Pedro Juan Caballero, Paraguay, and its neighboring Brazilian town of Ponta Pora. To reach Rio de Janeiro, the arms cross Dourados and Nova Alvorada (Mato Grosso do Sul State), and Presidente Epitacio (Sao Paulo State). Other drugs and arms shipments arrive in small planes that fly from Colombia to Sao Paulo and then land in small clandestine airports at the town of Angra dos Reis on the so-called Green Coast. The shipments then reach Rio de Janeiro through the Rio-Santos highway. The shipments are obtained from the producers through a trust system: The drug is paid for only after it is sold to consumers.
