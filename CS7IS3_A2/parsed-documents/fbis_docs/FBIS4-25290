Han briefed Qian on the latest developments centering on the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. Stating China's point of view on the current situation, Qian pointed out that, with the efforts of the parties concerned, not long ago the development on the issue was in a positive direction. But recently, he continued, due to disputes between the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea about the inspection of the replacement of fuel rods the situation has taken a sudden turn, and the Chinese side has shown much concern about this. He stated that the Chinese side advocates two basic targets for efforts to solve the issue: the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and the safeguarding of peace and stability there. He said that these targets are in the fundamental interests of all the countries in Northeast Asia. Facing the current difficulty, Qian pointed out, it is particularly necessary for the concerned parties to keep calm and restraint, and not to close the door to negotiations rashly. He stated, "We call on all the parties directly concerned to make further efforts to start talks so as to leave room and keep possibilities alive for the settlement of the issue." Qian pointed out that sanctions can not help solve the issue; on the contrary, sanctions may lead to results that none of the concerned parties is willing to see. Han arrived here yesterday evening on a working visit.
