FR940412-1-00031 FR940412-1-00008 The average hourly charge for pilotage services would be set to generate sufficient revenues to cover operating expense and the return on investment allowance (including Federal taxes, if any). Adjustment for Inflation This NPRM proposes to project annual inflation factors to the succeeding navigation season, reflecting the gradual increase in cost throughout the season. These inflation factors would be applied to the actual costs of the pilot organizations, other than for pilot compensation, in computing the rate necessary to achieve the target ROI. The factors would not be applied to pilot compensation costs, which are estimated separately. This NPRM proposes to project the actual annual experienced changes in the average costs per pilot assignment for each pilotage area after the initial two years of cost inflation under this NPRM's proposed rate methodology. The initial two years of cost adjustment would be based on the preceding year's change in the North Central Region's Consumer Price Index, as calculated by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Costs not subject to inflation (depreciation, for example) would not be adjusted for this initial period. Alternate methods of cost projection proposed during the comment period of this rule would be carefully considered. Part A.2. Recognition of Costs for Ratemaking Purposes Virtually all regulated rates contain economic incentives, penalties, or limits. This NPRM has already mentioned one such standard sometimes used, an artificial debt/equity ratio for return on investment. This NPRM proposes one explicit economic standard for Great Lakes pilotage ratemakings_recognition of lease expenses only to the extent that they either: (a) Approximate open market costs (for those leased assets with readily available markets); or (b) approximate ownership cost (for those leased assets with limited alternative markets, or which were obtained through transaction with affiliated companies.) This NPRM also proposes to place expenses that appear excessive under greater scrutiny than in the past. Regulators may disallow expenses, subject to appeal by the pilot associations, as excessive or unrelated to the provision of pilotage services. Finally, while the Coast Guard is unaware of the use of other than the straight-line method of recording depreciation expense by the pilot organizations, this NPRM does not propose to recognize, for rate-setting purposes, depreciation expenses on other than a straight-line basis. Recognition of Lease Expenses Economic organizations lease equipment or other assets for a number of operational or financial reasons. This NPRM proposes no general objection to the leasing of assets. However, lease transactions, and lease transactions with related companies in particular, are subject to two general guidelines in public ratesetting. The first guideline allows recognition of lease expense with no adjustment should the lease terms generally approximate the market conditions for the leased asset. The second guideline allows the recognition of lease expenses only to the extent that the lease cost approximates the cost of owning the asset. This NPRM proposes to recognize lease costs to the extent that they generally approximates open market costs, subject to the condition that a readily available alternative supplier for the leased asset exists. Should there be no readily available alternate supplier, recognition of lease costs would be limited to the approximate cost of ownership, including a return to capital. Since related-party transactions by definition are not open market transactions, this NPRM proposes to generally apply the more stringent guideline to all related-party transactions. (See 14 CFR 399.43, for example). This NPRM proposes to amend the financial reporting requirements to require that lease costs be recorded in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) publication FASB&hyph;13, including subsequent rulings on this subject by the FASB. Part A.3. Ancillary Charges Several charges have traditionally been levied for ancillary pilotage services, such as docking/undocking and moving to an anchorage, as well as penalty charges, such as for delay or cancellation. Revenues received for these services have been included as part of the overall revenues received by the pilot organizations in estimating the need for rate changes. However, accepting these revenues as general revenues does not tie the revenues received to the provision of a service or the incursion of a cost. For example, overhead costs (non-pilot compensation costs) are incurred in assigning a pilot. Should that order be later cancelled, the revenue received from the cancellation charge is reported as cancellation charge revenue, but is not linked to the overhead cost of assigning the pilot.
