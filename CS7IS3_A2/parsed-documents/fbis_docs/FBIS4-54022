They have arrived at the assessment that there is no need to issue preferred stock to improve their bank equity position, because an improvement in stock prices has caused a rise in the equity of the respective banks. There had been the view that the issuance of preferred stock on the part of banks would translate into the diversion of a large amount of funds and an adverse effect on the stock market, but that issue can now be avoided. Preferred stock does not provide for voting by the holder, but offers a higher dividend than that payable on the common stock. Financial institutions consider preferred stock as a favorable instrument for increasing equity. Issuance of preferred stock requires a revision of the bank charter authorizing the board of directors to take the issuing action. Sakura Bank, which was behind the industry in improving its equity position, revised its charter at the shareholders' meeting in June 1993 and in March 1994 issued 100 million yen in preferred stock. Since the sale went well, the majority of the leading banks considered taking similar action, but decided against such revision of their charters. The reason given was that the dividend obligation would be higher than with common shares and would be a costly action. Further, a rise of equity ratios (based on a broad definition of equity ratio in comparison with a calculation of assets considering various risks) at the banks concerned above the required level of 8 percent lessened the need to replenish equity, providing another reason to forgo a revision of charters. The Bank of Tokyo equity ratio stood at 10 percent at the end of March 1994, and it reached 9 percent at the Industrial Bank of Japan, which was relatively low. The unfavorable attitude of the Ministry of Finance [MOF] toward charter revisions also served as a reason for the banks' decisions to forgo the changes. In administrative guidance issued in February 1994, the MOF had encouraged the issuance of preferred stock, but after March it came to the decision that any attempt to raise large amounts of capital would have an adverse effect on the supply and demand situation in the capital markets and reversed itself in asking that the banks forgo their plans to revise their charters. The MOF had estimated that if bank charters were revised, banks would issue preferred stock en mass and soak up about 1 trillion yen in funds from the capital markets. It appears that the MOF had come to the conclusion that any large-scale funding actions by banks would lead to a drop in stock prices.
