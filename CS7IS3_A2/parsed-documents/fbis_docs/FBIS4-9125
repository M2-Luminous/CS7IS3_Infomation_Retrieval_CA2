FBIS4-9125 "dreeu077_s_94002" FBIS-EEU-94-077 Daily Report 21 Apr 1994 SLOVENIA Personnel Changes Following Jansa's Replacement Personnel Changes Following Jansa's Replacement AU1304140794 AU1304140794 BFN [Editorial Report] Ljubljana DELO in Slovene of 5 April on page 2 carries a report by Vladimir Vodusek about personnel changes in the Defense Ministry and various military services following the dismissal of the former Defense Minister Janez Jansa, which the author sees as the beginning "of the disbandment of the Moris special brigade and the intensive banishment of Jansa's influence in the army." As is reported, Tone Krkovic, commander of the special brigade Moris, and Darko Njavro, deputy security commander of the Moris special brigade, were relieved of their posts. Vodusek writes that these changes took place before the inquiry commission produced its final report about the incident in Depala Vas, which resulted in Jansa's ousting. Although Krkovic proposed Boris Mikuz as his replacement, Vodusek writes, ``[new Defense Minister] Jelko Kacin decided for Vojko Pavlin from the Moste Polje training center, who was until the July war the commander of the Ljubljana province, and was, together with Miha Butara, replaced by Janez Slapar. The new commander will probably set up an entirely new office of assistants. In political circles, one could have detected, for quite some time, plans to reduce the numerical and striking power of the special brigade, which also got its epilogue in the accusations about the coup, the replacement of Janez Jansa, the dismissal of Anton Krkovic, and the stripping of Darko Njavro's authority. "Beside Tone Krkovic, both [defense] state secretaries Franci Znidarsic and Gorazd Vidrih offered their resignations. Jelko Kacin did not accept the resignation of Albin Gutman, commander of the republican Territorial Defense Headquarters, although one could have noticed from the media that he `allegedly stood too much to the side' in the Smolnikar case. On the other hand, government adviser Miran Bogataj, who took over the internal investigation of Milan Smolnikar's arrest and in the [parliamentary] commissions supposedly advocated Janez Jansa too openly while did not identify with the views of the Liberal Demoracts enough, will be promoted to a state secretary." As the article says further, Milan Zver, the chief of Jansa's cabinet, and press representative Nika Dolinar are also leaving the Defense Ministry and so is Maja Stojnic, who is in charge of the international liaison. "Big surprise are the rumors that the hitherto chief of the Government Information Bureau Mile Setinc would become the head of the military security service [VOMO]. Dusan Mikus, as a moderate professional agent, is probably really not the must suitable man for the potential use of VOMO for political purposes, however the military intelligence service is, amidst the general chaos, the only satisfactory constant in the intelligence sphere," Vodusek writes.
