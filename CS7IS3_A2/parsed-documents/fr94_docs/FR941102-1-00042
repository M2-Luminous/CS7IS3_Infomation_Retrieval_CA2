FR941102-1-00042 FR941102-1-00007 The third element, which requires the VMT Offset SIP to comply with the post-1996 RFP and attainment requirements of the Act, will be due on November 15, 1994, the statutory deadline for those broader submissions. The USEPA believes it is reasonable to extend the deadline for this element to the date on which the post-1996 RFP and attainment SIPs are due for the same reasons it is reasonable to extend the deadline for the second element. First, it is arguably impossible for a State to make the showing required by section 182(d)(1)(A) for the third element until the broader demonstrations have been developed by the State. Moreover, allowing States to develop the comprehensive strategy to address post-1996 RFP and attainment by providing a fuller opportunity to assure that the TCM elements comply with the broader RFP and attainment demonstrations, will result in a better program for reducing emissions in the long term. On November 17, 1993, Indiana submitted to USEPA documentation to fulfill the first and second elements of the VMT&hyph;Offset SIP. A public hearing was held on December 14, 1993, and documentation on the public hearing was submitted to complete the SIP revision request. Indiana does not at this time anticipate the need for additional TCMs to meet the attainment demonstration requirement but will submit any necessary TCMs with the attainment demonstration SIP. Evaluation of the State Submittal Section 182(d)(1)(A) of the Act requires the State to offset any growth in emissions from growth in VMT. As discussed in the General Preamble, the purpose is to prevent a growth in motor vehicle emissions from canceling out the emission reduction benefits of the federally mandated programs in the Act. The USEPA interprets this provision to require that sufficient measures be adopted so that projected motor vehicle volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions will never be higher during the ozone season in one year than during the ozone season in the year before. When growth in VMT and vehicle trips would otherwise cause a motor vehicle emissions upturn, this upturn must be prevented. The emissions level at the point of upturn becomes a ceiling on motor vehicle emissions. This requirement applies to projected emissions in the years between the submission of the SIP revision and the attainment deadline and is above and beyond the separate requirements for the RFP and the attainment demonstrations. The ceiling level is defined therefore, up to the point of upturn, as motor vehicle emissions that would occur in the ozone season of that year, with VMT growth, if all measures for that area in that year were implemented as required by the Act. When this curve begins to turn up due to growth in VMT or vehicle trips, the ceiling becomes a fixed value. The ceiling line would include the effects of Federal measures such as new motor vehicle standards, phase II RVP controls, and reformulated gasoline, as well as the Act mandated SIP requirements. The State of Indiana has demonstrated in its submittal of November 17, 1993, that the predicted growth in VMT in Lake and Porter Counties, Indiana, is not expected to result in a growth in motor vehicle emissions that will negate the effects of the reductions mandated by the Act. Further, Indiana has projected motor vehicle emissions to the year 2007 and, using the most current socioeconomic data, has not predicted an upturn in motor vehicle emissions. In the event that the projected socioeconomic data and associated VMT grow more rapidly than currently predicted, Indiana is required by section 182(c)(5) to track actual VMT starting with 1996 and every three years there after to demonstrate that the actual VMT is equal to or less than the projected VMT. TCMs will be required to offset VMT that is above the projected levels (section 182(c)(5)). The VMT offset submittal from Indiana dated November 17, 1993, contains the final report ``TCMs to Offset Emissions from VMT Growth in Northwestern Indiana.'' The report used the most current socioeconomic data and the travel network model in conjunction with the MOBILE5a to estimate mobile source emissions to the attainment year of 2007. This report also documents the progress Indiana has made in evaluating TCMs to reduce growth in VMT and thus reduce emissions. Indiana may choose to take credit for TCM emission reductions as part of the post 1996 RFP requirement or to meet the attainment requirement. Not only has Indiana evaluated the effectiveness and predicted impact of a number of TCMs but actual implementation of selected TCMs has been ongoing. For example, a new inter city bus route to link the cities of Hammond, East Chicago and Gary, Indiana has been started. These three cities have operated established intra city bus routes for many years and this is the first route to link the already existing transit services for these cities.
