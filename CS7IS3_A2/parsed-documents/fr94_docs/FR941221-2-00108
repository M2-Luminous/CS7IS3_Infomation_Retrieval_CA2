FR941221-2-00108 FR941221-2-00075 Rule 127 also provides that if the member fails to consult with the specialist prior to announcing the block cross to the Crowd, he is responsible for filling the reasonable needs of the specialist at the clean-up price. If, however, the member determined that too much stock would be lost to the market and announced that public orders would not receive stock at the clean-up price as described above, the member is not required to give the specialist stock at the clean-up price. If there is a disagreement between the specialist and the member representing the block orders as to the extent of the specialist's needs, the rule suggests the use of a Floor Official to resolve the differences. The NYSE proposes to change the procedure for crossing block orders outside the current quotation in several respects. The proposal alters a member's obligations to fill public orders at the clean-up price and removes the block positioner's responsibility for maintaining the aftermarket when the block positioner has not satisfied the reasonable needs of the specialist. Finally, the rule change requires documentation when an agency block cross outside the prevailing quotation is executed and public orders limited to the clean-up price or better are not executed at the clean-up price. 9 9 The rule change also clarifies the rule for block transactions in which all or a part of the block is for a member or member organization's own account. The rule change states that if all or any portion of a block that a member is representing will establish or increase the member's position, the member must fill at the clean-up price public orders limited to the clean-up price or better before any amount may be retained for the member organization's account. However, if the member is covering a short position or liquidating a long position, it is not required to fill at the clean-up price orders limited to the clean-up price or better. The rule change would eliminate the requirement that a member representing an agency block cross with size precedence at the clean-up price must fill public orders limited to the clean-up price that are on the specialist's book, up to a minimum amount of 1000 shares or 5% of the total amount crossed at the clean-up price, whichever is greater. Instead, when a member determines that the amount of stock that would be lost to the market is excessive and announces to the Crowd that stock will not be given at the clean-up price, the block transaction is entitled to priority at the clean-up price after the member has followed the procedures of NYSE Rule 76 and filled orders at the bid. The Exchange states that the deletion of the current requirement is appropriate to conform the agency cross principles of Rule 127 with the agency cross principles of Rule 72(b), the Exchange's rule for agency block crosses at or within the best NYSE quotation. 10 Under NYSE Rule 72(b), public orders may participate in proposed cross transactions by providing price improvement to one side of the cross, but cannot trade with or ``break up'' crossed orders at the clean-up (cross) price. 10 NYSE Rule 72(b) states that the member's bid or offer is entitled to priority at the cross price, irrespective of pre-existing bids or offers at the cross price. See also Securities Exchange Act Release No. 31343 (October 21, 1992), 57 FR 48645 (October 27, 1992) (order approving amendments to NYSE Rule 72). In addition, the rule change removes the reference to the block positioner's responsibility for maintaining the aftermarket when the block positioner has not satisfied the reasonable needs of the specialist. The Exchange believes that it is appropriate to place responsibility for the aftermarket on the specialist rather than the block positioner because the specialist is otherwise responsible under NYSE Rule 104 for the maintenance of a fair and orderly market. The rule change continues to state that the member should be prepared to fill the needs of the specialist, and that if the specialist and the member representing the block orders disagree as to the extent of the needs of the specialist, they should consult with a Floor Official. The rule change adds that, as provided in NYSE Rule 92, specialists may not retain any stock for their own accounts obtained at a price at which they hold executable, but unfilled, orders. Finally, the rule change adds in the Supplementary Material to Rule 127 a requirement that, if a member represents only agency orders on both sides and does not fill public orders limited to the clean-up price or better at the clean-up price, the member must complete any documentation of the trade that the Exchange may require. The rule change also amends NYSE Rule 72(b) to include the same documentation requirements for agency crosses.
