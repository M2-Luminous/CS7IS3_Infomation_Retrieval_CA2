Mayor Huang Ju met little opposition when he informed Beijing of the decision last week, a senior Shanghai government official said yesterday on condition of anonymity. Although the controversial tax was to be levied from January 1 this year, Shanghai will delay implementation until 1995 at the earliest, the official said. Meanwhile, the city government, which is counting on receiving ample foreign property investment for green-field sites in the new Pudong area and for inner-city redevelopment, will exempt all primary land-development projects from the tax. "Even if the central government decides to include these projects, we will give them a permanent tax holiday," the official said. The news will come as a blow to the State Taxation Administration in Beijing, which has asserted all along that the tax must be levied this year in line with the State Council's edict last month. Beijing's grip on the matter is expected to fall apart in the next few weeks as other cities and provinces announce their own delays and exemptions. Hong Kong businessmen have voiced strong concern about the tax, saying it would scare away property investments. Some have made plans to lobby officials in Beijing and current projects are believed to be on hold.
