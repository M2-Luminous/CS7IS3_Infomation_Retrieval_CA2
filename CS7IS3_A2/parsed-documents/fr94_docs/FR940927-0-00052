FR940927-0-00052 FR940927-0-00007 (19) Navajo EPA stated that agreements for cooperative projects by the Navajo Nation with any Federal or State agency should be entered into with the advice of the Navajo Nation Department of Justice and the Division of Natural Resources, in addition to the Intergovernmental Relations Committee and Resources Committee of the Navajo Nation Council already indicated in Title IV, section 413(b) of the Navajo Nation AMLR Code of 1987. SMCRA does not require Tribes or States to conform to a specific administrative process but does provide the power and authority to engage in cooperative projects. (See finding No. 1.e.) OSM reviews any cooperative projects during its annual oversight of the Navajo Nation plan and AMLR grant program and determines at that time whether such projects are conducted in a manner that meets the requirements of SMCRA and the implementing Federal regulations. (20) Navajo EPA stated that Title IV, section 413(d) of the Navajo Nation AMLR Code of 1987 should require that NAMLRD will turn over management and operation of water treatment facilities to the appropriate Tribal department, which will have the continuing staffing and expertise to run said facilities in perpetuity. This provision of the code is substantively identical to section 413(d) of SMCRA. SMCRA does not require that the management and operation of such a treatment plant be turned over to another agency for continued management and operation. The administration of the Navajo Nation's AMLR program is addressed during OSM's annual oversight and any deficiencies in the program are handled through the oversight process. If, during oversight, OSM determines that a problem exists with effective management of any part of the program, OSM would require resolution of the problem. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) EPA responded on June 13, 1994, with the following comments (administrative record No. NA&hyph;220). (1) EPA commented that the Navajo Nation plan does not address or reference environmental requirements that may be applicable under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and that sites found to pose an environmental problem should be coordinated through NEPA to identify the appropriate clean up remedies and standards. OSM responds, as it did at comment No. 2 of the Navajo EPA comments, that Title IV of SMCRA and the implementing Federal regulations do not require specific reclamation standards. Prior to the Navajo Nation initiating AMLR construction projects, OSM complies with the requirements of NEPA to identify environmental impacts and mitigation measures.
