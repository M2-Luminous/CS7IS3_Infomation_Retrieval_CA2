This material contains the Slovak Republic Defense Doctrine, which incorporates a set of official principles and views on the Slovak Republic's defense, preventing war, the structure of the Armed Forces, and the means of conducting an armed struggle in defense of the state. Asserting Slovakia's national interests, with the aim of guaranteeing its territorial integrity and the inviolability or unchangeability of its internationally recognized state borders, is among the fundamental principles of the Defense Doctrine. In its Defense Doctrine, the Slovak Republic avows that, under no circumstances, will it either precipitate an armed conflict or initiate one against another state. According to the doctrine, the Slovak Republic will not condone the propaganda of war and armed force, terrorism, chauvinism, fascism, race and class hatred, or national and religious intolerance. Slovakia will not give up its right to take part in establishing collective security and therefore will strive to join NATO and the Western European Union (WEU). Apart from the Defense Doctrine, the Slovak Government also approved other important material drafted by the Defense Ministry--the Principles for the Slovak Republic's National Security. This document was drafted in cooperation with the Interior Ministry and the Foreign Ministry. The principles establish a political, legal, and methodological basis for the Republic's national defense system. At the same time, they represent a systematized series of general objectives in issues such as the sovereignty of the state, territorial integrity, and Slovakia's equality, and in guaranteeing the citizen's basic rights and freedoms. Binding international documents, the Slovak Constitution, and recommendations and information from analyses of the security systems of comparable European states were endorsed in the drafting of the Principles for the Slovak Republic's National Security. Slovakia's security is an element of the broader framework of European and global security. The Slovak Republic relies on its own forces. However, at the same time, it places emphasis on establishing new international relations. In its objectives, it is counting, first and foremost, on NATO, the WEU, the CSCE, and the United Nations. Slovakia considers stable, conflict-free, and correct relations with its immediate neighbors to be an important aspect of guaranteeing its national security. It is interested in activity within the Visegrad Group and the Central European Initiative. The Slovak Republic is aware of the need for equilibrium in its relations with all European states. At the moment, it is achieving this aim by means of bilateral treaties. It is also aware of the positive role filled by the U.S. presence in Europe and is in favor of its preservation.
