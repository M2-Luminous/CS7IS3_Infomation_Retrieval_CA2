He said the U.S.-proposed halting of remittances to North Korea would be effective, with other nations expected to cooperate if the United Nations decides to adopt such a resolution. The United States has proposed a two-staged sanction plan against North Korea over its refusal to allow full international nuclear inspections. The halting of remittances is included in the second stage. Meanwhile, the U.S. is making last-ditch efforts to solve the issue through negotiations with former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who is now visiting Pyongyang. "I must refrain from commenting because the North Korean issue is delicate with new developments in the making," said Fujii in an apparent reference to Carter's visit. He noted that the Foreign Ministry is now tackling the issue and his ministry has not received any "details" over the U.S.-proposed sanctions. Turning to the domestic issue, Fujii said the recent rises in long-term market rates reflected "market perception over the global trend and slight brightness in Japan's economy." But he refused to comment directly on the interest rate directions, unlike Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno who said in his press remarks Wednesday that long-term rates would settle at levels reflecting the economic state in the longer run.
