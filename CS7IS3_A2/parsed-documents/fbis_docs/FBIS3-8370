Three of the five passengers on the Spanish air force plane were injured. The three-member crew escaped injury, NATO said. NATO officials here and the Spanish defense ministry in Madrid said they did not know where the gunfire came from. NATO officials in Naples said it was hit by ground-based anti-aircraft fire. In Zagreb, the Croatian defense ministry said the plane was attacked by separatist Serbs who control the Krajina region of the former Yugoslav republic. The plane was damaged by the mid-air explosion of one of two missiles fired from the ground, the ministry said in a statement. NATO said the plane was hit in the right motor and the tail while transporting passengers from the capital Zagreb to the port city of Split in the south. The NATO supreme command in Brussels said the three wounded were from France, Britain and the United States. The plane made an emergency landing on the island of Krk, which serves the Croatian coastal city of Rijeka, NATO officials said. A Croatian government official in Zagreb, asking not to be named, suggested that the plane may have been fired on after it strayed off course. "The plane probably mistook its air corridor and deviated from its route," he said. The twin-engined CASA 212 aircraft is designed to transport either 16 or 19 passengers, depending on the model. It can also be used for transporting wounded, aerial photography and training missions.
