Following the snaps of [President Scalfaro's daughter] Marianna Scalfaro and architect Adolfo Salab in the Via del Babuino, images which one suspects of being inspired by 007s, another photograph is causing embarrassment to the Interior Ministry's civilian secret service. It is the one depicting SISDE's number two, Prefect Antonio Barrel, at the baptism of the son of a supposed narcotics traffic boss, Maurizio Martina from Puglia. The photo is in a dossier opened by public prosecutors Leone De Castris of Brindisi and Francesco Mandoi of Lecce, who hold most of the key information in the investigation into the Pugliese narcotics trafficker. For the time being the two prosecutors have not taken any measures. Nonetheless, the prefect's presence at the ceremony is raising serious questions both outside and inside the Interior Ministry. Barrel was appointed SISDE deputy director on 3 June last, after heading the Brindisi Prefecture since 1991. On arrival at the capital of the Messapian region, he was immediately confronted with the invasion of the Albanian ``boat people,'' 20,000 of whom landed on the Pugliese coast that year. Apart from the refugee emergency, the prefect got himself in the limelight by proposing to the Interior Ministry that it suspend local councillors and introduce initiatives against contraband and the practice of hiring local youths for criminal purposes. Employed by the Interior Ministry in 1953, appointed questor in 1982 (in Naples, where he remained three and a half years), Barrel was called to SISDE immediately after the scandal of the reserved funds, earning the acclaim of Interior Minister Nicola Mancino (``He was indeed a good choice'') and PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] member Luciano Violante, chairman of the anti-Mafia committee (``In Brindisi he succeeded in giving an extraordinary impetus to all the administrative departments reporting to him''). Whilst Barrel was in this long-vacant office, the Salento region police came into possession of a compromising family album belonging to Maurizio Martina, not just a Mr. Nobody in Brindisi. According the weekly L'ESPRESSO, Martina is known for ``the unscrupulous nature of his financial dealings, his widespread and at first glance unjustifiable property holdings, and for being related, through his wife, with the U.S. bosses: His wife's daughter married a member of the Gambino family.'' Arrested together with a Turk and a Pakistani, with whom he is suspected of narcotics trafficking on a vast scale, leading to the seizure of 60 kg of heroin, Martina invited Barrel and a well-known Pugliese politician, Socialist member Biagio Marzo, former chairman of the bicameral commission on state participation in industry, to his son's baptism. In the photos, the prefect and Marzio appear, holding the newly born child at the time of the baptism. Whilst the Pugliese magistracy is trying to shed light on the activities of Martina and his friendships ``above all suspicion,'' the enquiry continues in Rome into SISDE's black funds. Yesterday former civilian secret service Director Alessandro Voci was interrogated at length. The prefect denied ever having appropriated funds or having ``paid a salary,'' as head of the 007s, to the then Interior Minister Enzo Scotti. Also interrogated for five hours was his predecessor at the head of the service, Riccardo Malpica, who replied to all the judges' questions. Meanwhile, from his secret refuge, one of the SISDE officials still hiding from justice, Michele Finocchi, threatened legal action and denied presumed links between financiers linked to the Magliana Band [crime gang] and the service's cover-up company. ``The only company in which I have an interest,'' Finocchi stated, ``is the one which is the registered owner of the apartment in which I am living.'' Finally, a meeting is scheduled today between Prince Rainier of Monaco and the capital's well-known criminal lawyer Nono Marazzita, 007 Maurizio Broccoletti's defender. At the center of the discussion, which will take place at the Monte Carlo Royal Palace, is the extradition request issued by the Italian authorities.
