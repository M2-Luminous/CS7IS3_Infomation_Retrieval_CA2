Headed by Wang Jiying, commander of the North China Sea Fleet of the Chinese Navy, the formation consists of a deep-sea rescue vessel, a destroyer and an escort vessel, both equipped with missile launchers. The call-in visit is in return for a visit made by a Russian naval fleet to eastern China's Qingdao last August. The formation was honored first by a gun salute from the Russian Navy stationed in Vladivostok, and then at a quayside welcoming ceremony attended by commanders of Russia's Pacific Fleet. Wang told the press that the Armed Forces of China and Russia are increasing their exchange programs, and the friendly relationship between the two navies is on the rise. He also noted that closer ties between the two navies would serve the interests not only of the two peoples, but also of the peace and stability of the Asia-Pacific region and of the world as a whole.
