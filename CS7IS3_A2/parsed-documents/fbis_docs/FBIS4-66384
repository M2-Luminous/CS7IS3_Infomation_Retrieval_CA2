The purpose of this plan is to promote industries' productivity by rebuilding China's lagging production industries. Technologies considered vital to China's economic prosperity and development for the 199Os and the next century are listed in priority order based on the technologies needed for China's economic development, with a special focus being put on industrial technology. The list includes 35 projects in seven areas: 1) Agriculture: Two projects on crop breeding technology and technology to manage low- and medium-crop production areas in order to achieve high-quality, high-yield production. 2) Energy resources and environment: Five projects on low-tempetature nuclear reactor district heating technology, tertiary oil exploitation technology, and clean coal utilization technology. 3) Transportation: Three projects on high-speed railway transportation, high-grade highways and inland water transport technologies. 4) Raw and Processed Materials and Natural Resources: Seven projects on sheet-bar continuous roll milling and continuous casting technology, oxygen-coal iron-smelting technology, heavy oil processing technology, manufacturing technology for important fine chemical engineering products, engineering plastics and plastic alloy technology. 5) Information and Telecommunications: Nine projects on integrated circuits, computers, softwares, power electronics, automation, and fiber optics. 6) Manufacturing Technology: Eight projects on numerical control technology, laser technology, and technology for manufacturing complete set of large-scale thermal power plants. 7) Biotechnology: Six projects on animal and plant genetic engineering, hybridoma-production technology, industrial microbial technology, and protein engineering.
