V. Volkenshtein, I. B. Golovanov, I. G. Tsygankova; Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Biophysics of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Pushchino; UDC 577.112.6] [Abstract] A relatively simple ``vacuum approximation'' method of conformational analysis and a method for estimating the free energy of molecular transfer from the gaseous (organic) to the aqueous phase were described and proposed as alternatives to the traditional approach to simulating biopolymer molecular structure. The rational for the simplified approach was based on two equations derived from the thermodynamic cycles employed to quantitatively express molecular structures and processes. These equations can be used to estimate the free energies of these processes in water. The simplified approach was used to simulate the structure of molecules and molecular associations in the aqueous phase, to simulate simple molecular systems and quantify their hydrophobic interaction, and to simulate the structure of hydrocarbon polymers and glycine and alanine oligopeptides in the organic and aqueous phases. It was found that a polymer molecule bends back under itself in water, forming a compact structure and reducing the total molecular surface, leaving the accessible surfaces of the polar groups located in the linear sections unchanged while increasing the accessible surfaces of the groups located where the molecule bends. This gives the molecule an advantage by minimizing hydrophobic interaction and by maximizing the hydration of the polar groups. Such behavior is typical for any polymer, thus optimizing their ability to interact with surrounding water molecules. This pattern is also valid for peptides and proteins. The behavior of the glycine and alanine peptides was found to be similar to one another in many ways, with one notable exception involving a substantially lower free energy contribution for the C7eq and _a_ conformers in the alanine, and consistent with existing experimental data.
