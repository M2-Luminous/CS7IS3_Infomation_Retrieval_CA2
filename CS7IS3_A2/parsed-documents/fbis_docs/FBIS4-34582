Cardenas made this comment in reference to reports about a tacit agreement between the MIR [Movement of the Revolutionary Left] and the MNR [Nationalist Revolutionary Movement] by which no charges would be filed against national MIR leaders for their links with drug trafficking, in exchange for a harsh sentence for Justices Edgar Oblitas Fernandez and Ernesto Poppe Zubieta. Cardenas rejected the validity of that report, saying that there are no real elements to sustain the media reports of a "dubious political scheme" between the MNR and the MIR regarding the two issues. Cardenas asserted that the government wants to do justice and not break it. He said, however, that if a situation such as that reported by the media emerges, "I would be the first to report it and condemn it, as this type of agreement or deal can only hurt the country and the democratic process that was so hard for the country to recover." President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada himself categorically denied the media report before leaving for Colombia and the United States, saying that "our struggle is against corruption. We don't negotiate these cases, and although we don't want to hurt anyone, our will is to enforce the law."
