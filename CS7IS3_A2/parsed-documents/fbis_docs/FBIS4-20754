The committee's discussions focused on means to guarantee that salaries will not be frozen. One of these principal means would be making the pay grades open-ended at the top, since this would lead to direct salary increases that would not be dependent on promotions. Another proposal discussed by the committee involves freeing periodic pay increases so that they would not stop at the top of the pay scale, or preparation of new salary tables that would include making the pay grades open-ended at the top. Still another proposal would grant a single pay increase that would include both the periodic pay increase and the cost-of-living pay increase and would amount to about 10 percent of one's salary. Unfortunately, however, increases in salaries--however slight--are always followed by increases in prices, and the two increases do not match each other. Although 10 percent annual cost-of-living pay increases, amounting to an overall increase of 110 percent, have been added to salaries during past years, prices, according to statistics, have increased 224 percent. The strange thing is that officials are still fumbling around concerning the next pay increase, and every day we hear about a new opinion that already gets changed the following day. On 12 February of this year a meeting was held in the Ministry of Finance for the purpose of discussing the implementation of the decision by Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi, concerning combining the periodic pay increase with the cost-of-living pay increase and having this be in effect starting with the new budget next July. An official in the ministry has said that Dr. Sidqi's decision is the result of the government's endeavoring to grant a cost-of-living pay increase to government employees when the new budget goes into effect, in accordance with the policy of achieving a balance between wages and prices and lightening these employees' burdens!! He said that the amount of the cost-of-living pay increase to be paid out with July's salaries will be finalized during the month of April. He pointed out that there are several different proposals being studied by the government, including keeping the cost-of-living pay increase as it is, that is, separate from the periodic pay increase, or combining the cost-of-living pay increase with the periodic pay increase. During this period of time the government will study the expenses involved in putting into effect the new 10 percent increase in government employees' wages next 1 July, and will also study the expenses involved in combining the cost-of-living pay increase with basic salaries--and these expenses amount to about 150 million Egyptian pounds. Dr. Sidqi has previously stated that the government intends to grant the cost-of-living pay increase next July, in accordance with the policy of achieving a balance between wages and prices and lightening employees' burdens. He said that the amount of this cost-of-living pay increase has still not been determined, that there are ongoing studies dealing with instituting it, and that there are different proposals being studied by the government, including keeping the cost-of-living pay increase separate from the periodic pay increase. He said that he personally would get a pay increase of 21 Egyptian pounds, and that a minister's pay increase would amount to 15 Egyptian pounds. During the same month, Ahmad al-'Awami, minister of manpower and employment, announced that the percentage of the cost-of-living pay increase for government employees still has not been determined and that this matter would, in due time, be discussed with the ministries concerned. This information also appears at a time when the media has published a statement by Dr. Sidqi to the effect that, during the next few days, he will look into the demands of the Federation of Labor Unions and Heads of Labor Unions concerning raising the percentage of the cost-of-living pay increase, to be paid out next July, from 10-20 percent. Of course, all of these statements have aroused resentment on the part of employees and workers with limited incomes. All during the last few years they have heard and read such statements, and the only thing that has happened has been the payment very small cost-of-living pay increases which have lagged far behind pay increases!! All of the above has concerned government employees. As far as employees in companies are concerned, the holding companies have recently prepared wage tables that have the following features, among others: Level 3 of the civil [service] positions, including Categories 6, 5, 4, and 3, would have starting salaries of between 100 and 300 Egyptian pounds. For Level 2 of the technical, administrative, and specialist positions requiring intermediate level and high level qualifications, including Categories 4, 3, and 2, the starting salaries would be between 120 and 300 Egyptian pounds. For Level 1 of all higher positions, including even the director of a department, the starting salaries would be between 150 and 400 Egyptian pounds. The wage tables also would include the fact that the proposed periodic pay increase be from 5 to 40 Egyptian pounds. All of these things discussed above are merely proposals and declarations made unilaterally, that is, made by officials in charge. But how do things really stand, and what is being said by the employees themselves, the people most concerned? First of all, the proposal being discussed which concerns abolishing the top end of the pay scale for the grades of the various positions, if applied, would constitute an important achievement, especially since, at the present time, employees are not allowed to receive any pay increases after arriving at the top of the pay scale, unless the law stipulates otherwise. There is nothing stated in Law 47 of 1978 which permits this. However, we note that Law 6 of 1977, which was issued in order to grant an additional pay increase to employees as of 1 January 1977, does permit the granting of this pay increase, even if an employee, by receiving such a pay increase, would have pay which would go beyond the top pay scale stipulated for his position. This law has been in effect in this area, and it predates Law 47 of 1978. Another legal passage of this type that constitutes an exception is the passage in Article 103 of Law 47 of 1978 dealing with transfer regulations that stipulates that employees shall have either the starting salaries of the positions to which they are transferred or a pay increase, whichever is greater, even if this means that they would thus have pay that goes beyond the top end of the pay scale, and this pay increase shall not affect the employees' periodic pay increases. According to this passage, an employee shall be granted an additional pay increase even if this means that his pay will go beyond the top end of the pay scale for the position's grade. There is also Passage No. 52, which constitutes an exception and which stipulates the granting of an incentive pay increase even if this means that the employee's pay would go beyond the top end of the pay scale for his grade. Rushdi Muhammad says: "I have been a Category 1 employee for 10 years. I don't care about grades or pay increases after seeing that my salary, incentive payments, and allowances are not enough to cover my life's basic necessities for even 10 days out of every month!! I suggest that the government be interested in people as such before engaging in talk about cost-of-living pay increases. We actually do get a lot of cost-of-living pay increases, but the increases in prices are far greater and our salaries are not enough to meet our basic needs. They are not even enough for our food alone, much less for clothes, housing, and medical expenses." He added: "The government is always announcing that it has lowered taxes for employees and given them wage increases. The truth is that it has taken all this away many times over in the form of prices for services such as electricity, water, and transportation." Sayyid al-Hujurati, an employee in the water utility, had the following to say: "What can I do with a 10-percent pay increase with the high cost of living that we have? Even though salaries, as they say, have increased 100 percent during the last 10 years, they have not enabled Egyptians to even have enough for the basic necessities of life." He feels that it would be more worthwhile to fix prices than to give pay increases, and said: "I used to buy a kilogram of meat for 68 piasters. But today the price of this meat in the 13 consumer cooperatives has gone up to 1 Egyptian pound. Is the 10 percent enough to take care of the steep rise in the prices of meat, bread, and only the basic necessities?" He went on to say: "For three years the officials have been saying that they are looking into the matter of making pay grades open-ended, but unfortunately this has not happened. If it does happen, I believe that it will significantly decrease the effect of the high prices which employees suffer from." Samir Muhammad al-Nu'man, an employee in the Egyptian Commercial Medicines Co., says: "Giving one a pay increase that amounts to 10 percent of one's salary will not add much to the salary and will not decrease the burdens on an employee's shoulders. Whatever the pay increase is, it is always far less than the insane increase in prices. This is particularly true because the pay increase is never linked to the increase in prices and the current actual value of the Egyptian pound." Dr. Faruq 'Abd-al-Salam says: "As for the matter of achieving a balance between the system of periodic and cost-of-living pay increases now in effect and a permanent pay increase amounting to 10 percent of one's salary, this is something that will neither hasten nor delay--to either a large or a small degree--the problem that afflicts our worn-out Egyptian people. We are only talking about a difference in milliemes, which cannot keep a person alive. There are three basic reasons for saying this. First of all, changing the type of pay increase, whether this involves the various kinds of pay increases or regular raises, amounts to nothing more than a sedative. This would be true even if the regular raise were 100 percent of one's salary. The reason for this is that prices nowadays have become a vicious monster, which is dozens of times greater than any increase in pay that the government might give to its employees." Mayisah 'Abd al-Rahim , an employee, says: "By means of simple arithmetic I found out that the value of a pay increase would not increase my salary by more than 10 Egyptian pounds, most of which would be spent on transportation within only a two-day period. I would not be able to make use of this pay increase to buy anything that I want to buy, especially since prices continually go up. I believe that pay increases should be in line with price increases and should not be fixed." 'Abd al-Rahman Mustafa 'Iraqi, director of a consumer cooperatives company, says: "The pay increases, no matter what they are, will not be enough to cover the basic necessities of average Egyptians. I do not believe that a 10-percent salary increase will benefit our citizens. Such a pay increase is not enough even to buy just one kilogram of meat or 20 flat loaves of bread. If an Egyptian wants to buy a new shirt, he has to save the money earned from this pay increase for at least four months. The ideal solution is to link the pay increases with the rises in prices."
