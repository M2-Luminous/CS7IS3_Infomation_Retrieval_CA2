Mr Mohammadi said: Repeating such baseless issues, which undermine the process of consolidation of stability in the region, serves only the interests of foreigners and helps the Zionist regime spread its influence in the region. He added: Expansion of ties and cooperation does not mean serving one-sided interests. Instead, such a process embraces the mutual interests of the two neighboring Muslim countries, and in the opinion of the Islamic Republic of Iran, expansion of ties requires that one should refrain from making territorial claims, and should instead pay respect to the issues of sovereignty and established frontiers. Furthermore, he stressed: Instead of attention to propaganda issues, it is better for the UAE to accept the Islamic Republic of Iran's invitation to hold bilateral talks.
