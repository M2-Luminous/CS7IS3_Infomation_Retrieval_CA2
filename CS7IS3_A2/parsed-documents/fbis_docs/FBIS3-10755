In contrast with other demonstrations sponsored by Zavalia, on this occasion only about 1,500 people joined the radical leader in his demand. At approximately 2115 a caravan of about 1,000 people left La Banda toward the capital, reaching the highway at the entrance to the capital at 2300, where 600 demonstrators were waiting, and where Zavalia was the main speaker at the anti-government demonstration. Zavalia, who as usual participated in the rally mounted upon his chestnut steed, said that with Schiaratti's trusteeship "corruption continues" in Santiago del Estero. It was explained that the demonstration was small because the unions plan to boycott the elections to be held on 10 April. In another matter, Santiago del Estero provincial employees have already solved part of their problem over back pay, which was the reason for the outbreak of violence in this province last December. On that occasion demonstrators had surrounded Zavalia in his house, and it even led to shots fired between Zavalia and the demonstrators. As to why so few people participated, those responsible for the demonstration said that the reason was the "pressure" being exerted on the public by the trusteeship. Zavalia headed the demonstration riding his horse, followed by about 100 buses contracted for the occasion, which were for the most part filled only by UCR militants and sympathizers. In any case, this first demonstration of power by the Santiago del Estero radical forces in light of the upcoming elections for Constituent Assembly members was not a very convincing one for the UCR provincial leaders.
