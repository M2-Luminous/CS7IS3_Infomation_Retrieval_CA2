The officials said Daiwa Securities Co. has formed a team of experts to study ways to enable customers to engage in stock trading at home using the interactive system. Customers can call up on the screen all necessary data, including the business results of interested firms and economic indexes while listening to advice from salespeople, they said. Similar studies are being made by three other brokerages, including Nomura Securities Co., the officials said. They said investors will be able to engage in stock trading at home when the multimedia system for home use is introduced. The securities companies introduced home trading in 1988 using television game machines, but the existing system cannot meet the needs of customers because the volume of information provided is limited.
