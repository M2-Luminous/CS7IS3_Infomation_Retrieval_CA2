A NODONG SINMUN analyst today says: The students' struggle this time can never be a target of suppression. It displayed their patriotic will to defend the wellbeing and dignity of the nation against the aggression and war policy of outside forces. The object of overthrow is the Kim Yong-sam group bent on igniting a war and plunging the nation into a nuclear holocaust in league with outside forces. The Kim Yong-sam group invited Perry to South Korea, begged for "sanctions" against the North and reinforcement of the U.S. forces and an "early deployment" of latest-type military equipment in South Korea. The patriotic students courageously turned out in the struggle against Perry's war trip because the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppet clique were scheming to impose the disaster of a nuclear war on the nation. Nevertheless, the Kim Yong-sam group, far from turning an ear to the just demand of students and people, wielded the sword at the patriotic students. What a disgusting and despicable act of a pro-U.S., flunkeyist traitor and warhawk it is. The valiant struggle of the South Korean students who ardently desire peace and reunification is supported and praised by the whole nation now. Their righteous struggle and patriotic spirit can by no means be blocked or broken with anything. The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique which is resorting to treacheries, clinging to the coattails of outside forces, estranged from the fellow countrymen, cannot evade judgement by the nation.
