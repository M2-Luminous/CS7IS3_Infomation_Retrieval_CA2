Jordan had expected that the United States would decide to lift the blockade against ships bound for al-'Aqabah Port and allow inspection of ships at the port instead of accosting them on the high seas. Jordan has already conveyed its views to the United States and the world and the issue has become clear and does not have to be discussed by the prince in Washington during the visit, which was scheduled one month before the outbreak of the present crisis. Talks during the visit were supposed to focus on certain economic aspects and political issues which cannot be discussed now before the al-'Aqabah blockade crisis is over.
