FR941206-0-00120 FR941206-0-00017 In the Third Reconsideration Order, 59 FR 17961, 17969&hyph;17970 (May 21, 1993), the Commission concluded that the Commission concluded that the Commission and state and local governments have concurrent jurisdiction to regulate negative option billing. The rationale for this conclusion was that regulation of negative option billing, while discussed in the section of the 1992 Cable Act governing rate regulation, is more in the nature of a consumer protection measure than rate regulation per se. Section (8)(c)(1) of the 1992 Cable Act, codified in Section 632(c)(1) of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. 552(c)(1), provides that nothing in the ``Consumer Protection Laws'' title of the Communications Act may ``be construed to prohibit any State or any franchise authority from enacting or enforcing any consumer protection law, to the extent not specifically preempted by this title.'' Commenters request that the Commission clarify what channel additions to a tier will not require affirmative marketing under Section 3(f) of the 1992 Cable Act. They also ask the Commission to declare that local authorities may not require affirmative marketing for channel additions under state or local laws. More specifically, NCTA asks the Commission to clarify that three specific ``scenarios'' do not trigger the federal negative option billing rule and that state or local authorities are preempted from enacting or enforcing their own negative option billing laws. 2. Discussion In determining whether any of the scenarios involve negative option billing, the Commission is guided by the language of the negative option billing provision, its legislative history, and our prior interpretations. In light of that guidance, the Commission reaffirms that a change in the mix of channels in a tier, including additions or deletions of channels, will not be subject to the negative option billing provision, unless they change the fundamental nature of the tier. With respect to NCTA's first scenario, which involved passing through external costs or inflation adjustments, the Commission holds that these types of rate changes do not in and of themselves invoke the federal negative option billing rule. As an initial matter, they do not constitute ``service or equipment'' within the meaning of Section 3(f). Moreover, under our rate regulations, operators are specifically permitted to pass through to subscribers increases in external costs and inflation adjustments. 47 CFR 76.922(d). These types of rate changes do not constitute a change in the fundamental nature of a tier, and, therefore, do not implicate the federal negative option billing prohibition for that reason as well. With regard to the second and third scenarios identified in NCTA's letter, the Commission stated in the Rate Order, 58 FR 29748 (May 21, 1993), that ``a change in the mix of channels in a tier, including additions or deletions of channels, will not be subject to the negative option billing provision, unless they change the fundamental nature of the tier.'' Determinations as to what constitutes a change in the fundamental nature of a tier will generally depend on the individual circumstances of each case. Channel changes involving relatively few channels generally will not change the fundamental nature of that tier, and thus will not implicate the federal negative option billing rule. Consistent with this approach, additions of channels and rate adjustments within the Operator's Cap and License Fee Reserve of the revised going forward rules generally will not change the fundamental nature of a tier. Affirmative marketing also is not required when an operator moves channels pursuant to our conditions for establishment of NPTs, so long as the movements do not change the fundamental nature of the tier. Because the Commission's rules require operators to give subscribers 30-days' advance notice of any changes in rates, programming or channel positions, the Commission does not believe subscribers need the additional protection of the negative option billing provision for relatively modest changes. See 47 CFR 76.309(c)(3)(i)(B); 76.964(b). Section 632(c)(1) of the Communications Act makes clear that state and local authorities generally may apply statutes proscribing fraud or misleading advertising practices to cable operators. However, Section 3(a)(1) of the 1992 Cable Act makes clear that regulation of ``the rates for the provision of cable service'' is governed exclusively by the federal statute and Commission regulations. The scenarios NCTA presents require the Commission to consider again the relationship between Section 632(c)(1) of the Communications Act and Section 3(a)(1) of the 1992 Cable Act. The Commission concludes that a two-step approach is warranted. First, is the state or local negative option rule consistent with the federal rule? If it is, then the state or local rule may be enforced. If the state or local rule is inconsistent with the federal rule, then it is necessary to consider whether its enforcement ``approaches, actual regulation of `rates for the provision of cable service.'' In elaborating on that inquiry, the Commission now concludes that state or local consumer protection laws may not be enforced in a manner that conflicts with or undermines our rate regulation rules established pursuant to Section 3 of the 1992 Cable Act. If there is an actual conflict between federal and state law or where state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full objectives of Congress, the state law is preempted. See, e.g., Free v. Bland , 369 U.S. 663 (1962); Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U.S. 52 (1941).
