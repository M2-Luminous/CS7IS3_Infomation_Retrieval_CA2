But What Shall We Do with It?"] [Text] Vilnius -- Three years ago Vytautas Petkevicius was really being threatened, but he was writing his stories and novels. Today Petkevicius is chairman of the Lithuanian Seimas National Security Committee, and not just a well-known writer and storyteller. Vladimiras Zarovskis, our own correspondent in the Lithuanian Republic, talked with Vytautas Petkevicius about the KGB archives which have disappeared, a little about spies, and a little more about corruption and crime in the Army, and about the fact that people must not be deceived. [Zarovskis] Why did you exchange a writer's desk for the hectic Seimas and a chairman's uncomfortable chair? [Petkevicius] I was one of the initiators of the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party's transformation into an opposition party after March 1990. The party won the elections to the Seimas 18 months ago only because it was an opposition party. Only I did not become a deputy on the party list but won in a single-seat electoral district. As regards the National Security Committee, the work on it is very interesting for me as a writer. At the time of the Khrushchev thaw I wrote the novel "Of Bread, Love, and the Rifle," which is a first-person narrative about postwar Lithuania. My opponents set about proving that its hero -- who was myself -- was an employee of the People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs, a Chekist, etc. Therefore I had to prove that all this was not so. I won that case even in court. [Zarovskis] Right after March 1990 Lithuanian state security became the province of right-wingers. How did they greet you, who are very left-wing? [Petkevicius] There was no such service. There were three or four scatterbrains, with whom it was impossible to reach agreement. National security had been broken up. Previously, there had been very modern equipment in Lithuania. It was squandered. They deliberately destroyed national security from March 1990. Incompetent people who did not understand the business were set up as leaders. One was a postgraduate dropout, another did not even have secondary education, yet another was a specialist in land improvement. Lithuania was left without cover, and people descended on it and did what they liked. Top-class specialists who had been trained to combat foreign currency speculators, terrorists, and spies worked in the old Lithuanian SSR [Soviet Socialist Republic] KGB. Little by little we are vetting them and inviting them to work. [Zarovskis] Your committee also monitors the Army. Lithuanian newspapers write about purchases of Russian arms, helicopters, and ships for Lithuania's army through some Russian-Lithuanian front firms, which have done great harm to the Republic. [Petkevicius] I can refute nothing of what Lithuanian newspapers have written about thefts, currency machinations, and financial speculation in the Army, the Voluntary Territorial Protection Service, and national security. Mass searches of people engaged in buying weapons, right up to the former minister of territorial protection, were carried out in Lithuania recently. The parliament of independent Lithuania has worked for three years without adopting a single law on the Army, just a decision to create it. The Army itself does not even have regulations, let alone a military doctrine. Imagine: A person is recruited for the Army under civil legislation. If he has sold an assault rifle or a pistol for drink, he cannot be punished as a soldier or an officer but only as a civilian who has lost a production tool. This is why so many weapons have flowed into the criminal world. Moreover, even people with two or three convictions have gotten into the power structures, particularly the Voluntary Territorial Protection Service. We have been forced to start recertification, to collect up the rifles and carbines that they were keeping at home, and to "test-fire" them. According to the rules, it is necessary to have two spent cases from each gun in order to verify, if necessary, whether it has been involved in a crime. But even this has not been done in the three years that the Army and the Voluntary Service have existed, and the number of murders involving weapons is growing yearly. The necessary civilian control over servicemen is now being introduced. We have to combat irregular relationships, thieving, and crime in the Army. It is offensive. I traveled around the Republic with a commission, and we received Russian Army installations which were clean, generally in order, and had been prepared for handover, but our people came along, and two months later it was impossible to find anything anymore. Everything had been looted and smashed, and even the central heating radiators had been taken. Is it really possible to do this? We want to call these people to order -- and we will. [Zarovskis] Every army has a so-called likely enemy. Does Lithuania? [Petkevicius] Ours is a small state, and we do not intend and would not be able to fight anyone. The Lithuanian Army already exists, and thousands of people serve in it, and it must be disciplined and well armed. But it must be of such a size that the people will be able to maintain it. It is needed for support and the elimination of some conflicts. Our concept of military doctrine is the Swiss one: resistance by the whole people. If not with weapons, then through disobedience, etc. We can be part of the NATO structure, for a company -- no more -- to participate in international actions. Lithuania has already subscribed to the NATO "Partnership for Peace" program, but that is, rather, a political step. [Zarovskis] What about the archives of the former Lithuanian SSR KGB? They could be used both by Russia and by Lithuania itself. [Petkevicius] Some of the documents were burned in the inner courtyard of the "Lithuanian SSR" KGB, and some were taken away to Ulyanovsk and Tomsk. Negotiations for their return have been going on for more than a year. I do not believe, however, that we will live to see the day. Russia will not give up the archives, since the state is interested in keeping its agents in any republic of the former USSR, including Lithuania. They will not be of any special use to us if they do return. In our situation the declassification of these files could have most dreadful consequences. In the times of Landsbergis' rule the entire people shuddered, particularly the intelligentsia: Rogues and adventurers had been admitted to the KGB archives, and they had stolen their own files, picked up other people's, and then started blackmailing them. Ten sacks of documents were stolen in the space of two years, but we have found them. An archives administration has been set up on our initiative, and a center for the study of genocide and a special library for those who wish to acquaint themselves with their own file are being set up. Those who wish to can now find out the reason for being in disfavor with the government, and we give answers to requests -- except, of course, for operational information. It will not be possible to find out who "ratted" on them. [Zarovskis] How will I be able to show gratitude to my "friend"?... [Petkevicius] In Lithuania everyone was rehabilitated at the beginning of the nineties, including those who participated in mass executions of Jews. We are now ashamed before the whole world. The genocide center must work the same way as the de-Nazification army in postwar Germany. This must be tackled by jurists and historians, because we have had enough of politicians poking about in this dirty business. They must not. The use of such archives by politicians for political purposes is criminal. In all democratic countries there is a deadline for releasing documents, otherwise political vengeance is at once followed by human vengeance -- which is ruinous for the state and the people. [Zarovskis] Are there many Lithuanian spies abroad -- in CIS countries, for example? [Petkevicius] Well, there may be some self-styled spies. What is more, I will say that we have no such department as intelligence at all. What intelligence can be gotten abroad? So we steal some blueprint. What are we going to do with it? Enterprises may engage in economic espionage, but even then hardly at all.
