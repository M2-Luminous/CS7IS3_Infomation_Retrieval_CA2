FBIS4-16130 "drsov072_v_94002" FBIS-SOV-94-072 Daily Report 13 Apr 1994 Lithuania U.S. Military Official Satisfied With Cooperation U.S. Military Official Satisfied With Cooperation WS1304150794 Tallinn BNS in English 1226 GMT 13 Apr 94 WS1304150794 Tallinn BNS English BFN [Text] Vilnius, Apr 13, BNS -- American military experts see a number of positive changes in Lithuania's national defense system and think the improvement is partly a result of the successful implementation of the U.S. Military-to-Military Contacts Program in Lithuania. Such contacts cost the United States around 100,000 dollars a month, but Brig. Gen. Thomas Lennon, deputy director of the program in 13 world countries, said he is certain that money is not spent uselessly in Lithuania. The general arrived in Vilnius Monday [11 April]. On Tuesday, Lennon met with the U.S. ambassador to Lithuania, Darryl Johnson, and Lithuanian Defense Minister Linas Linkevicius. At a press conference, Lennon said he is satisfied with the work of a joint U.S.-Lithuanian military contacts group. He emphasized that the Military-to-Military program is a mutual exchange of ideas and experience, but not an attempt to press on American views. Lennon said 85 projects ranging a full spectrum of national defense activities were carried out in Lithuania since last May. Lithuanians and Americans acquainted each other with their defense structures, civil defense, military communication systems, military medicine and engineering. The Military-to-Military program will be continued in Lithuania next year, although initially it was intended for half year or a year. Lennon said the program will continue in Lithuania because "the interest of the United States is supporting your democratic transformations."
