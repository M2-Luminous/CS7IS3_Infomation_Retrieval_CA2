While officials put a tight lid on what went on at the meeting behind closed doors, there were at least indications that neither side has given up hope of trying to fashion an agreement. "The talks are ongoing," said a Japanese official after emerging from three hours of talks held Friday morning at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR). Both U.S. and Japanese officials refused to comment on substantive issues raised after the two sides broke off the morning session. The talks resumed in late afternoon, and another session is tentatively set for Saturday. The negotiations to revive the so-called "framework" trade talks have been closely watched on financial markets as a barometer in the state of the relationship between the world's two largest economies. Reflecting the sensitivity of the negotiations, two Japanese principals involved in the negotiations -- Vice Minister of International Trade and Industry Sozaburo Okamatsu and Deputy Foreign Minister Sadayuki Hayashi -- slipped off after the morning session without being noticed by a group of reporters staking out the main entrance of the USTR office. Like their Japanese counterparts, U.S. officials involved in the talks were equally tight-lipped. "You know I can't talk," said a U. S. official when asked for comment. One senior U.S. negotiator involved in the talks, however, sought to project an air of conviviality. "We had a good and cordial conversation, and we will meet again," said Bowman Cutter, deputy director of the Presidential National Economic Council. The trade talks, based on a "framework" accord the two countries concluded in July last year, ruptured in February at a meeting in Washington between President Bill Clinton and then Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, who succeeded Hosokawa in late April, and Clinton agreed last week to work out a common "basis" for restarting the framework talks before they meet at the group seven summit in Naples in early July. One major sticking point in the framework talks -- and the primary cause for the rupture of the negotiations at the Feb. 11 U.S.-Japan summit -- is the idea of setting "objective criteria" to measure imports to Japan. In what is known as a "results-oriented" approach, the U.S. has insisted using "numerical indicators" to ensure that a trade agreement with Japan translates into increased foreign sales in the Japanese market. Tokyo has strongly objected to the idea, saying it amounts to government-managed trade. Among the industry sectors covered under the "framework" accord are Japanese Government procurement for medical and telecommunications products, trade in autos and auto parts and the Japanese insurance market. The U.S. wants Japan to open its market wider to foreign goods and stimulate domestic demand in order to reduce its vast, and growing, trade surplus. The U.S.-Japan trade imbalance was underscored by fresh U.S. Government data Thursday that showed the U.S. trade deficit with Japan jumped 25 percent in March to 5.80 billion dollars. The U.S. trade gap with Japan came to 15.04 billion dollars in the first three months of this year, well ahead of the comparable period last year which stood at 13.3 billion dollars.
