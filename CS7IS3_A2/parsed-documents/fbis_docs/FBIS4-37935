FBIS4-37935 "drnes123_l_94009" FBIS-NES-94-123 Daily Report 26 Jun 1994 ISRAEL Cabinet Endorses Recommendations Cabinet Endorses Recommendations TA2606170594 Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew 1600 GMT 26 Jun 94 TA2606170594 Tel Aviv IDF Radio Hebrew BFN [Text] A short time ago, the cabinet endorsed the recommendations in the Shamgar Commission's report. Yitzhaq Rabin, prime minister and defense minister, will convene an additional, wide-ranging cabinet meeting soon to discuss proposals for implementing the report's recommendations. On leaving the cabinet meeting, Minister Yosi Sarid said: [Begin Sarid recording] The cabinet unanimously adopted all the recommendations in the report and undertook to implement them in full. The cabinet believes the commission performed a serious and responsible task, and the cabinet is committed to implementing all the commission's findings. The commitment is not only to the commission but primarily to the cabinet itself and to proper government. [Announcer] We now turn to our political correspondent Udi Segal, who heard the prime minister's first reaction to the Shamgar report a few minutes ago: [Segal] Prime Minister Rabin has reacted for the first time to the Shamgar Commission's conclusions. The prime minister was asked for his response, after his initial opposition to the establishment of an inquiry commission. Rabin said he does not want to delve into the past. We then asked him whether in today's reality, a similar massacre can be avoided. This is what Rabin had to say: [Begin Rabin recording] If a Jewish madman decides to open fire on one of the thousand mosques in Judaea and Samaria or if somebody opens fire in the streets of Hebron or anywhere else, it could happen again. Theoretically, it could happen, but I hope it will not. To the same extent, we cannot give 100-percent assurances that Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] and Islamic Jihad murderers will not continue to attack Israelis. We must vow to wage a war to the bitter end against the murderers of Israelis and peace and, at the same time, take action to impose the law on those Israeli settlers on the fringe of society who call for illegal activities and carry them out.
