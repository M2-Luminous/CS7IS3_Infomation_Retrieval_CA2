Telecommunications business concerning cellular mobile telephone calls is now within reach in all provincial capitals of the country, as Xining, the last city to start such services, switched on its system last Wednesday [30 March]. The new cellular mobile telephone system in the city has the capacity to transmit 1,200 calls at one time. At present, the city already has 400 users of cellular phones. Cellular mobile telecommunications services have been developing rapidly in China since October of 1987, when Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong Province, took the lead to install and put into use a cellular mobile telephone system. At present, the country's mobile telecommunications service has the capacity to transmit 1.56 million calls at one time. The industry now has 638,000 customers, with the group growing at a monthly speed of more than 30,000 clients, officials with the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications told XINHUA. They added that they are working hard on the implementation of a national scheme based on a nationwide automatic switching network, which was launched in March of 1993. When the scheme is completed, customers with cellular phones will only have to go through a simple registration procedure in their home provincial capitals to use their portable units freely in any other provincial capitals.
