It comprises the former Christian Democrats who did not join Mino Martinazzoli's People's Party and who will seek an alliance with the League and Berlusconi to contest the elections. With [National Alliance Secretary] Fini, too? Maybe. In the South, very probably. Only 24 hours and a few kilometers separated the birth of the People's Party from that of the CCD, but the differences are very sharp. "Who are these people?" Casini asked delightedly, surrounded by his fans. "They are Christian Democratic supporters," he replied triumphantly. "I am very optimistic because, though it is true that Martinazzoli and Bindi have been followed by the sector of the Catholic world that looks to the left, we still have all the rest." Including those who voted for the right in the local elections. Those who voted for Fini in Rome and whom the center wants to claim, under the new symbol of the sail with a tricolor band and the crossed shield. It is there on the CCD's new symbol, too but, perhaps to avoid legal problems with the People's Party, it lacks the word, "libertas," it is blue, and the cross is white. "Never with the PDS" [Democratic Party of the Left], Ombretta Fumagalli proclaimed, and the audience rewarded her with lengthy applause. "This," Andreotti's former heir apparent in Milan went on, "both before and after the elections; and we say `no' to any kind of institutional government, because that would mean a government with Occhetto." Rosy Bindi is their bete noire. "In the past six months," Casini said, "in the DC [Christian Democratic Party] there has been not only a necessary cleansing operation and change of leadership. There has also been an outright genetic mutation of our identity. The party was entrusted to a limited sector of Catholic associationism that has always had a distorted perception of the left." Alberto Alessi, one of the 23 former DC deputies who opted for the Center, expressed this concept crudely: "Bindi stands with respect to the People's Party as Lorena Bobbit does with respect to her husband." And there is nobody now who does not know what Lorena Bobbit did to her husband. The left-wing cartel is the enemy to be defeated in the elections, but the real adversary is Martinazzoli -- "Bindi's hostage." It is the People's Party leader's strategy that is criticized, of course: "Isolation is not neutral now; it contributes to the victory of the left. Isolation is an option that leads toward [PDS Secretary] Occhetto." The CCD, however, presents itself as "something new on Italy's political scene: There is no other national force," Francesco D'Onofrio said, "that is liberal-democratic, federalist, and presidentialist. This permits us to pursue a strategy of alliances for the Second Republic." Yesterday the Democratic Christian Center began this venture. Mastella promised a battle: "Many friends in the People's Party have been telling me recently: Let us not harm each other in the elections; let us seek a technical agreement. But we reject any such possibility. We will field candidates wherever possible, including in the North with the League and Rooting for Italy." What about with the MSI [Italian Social Movement] in the South? "We shall see. Their political stance is evolving." A real war, then. And soon a war will be waged over the inheritance. "We are paying for everything out of our own pockets, including the rent on this room," Casini pointed out. Carlo Giovanardi, a deputy, warned: "I am not moving out of my DC office in Modena. Just like them."
