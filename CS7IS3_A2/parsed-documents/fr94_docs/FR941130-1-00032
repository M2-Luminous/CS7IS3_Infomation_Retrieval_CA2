FR941130-1-00032 FR941130-1-00010 FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION 47 CFR Parts 2 and 15 [ET Docket No. 94&hyph;124; FCC 94&hyph;273] Use of Radio Frequencies Above 40 GHz for New Radio Applications AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: This Notice of Proposed Rule Making (Notice) proposes to open for commercial development and use a portion of the ``millimeter wave'' frequency bands above 40 GHz. This proposal is necessary because the existing FCC rules generally do not permit operation above 40 GHz. Recent advances in technology indicate that commercial use of these frequencies is feasible. The Commission believes the proposals set forth in the Notice will stimulate new applications of radio technology for the American public, facilitate technology transfer from the military sector, and create opportunities for economic growth and jobs. DATES: Comments must be submitted on or before January 30, 1995 and reply comments on or before March 1, 1995. ADDRESSES: Federal Communications Commission, 1919 M Street, N.W., Washington, DC 20554.

Marcus, Office of Engineering and Technology, (202) 653&hyph;8110 or Richard Engelman, Office of Engineering and Technology, at (202) 653&hyph;6289. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This is a summary of the Commission's Notice of Proposed Rule Making in ET Docket No. 94&hyph;124, FCC 94&hyph;273, adopted October 20, 1994, and released November 8, 1994. The full text of this decision is available for inspection and copying during normal business hours in the FCC Dockets Branch (Room 230), 1919 M Street, N.W., Washington, DC. The complete text of this decision also may be purchased from the Commission's duplicating contractor, International Transcription Services, Inc., at (202) 857&hyph;3800, 2100 M Street, N.W., Suite 140, Washington, DC 20037. Synopsis of Notice of Proposed Rule Making 1. The Commission is proposing to open for commercial development and use a portion of the millimeter wave frequency bands above 40 GHz. In particular, the Commission proposes to make available a total of 16 GHz of spectrum in the frequency range between 47.2 and 153 GHz on a shared basis with existing and future government users. The Commission also proposes to make available 2 GHz of Spectrum in the 40.5&hyph;42.5 GHz band for non-government users. 2. These new frequency bands will permit the development of short-range wireless radio systems with communications capacities approaching that now achievable only with coaxial and optical fiber cable. Such systems could support many short-range applications that require very high bandwidth or data transfer rates. Uses could include applications involving the National Information Infrastructure (NII); educational or medical applications such as remote wireless access to libraries or other informational databases; and non-communications uses such as automobile radar systems to avoid collisions. The proposed rules provide for the operation of such systems on both a licensed and an unlicensed basis. The Commission is also proposing technical standards for millimeter wave band equipment and operation. 3. All of the spectrum above 40 GHz, with the exception of the 40.5&hyph;42.5 GHz band, several Amateur Radio Service allocations, and a Government satellite allocation, is allocated on a shared basis to government and non-government use, and most of the bands that the Commission is proposing to open for commercial use will continue to be available for existing and future government use. Thus, in cooperation with the Department of Commerce's National Telecommunications Information Administration (NTIA), the Commission is proposing twelve frequency bands in the region of the spectrum from 47 GHz to 153 GHz for potential use by new millimeter wave technologies. These frequency bands are: 47.2&hyph;48.2 GHz, 59.0&hyph;64.0 GHz, 71.0&hyph;72.0 GHz, 76.0&hyph;77.0 GHz, 84.0&hyph;85.0 GHz, 94.7&hyph;95.7 GHz, 103.0&hyph;104.0 GHz, 116.0&hyph;117.0 GHz, 122.0&hyph;123.0 GHz, 126.0&hyph;127.0 GHz, 139.0&hyph;140.0 GHz, and 152.0&hyph;153.0 GHz. The Commission is also proposing to permit commercial use in the 40.5&hyph;42.5 GHz band which is already allocated entirely to nongovernment use. 4. The Commission is tentatively proposing an approximately even division of available spectrum between licensed and unlicensed users, with unlicensed users further divided between general unlicensed devices and unlicensed vehicular radar systems. 5. The extremely limited propagation range of the 59&hyph;64 GHz-band, as well as higher millimeter wave frequency bands, suggests that major portions of those bands be designated for general use by unlicensed devices. Therefore, the Commission is proposing to provide the following frequency bands for unlicensed operations under Part 15 of our rules: 59&hyph;64 GHz, 71.5&hyph;72.0 GHz, 84.5&hyph;85.0 GHz, 103.5&hyph;104.0 GHz, 116.5&hyph;117.0 GHz, 122.5&hyph;123.0 GHz, 126.5&hyph;127.0 GHz, and 152.5&hyph;153.0 GHz. This would provide 3.5 GHz in seven of the frequency bands and 5 GHz in an eighth band, for a total of 8.5 GHz for general unlicensed operations. 6. Based on the demand for licensed services below 40 GHz, the Commission is proposing to designate all of the 40.5&hyph;42.5 GHz band and virtually all of the 47.2&hyph;48.2 GHz band for licensed use, except for a small portion that would be designated for vehicular radar use. Similarly, the Commission is proposing that portions of the bands above 64 GHz that are not designated for vehicular radar use be designated for licensed use. In particular, the Commission is proposing to provide spectrum for licensed services in each of the following bands: 40.5&hyph;42.5 GHz, 47.4&hyph;48.2 GHz, 71.0&hyph;71.5 GHz, 84.0&hyph;84.5 GHz, 103.0&hyph;103.5 GHz, 116.0&hyph;116.5 GHz, 122.0&hyph;122.5 GHz, 126.0&hyph;126.5 GHz and 152.0&hyph;152.5 GHz. The Notice proposed that the licensing rules be contained in 47 CFR Part 21 and that the rules be similar to those proposed in Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, Order, Tentative Decision and Order on Reconsideration, CC Docket No. 92&hyph;297, 58 FR 6400. 7. The Commission is proposing to designate three of the millimeter wave bands, as well as part of the fourth band, for use by vehicular radar systems. These bands are: 47.2&hyph;47.4 GHz, 76.0&hyph;77.0 GHz, 94.7&hyph;95.7 GHz, and 139.0&hyph;140.0 GHz. 8. The Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is contained in the text of the Notice. 9. Pursuant to applicable procedures set forth in Sections 1.415 and 1.419 of the Commission's Rules, 47 CFR Sections 1.415 and 1.419, interested parties may file comments on or before January 30, 1995 and reply comments on or before March 1, 1995. To file formally in this proceeding, you must file an original and four copies of all comments, reply comments, and supporting comments.

You should send comments and reply comments to Office of the Secretary, Federal Communications Commission, Washington, D.C. 20554. Comments and reply comments will be available for public inspection during regular business hours in the FCC Reference Center, Room 239, 1919 M Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20554. 10. This is a non-restricted notice and comment rule making proceeding. Ex parte presentations are permitted, except during the Sunshine Agenda period, provided they are disclosed as provided in the Commission's Rules.
