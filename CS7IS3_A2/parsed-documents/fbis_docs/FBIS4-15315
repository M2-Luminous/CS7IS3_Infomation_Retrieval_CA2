He said the rate of inflation in March ran at 5 percent. Low inflation and stable currency, he said, are setting conditions for economic growth. The statement says if the policy of economic reforms and financial austerity is maintained "for the next six months at least," good incentives will be created for the inflow of foreign investment and Kyrgyzstan is justified in expecting an upsurge of economic activity soon. Rysaliyev believes "now is the time to think of how to sell what is produced and to avert any possible glut in the domestic market."
