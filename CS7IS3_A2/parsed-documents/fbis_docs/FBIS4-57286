Good evening, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, PRD candidate. [Cardenas] Good evening. [Noriega] Good evening, Dr. Ernesto Zedillo, PRI candidate. [Zedillo] Good evening. [Noriega] Good evening, Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, PAN candidate. [Fernandez] Good evening. [Noriega] Ladies and gentlemen, before opening the debate I will briefly outline the rules agreed on by the parties to conduct this debate. It will be divided into three parts. Each candidate will have the floor for an equal amount of time, under equal conditions, and in the order established by the results of the lottery. The first phase begins with an eight-minute exposition by the candidates, who will discuss their political ideas in general terms. Later, each of them will have two opportunities, one of five minutes and the other of three minutes, to comment on the views of his adversaries, respond to questions or observations made to their own comments, or expand on his initial statement. In the second phase, the candidates will have five minutes each to outline their proposals. Then each candidate will have two three-minute rounds to expand on their statements. Finally, each candidate will have three additional minutes to deliver a final message. It is important to remember that the candidate speaking cannot be interrupted and cannot use any more time than that established for each portion of the debate. Now that these rules have been outlined, we will open the first part of this debate. PRD candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas has the floor. [Cardenas] The moment for this long awaited debate has arrived. This is a moment without precedent for the candidates who are promoting a democratic change: A moment on television, which had been closed to us. I hope this is not the last meeting of the three candidates who are here. I hope that the PAN and PRI candidates agree to meet again on other occasions before 21 August and to meet also with the candidates of the other parties. This opening of the media is, without a doubt, a victory for those who from various positions and in various organizations have been struggling for a democratic change in our country. I have been able to travel throughout the country. I have been doing this for the past six years. We have found an abandoned countryside, closed factories, and dismissed workers. We have found poorly served dining tables. In these trips throughout the country we have seen roads in bad condition and situations that the majority of the Mexicans cannot appreciate. In sum, we have found a situation most Mexicans cannot agree with. We can say that no one, except a few, very few, are better off today than in 1988. What we have found in our trips throughout the country is a nation deteriorated by corruption, arbitrariness, and the lack of investments and opportunities. With very few exceptions, most of the people, at least those living in areas where the country's resources are located -- a significant majority -- are all seeking some type of change, and all of us would like this change to be fair and reasonable. We should not be afraid of change. We should all think of the changes that occur throughout our own lifetimes. Changes begin to take place in a small child who transforms into an adolescent, a young adult, and finally into a full-grown adult. As time goes by, we learn and acquire new experiences, and we learn new ways to resolve our problems. This is the type of change we are seeking for our country -- a change that will allow all of us to progress and resolve the source of our problems; a change that will also allow us to rise out of the mess into which the current administration has led us, and move to a place that will permit us to enter a stage of development and creativity that will allow us to take advantage of our resources. We are seeking a transformation that will allow us to guarantee our children their right to life -- their right to be children who are not forced to work and, in turn, are able to study, play, and laugh. We are seeking fair and reasonable changes for every youngster throughout the country, enabling him or her to have access to education and employment -- changes that will allow them to take part in sports and encourage their creativity in the arts and culture. We are also seeking changes that will allow Mexican workers to improve their wages and to have tangible job opportunities. We want changes in which women will be allowed to advance toward genuine equality -- a term that has become dead in our laws. We want changes that will open the door to new opportunities for women. It is up to all of us -- women and children included -- to pave the way to new opportunities and for these changes to take place at work, at play, and during cultural and political activities. We are seeking fair and reasonable changes that will allow our farmers to plow their fields -- changes that will not compel them to abandon their lands to see how they can earn a living on the other side of the border, only to find themselves facing the uncertainties that prevail over there. We are seeking changes that will enable us to take into account the important contributions we have received from our retirees and senior citizens -- people who are responsible for what we are today. Nevertheless, we cannot accomplish any of this with the government we now have. We cannot accomplish this if we continue with the current policies that have only led us into a situation of crisis -- a situation in which the only thing we can expect is that corruption, price increases, and environmental pollution will continue to pummel us. If we set our sights on this task, we can attain changes. These are changes for which we will have to work, especially if we expect to improve the climate of freedom. Enhancing the scope of democracy will allow us to develop economically and prevent us from stagnating, as has happened recently, and it will permit genuine social equality to exist in our country. It is critical for us to progress in three important areas: democracy, economic growth, and social equality. The current administration has said that economic growth comes first. Nevertheless, it has been unable to implement any changes, and it has not been able to institute democracy. This government has caused increased poverty, and I would like to call attention to the fact that the PRI candidate has said the greatest shame -- his greatest shame and his government's greatest shame -- is none other the poverty in which these people have plunged thousands of Mexicans. This poverty has tended to grow. I would like to call on all Mexicans to prepare for changes. All of us -- urban and rural workers, artists, and citizens throughout the entire country -- should prepare for these changes which, if we are willing, can be engendered. [Noriega] Ernesto Zedillo, candidate for the Institutional Revolutionary Party, PRI, has the floor for eight minutes. [Zedillo] Good evening, fellow citizens. Thank you for your attention. Good evening, Maite. Good evening, Messrs. candidates. I appreciate your acceptance of my 24 April invitation to hold this debate, which undoubtedly will strengthen our democracy. The upcoming 21 August elections are about the most important issues. They are about the future of Mexico; they are about the future of our families; they are about the future of our children. Tonight's debate is for and about the future of Mexico. Each Mexican family will have the well-being it deserves -- the well-being that it should have, which Mexicans have worked for in the past and will work for from this moment onward, and not because of what we have failed to do in the past. That is why tonight's debate is about the future, not the past, my fellow countrymen. I am sure that pretty soon Mexico can become the fully democratic country with progress and justice that all Mexicans are yearning for. That is why I assumed -- with great sorrow, yes, but also with steadfast determination -- the responsibility of becoming the standard bearer to replace Luis Donaldo Colosio. I have done so to work for the Mexico of which we all dream. I have confidence, my fellow citizens, in Mexico's future. My confidence resides in knowing that time and again we Mexicans have overcome our problems. We have overcome adversities. At times, we have defended our sovereignty, even with our own blood. My confidence also lies in my personal experience. I hail from a family in which limitations and poverty were a daily experience. Thanks to the efforts of my parents, however, and thanks to the efforts of my teachers and the opportunities offered to me by Mexico, I stand here today aspiring to be your president. This is Mexico -- a land of opportunity. My confidence is also based on our country's strength -- a strength that should make us Mexicans extremely proud. My hope to serve my fellow countrymen is substantiated by a life of work, study, and knowledge, and a life of getting to know the country's problems. It is supported by a public career of many years which I began when I was very young. My career has taken me from the most modest positions of public administration to accepting two state secretariats. I know that I am the youngest of the presidential candidates, but I can assure you that I am the one with the most experience in good government. I want to place my knowledge, my studies, and my experience at the service of my fatherland. Today, more than ever, I want to do so to become part of the solution to our problems. I want to do so in order that those problems which weigh heavily upon you today, my fellow citizens, can be overcome, because we have the ability to overcome them. In matters of justice, I am convinced that the country will progress only if all Mexicans adhere to the fulfillment of the Constitution and laws and if those people who fail to do so are invariably punished in the terms of the law itself. I must recognize the fact that this is not the case today. There are many people who are annoyed by the prevailing injustice, the lack of security, and violence, and, often, the corruption of the police corps and the Public Prosecutor and Attorney General's Offices. This is why I am proposing the total reformation of our judicial system. This must be a deep-rooted reform, starting virtually from ground zero, because we need a justice system that will function for the Mexican people. We must establish a legal system that will protect citizens' rights, that will avert violence, and that will rid us of our security problems. I am certain, my fellow citizens, that we can achieve this together. In terms of economic matters, without giving way to inflation and without returning to the policies of the past, we must reestablish growth. Our economy must grow faster than our population to enable us to generate the jobs you are demanding. This is why I propose an economic policy whose key mechanism will be the promotion of investment in order that we can take advantage of this great national state we have, as well as take advantage of the world markets that have opened, thereby generating the jobs that are being demanded. I think that with an investment policy that will encourage new businesses, bolster the ones extant, help the Mexican countryside, and encourage new activities in service and export industries, I am certain, my fellow citizens, that we are going to generate those jobs. I am also proposing to promote technology to give, together with training, a great boost to production. In other words, this should enable us to do things better in order that we can become more competitive, and, above all else, increase wages. New economic growth, my fellow citizens, will provide us with resources to fight poverty. Poverty is our greatest challenge. We must work to enable those many thousands of Mexicans who still live in conditions of poverty to overcome this poverty. We will do this without paternalism. We will break this vicious circle -- this circle of poverty and ignorance in which they are trapped today -- providing them with education, health, dignified housing, and alternative sources of employment. I propose that the greatest triumph of our generation be the defeat of poverty. With jobs, better salaries, justice, and a frontal attack on poverty, we will be satisfying your demands, fellow Mexicans. We will do so by strengthening our federal system, by making the decisions not here from the center but, rather, from where you live. We will do so, my fellow citizens, by strengthening our democracy. I invite you to work together with us for that future -- that future of progress, that future of justice, and that future of democracy, which we all want for our children, my fellow citizens. Thank you very much. [Noriega] Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, candidate for the National Action Party, has the floor for eight minutes. [Fernandez] My fellow Mexicans, friends: We are a young nation, with a majority of young people. We are a peace-loving people who want to work to live in a dignified manner and who want to progress. We have vast moral, cultural, religious, and historical wealth. Our country is large and beautiful, featuring abundant minerals and oil. As a birthright, we have the eternal embrace of the seas. We have over 10,000 km of coastline, 10,000 km of coastline and beaches, with everything that it implies, from the viewpoint of tourism, trade, and nourishment. In view of everything that we have, the question we must ask is: Why is there hunger, neglect, unemployment, insecurity, guerrillas, and death among us? I think it is because we have not achieved a just order, because we have not been able to form good governments, because policy usually is not subject to ethics, and because the economy has not been truly human. No, Dr. Zedillo, we have not come here to speak only of the future. To speak of the future, we must also speak of the present. To understand the present, we must speak of the past. In short, the debate will soon begin. For me, far beyond the extent of the debates, my interest is to invite you, the men and women of Mexico, "to participate in change, to leave selfishness, indecision, and cowardice." We need to know how to face the challenge today and we need authentic social leaders to turn into genuine political leaders. The task must be for all of us. Politics are far too important to leave them in the hands of politicians. Undoubtedly, we have all heard fiery speeches in favor of democracy. Generally, however, they are from the viewpoint of rights. The PAN wants to insist today, as it did 54 years ago, that democracy too is doing one's duty. I invite you -- friends and colleageus -- to all go and vote freely, according to your conscience, because in that manner, we can democratically direct the destiny of our nation. Dr. Zedillo, if we all agree that a change is urgent than we must agree that we do not want to change in such a way that everything remains the same. Nor do we want, Mr. Cardenas, to return to a past to which we should not return. "The National Action Party's view is that we should seek a change that does not imply destroying everything Mexico represents because it has cost the Mexicans a lot to have most of what we have." We need to achieve a change that will consolidate the good things, but at the same time be capable of overcoming and rectifying both political and economic diversions. I tell you, friends and colleagues, I believe that in the presidency I will be supported by you, as well as by the history of PAN and my work there, which has always been democratic. From the opposition, fellow citizens, the PAN has secured rectifications in the government. When the government has made rectifications, we have supported such decisions for Mexico, for you, for the nation. We have also clearly marked the differences we have with the government. The differences are both political and economic and I will mention them briefly. We continue to defend effective suffrage, which the government does not respect. We advocate division of powers, which is not respected in Mexico. We promote authentic federalism, the municipal life. In one word, we advocate the state of law. Economically, we continue to advocate a truly human economy, at the service of humankind, in which we will all have the opportunity to work and benefit from the distribution of wealth. I frankly believe we have deep differences. I tell my friends and companions that we have a country and we have the people. What we need is a good government. The PAN lives democracy internally and wants to share it with you, because it wants Mexico to live democratically. As PAN candidate, I invite you to support us for the Congress majority, to be able to reach the presidency of the republic, and to make Mexico a country in which we can live harmoniously with stability and progress. Thank you. [Noriega] The opportunity to reply now goes to PRI candidate Mr. Ernesto Zedillo for five minutes. Please go ahead, sir. [Zedillo] Thank you very much. My fellow Mexicans, during the past five years, our country has made enormous efforts to overcome a very pressing financial crisis. We have done it in order to set the foundations for future economic growth. Neverthless, we must acknowledge that this process has been very drawn-out. It has been a very difficult process. We are only now starting to witness the first concrete results. I have travelled throughout the country, and after campaigning for barely one month I have already received more than 34,000 letters. The common feature of all these letters is people's anguish over their lack of employment or lack of better wages. That is why I am proposing a national agenda, starting from the foundations we have already, to establish economic growth as the first priority during the next few years. I recommend to do this with a program based on trust, conviction, and investment promotion to encourage the jobs you are all demanding. A central feature in this strategy must be proposals related to small and medium-sized businesses since they are responsible for 60 percent of the country's employment. It is in this sector where Mexico's greatest export capacity lies. It is also because of this that I propose a fiscal, credit, training, and technology program to provide new incentives for small and medium-sized businesses to encourage the jobs you are demanding. Another issue very important for this agenda to address is attention to the rural sector. Fortunately, we have already carried out reforms to Article 27 of the Constitution which has resulted in ending an era of oppression against Mexican farmers. This reform explicitly establishes prohibitions on large landholdings and will enable us to fulfill the dreams of liberty and justice for which Zapata fought. That is why, beginning from the aforementioned legal ground rule, I propose a policy of dynamic investments in the rural sector. This policy will include training for farmers, new technology, access to timely credit and at fair prices, and guidelines that will enable them to market their products. My fellow compatriots, I propose we take advantage of our enormous national market and those foreign markets which are now opening up to us as a result of negotiations carried out by the government during the last few years. These negotiations were intended to create and elicit more employment. In addition, I propose that with the motivation we will elicit as a result of technology and training, we attempt to raise productivity. In turn, productivity will guarantee better wages for all Mexicans. With this new economic ability and more encouragement to save and invest, we will have a dynamic economy that will reward the efforts and sacrifices you have made during the last years to overcome the crisis. I am convinced that the time has come to pass from sound national finances - as Luis Donaldo [Colosio] would say - to sound household finances. It is time the effects of positive macro- economics be felt in the pockets and tables of each Mexican farmer and worker. I would like to assure you, my fellow compatriots, that all of this is possible and that we can all do it together. Mexico can have one of the world's most dynamic economies. This will be one of our greatest challenges during the years to come. I am quite sure that we can accomplish this as long as we set our sights on the future, as long as we decide not to revert to old policies, and as long as we remain willing not to experiment with what proved to be a complete failure. My fellow Mexicans, the future is in our hands. Let us all work together to make it happen. [Noriega] PAN candidate Diego Fernandez de Cevallos now has the opportunity to reply. Please proceed, Mr. Fernandez. You have five minutes. [Fernandez] Thank you, Maite. Well, since we are here for a debate I would have liked to focus my time on Mr. Zedillo because of what he represents. Nonetheless, these minutes are for you, Mr. Cardenas. On several occasions you have said that Mexico's options lie between what the government offers and the option for democracy that you represent. Using the facts, I will establish that you do not represent a democratic option and that moreover, you are a man who straddles both the opposition and government sides. Just look and see. Today, from the opposition, with democratic inflexibility, you contend that the government must remain on the sidelines of the election process. Yet you proceeded to implement an election law in Michoacan where you controlled the elections. I have a copy of the law right here. Second, today you describe yourself in schools and universities as a tolerant, pluralist man, respectful of the younger generation, freedom of expression, and freedom to teach. However, in 1985 during your term as Michoacan governor you imposed Marxist-Leninist teachings. The text you imposed at the time is right here, in case you wish to review it. And you are not just that, sir. In addition to appearing these days as a tolerant and respectful person -- and we might even say a person that students like -- the one thing you never mention to them is that you approved a law in Michoacan that really violates dignity, not only of the students but of an entire nation. I would like to read an article of the law which, by the way, was signed by you and which I hope you haven't forgetten. Just look for a minute at Article 101 of the State Education Law, which reads as follows: Any teacher who undertakes individual or collective activities that tend to disrupt public order will be separated from the state educational system. According to this law, all the youth involved in the events of 1968 would thus be out of the national education system. This is something you never mention to the students. Here is another concrete fact, sir. Today you criticize the government -- and rightly so -- for deceitfully and illegally transfering funds to the PRI. Yet you yourself transferred funds to the PRI when you were governor of Michoacan. You have already acknowledged this. I have a recording of you in case you would like to hear it. Last, you contend that you oppose the system of handpicking [dedazo] and presidential authoritarianism. I would like to demonstrate here, with documents, that you have indeed opposed handpicking, but only when it does not favor you. I would like to go back several years -- and Mr. Zedillo, please allow me to review some history here. In 1974 you say that when Echeverria appointed Mr. Torres Manzo to be presidential candidate through the usual mechanisms, you made a public statement that the government did not find amusing. Here is the proclamation. However, years later you were elected governor of Michoacan. When a friend of yours asked you how you were elected governor, you replied: I expressed my interest to the president of the republic, and I was finally advised that I was the candidate. Mr. Cardenas, this is evidence that you are in both the opposition and the government. I can understand your presidential aspirations, and even your obsession with wanting to become president, but we have gotten to know you as part of both the opposition and the government. In this respect we do not believe that you are the best option for Mexico. In conclusion, I would like to tell you that if we Mexicans are to believe your assertions that you represent the best democratic option for Mexico, then we would have to believe Aburto's claims that he is a pacifist. Thank you. [Noriega] PRI candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, you now have the floor for five minutes. Please proceed, sir. [Cardenas] I have never and will never conceal what I am. I acknowledge the events in which I have participated throughout my life, and in this respect, there is nothing for which I can reproach myself. I have been permanently involved in a struggle for democracy, the country's improvement, and our nation's sovereignty. I want to say that the proposals we heard during the first part of this block of time might sound pretty similar to those who are listening to or watching us. But it seems that our words do not always mean the same thing. We have strong differences with the PRI and the PAN. Regarding the PRI, I can say specifically that we cannot believe them. We have no reason to believe either the official party's candidate or the official party itself. They say one thing and do another. We all know that 6 July 1988 was marked by fraud and that this served as the basis for a government that to this day -- something about which we can do nothing -- lacks legitimacy. All candidates present here have spoken at one time or another about clean elections. But we say that the 6 July elections were the most fraudulent elections in the country's history. At this point we should ask that when each of us speaks about the upcoming elections, the PRI may be thinking that the 21 August elections will be exactly the same as those of 6 July 1988. We also have differences with the PAN. One particular difference led us to not only adopt different positions but also to confront each other on our views of how to move toward democracy. When we voted in 1989 on the constitutional reforms of electoral issues, when the PAN voted with the PRI to take a step backwards, to close off democratic opportunities, this led to a confrontation between us. Nevertheless, I would like to use this occasion to invite PAN to join efforts so we can make our country move toward democracy -- to unite so that, in a joint effort, PAN and the Party of the Democratic Revolution can make a decisive contribution for a democratic change in our country. We cannot believe the government candidate. It seems like he is just now noticing corruption, unemployment, and the many things lacking in the country. He seems only now to notice that government policies are a failure. He said this himself a few minutes, a few moments ago. He admits the failure of government policies due to all the backwardness these have caused the country. Thus we have no reason to believe in the system, the regime, which has been the greatest manufacturer of unemployment in our country, which offered us 1 million jobs a year and has barely been able to meet one-third of this goal. The government offered us supported, sustained, and growing education; instead, our educational system has seriously deteriorated. We cannot believe those who offered us economic growth. Today we are clearly bogged down. We must remember that the development plan was prepared by Dr. Zedillo. By now we should have achieved 6 percent growth, by the end of the six-year period, and we are barely at 0.4 percent growth. These policies -- the ones offered by Dr. Zedillo -- cannot lead us to anything but six more years of the same. Six years of stagnation, corruption, contamination -- six years that would only mean a decline, an abyss for the Mexican people. [Noriega] Candidate Diego Fernandez de Cevallos of the National Action Party, you have three minutes. [Fernandez] Thank you. Mr. Cardenas, of course I am willing to work with all those who want to work for democracy, but in a serious manner, not only when it is advantageous or circumstantially favorable. You did not rebut any charges, so I will dedicate these minutes to Dr. Zedillo. Dr. Zedillo, I want to tell you something that perhaps many millions of Mexicans would like to say. According to the information we have been given recently, we know you were a good boy who got high grades. But you don't get a passing grade in democracy. Let me tell you why. Allow me to make a comparison. I am here because thousands of free men and women in the PAN voted freely for my candidacy. You, with all due respect, are here as a result of two tragedies. On the one hand, the death of Colosio. On the other hand, the presidential designation. You are not responsible for the first one, but the second one disqualifies you. At least, if we are speaking of democracy. On another topic, in what is left of my time -- your strength is economics. We know you are a good economist, and your most outstanding participation in the government, some aspects of which you mentioned, has been precisely in economic areas. There the government has failed on fundamental issues. As a political party we have tried to act honestly. We recognize and are not ashamed to admit the things the government has done right. That is the function of the honest opposition, not to destroy everything or to question everything arbitrarily. I do want to tell you that when we do find differences, we make note of them. For us, your national development plan accounts for 40 million poor; 40 million poor is the outcome of your national development plan. Of course, there are some macroeconomic plans that we have recognized, but the final outcome is not justified. We hope you can tell us what happened to the projections you made, as secretary, of the deficit in current accounts. You made projections and failed repeatedly and for years by thousands of millions of dollars. We hope that you can tell us, if time permits, what happened to your growth projections of 6 percent for 1993. We are at least 15 times below that. And regarding your plans and promises, I want to tell you that in any event I will have to believe you 15 times less than what you say. Thank you. [Noriega] Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, candidate of the Party of the Democratic Revolution, you have three minutes. [Cardenas] I am surprised by the democracy that the PAN candidate sometimes preaches. I would think that we have to be looking at the government front in Guanajuato, not Carlos Medina, but Vicente Fox. In short, that is just something I will leave for you to ponder. I insist that we cannot believe the PRI candidate. The judicial officials who engage in extortion, the inspectors who accept bribes, the chiefs -- those who were hired to establish cordons in Lomas Taurinas in Tijuana on 23 March -- all belong to the PRI. Why should we believe the government candidate now when he offers changes? The ruling party candidate has been an outstanding official of this regime, although I would not say a man of experience in good government because we have seen that his passage through the government in reality has been failure, failure in programming, failure in education. But the important thing is what lies ahead. Why should we believe the PRI candidate when the government is the principal promoter of violence, the one that caused the Chiapas uprising, the one clearly responsible for corruption which Dr. Zedillo now recognizes? He now realizes, now that he is candidate, that there is corruption in the government. This was not until now. It took him quite a while to find out that there were flaws, things wanting, inefficiencies, and corruption in the government. Now we wants to correct it. He did not do this when he was an official in charge of important government positions. You, Dr. Zedillo, are the ones who generate violence; who are responsible for corruption both inside and outside the government; who have prevented the country from growing, from having better living conditions, from having more opportunities in education and culture, from making use of our natural resources. You have led the country -- and I insist on this -- to this economic stagnation, which has generated the largest unemployment figures ever recorded in our history. [Noriega] Ernesto Zedillo, PRI presidential candidate, you have three minutes, sir. [Zedillo] Thank you. First, I would very respectfully like to ask the candidates not to seek political profit from the murder of Luis Donaldo Colosio -- particularly you, Mr. Cardenas. Throughout Luis Donaldo Colosio's campaign, you frequently used your well-known verbal violence. I was especially offended when on 10 December, in Hermosillo, Sonora, you called Luis Donaldo Colosio a bad Mexican who was acting against the national interest. Instead of trying to profit politically from his image, you should apologize to Luis Donaldo Colosio's family. Mr. Cardenas has said that the proposals all sound alike. That is true, because day by day his proposals become more and more like those of the government. As Mr. Cardenas realizes that his proposals are not welcomed by the Mexican people, he has adopted the government's proposals for himself. The question that arises now is: What would have happened if Mr. Cardenas had won six years ago, which he did not, and we had followed the economic policies he offered us? These were political policies of government deficit, that ignored inflation, allowed uncontrolled public spending, opened more state enterprises with subsidies to be paid by the people. My fellow Mexicans, the answer is very clear. Today the country would be submerged in the deepest of poverties. Our economy would be a shambles. This is why I insist on speaking about the good things we have achieved, and there are plenty of them, which are not the result of the government's efforts alone, but of the efforts of the whole Mexican community. We must recognize our faults. I do. I will be the first to do so. We must move on, based on our strong points and our weak points. We have everything we need for a growing economy. We have the foundations, thanks to our sacrifice and our efforts. I propose we begin growing again and use the profits of that growth to fight poverty. I insist. Fighting poverty is our greatest challenge, and I am sure that fighting and defeating poverty will be the greatest achievement of our generation. [Noriega] We have concluded the first part of our debate. Now we would like to hear general proposals from each of the candidates. Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, PRD presidential candidate, you have five minutes, sir. [Cardenas] The axis of our proposal is democratic change: moving toward democracy by ending the current government party regime. On the other hand, we have the recovery of a productive economy. We must make one very important change. This will be a radical change in our country: Start abiding by the law and the constitution that the government systematically violates every day in this country. If we abide by the law, we will have a radically different country. We favor the separation of powers, true federalism, autonomy of our municipalities, the development of a system of freedom in our country. We want to recover our economy by centering our efforts on establishing economic policies and generating jobs. These are the main challenges Mexico will face to effectively reactivate our economy, as we move toward the end of the 20th century and into the beginning of the 21st century. We propose establishing an economy that takes people into account, not like that of the current government, which has disregarded Mexicans. We will begin an emergency plan that focuses on job creation and the reactivation of the economy, after launching an intense public works program that may lead economic growth in our country. Additionally, we will begin to prepare a plan for sustained growth that we can implement beginning in 1996, that is, after the first year of government. This will permit us to reactivate and promote productive investments, as well as to finance our development without going into debt. We will only spend what we earn. On the other hand, this plan will enable us to implement profound fiscal reform, creating a fairer and simpler tax system. This will permit us to end fiscal terrorism. We are going to eliminate the 2 percent tax on company assets as well as the harsh tax system. But I didn't want to end this segment without raising other concerns. The government continues to violate our laws systematically. It continues to create dependency relationships, appointing officials who earn high wages and who are above the laws promulgated by the government. Why did we create this national security coordinating board? With this we place officials above the secretaries of government, national defense, and the Navy. This is an offense against our Armed Forces. On the other hand, we see that the government is purchasing water cannon vehicles. Is this to prepare for elections? Why does this government want this equipment? Why is this equipment being delivered to the Secretariat of National Defense? I believe this equipment should never have entered the national territory. In any case, it should have been delivered to municipal and metropolitan police forces. Or does the government want to pit the Armed Forces against the people? Does the government once again want to pit society against the members of our Army and Navy? This is the only explanation that can be found for these policies: to continue pitting Mexicans against Mexicans and not trying to resolve problems through conciliation. Let us agree on how to advance. Let us agree on how to resolve problems. Let us all decide to walk together, those who may agree or disagree -- the former carry more weight -- to create democracy, to advance, to create a productive economy, and to achieve social equality. Every day this government is taking us farther away from social equality. [Noriega] PRI candidate Ernesto Zedillo, you have five minutes. [Zedillo] Thank you very much. I would like to use this time to address a very important issue for all Mexicans. I am referring to education, compatriots. Do you know education is the key to individual, family, and national advancement? Do you know the only real thing parents can leave to their children is a good education? Even those less privileged Mexicans know this very well. A few days ago, a street boy, Jesus Crisantos, a boy who does not own anything, a boy who lives on the streets abandoned and exposed to vice and criminality, told me: Candidate, what we need most is education, because you know that when we grow up, if we don't have education, we will not accomplish anything in our lives. If we have education, we will show the people who think the kids in the streets are worthless that we are very valuable. Even Crisantos, the street boy, has a clear idea about the value of education. Like all of you, I am convinced that we have to embark on a huge crusade for national education in the next few years. I had the very high honor of being the education secretary for almost two years. With the Mexican teachers' support, I was able to implement an educational reform program during this period. This reform allowed us to decentralize education, out of the hands of the federal government and into the hands of local governments. It was a true act of federalism because we took power, resources, and authority from the federal government and gave them to local governments. We were able to accomplish the first reform of lesson plans, programs, and material in 20 years. We also established a new promotion system for Mexican teachers. Furthermore, we worked to reform Article 3 of the Constitution and established for the first time in our country, the right to education, compulsory education, and the government's obligation to provide preschool education. Although we accomplished all this, compatriots, we know there is still a lot to do in education. That is why I propose a great crusade for national education. We must set ambitious goals for the year 2000. I propose, compatriots, that we end illiteracy. I propose, compatriots, that we guarantee that all children of age attend grade school because, even today, 15 percent of our children do not enter grade school, and many leave school before the sixth grade. I propose, compatriots, that we make high school compulsory. I propose that we multiply opportunities for training and technological education. I propose, compatriots, that we give a big push to further university studies at public universities and technology institutes. We have to make sure that no boy with talent, ability and desire be left without university studies. Let us establish a national scholarship system for them. I propose, compatriots, as a special task, that we take education to the less privileged sectors in the country. Allow me to tell you that it will not be enough to open a school with teachers to achieve this objective. We have to take a big step and establish assistance programs that will provide food to those children so they can enter school and can remain there. It is a big task, compatriots, but it will be worth it. It is a task that we have to undertake for the future of our children. It is a task that will cost money. But I am sure we will be able to achieve this goal with the resources generated by our new economic growth. I believe it is a worthwhile cause. The country's best investment is in its people because they are the foundation of our future. Thank you, compatriots. [Noriega] PAN candidate Diego Fernandez de Cevallos. Please, you have five minutes. [Fernandez] Thank you, Maite. I must respond to two charges. First, Mr. Cardenas, in Guanajuato the election was won by PAN. The post belonged to PAN. If we only managed to partially correct the transgression, don't blame us -- that is all we were able to do. We are not to be blamed for a fraud that was only partially corrected. However, I would like to tell you that I hope we can talk about electoral issues in the next debates, as you have suggested. For the time being, I have documents here with me, which I can present to you right now, on 23 cases in Michoacan, where your party was the one that emerged victorious and not as clearly as PAN's and Foxx's victory in Guanajuato. I am at your disposal for any debate on the issue. Second, Dr. Zedillo, I have done nothing that could lead you to recommend that I not try to profit from Colosio's death. I have been very respectful regarding this tragedy. I was appalled at the crime and publicly expressed consternation. I only said that this crime was one of the reasons you were here. However, I also said that you were not responsible for it. I have not profited from the insidious and cowardly crime against Colosio. I now move on to the proposals. From the PAN's perspective, it is not a matter of well-intended and demagogic recipes. Mexico's problem is that the country needs to be rebuilt. The country's reconstruction demands that all Mexicans make a big effort to develop a clear vision -- from a truly humane point of view -- of what Mexico is, with both its history, Dr. Zedillo, and its present in mind so that we can further its future. It is not a matter of inventing patches, recipes, or new programs and projects; we already know where they end up. We need a clear philosophy to run the country, we need democracy, and we need money. Allow me to list a few basic measures -- briefly, because we only have a few minutes. 1. As president of the republic I will form a plural government. This is fundamental. It will not be a partisan government. A pluralist government is necessary if we want to attain peace and harmony among Mexicans. 2. As president of the republic, Mr. Zedillo and Mr. Cardenas, I will not be the head of a political party. I believe I would be the first Mexican president not to be the head of a political party. 3. I will respect and abide by the 20 agreements for democracy, which a very broad-based group of very prominent citizens from all across the nation have presented to the presidential candidates. I adopted it as my own because it is concurrent with the discourse and programs of the PAN, and therefore, I endorse the commitment. 4. I will respect the federal authority of the states and municipalities. 5. I will immediately increase by 100 percent the budget allotments for every municipality. This is a clear and viable offer. The allotments for each and every municipality in the country will be increased 100 percent. Let no one tell me that this is an unrealistic increase, because by removing just one expense account from the president's hands, we can increase the municipalities allotments 100 percent. 6. As part of a heroic national crusade for public security, I would propose the creation of a national guard. That is already included in the Constitution. 7. Regarding the administration of justice, I would propose the creation of a general council, tasked with recomposing and reorganizing this branch of government. 8. A national crusade is also urgent in education. We must reevaluate the role of our teachers. We must not change the secretary of education three and four times during the term, as was the case in this presidential term. We must increase spending and charge it to related items on the budget and to contributions from the community, especially if implementing a policy that would make such contributions tax deductible. During the next administration we must achieve absolute discipline and honesty in government spending. We must pursue the fair, simple, clear, and permanent regulation of our administrative and judicial laws to allow farming and small and medium-size industry to flourish. Speaking of agriculture, our farmers demand justice and money. As time is short, I can only say that I will not allow a single case of land tenure or squatting. Let me say that during my next turn I will address financial openness. This is essential to prevent banking oligopoly and to create millions of jobs that the country needs. Thank you. [Noriega] Ernesto Zedillo, PRI presidential candidate, you have the floor for three minutes. [Zedillo] Thank you. My fellow Mexicans, this time I would like to continue on the issue of justice. One of the most distressing problems worrying our people, our families, is the lack of public security. We must admit that today the people do not feel that the law is on their side. Every day we hear about acts of violence, aggression against the honest and decent citizens of our cities. Quite frankly we must accept that our justice system leaves much to be desired. There are examples of corruption in the police force, in the Attorney General's Office, in the district attorney's offices, and there the deficiencies in the administration of justice which are almost commonplace. One of the main proposals of the government I hope to lead is to completely reorganize our justice system. Such reform must begin by reviewing of our laws. Let's face it -- in our country there are still unjust laws. One clear example are the laws that deprive our women of their equal rights. I have presented a package of modifications to change that. I have also said that the the executive branch should not monopolize the work of the Attorney General's Office. I will promote the necessary reforms to end that monopoly. I will modify, in coordination with state governments as part of our federal pact, the way in which police corps prepare, operate, and function. I will sponsor reforms of the Judicial Branch, undoubtedly to give it a greater autonomy; to give it total independence from the Federal Executive Branch; but it must also be a reform which guarantees that judges will be fair and that they will always grant citizens their legal rights. Fellow citizens, now is the time to launch that great legal reform. I intend to make this one of the first points in our government. It is true we must end corruption, impunity, arbitrariness. Hence, the legal reform. [Noriega] PAN candidate Diego Fernandez de Zevallos has three minutes to speak. [Fernandez] Thank you. Undoubtedly, financial opening is necessary in this country. The government has committed a crime by opening up Mexican borders to the competition of the farming sector and the micro, small, and medium-sized enterprise, while protecting a banking oligopoly. This is not fair. This is a crime that cannot continue. We need to use internal and external savings to capitalize the farm sector, as well as micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises. We also need to get society involved in creating a modern infrastructure. Just think of the railroads. They are still Porfirio's after 100 years. I will promote the immediate opening and pluralism of the media, without insults or rancor toward anyone. You know who I am talking about. We all have the need to have media sources that are useful to society. I would like to make one final reflection, ladies and gentlemen. It is necessary that the government always maintain a frank, sincere, and constructive dialogue with the whole population. It is necessary for the government to call on the population to work on Mexico's behalf. The government of the republic must guarantee that there will not be harshness or tolerance with regard to the law; there must simply be justice and understanding so that all Mexicans can get along well. I am determined to undertake, with your support, a federal government, a presidency of the republic that will radiate nobleness, dignity, and capacity to resolve problems. I am sure this can be done with your support. It is necessary that, once and for all, Mexicans have a government to support, a government to trust, a government of which to make demands. It is not fair once more that plans come and go, that once more they become just literature gone with the wind. Today we demand a commitment to the truth, and today the democratic choice is indubitably National Action. This is the peaceful offer I will talk about later. Thank you. [Noriega] PRD candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas will now speak for three minutes. [Cardenas] The PRI candidate has realized too late that there are corruption and deficiencies in the police forces, the Attorney General's Office, and in the administration of justice. We should ask ourselves: why does he realize this now? Above all, why does he wait until now to report this? Why didn't he do it when he was an official in the current administration? It is now that he realizes many promises in the education sector -- he was secretary of education -- have not been fulfilled. Acccording to the Constitution, elementary and secondary education are mandatory. One-fourth of the children who should go to elementary school do not. In secondary school, only 26 of 100 who first register are able to graduate. No effort was made in this administration to meet the constitutional obligation of making elementary and secondary education mandatory. This government did not care much about improving conditions for workers. Today, teachers earn in real terms less than half -- 48 percent -- of what they earned in 1981. Why must we then believe the progovernment candidate when he said he will now begin to worry about education, that there will now be training programs, that there will now be better and more schools for Mexicans? His administration incurred very heavy spending -- and he says we have to invest in people. Well, sometimes investments are made in people -- but only in some, and in very few. Indeed, they invested in very few people to prepare and publish the textbooks that many of our children still lack. The very costly textbooks are still being stored in the Education Secretariat, and we have yet to hear a public explanation about why a contest was held, prizes given, printing expenses paid, and the books then shelved when our children lack basic textbooks in schools throughout the country. What does the PRI candidate offer us? More of the same? More lies? More unkept promises? I do not think this is what the majority of Mexicans want. I think we want a reasonable and just change. [Noriega] PAN Candidate Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, you have three minutes. [Fernandez] To end? [Noriega] No, sir, you have three minutes in this second segment. [Fernandez] In this second segment, I would like to insist that today, more than ever, it is necessary to seek the votes of all Mexicans, the votes that Mexico needs: the vote of conscience, the vote of reason, the vote that will seek a better future for us all. We cannot accept the vote of fear, that accomplice fear that will allow everything to continue the same -- to Mexico's detriment, should it happen. To continue the same is to deteriorate. Nor can we accept the vote of rancor and resentment, which comes with vengeance and violence. We need the vote of harmony, the vote of peace. The National Action Party candidate invites you to work together for a Mexico free of lies. We need to take advantage of this opportunity to rebuild the entire country. We, the men and women of Mexico, need to make an effort. Allow me to make a special call to youngsters. I call the young people of this country to intervene seriously and in depth, without lies, without pranks, without cowardice. All Mexicans have to step in, but there is a bounty, an endowment, an incalculable treasure in the women of Mexico. I believe that women can, if they decide to do so, change Mexico on 21 August. They can change, on 21 August, the course of a country that will only improve with the work of all its children. I ask young people and women to decide for an honest, peaceful, pluralist, civilized change. We need to include everybody in this effort. PAN's political offer is pluralist and democratic. Dr. Zedillo said a few days ago that he will not form a pluralist government. This is tragic. These days anybody who understands the signs of the times has to present a broad range of views in the new government to be formed. This new pluralist government will be formed by the PAN candidate when he assumes the presidency. It will have more participation by the people, because only thus can we all work together to make this great effort to save Mexico from the tragedy that is so close at hand. We need to achieve change. We will surely achieve it because Mexico has a great future that cannot be lost. [Noriega] PRD candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, you have three minutes, please. [Cardenas] I don't know how the PAN candidate can call on all Mexicans to join him and change the country when he has shown such clear contempt for so many Mexicans. I only want to recall that on more than one occasion, he called one group of Mexicans, who with reason were demanding housing because they lacked it, riffraff [descalzonados]. I don't understand a candidate who addresses his compatriots in search of votes and then talks about them in such terms. This Sunday, the most recent one, the PRI candidate met with taxi drivers. It was a good meeting, according to the media. They offered the PRI candidate a beer, and he accepted. However, he said they had to put it in a glass so that it would look like cider. I ask you here: Does the PRI candidate want to give us beer for cider and cider for beer? Is this the offer of Dr. Zedillo, the current candidate of the official party, who has so many university degrees and so many academic merits, about which he boasts so much? Is this the type of government he wants to give the Mexicans? A government, I insist, in which he will give us cider for beer and beer for cider? I also want to consider the people with whom the PRI candidate will govern. Who is backing him? We have seen pronouncements paid for by government officials, who say they used their own money -- maybe, maybe not. But he is supported by the people responsible for past six-year periods. Let us recall the statement that journalists called the Dinosaurs Manifesto. This is what the PRI candidate offers us: a return to corruption, populist practices, and a return to those -- they are the ones who support him -- who are mainly responsible for the deteriorated, disastrous economic, social, and political situation in which we now live. I end and insist, cider for beer and beer for cider, is this the PRI candidate's offer? [Noriega] PRD candidate Ernesto Zedillo, you have three minutes. [Zedillo] Thank you. Half truths are but half lies. It is not right to lie to the people, even if only a little bit. Lies and verbal violence will only divide Mexicans and damage our social peace. Just now, when Engineer Cardenas referred to education issues, he only said a small part of the truth, and in doing so, he told a big lie. Engineer Cardenas, the balance you have made of the current government's education effort is not true. Perhaps, your advisers, with very bad intentions, did not give you the correct information. During the current government, spending on education, in real terms, increased 100 percent. Most of this increase was allotted to increase Mexican teachers' wages. It's true -- there is still a lot to be done and this is my commitment. You also did not tell the exact truth when you talked about the books in storage. It is true there was a contest, but in the end the panel of judges decided that those books should not be printed and they were not. There are no books on shelves, as you said. So, please, tell the whole truth. I want to use the rest of my time in this segment, compatriots, to talk about democracy. I want to attest to you that my personal commitment, my commitment as a Mexican, is to further democracy in our fatherland. I want to assure you, compatriots, that we want more than your vote on 21 August. We want legality, credibility, and legitimacy. I am convinced that thanks to the electoral reforms made during the past years, Mexicans will have an electoral system that will totally guarantee the effectiveness of their vote. I do trust the almost 2 million Mexicans who will participate in the preparation and implementation of those elections. Out of those almost 2 million Mexicans, only a few belong to my party. Thus, let us have confidence. The next elections will be clean. [Noriega] Now each of the candidates will deliver his final message. You will have three minutes to do this. PRD candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, we will start with you now. [Cardenas] I call on all of you, the Mexicans, to win the right to build our democracy. I will form a government with the best Mexican men and women, a government that will not just belong to the PRD, but one that will include all those who have actively participated in the democratic movement -- people in private organizations; in business, banking, and commerce; and people who are now in universities -- to have the pluralist government our country needs to be able to move into democracy. I am going to call for -- this is a promise, and I have to say it in the singular -- I am going to initiate efforts so we can call a national referendum to reform our Constitution. We have to make ample reforms to our Constitution so we can have a constituent assembly in 1997. This body will prepare the new Constitution that is to include our aspirations and, based on this constitutional framework, find solutions to the country's needs and problems. The next government will not be a government in which the PRD will replace the PRI. We do not want any more government parties. Thus, my party, in this case, will not be the one to replace the current government party. Let us have confidence in the vote and in the next elections, despite the conditions in which they are taking place. Let us remember that changes thought to be impossible -- Mandela is president of South Africa now and the opposition has won in Panama -- are today a reality. Let us have confidence in ourselves. Let us go into these elections with faith, drive, and a lot of votes. Our votes will decide the future of our country in the latter part of the 21st century. I pledge to you that I will respect the electoral results and will make them be respected. We want independent management. We want Carlos Salinas to promise that he will not interfere in this election. We want Carlos Salinas to promise that the 21 August elections will not be the same as the 6 July elections. I have confidence in the support of my compatriots. I have confidence that, together with you, I will be forming the next government and that this government will be the one to establish and develop democracy in our country. [Noriega] Thank you, sir. PRI candidate Ernesto Zedillo, it is your turn. [Zedillo] Compatriots, I thank you sincerely for your attention. Messrs. candidates, I thank you for accepting this invitation. I invite you to meet and debate again. I invite you to debate, but now to include the other candidates too. As I have said from the beginning and throughout my campaign, we should have the opportunity to compare our ideas with those of all the candidates. Thus, I invite you to join me in a debate that will include all the candidates. For my part, compatriots, I will continue my political campaign tomorrow. I will do so intensely and will continue to talk to all the Mexican men and women, especially those who have less. I will do this because I aspire to be president of the republic. And I aspire to be president of the republic, compatriots, to work with you in building the Mexico we all want. I propose, compatriots, that we work together to further an economy that will generate the jobs and wages you are demanding. I propose that we work together on reorganizing and installing a system of justice capable of ending insecurity, violence, and aggression against our citizens. I propose, fellow Mexicans, that we launch an offensive against poverty. I propose, fellow Mexicans, that we remember the poor peasants, our Indian brothers, the elderly, and the handicapped when we wage our battle on poverty. I propose, fellow Mexicans, that we make equality for women a reality in law. I propose, fellow Mexicans, that we work together. [Noriega] Your time is up, sir. [Zedillo] You only gave me two minutes. [Noriega] Very well. [Zedillo] I apologize, the moderator made a mistake. I will take one minute to close. Excuse me. I propose, fellow Mexicans, that we work together during the coming years to build that future of progress for our children. I ask you not to hesitate and to vote on 21 August. Go and vote with the assurance that your vote will be respected. I ask you to think of your children's future and your family's future when you cast your vote. Thank you. [Noriega] Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, presidential candidate for the PAN. [Fernandez] According to the rules of this debate, I cannot respond forcefully during this last speech, because Mr. Cardenas cannot answer. All I want to say, Mr. Cardenas, is that your accusation is unfair. I did not call those poor people who were demanding housing riffraff. I called the leaders who agitate them and never show their faces riffraff. Please read PROCESO and journalist (Galarza), a professional journalist, and you will find the text of what I said then and am reaffirming now. I did not call them that, and I cannot accept your accusation. To conclude, the PAN has been struggling for democracy for 54 years. It has been struggling for 54 years so that Mexico may live in a state of law, and we are going to make it in the next administration. We have also been fighting for a more humane economy, so we can all live with dignity, jobs, justice, and law for all, thus guaranteeing that dignified, safe, and sufficient lifestyle for all Mexican families. In closing, I wish to say that if I have not failed you now that I am a candidate, I will not fail you as president. I need your support on 21 August, but I will need greater support from you for the six years following that, because I can only be a good president for Mexico with your help. [Noriega] Thank you sir. We thank all the candidates for their participation in this debate. My apologies again to Mr. Zedillo. On behalf of the National Chamber of Radio and Television broadcasters, we hope this event will serve to enlighten and unify all Mexicans. Good night.
