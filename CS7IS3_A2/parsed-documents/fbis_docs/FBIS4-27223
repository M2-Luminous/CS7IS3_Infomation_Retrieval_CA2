It was painful to have to acknowledge that he had been wrong to use the trade bludgeon to improve human rights in China. Saying the policy had "outlived its usefulness" would not fool those who had tracked this doomed approach, but it was the best construction that could be put on a policy blunder. But Mr. Clinton was honest; credit due to him for that would, it is hoped, ease the disappointment of having to endure another setback in a spell of political and personal reverses. For China, there must be immense satisfaction that it has bent America to its will on the cold logic of economics and its strategic importance to a world which has discarded one by one the old assumptions valid during the era of the U.S.-Soviet contest. But it should not gloat. The MFN tussle was not a chess game to determine which of the two countries could manoeuvre more smartly. China prevailed in spite of itself; its harsh treatment of citizens who disagree openly with the government cannot continue, with or without the censure of world opinion. Rather, what this episode proved was that despite mutual distaste -- over America's meddlesome policies and China's intrusive policing of its citizenry -- the U.S. and China need to seek a form of accomodation that will stand them in good stead into the next century. China can be a benign force for stability in the Asia- Pacific region: exerting pressure on North Korea to minimise the nuclear risk, its vibrant growth spreading prosperity down to Indochina and Southeast Asia, economic expansion taking the sting out of whatever hegemonic intensions it may have. Recognising that withholding trade privileges would bring misery to millions of workers in China, Hong Kong and the U.S. in return for minimal gains in human rights compliance would, one hopes, bring about a new enlightenment in America's relations with big and potentially powerful nations. Economic need now surpasses pure ideology. That has been much conceded by Mr. Clinton with the tacit disavowal of his executive order linking renewed MFN to "significant progress" in China's handling of human rights issues. Consider some numbers -- 182 countries enjoy MFN with the U.S. with only nine denied it; 150,000 American jobs will be in jeopardy if China could sell only a fraction of the U.S.$33 billion worth of goods it sold to the U.S. last year. For people in Asia, relief that a collision has been averted must be tempered by this realisation: as much as Mr. Clinton's backdown will not be cost-free where his domestic standing and re-election chances are concerned, China needs to return the favour. That simply means that it has to treat its people better. Torture, disappearances in the night, inhumane incarceration, now an embarrassment, would be unacceptable infractions as China comes up in the world. The White House National Security Adviser, Mr. Anthony Lake, was not trying to salvage a bad situation when he said the American spotlight on human rights had concentrated Chinese minds on the issue. America did make a candid contribution. Mr. Clinton says his country will persist with the crusade. With the linkage with trade removed, it all looks more palatable. Asian countries, on their part, have to use moral persuasion and quiet diplomacy to impress upon China the need to reciprocate America's gesture by taking the brutishness out of its treatment of political prisoners. But a distinction has to be made: using human rights as a cover for imposing so-called minimum labour standards as a means of cancelling out the developing world's advantage must be exposed for what it is. The U.S. and France, egged on by certain human rights watchdog groups, have kept this on the backburner despite a roasting they received at the GATT conference in Morocco recently. But it will not go away.
