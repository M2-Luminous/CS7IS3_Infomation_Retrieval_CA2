The dismissed leadership does not accept the decision, hence there are two competing heads and two party boards. At this rate, NYD will drop out of parliament in this fall's elections, Timo Seppaenen reports. [Seppaenen] Harriet Colliander is a name that will go down in Sweden's political history. Colliander will ensure the inclusion of her name in records as her country's shortest-lived party leader. Less than two months ago, she was elected chairwoman of New Democracy. Yesterday, an extraordinary party congress dismissed her from her post, together with the entire party board. During Colliander's short term of office, NYD's parliamentary group was entirely split. The process of firing the party chairwoman was started by a farce in the voting in parliament on subsidies for home care, in which the party group was split three ways. Because of its internal wrangling, New Democracy has lost its excellent position in Swedish politics. The party is no longer able to swing the government despite its position of holding the balance, which it gained in the elections. [passage omitted] The party chairwoman, dismissed yesterday, and the party board do not regard the decision by the extraordinary party congress as legal and will not give up their posts. The newly elected leaders admit that they will stay in their posts for a couple of weeks on a temporary basis. In that period, the party's 3,000 or so members will have to vote on whether they support the new leadership. [passage omitted] There is some basis for NYD remaining in parliament. Vivianne Franzen, who has been elected new chairwoman, is a skillful demagogue. She is seeking votes by expressing anti-immigrant views, scaring the Swedes with the growing influence of Muslims. Franzen's chances are also boosted by the fact that she is supported by Ian Wachtmeister and Bert Karlsson, NYD's two charismatic founders. [passage omitted]
