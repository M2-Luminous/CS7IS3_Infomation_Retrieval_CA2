Vahi said in an interview to BNS that "with regard to the taxation system, we are of the opinion that the taxation policy of the future coalition between the Assembly Party and Pro Patria will pay more attention to the interests of enterprises than the present policy." Vahi told BNS he attaches great importance to future cooperation between the two parties. The Assembly Party recently proposed coalition talks to Pro Patria. The Pro Patria parliament faction plans to discuss the offer on Tuesday [15 March]. "(Prime Minister) Mart Laar's unwillingness to collaborate with the Assembly Party doesn't mean that the entire Pro Patria declines to cooperate with the Assembly Party," Vahi said in a comment on the statement Laar made on Saturday. Laar, who is Pro Patria's chairman, told BNS on Saturday that the implementation of Assembly Party policies would send taxes skyrocketing and put a stop to radical economic reform. It is difficult for Pro Patria to find points of contact with "red directors" and former collective farm managers, he claimed. "Pro Patria takes no interest in collaboration with the specialists of the Assembly Party administration who granted multimillion-kroon interest-free risk credits and whose thoughtless guarantees have caused the state damage to the tune of over 100 million kroons," the premier said. The editorial in today's issue of the Hommikuleht daily regards Laar's statement as an attempt to foil the forthcoming meeting with the Assembly Party leader. A Hommikuleht commentator voiced the opinion that Laar dreads Vahi "like lightning," since the leader of the Assembly Party has been making overtures to the Pro Patria wing that has distanced itself from Laar: "The premier has reason to fear that he may drop the reins of Pro Patria, which he holds not too securely, anyway." Vahi claimed that the Assembly Party program largely coincides with that of Pro Patria. The party, however, strives for a more decentralized taxation policy, elimination of turnover tax levied on entrepreneurs who import goods, and changing of the taxation system concerning taxes levied on farmers, Vahi said commenting on the differences between the two parties' programs. "I think that, if we solve these questions, the actual tax burden of enterprises will decrease," Vahi said. He maintained that the taxation policy of the future Assembly Party-Pro Patria coalition should be more enterprise-friendly. The Assembly Party led by former Prime Minister Tiit Vahi is at present in opposition. Opinion polls indicate, however, that it holds the top position among Estonian political parties. The party also won the elections to the Tallinn City Council last autumn.
