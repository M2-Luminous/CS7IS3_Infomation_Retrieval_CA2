Reform is currently in a stage of overcoming the strategic barrier. We must pay special attention to social stability. We must stabilize commodity prices, successfully combat corruption, promote clean government, and control investment in fixed assets to create a favorable external environment for reform. Local authorities must carry out meticulous organization and study, promptly resolve new problems appearing in the course of reform, reduce risks, and work with one heart and one mind to ensure the smooth progress of reform." This statement was repeatedly and emphatically made by Li Lanqing, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and vice premier of the State Council, during his recent inspection tour of Zhejiang. From 4 to 7 January, Li Lanqing, accompanied by Secretary Li Zemin of the Zhejiang provincial party committee and Governor Wan Xueyuan, inspected Zhejiang to find out about its grain and edible oil prices, market supply, education reform, and fight against smuggling. During his stay in Zhejiang, Li Lanqing made a special point of hearing the work report of Zhejiang's provincial party committee and government. He pointed out: Zhejiang's general situation is very good. The province has made notable progress in its work in all areas. Achievements in its economic relations and trade with foreign countries are particularly impressive, with a growth rate among the highest in the nation. It is very hopeful that the goal of achieving a level of comfortable living may be attained ahead of schedule. After an in-depth investigation, study, and tour of Hangzhou, Shaoxing, and Ningbo cities, Li Lanqing said: With the promulgation of new measures for comprehensive reform, we must pay particular attention to inflation. The key here is to control price changes within a range tolerable to the broad masses. There has been quite a large fluctuation in the price of grain, edible oil, and vegetable. The State Council has adopted a number of measures to cope with it. Localities should also sacrifice some of their immediate, partial interests and adopt macroeconomic regulation and control to bring to a reasonable level the prices of commodities closely related to the daily life of the masses, thereby creating a stable social environment for reform. Li Lanqing said: In the course of developing the economy, we must not blindly build development zones. In building approved development zones, we must pay attention to integrating them with the renovation of old cities and enterprises. In building small towns in rural areas, we must coordinate their planning with the development of a type of farming that provides high yields of fine quality with maximum efficiency, and with the second take-off of our rural work. We must guard against decrease in agricultural output and safeguard the development of "vegetable basket project." As long as we have abundant agricultural produce and sideline products, we will not be thrown into panic, and things will be easier to handle. During his inspection, Li Lanqing visited Hangzhou's Moganshan Vocational High School, Xuejun Middle School, Hangzhou University, and Zhejiang University, as well as held a discussion meeting on educational reform with responsible persons of 22 institutes of higher learning. Li Lanqing asked leading cadres at all levels to truly enhance their understanding on "respecting teachers and attaching importance to education." He said: Educational work was discussed rather comprehensively and thoroughly in 27 chapters in Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping. We should earnestly study, understand, and practice the teaching. The saying "education is fundamental for a program of lasting importance" should not be taken as merely an empty slogan, but should be used for mobilizing the entire party, society, and people to show concern, support, and participation in educational undertakings. Li Lanqing expressed his appreciation to Zhejiang provincial party committee for its decision "not to delay payment of teachers' salaries and not to issue IOU's to farmers." Li Lanqing pointed out: Further upgrading teaching quality and school efficiency are the two key issues in current reform for higher education. Speaking on the placement of institutes of higher learning on the "211" project, he stressed: It is not necessary to rush into making an evaluation as this is a development process. Apart from standards stipulated by the State Education Commission, institutes of higher learning should meet the following three criteria: First, institutes of higher learning of any province (city) that has not implemented basic education efficiently or not even paid teachers' salaries cannot be placed on the "211" project. Second, institutes of higher learning that have not undertaken major reform measures cannot be placed on the "211" project. Third, institutes of higher education should be encouraged to supplement one another with their strengths and jointly establish the "211" project. While holding a discussion meeting in Ningbo, Li Lanqing spoke predominantly on vocational education. He said: While implementing educational reform, we should ask the people not to merely seek a higher college entrance rate and advise students not to confine themselves anymore to the difficult path of seeking entrance to colleges. We shoud advise them to embark on vocational education, a "broad and sunny avenue" which will provide them with equal opportunities to become qualified personnel and contribute to society. He expressed the hope that, through the development of vocational education, Ningbo City would actively explore a new avenue for training qualified personnel urgently needed in economic development and reform and opening up. He was pleased at Ningbo City's efforts in implementing the "Teachers' Law" and active research in measures for solving teachers' housing problem. He encouraged the city to make a resolution on accomplishing its tasks effectively. On the issue of compulsory education in rural areas, Li Lanqing stressed the need to work out a comprehensive program to incorporate agricultural science and technology into the nine-year compulsory education so as to train a new generation of peasants who are better educated than their parents. During his inspection of Zhejiang, Li Lanqing also called on customs office employees in Hangzhou. He told them: The Zhejiang provincial party committee and government have paid keen attention to, and followed a correct ideological line in understanding antismuggling work. From now on we should strengthen ideological education on the need to crack down on smuggling among the grass-roots cadres. We should tackle smuggling in the light of fighting corruption and promoting clean government, and should teach grass-roots cadres to develop local economy and achieve prosperity through earnest operation, not by engaging in smuggling. Li Lanqing said: We have already checked the spread of the evil wave of smuggling, and the country as a whole is relatively quiet. However, we should never lower our guard. Antismuggling is a protracted task. It is necessary to persistently and relentlessly crack down on smuggling activities once they are discovered. Meanwhile, we should strive to achieve periodic results in fighting smuggling in various fields: 1) we should raise the awareness of antismuggling among leaders and ordinary people alike; 2) we should resolutely curb smuggling and trading of smuggled goods; 3) we should step up efforts to investigate and punish major and serious cases; and 4) all departments concerned should coordinate with each other to improve comprehensive management. Efforts should be made to resolutely implement the principle of "on-the-spot arrests, coastal blockade, road checks, market supervision, and severe punishment" in dealing with smuggling activities and smugglers. In conclusion, Li Lanqing said: As the reform has entered a crucial stage in all fields, all localities should study issues related to the change of operational guidelines and mechanisms of commercial circulation and foreign trade enterprises. State-owned commercial departments should develop a commercial chain system comprising both enterprise groups and wholesale and retail businesses. It is necessary to actively experiment with the modern enterprise system among foreign trade enterprises in a bid to strengthen their cohesive power, intiate perfect incentive and supervisory systems, prevent the drain of talented people, ensure more foreign exchange earning, and increase economic efficiency, thereby enabling the foreign trade industry to keep abreast of the development of a socialist market economy as quickly as possible.
