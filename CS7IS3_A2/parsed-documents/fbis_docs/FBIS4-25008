[sentence as published] This is for the first time for the transfer of stake in public utilities in China. [sentence as published] The letters of intent mainly stated that a business group would like to buy some public utilities in the municipality including the People's Bridge, the Haizhu Bridge, the Haiyin Bridge, the Guangzhou Bridge, the Pearl River Tunnel and 60 percent of stake in three water plants. The two sides would set up a cooperative company to run the four bridges, the tunnel and the three water plants. The foreign investor accounts for 60 percent of stake in the cooperative company and the Chinese side makes up the rest 40 percent. The term is set for 30 years and the management would return to the municipality on expiry of the agreement. Economic return that the foreign investor would receive is put at 17.5 percent from the municipal facilities and 17 percent from the water plants. The cooperative company is considered a franchised entity and the charging rate for bridge and tunnel toll as well as for water rate is under the control of the municipal government. The foreign partner of the cooperative company will offer capital in accordance with its stake in the company to fund construction of three new bridges and a water plant. The opening of municipal facilities to foreign businessmen for management is regarded as a breakthrough to raise capital. Such practice would help alleviate long-term shortages of capital for urban construction. Some persons are, however, convinced that inflation would be brought about because the basic expense for daily living has to increase as a result of commercialization of the public utilities. A formal agreement on these items will be signed this month.
