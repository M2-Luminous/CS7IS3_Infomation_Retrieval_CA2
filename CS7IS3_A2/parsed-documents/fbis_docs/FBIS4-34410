It staged other attacks last night against the Banco Continental and Banco de la Nacion. The attacks caused damage, but no victims. During the attack on the Wiese Bank the terrorists turned away retirees, who were standing in line to cash their paychecks before the bank opened. Terrorists yesterday staged an attack with explosives against the City Hall and a Mormon church run by U.S. priests in the city of Huancayo, 415 km southeast of Lima, in the central mountain range of Peru. The terrorist attack did not cause any casualties, but did cause considerable damage, according to National Police sources in Huancayo. With its acts of violence, the Shining Path organization is today commemorating the killing of 250 Shining Path members charged with terrorism on 18 and 19 June 1986, during the administration of Alan Garcia, who remains in asylum in Colombia. The killings occurred in three prisons in Lima and the port city of Callao after Shining Path inmates staged prison riots that were quelled. That date is recalled by the Shining Path as the "day of heroism." Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori announced yesterday that important Shining Path leaders had been arrested. Among those arrested is Moises Simon Limaco Huayascachi, alias "Ramiro," alleged number two man in the Shining Path faction headed today by Oscar Ramirez Durand, alias "Feliciano." Also arrested were terrorists Mario Vazquez Rojas, alias "Roberto," and Walter Tupac Yupanqui Asuquilca. Vazquez Rojas led the Shining Path's "People's Aid," which plans and executes crimes and attacks by the band, after replacing Martha Huatay, who was sentenced to life in prison.
