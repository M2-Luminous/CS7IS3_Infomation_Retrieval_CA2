A decision signed by the prime minister approving the State Program of Demonopolization of the Economy and the Development of Competition on Russia's Markets was put on the official distribution list yesterday. The program had been formally approved back on 9 December last year. A significant part here had been played by the president of Russia, who in November had signed an edict strengthening the organizational base of the Antimonoply Committee. And the cabinet, which has in fact complied with the edict, has once again demonstrated that it is not independent in the formation of its economic policy. The main direction of the new program is the creation of a new antimonopoly legal base. Last week Leonid Bochin, chairman of the committee, declared that some of the provisions of the Competition and the Limitation of Activity on the Commodity Markets Act were today out of date. The first prescriptive enactment that will be presented by the Antimonopoly Committee for consideration by the government within the framework of the program will be the Natural Monopolies bill. Specialists are drawing up the legal base for a broadening of the committee's sphere of competence--regulation of the activity of the banks and control of the securities market could be transferred to its jurisdiction. In addition, the committee is currently drawing up documents that are not formally within its jurisdiction: a bill on advertising (which regulates the sanctions on organizations conducting increased-risk transactions with the citizens' deposits) and on commodity exchanges. In Leonid Bochin's opinion, granting them privileges is impermissible since the exchanges have not justified the commitments they assumed and, "with the departure of the superprofits," have virtually disbanded of their own accord. It is becoming obvious that the committee, which affords no reason for it to be suspected of lobbying activity, will be used by the government as a lightning rod when projects evoking the harshest criticism are being pushed through. Coordination of the actions of the ministries and departments in realization of this program has been entrusted to the Interdepartmental Commission for Competition Policy, which is headed by First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets. The nature of the work of the first deputy prime minister is reason to suppose that the range of projects proposed by the committee and accepted for execution will be extremely limited. The touchstone, according to the information of KOMMERSANT, will be discussion of the actions of the Russian oil companies, which, in Leonid Bochin's opinion, "have shared out the domestic market and eliminated competitive struggle." The committee is proposing that the government examine this question from the standpoint of legislation. It is possible that the realization of the provisions of this program will breathe new life into the competition of Russia's manufacturers, which is fading before our eyes. But even a cursory analysis of the program leads to the conclusion concerning its exclusively abstract nature. Yet the deep roots of Russian monopolism require not so much narrow-departmental antitrust programs as a reform of the entire structure of the Russian economy and also the operational actions of the appropriate power departments. Without this, Russian business will not sense an improvement in its environment, and the competitive space, in whose formation it has an interest, will not be created.
