FR940725-0-00156 FR940725-0-00019 In paragraph (a) of the final rule, OSHA describes the spaces to which this section applies. The old standard referred to those spaces in §1915.12(a)(1) (i) and (ii) and (b)(1) (i) through (iii). The Agency proposed minor editorial changes, the most important of which involved listing the spaces that must be tested, and ventilated if necessary, before cleaning and cold work is begun. OSHA believes that specifying the spaces that will be affected by §1915.13 in the first paragraph will enable the employer to easily determine the scope of the section. This listing, which replaces the reference to locations, is an editorial revision of the previous requirements. Paragraph (b)(1) provides that liquid residues in the tanks shall be removed as thoroughly as practicable before manual cleaning starts. As in the previous standard, special care is required to be taken to prevent the spilling or the draining of these materials into the water surrounding the vessel. For consistency with the expanded scope, OSHA has added the requirement to take special care to prevent spills onto the surrounding work area. If liquid residues were allowed to contaminate the surrounding water or worksite, employees would be endangered. Paragraph (b)(2) requires that tests to determine the concentration of flammable, combustible, toxic, corrosive, or irritant vapors must be done by a competent person prior to starting cold work. This provision has been brought forward from previous §1915.13(a)(3), which required tests to maintain flammable vapors below 10 percent of the LEL. OSHA believes that simply requiring tests does not give the employer enough guidance about what tests are necessary to protect workers during cleaning and other cold work. Therefore, OSHA is specifying that tests be done for flammable, combustible, toxic, corrosive, or irritant vapors. Paragraph (b)(3)(i) of the final rule requires that when the concentration of flammable or combustible vapors is equal to or greater than 10 percent of the LEL, ventilation must be provided at flow rates sufficient to keep the concentration of flammable vapors at a level less than 10 percent of the LEL. Toxic, corrosive, or irritant vapors are required to be maintained within the permissible exposure limits and below IDLH levels by paragraph (b)(3)(ii). The previous rule at §1915.13(a)(2) and the proposed rule at §1915.13(a)(8) (53 FR 48108) allowed employers to ventilate only major portions of a compartment when, due to the high volatility of residues, concentration of flammable or combustible vapors of less than 10 percent LEL could not be achieved. In these circumstances, employers had to continually monitor the major portion of the space as pockets of hazardous vapor could shift into the work area thereby putting workers at risk. OSHA does not believe such an approach to the monitoring provides adequate protection for employees. The Agency believes that a compartment in which any portion is above 10 percent of the LEL is unsafe. In addition, conditions at or above 10 percent of the LEL could result in air concentrations which exceed the OSHA PEL or IDLH. This was clearly illustrated by Marine Chemists, Inc. (Ex. 7&hyph;24FF): Many flammable products are also toxic or contain toxic ingredients and in many cases 10 percent of LEL is well above the recommended PEL and in some cases may exceed the IDLH, for example: STYRENE The LEL is 1% Styrene=10,000 ppm, 10% LEL=0.1% Styrene=1,000 ppm, PEL for Styrene=100 ppm In other words 10 percent for Styrene is 10 times the recommended PEL. Ventilating only portions of a compartment can mean that pockets of hazardous atmospheres containing a variety of unknown levels of flammable vapors can remain within a compartment providing a significant potential for fire or explosion. Ignition could occur through scraping or blasting. For example, the National Fire Protection Association (Ex. 6&hyph;10) noted that ignition may occur from static electricity. NFPA does not believe that work in IDLH atmospheres should be encouraged, except for the purposes of emergency rescue. NFPA does not support the proposal of working in UEL atmospheres. The potential hazards associated with ignition sources, such as static electricity, and the introduction of air to bring an atmosphere above the UEL within the flammable range, are significant and difficult to control. The additional testing requirements would also be significant. This concern was also expressed by Independent Testing and Consultation, Inc. (Ex. 6&hyph;24). All ignition sources cannot easily be eliminated. There remains possible ignition due to static electricity. It has been my experience that owners and operators would rather clean or otherwise make safe a tank or compartment even if the work required in the compartment is of the briefest duration. The Department of the Navy (Ex. 6&hyph;31) stated that the possibility of an explosion could still be present when only the major portions of a compartment are required to be ventilated. They noted that ventilation should be used to alleviate a hazardous atmosphere and that continuous monitoring alone will not prevent the possibility of an explosion. One commenter, Sound Testing, Inc. (Ex. 6&hyph;8), questioned OSHA's acceptance of the 10 percent LEL level. It distresses me that even today we are still using the 10% LEL in helping to determine whether a space is ``Safe for Workers''. I have written about 10,000 Marine Chemist certificates, involving tens of thousands of compartments and I cannot recall a single instance where I wrote ``Safe for Workers'' about a tank reading even 2% LEL. Why, then, is OSHA giving a ``reference point'' significance to 10% LEL as ``Safe for Workers'' criterion? OSHA agrees with NFPA, Independent Testing and Consultation, Inc. and the Navy and is therefore, persuaded that an entire compartment must be ventilated sufficiently to bring the level of flammable and combustible materials below 10 percent of the LEL. Because the ventilation to maintain conditions in the major portion of a compartment would already be in place, increasing or redirecting the ventilation so that it now adequately ventilates the entire compartment would put little or no additional burden on employers.
