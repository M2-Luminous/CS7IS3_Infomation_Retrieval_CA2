The turnaround in technology transfers, which had declined since 1989, reflects the business recovery in Korea, according to the "Annual Report on Technology Introduction" issued recently by the Korea Industrial Technology Association. The annual report analyzed last year's technology introduction, finding that the electric and electronic sector led the way with 238 cases (33.6 percent), followed by 206 cases for the machinery area (29.1) and 91 cases for the chemical field (12.8). In terms of royalties paid for technology transfers, the electric and electronic sector came first with 54.2 percent, trailed by the mechanical and chemical fields with 22.8 percent and 12.55 percent, respectively. The most conspicuous rise occurred in the construction sector with 28 cases worth 14.46 million dollars compared with three cases totaling 7.35 million dollars in the previous year. By country, Japan ranked first with 285 cases (40.3 percent), followed by the United States (31.6 percent), Britain (5.15 percent) and Germany (4.3 percent). The report said Korea's reliance on American and Japanese technology declined as Japan, in particular, is avoiding transfer of its advanced technology. However, technology imports from former communist countries such as Russia rose to 17 cases from five in the previous year, indicating that technical cooperation with these states is becoming more active.
