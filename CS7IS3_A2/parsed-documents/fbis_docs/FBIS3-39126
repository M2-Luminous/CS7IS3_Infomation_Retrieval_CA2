Around 15 fishing boats blocked access to the ports of Marseille, Fos sur Mer, Port Saint Louis du Rhone, and Port de Bouc at 0700 (0600 GMT). More boats were set to join the blockade during the day. The fishermen, who have been on strike since Friday, have called for a meeting with the right wing president of the regional council, Jean-Claude Gaudin, to discuss their demands for guaranteed fish prices and an end to foreign imports. The blockade was mounted without violence, and without much early effect on traffic, authorities said. In a separate action early Monday, 100 Breton fishermen intercepted two refrigerated trucks on the Paris-Lille motorway, dumping several hundred kilograms of fish and goods they believed to be cheap imports, sources said. The fishermen, who had traveled in 30 cars from their northwestern Finistere department, staged the two-hour protest action at the toll post at Chamant. They urged passing motorists to go through without paying tolls. Police deployed nearby did not intervene and there were no incidents. The fishermen initially sought to head for the huge Rungis wholesale market south of here -- where some 100 riot policemen have been deployed -- but then drove north. Around 30 fishermen occupied a toll post at Saint Arnoult en Yvelines, south of Paris, for three hours after emptying the fish cargo of two Spanish lorries, separate sources said. The occupation, in which motorists were waved through the poll without paying, ended at 0700 (0600 GMT). The fishermen were reinforced by a 50-strong coach party of fishermen who burned the salmon and cod cargo of two Spanish lorries after intercepting them at a service station on the A10 motorway. All 80 fishermen headed for Brittany, sources added. In Dreux west of Paris, police also intercepted a busload of 50 fishermen carrying clubs, pickaxes and flares. Thursday, French fishermen massively voted to continue a 10-day strike, rejecting their union's call to return to work and an aid package negotiated by their leaders with the government on Tuesday. The negotiations followed violence the previous week culminating in a daylong pitched battle in the Brittany capital of Rennes where a fishermen's delegation negotiated with Prime Minister Edouard Balladur. Seventy-seven people were injured. At France's request, the European Commission fixed minimum prices until March 15 for seven species of fish.
