My brothers, I must thank you for allowing my to come here to pray together. Allah willing, we will soon pray in Jerusalem, the first site (chronologically speaking) of Islam. My brothers, it must be understood that after the Gulf war the main conspiracy was to completely eliminate the Palestinian problem from the international agenda. It was not easy, because our men paid the price of the Gulf war, as you know. Our community in Kuwait, which was one of the largest and richest, was kicked out of Kuwait. Not only that, but later we were presented with the Bush initiative on the Madrid conference. And, it was not easy to agree to go to the Madrid conference, because of its very difficult conditions. Why? So as not to give them a reason and an excuse to ignore the question of Jerusalem and the question of Palestine. This must be understood. Now, after this agreement, which is the first step and nothing more than that, believe me -- a lot remains to be done. The jihad will continue. Jerusalem is not only of the Palestinian people, but of the entire Islamic nation. You are responsible for Palestine and for Jerusalem. "The land that was promised to God's fearful." ('Arafat quotes a Koran verse in which Allah addresses Abraham on this issue.) After this agreement you must understand that our main battle is not to get the maximum out of them here and there. The main battle is over Jerusalem, the third most sacred site of the Muslims. Everybody must understand it. Therefore, I insisted before signing (on the Gaza and Jericho agreement in Cairo) to get a letter from the Israelis that Jerusalem is one of the items for discussion in the negotiations. We are not talking about (a discussion of) Israel's permanent status. No. We are talking about the permanent status of Palestine. It is very important that everybody understand it. In this letter, which they wrote and I have in my possession although I have not divulged it so far, I insisted that they mention that we are responsible for all the holy sites, Christian and Muslim. I insisted that the name of the Christian holy site be mentioned before the name of the Muslim holy site, because I must be faithful to the agreement between Caliph 'Umar Ibn-al-Khattab and Patriarch Sophronius. Therefore, I insisted that they mention in the letter the Christian holy places next to the Muslim holy places. Here we are, and I must speak candidly. I cannot do it on my own, without the help of the Islamic nation. And I cannot say like the Jews: You and your god fight alone. No. You must come to fight, to begin the jihad to liberate Jerusalem, your first shrine. It is very important. Therefore, me and my colleagues insisted on mentioning in the agreement that the negotiations about Jerusalem will start no later than the beginning of the third year, and that immediately after the signing of the agreement we will start the negotiations about Jerusalem. About the future of Jerusalem. You saw me when I hesitated (in the signing ceremony in Cairo). I did it because I insisted on mentioning Jerusalem. I did not want this promise from Rabin, but from the two cosponsors of the process, Christopher and Kozyrev, and the witness, President Mubarak. And this was done. Everybody must understand that there is a constant conspiracy against Jerusalem. As mentioned, in the next three years, (negotiations) will start no later than the beginning of the third year. They (the Israelis) will try to wipe out and change the demography of Jerusalem. This is very important. We must be very careful and give it priority, because there is no higher priority than Jerusalem. We must give it top priority, not just as Palestinians and not just as Arabs, but also as Muslims and as Christians. I mentioned it before to the Archbishop of Canterbury. I told them that if they want the Holy Sepulcher and the Christian holy sites they must not only talk to the Israelis but also to the Jews. We are not against the Jews. We must remember what the Koran says: "Within the people of (the prophet) Moses there is a nation (a group) that believes in justice and lives by it." For your information, there are two Jewish sects in Palestine: The Samaritans in Nabulus and the Neturey Karta in Jerusalem. They refuse to recognize the State of Israel and regard themselves as Palestinians. I am saying this to prove that their statements that Jerusalem is their capital are wrong. It is not their capital. It is our capital and yours. It is the first most sacred site of Islam ('Arafat is referring to the first sacred place to which the Muslims turned in their prayers; later the direction of their prayers was changed to Mecca). But, we need your support. This is the message of the people in Palestine and our population in Jerusalem. They are calling on you and on everybody everywhere. I am sure that sooner or later we will pray in Jerusalem, together. I regard this agreement as no more than the agreement signed between our prophet Muhammad and the Quiraish (tribe) in Mecca ('Arafat is referring to the Treaty of Hudaibiya in the year 628 in which Muhammad promised peace for 10 years, but violated it two years later when he conquered Mecca which had been ruled by the Quiraish). We must remember that Caliph 'Umar refused to accept this agreement and considered it "an inferior peace agreement." However, the prophet Muhammad accepted it, and we now accept the peace agreement, but (this) in order to continue on the way to Jerusalem. Together and not alone. We must say clearly that circumstances are very, very critical. I will give you one example. Do you remember what happened after the massacre in Hebron? For 22 days the UN Security Council hesitated to pass a resolution condemning this massacre. Do you remember? Twenty-two days because of one word I insisted on including in this resolution; (namely, adding to the term) "the occupied territories" (the words) "including Jerusalem." They tried to argue with me to omit Jerusalem, but I refused and got my way. Once again, I must thank you from the bottom of my heart and I am speaking to you with sincerity, from one brother to another. We need you as Muslims and as mujahidin (jihad warriors). It is a pleasure for me to thank my old friend and elder brother, Nelson Mandela, for inviting me to visit South Africa for the first time. My presence here is part of your struggle. I am telling him on your behalf and on behalf of the Islamic nation that we will be by his side, and we are sure he will continue to be by our side. Once again, I must say "they will enter the mosque as they entered it before" ('Arafat is quoting a Koran verse). Until victory, until Jerusalem, until Jerusalem, until Jerusalem.
