[Education Minister Rosa Russo] Iervolino, [DC Chamber of Deputies spokesman Gerardo] Bianco, and [DC Deputy Gabriele] De Rosa were alongside [DC Secretary Mino] Martinazzoli. Among those invited were Giovanni Spadolini and Giorgio Napolitano, the speakers of the two chambers of parliament, as well as members of the old DC, including Amintore Fanfani, Paolo Emilio Taviani, Emilio Colombo and Ciriaco De Mita. Shortly before, Martinazzoli had alluded to the absence of the centrist faction. He said the Italian Popular Party was being born "without some friends who, for reasons I am not politically able to decipher, have decided not to participate in this undertaking. This makes me bitter, but this defection can in no way convince me to give up ideas I believe to be right even as far as the outlook is concerned."
