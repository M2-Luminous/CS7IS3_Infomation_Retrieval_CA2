The defendants guilt was established. The court sentenced Aydin Gassimov as an organizer and Abil Babayev as an accomplice to 12 years imprisonment. However they did not plead guilty. A student from Turkey Hassan Toku, whom conspirators planned to be the assassin, was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment. The court, giving this judgment, took into consideration his honest confession and the fact that he had been a help with investigation. Cases of the other two defendants--Nariman Mamedov and Ali Askerov--were sent to additional inquiry because of inadequate evidence. Additional inquiry is also necessary because the two accomplices of the conspiracy aimed at attempt on president's life went into hiding.
