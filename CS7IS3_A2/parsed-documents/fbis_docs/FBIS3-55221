In comparison with the Russian Ministry of Security, abolished in December, the number of personnel is being cut by 46 percent. Sergey Stepashin, first deputy head of the Federal Counterintelligence Service, reported this in an interview to INTERFAX. According to him, the new service will not have investigation and detention centers. It will not be fighting corruption, which is not characteristic of its functions. Such functions were formerly carried out by Ministry of Interior organs. The Lefortovo detention center where organizers of the 3-4 October events in Moscow are now being held is being transferred to the Ministry of Internal Affairs. All these changes were approved in the course of today's meeting in Moscow between the leaders of the Federal Counterintelligence Service and President Boris Yeltsin.
