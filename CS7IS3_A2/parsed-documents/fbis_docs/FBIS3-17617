Following the official part of the address, Mr. Meshkov added: "Using this opportunity I would like to express my view on the 27 March poll as that of a citizen. Who will I vote in the election to the Supreme Council of the Republic of Crimea? I will vote for candidates of the Rossiya bloc. How will I reply to the ballot questions in the poll of Republic of Crimea citizens on 27 March? To the first question, "Are you in favor of restoring the constitution of the Republic of Crimea of 26 May 1992 which determines relations between the Republic of Crimea and Ukraine on the basis of treaties and agreements?," I will say "yes". To the second question, "Are you in favor of restoring the Republic of Crimea constitution of 26 March 1992 which proclaims the right of the Republic of Crimea to dual citizenship?," I will say "yes". I will cross out the word "no." To the third question, "Are you in favor of granting decrees by the president of the Republic of Crimea the force of law on issues of temporarily unregulated legislation?," I, as a citizen of the Republic of Crimea, will say "yes" and will cross out "no." I will take away the ballot paper containing the names, first names and patronymics of candidates for the Supreme Council of Ukraine. I hope that 27 March will come up to the expectations we have for this day."
