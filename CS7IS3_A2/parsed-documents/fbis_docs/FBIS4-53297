Timor Issue Continues Manila Urged To Cancel Talks BK1805104894 Jakarta Radio Republik Indonesia Network in Indonesian 0600 GMT 18 May 94 BK1805104894 Jakarta Radio Republik Indonesia Network Indonesian BFN [From the press review] [Text] KOMPAS writes that Indonesia has in fact grounds to voice its objection to the Philippines over an Asia-Pacific conference on East Timor scheduled to be held at a university in Manila on 31 May. The Indonesian Government, which learned of the planned conference last October, subsequently voiced its objection. The objection was repeated in November 1993 and March 1994. According to Foreign Minister Ali Alatas, the objection stems from the fact that the conference organizers as well as the invitees, including Ramos Horta [a leader of the Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor or Fretilin] and his friends have a political goal, that is to mobilize public opinion to question the incorporation of East Timor into the Republic of Indonesia. Despite our doubts over their possible success in changing the current status of East Timor, the conference could in any way affect the efforts of Indonesia, the United Nations, and Portugal to settle comprehensively the East Timor issue. Accordingly, the Philippine Government should immediately move to cancel the planned conference because there could be a thunderbolt in the broad daylight in Indonesian-Philippine relations if the conference is held. Meanwhile, the daily ANGKATAN BERSENJATA says that the conference can be categorized as a forum of discussions on human rights rather than an academic one by whatever standards. Based on pamphlets circulated by the conference organizers, the delegates will discuss ways of achieving the independence of East Timor -- a political goal. Accordingly, the Indonesian Government and people hope that Philippine President Fidel Ramos will change his stand over the extremely sensitive issue that may undermine Indonesian-Philippine relations. SUARA KARYA stresses that Indonesia understands the dilemma faced by the Philippines. For the sake of close bilateral relations, the Philippine Government, however, may in any way prevent Philippine territory from being used as a base by Fretilin and its supporters to launch anti-Indonesian campaigns. As a comparison, the Indonesian Government will, for example, never allow Indonesian territory to be used as a base by the Moros [Moro National Liberation Front] to conduct anti-Philippine activities. The daily believes that as a preliminary step, the Philippine Government may deny entry to Fretilin leaders who want to attend the conference.
