FR941117-0-00158 FR941117-0-00011 §22.929 Application requirements for the Cellular Radiotelephone Service. In addition to information required by subparts B and D of this part, applications for authorization in the Cellular Radiotelephone Service must contain the applicable supplementary information described in this section. Initial applications for new cellular systems must also comply with §22.953. (a) Administrative information. The following information is required either by FCC Form 401, Schedule C, or as an exhibit. (1) The number of transmitter sites for which authorization is requested; (2) The call sign(s) of other facilities in the same area that are ultimately controlled by the real party in interest to the application; (3) If the application involves a service area boundary (SAB) extension (see §22.912), a statement as to whether the five year build-out period for the system on the relevant channel block in the market into which the SAB extends has elapsed, and whether the SAB extends into any unserved area in that market. (b) Technical information. The following information is required by FCC Form 401, Schedule C. (1) Location description; city; county; state; geographical coordinates correct to # 1 second, the datum used (NAD 27 and NAD 83), site elevation above mean sea level, proximity to adjacent market boundaries and international borders; (2) Antenna manufacturer, model number and type, antenna height to tip above ground level, the height of the center of radiation of the antenna above the average terrain, the height of the antenna center of radiation above the average elevation of the terrain along each of the 8 cardinal radials, antenna gain in the maximum lobe, the beamwidth of the maximum lobe of the antenna, a polar plot of the horizontal gain pattern of the antenna, the electric field polarization of the wave emitted by the antenna when installed as proposed; (3) The channel block requested, the maximum effective radiated power, the effective radiated power in each of the cardinal radial directions. (c) Maps. If the application proposes a change in the CGSA, it must include full size and reduced maps, and supporting engineering, as described in §22.953(a)(5)(i) through (iii). §22.933 Cellular system compatibility specification. Except as provided in §22.901(d), equipment used in the Cellular Radiotelephone Service must be designed in compliance with the technical specifications for compatibility of mobile and base stations in the Cellular Radiotelephone Service contained in ``Cellular System Mobile Station-Land Station Compatibility Specification'' (April 1981 Ed.), Office of Engineering and Technology Bulletin No. 53. This bulletin is contained in Appendix D to the Report and Order in CC Docket No. 79&hyph;318, and was published in the Federal Register of May 21, 1981. Copies may be obtained from the FCC's copying contractor. Special operational features that have been developed by joint industry consensus through the Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) and established as a TIA standard may be activated at the option of the cellular licensee, provided that the compatibility of equipment within the Cellular Radiotelephone Service as specified in OET Bulletin No. 53 is not adversely affected. §22.935 Procedures for comparative renewal proceedings. The procedures in this section apply to comparative renewal proceedings in the Cellular Radiotelephone Service. (a) If one or more applications competing with an application for renewal of a cellular authorization are filed, the renewal applicant must file with the FCC an original and four copies of its renewal expectancy showing. This filing must be submitted no later than 60 days after the date of the Public Notice listing as acceptable for filing the renewal application and the competing applications. (b) Interested parties may file petitions to deny any of the mutually exclusive applications. Any such petitions to deny must be filed no later than 30 days after the date that the renewal applicant submitted its renewal expectancy showing. Applicants may file replies to any petitions to deny applications that are filed. Any such replies must be filed no later than 15 days after the date that the petition(s) to deny was filed. No further pleadings will be accepted. (c) In most instances, the renewal application and any competing applications will be designated for a two-step procedure. An Administrative Law Judge (Presiding Judge) will conduct a threshold hearing (step one), in which both the licensee and the competing applicants will be parties, to determine whether the renewal applicant deserves a renewal expectancy. If the order designating the applications for hearing specifies any basic qualifying issues against the licensee, those issues will be tried in this threshold hearing. If the Presiding Judge determines that the renewal applicant is basically qualified and due a renewal expectancy, the competing applicants will be found ineligible for further consideration and their applications will be denied. If the Presiding Judge determines that the renewal applicant does not merit a renewal expectancy but is otherwise qualified, then all of the applications will be considered in a comparative hearing (step two). (d) Any competing applicant may request a waiver of the threshold hearing (step one), if such applicant demonstrates that its proposal so far exceeds the service already being provided that there would be no purpose in making a threshold determination as to whether the renewal applicant deserved a renewal expectancy vis-a-vis such a competing applicant. Any such waiver request must be filed at the time the requestor's application is filed. Petitions opposing such waiver requests may be filed. Any such petitions must be filed no later than 30 days after the date that the renewal applicant submitted its renewal expectancy showing. Replies to any petitions opposing such waiver requests may be filed. Any such replies must be filed no later than 15 days after the date that the petition(s) were filed. No further pleadings will be accepted. Any waiver request submitted pursuant to this paragraph will be acted upon prior to designating the applications for hearing. If a request to waive the threshold hearing (step one) is granted, the renewal expectancy issue will be designated as part of the comparative hearing (step two), and will remain the most important comparative factor in deciding the case, as provided in §22.940(a). (e) If the Presiding Judge issues a ruling in the threshold (step one) that denies the licensee a renewal expectancy, all of the applicants involved in the proceeding will be allowed to file direct cases no later than 90 days after the release date of the Presiding Judge's ruling. Rebuttal cases must be filed no later than 30 days after the date that the direct cases were filed. (f) The Presiding Judge shall use the expedited hearing procedures delineated in this paragraph in both threshold (step one) and comparative (step two) hearings conducted in comparative cellular renewal proceedings. (1) The Presiding Judge will schedule a first hearing session as soon as practicable after the date for filing rebuttal evidence. This first session will be an evidentiary admission session at which each applicant will identify and offer its previously circulated direct and rebuttal exhibits, and each party will have an opportunity to lodge objections. (2) After accepting the exhibits into evidence, the Presiding Judge will entertain motions to cross-examine and rule whether any sponsoring witness needs to be produced for cross-examination.
