[Central Committee], the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] and premier of the Administration Council, made a report "on the great victory of the socialist rural theses and future tasks" at the national agricultural conference which opened here today with a large attendance. The reporter said that the publication of "Theses on the Socialist Rural Question in Our Country" authored by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song 30 years ago was an event of historical significance in achieving the victory of the chuche cause of socialism and the eternal prosperity of the country and the people. In the period, he noted, our party and people have made big strides along the road shown by the theses, bringing about phenomenal changes in all spheres of socialist rural construction. He quoted the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song as saying: "In the `Theses on the Socialist Rural Question in Our Country' our party illuminated the basic principles and ways for finding the final solution to the peasant and agricultural questions after the establishment of the socialist system, and roused the whole party, the whole country and the entire people to implement them." The rural theses are a great programme of socialist rural construction which was worked out on the basis of the man-centred chuche idea and a classical work which was the first in history to give correct answers to all theoretical and practical questions arising in the solution of the rural question and break a new ground in the development of the revolutionary idea of the working class. The rural theses of our party opened a broad road for revolutionizing the peasants and assimilating them to the working class, industrializing and modernizing agriculture to elevate the agricultural productive forces to a high degree and building the socialist countryside, affluent and civilized, where the agricultural working people will enjoy an independent and creative life to the full. According to the report, first of all, remoulding of man has been successfully pushed ahead in the countryside and the ideological and cultural life of the agricultural working people improved in all aspects through the vigorous efforts to carry the theses into practice. Ideological education for revolutionizing and working-classizing the peasantry was intensified in the course of fulfilling the task to give priority to the ideological revolution laid down in the rural theses, with the result that all our agricultural working people have been firmly armed with the socialist idea of chuche, the revolutionary idea of our party, and the chuche idea has become predominant in rural communities. The great changes in the ideological and moral traits and manner of work of our peasants are the most precious success achieved in our efforts to implement the theses, which is incomparable even to millions of tons of rice. As a result of the active cultural revolution along with the ideological revolution, our peasants have grown to be more powerful beings and their cultural living conditions have been fundamentally improved. Regular universities and colleges of agriculture and such study-while-working centres for training technical personnel as farm colleges have been firmly built up in each province, at which a large number of agro-technicians and experts are being trained. Under the popular policy of our party, tap water, bus, wire radio and television services have been introduced, clinics developed into hospitals and cosy modern dwelling houses built in the rural areas. Newspapers, magazines and various books find their way to each peasant household. Thus our countryside has turned into a prospering modern socialist countryside good to live and work in, which is little different from towns. With the successful fulfilment of the four major tasks of the rural technical revolution--irrigation, electrification, mechanization and an extensive chemical application--through the energetic efforts to implement the rural theses, solid material and technical foundations of socialism have been laid in the countryside and, on this basis, the peasants are satisfactorily provided with independent and creative living conditions. As a result of the completion of irrigation and electrification of agriculture on a high level, our country has a most advanced and powerful irrigation system under which rich and stable harvest is reaped in any weather, and the yearly electricity consumption in the rural areas has increased 8.6 times the 1963 figure. Over the past 30 years the number of the tractors and lorries engaged in agriculture has increased respectively six and five times, with the result that the comprehensive mechanization of agriculture in the country is reaching a high level where all categories of farm work ranging from ploughing to sowing, rice-transplanting, weeding, harvesting, thrashing and carriage are done with the help of machines. An extensive use of chemicals in farming has been realized to sharply increase the supply of chemical fertilizers. Now, in our country the amount of chemical fertilizers applied to each hectare of paddy and non-paddy fields has reached more than two tons, far surpassing the target set by the theses, and the quality of their properties has improved with the rational combination of various kinds of them. A great progress has been made in the transformation of social relations in the countryside in conformity with the requirements of socialism. Through the efforts to give full play to the advantages of the new agricultural guidance system, the major component of which is the county cooperative farm management committee, such a difficult and complex problem as guiding and managing the rural economy has been successfully solved on the principle of collectivism in conformity with the nature of socialism and industrial guidance and the state's material and technical assistance strengthened through the committee. As a result, the advanced industrial management and production culture have gained a wide scope in the rural communities and distinctions between industry and agriculture in industrial management and ownership of the means of production are diminishing fast. Over the past 30 years since the publication of the rural theses, grain production has jumped 1.9 times, of which rice 1.8 and maize 2.2. Our agriculture reaped an unusually rich harvest last year, the year before the 30th anniversary of the publication of the rural theses, by effecting a new upsurge, despite a long spell of frost and abnormal low temperature. The principle of the right crop on the right soil and in the right time and an intensive farming method based on tending each plant with care have been applied on a full scale and the demands of the chuche farming method for each stage and process of farming thoroughly met, with the result that we now gather in 8,9,10, and even 15 tons of rice and maize per hectare from fields which yielded two or three tons in the past. With the fast progress of ideological, technical and cultural revolutions in the countryside, the level of ideological consciousness of the peasants and their technical and cultural standards have been enhanced, the material and technical foundations of agriculture consolidated and the gaps between industry and agriculture and between towns and rural areas narrowed in all spheres, creating more satisfactory conditions for converting cooperative property into all-people property. The socialist rural economic system in our country is neither an invention of an alien nor an imitation of other's. It is a most independent and popular system of the rural economy which our people, notably the agricultural working people, have established for themselves to suit their faith and demand by applying the rural theses under the leadership of the party. And it is a most solid and viable system which is advancing confidently towards socialism on the basis of collectivism. The 30 years of efforts for building the socialist countryside and all the historical gains in this course, the reporter said, prove that "Theses on the Socialist Rural Question in Our Country" authored by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song shows the only correct guideline for clearing away the leftovers of old society in the rural areas after the establishment of the socialist system and finally solving the rural question, and that only under the wise leadership of the party and the leader is it possible to successfully accomplish the cause of the socialist rural construction without any deviation and turns and twists and well build an ideal socialist society of chuche desired by the entire people. We can say with pride and honor that we have created a model of socialist rural construction by successfully solving the peasant and agricultural questions, the difficult and intricate problems in building socialism, from an independent stand under the wise guidance of the party and the leader, he noted. Outlining tasks to give full play to the advantages of the socialist agricultural system of chuche, he said: We should, as in the past, so in the future, too, invariably advance along the road of continued revolution indicated by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song in the theses. He further said: We must continue to push ahead with the ideological revolution in the countryside so as to more closely unite all the agricultural working people behind the party and the leader, strengthen the singlehearted unity of our revolutionary ranks and rear all of them better to be ardent revolutionaries faithful to the cause of socialism. An important task in the ideological revolution at present is to ensure that all the agricultural working people have a firm faith and will for the victory of the cause of socialism and highly demonstrate the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and strenuous efforts. While consolidating the achievements in irrigation, electrification and mechanization of agriculture and an extensive use of chemicals in farming, we must increase the state investment in agriculture and further strengthen the material and technical foundations to bring another epochal change in agricultural production. And we should continuously push on the cultural revolution in the rural areas to raise the level of technical and cultural standard of the agricultural working people and build a more cultured countryside. The industrial guidance of agricultural production must be strengthened in conformity with the realistic demand of the developing rural economy, the leadership of all- people property over cooperative property constantly enhanced and measures taken for gradually converting the cooperative farms into farms of all-people ownership in order to establish the single ownership of the whole people in future. The internal and external situation of our revolution remains grim and complex and our people's struggle is difficult and arduous, but no imperialist reactionary force can bring into submission the Korean people who are advancing courageously with conviction of the validity of their cause or deprive our people and agricultural working people of their independent and creative life which they are enjoying in the most advantageous socialist society of chuche, the reporter concluded.
