Leetooraj Chandramun, president of the Mauritius Communist Party, said the Korean people have brought about great changes with the chuche idea and the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance. Visiting Korea again some 20 years past, he said he never imagined that such great changes as he saw today could take place there. "I was really surprised at the great reality beyond imagination, at the high-rise buildings standing in a row, magnificent grand monuments, modern factories and rural villages," he said. He stressed it is the unbreakable strength of the Korean people armed with the chuche idea and their revolutionary spirit of self- reliance that have enabled them to make such great achievements under the conditions of national division and in face of ever-more malevolent moves of the imperialists to isolate and stifle socialism. Genaro Ledesma Izquieta, chairman of the People's Front of Workers, Peasants and Students of Peru, after visiting the Three- Revolution Exhibition, said the Korean people are making everything needed by their own efforts on the basis of the independent national economy. P.C. Sharma, chairman of the International Study Centre for the Chuche-Oriented Mass Media in Nepal, had this to say: The revolutionary spirit of self-reliance is an indomitable faith of the Korean people hardened through a long-drawnout struggle. They manufactured lorries, tractors and machine tools by highly displaying the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance in the difficult postwar period when everything was destroyed. The West Sea Barrage, the May Day Stadium and other amazing world's level magnificent grand monumental edifices have been created by the Korean people themselves. It can be said that the Korean people's history of creation and construction is a history of self-reliance. The chairman of the February Revolutionary Party of Paraguay said that as they have an unshakable revolutionary spirit of believing in their own strength and living by their own efforts, the Korean people are vigorously advancing without the slightest vacillation in the present complicated international situation.
