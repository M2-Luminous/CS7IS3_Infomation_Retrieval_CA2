Armed conflicts, which have a destructive effect on international stability, social and ethnic upheavals, massive famine and pandemic diseases, terrorism and the narcotics business, are threats on a global scale and objectively cannot but affect the interests and security of other regions and states, Russia included. The contemporary world, and above all the industrially-developed countries, are faced with the growing realization that one can hardly isolate oneself from the problems of the African continent, which are already leading to an increase in the influx of emigrants from Africa to Europe and other regions: such as, the growth of Islamic extremism; and the spread of diseases, including AIDS. It is no coincidence that in this connection Prime Minister of France Balladour stated, that the interests of his country "are suffering greatly from African crises, whether it is a question of development of trade, reliable supply of raw materials, the dangers of uncontrolled emigration, or conflicts which threaten to upset the balance of power on the entire continent."[.sup]1[/] Obviously, for these same reasons, Russia too cannot wall herself off from Africa behind the palisades of her own difficulties. The moreso since, while acting judiciously and with knowledge of affairs; and while structuring relationships with the African states on a genuine, mutually advantageous basis, with equal rights, without the previous distortions in the ideological and military sphere--it is possible that cooperation with Africa, which is still a rich and independent region despite its severe crisis, can be put to use in overcoming our own specific problems. At the very same time, if we withdraw from Africa, we are then in essence acknowledging our inability to engage in positive, constructive cooperation, and we are confirming the opinion which is still heard from time to time, that our policy in Africa was founded merely on the negative values of the "cold war." The warm breeze of change, which is breaking up the ice of many years of confrontation in the world, is blowing over Africa as well. Many countries on this continent have set about making democratic transformations: elections have been held on a multi-party basis, fundamental rights of citizens have been proclaimed, and more attention is being devoted to human rights. The changes taking place in the world, and in African states as well, along with those transformations which are being carried out in Russia, force us to look anew at the development of Russo-African relations as well. A thorough "inventory" must be made of the experience of our over 30 years of ties, singling out all that is of value and useful, and decisively rejecting the approaches which were dictated by the market conditions and ideological considerations of the past. At the same time one can properly set the priorities in our relations with Africa, discover the most promising areas for cooperation, and determine the circle of reliable partners, only on the basis of precise analysis and forecasting of the economic and political development of African countries, taking into consideration those factors which have decisive influence on the formation of a political and economic climate both for the African continent as a whole, and for the individual countries.[passage omitted] I believe that it is also in the Russian interest, especially in the economic plane, not to lose sight of the potential of Africa as our partner, the more so since we have already established a firm foundation for cooperation in our relations with many African countries. For the most part, future Russo-African relations are seen precisely in all-round development of mutually-advantageous economic ties; however, it will hardly be possible to achieve this until military-political stability is assured on the African continent, and until the prerequisites are established for stable socio-economic development. Orienting herself on the prospects which lie in the plane of economic and trade relations, Russia, employing political means, will strive to support the processes of democratization in Africa, and will take part in settling existing conflicts and forestalling potential conflict. Within the framework of the given approach, we should obviously focus special attention on activating political ties with this continent. At the same time, it is necessary to pay attention to its specific nature, when quite often cooperation in all other sectors depend upon the level of political relations and with establishing contacts with the leadership of a country. We cannot shut our eyes to the fact that the ruling circles of many African states still take a cautious attitude toward the political processes and reforms in Russia, lack confidence in their successful outcome, and doubt that our country, at the present stage, is capable of playing a definitive role in the international arena. African leaders, as practical experience shows, apart from discussing questions of bilateral relations, are prepared for dialogue with us on a broad range of problems associated with strengthening international peace and security, and primarily among those who are either directly influencing the situation on their continent, or who are promoting the acceleration of positive global transformations. From this point of view certain directions in Russo-African interaction are seen to be promising, such as certain aspects of disarmament, creation of nuclear-free zones, formation of regional security systems, strengthening international mechanisms for forestalling and settling conflicts, and formation of an international economic climate that is beneficial for Russia and Africa as well. The political assistance of Russia to settlement of the basic "hot spots" of Africa, to include support in the UN Security Council, is directed toward fulfilling the global mission of assuring a more secure world. We also consider this assistance an important part of our political partnership with the African countries, which strengthens the basis for mutually-advantageous cooperation with them. Russia is taking a most active part in the Angolan settlement, and together with the United States and Portugal is joining a "troika" of observers over the process of carrying out the Bisesskiy (Lisbon) Agreements (May, 1991). Russian military and civilian observers have been sent under UN auspices to a number of other conflict zones in Africa (Mozambique, Liberia, Somalia and Rwanda). On the whole it is obvious that in analyses of the prospects for stabilization of the situation in the "hot spots" of Africa and around them, one should avoid excess optimism. In this connection, Russian proposals made at the 48th Session of the UN General Assembly are considered timely ones. The essence of these proposals is--to establish within a United Nations framework additional mechanisms which will permit significantly increasing the success rate for peacemaking operations, to include the African continent as well. Experience in operations in support of peace implemented by the international community on the African continent is important for us, for application to Russia's own efforts on the territory of the former USSR. At the same time, while cooperating with the West on the African continent, one should proceed from the fact that the commonality of approaches noted for a number of problems does not at all signify that they are completely identical. Russia must operate above all in consideration of her own national interests, as well as the reality of the multipolar world that is taking shape. In spite of a certain slump in the sphere of trade and economic relations, prospects for developing cooperation with Africa exist, and above all in the extraction of minerals; in geology; and in construction, fisheries, woodworking and agriculture. Constructing and utilizing major new facilities--such as the bauxite extraction complex in Dian-Dian (Guinea); expanding the scale of independent activities of state and commercial structures; setting up joint enterprises; establishing new zones for trade and economic activities, for example, in Namibia and the South African Republic--can genuinely raise the overall qualitative level and scale of Russia's economic ties with Africa. The interests of Russia are served not only by maintaining, but also by expanding existing ties. It is at the same time necessary to purposefully and consistently place them on a new basis: to establish multi-level forms of cooperation with the countries which remain, chiefly for ideological motives, beyond the sphere of our attention. At the same time we should above all examine the possibilities for developing relations with those states which represent a promising market for acquiring Russian products, or suppliers of the goods and raw materials which we need. Intensification of Russo-African interaction will to a large extent also depend upon transition to new forms and methods of cooperation--granting of licenses and know-how, rental of machinery and equipment, collaboration between industrial sectors, and scientific-production cooperation. In recent years, while overcoming significant difficulties, the processes of integration have intensified in Africa. One may quite confidently assume that in the future, inter-African economic cooperation, aimed at the creation of an African economic community and regional economic structures, will become more significant. Such intentions have already appeared very vividly in a number of regions on the continent. Russian foreign economic structures could also take advantage of trends for integration in Africa for increasing her own exports to the corresponding markets, which will apparently be expanding as a result of the aforementioned trends. Our participation is possible at the level of enterprises, investment banks, and in the form of joint ventures. In resolving African problems of development, for the continent as a whole, for subregions and countries, Russia is devoting significant attention to the role of the UN Economic Commission for Africa [ECA] and, in particular, to the fact that ECA could stimulate and attribute a truly international character to its programs in such areas as transportation, power engineering, development of natural resources, and environmental protection, as well as support of small and mid-level entrepreneurship. Russian organizations are completely capable of participation in implementing projects within the framework of the second decade of industrial development in Africa and the second decade of transport and communication of the UN's ECA. It would appear that Russo-African cooperation, taking into consideration the peculiarities of the continent, could promote the solution of problems of employment and the development of facilities in the infrastructure; and could have as its ultimate goal the involvement to the fullest of African countries in the system of international division of labor on a fair basis. An important element of bilateral relations between Russia and countries of Africa, which requires a weighty and well-thought-out approach, is the problem of their obligations for credits issued by the former USSR. In terms of state credits alone, the volume of indebtedness of sub-Saharan African countries amounts to nearly $14 billion. The situation is aggravated by the fact that the domestic political situation in many of the countries which are the principal debtors is unstable, and the economy is in a state of crisis. Therefore, the task consists of finding ways and means of restoring the debts, without straining political relations, and without breaking existing mutually-advantageous ties. It is most important to proceed from the fact that the search for solution of this problem must not rest on narrow departmental considerations. It is necessary to take into account all aspects of political and commercial-economic relations with each country, individually. The question of indebtedness should be examined comprehensively, employing various strategies: partial payment in freely-convertible currency and local currency, compensation for debt by deliveries of goods, or reinvestment; taking things one step at a time, using part of the debt for covering the expenses of Russian missions, and so on. The sphere of military-technical cooperation remains an important link in Russia's foreign policy and economic ties with Africa. This form of interaction appears to be quite promising in the context of increasing its profitability and placing it on an exclusively commercial basis. A number of African states have an appropriate degree of interest in this. One must not fail to consider that a prolonged pause in the given sphere of relations with Africa can have a negative effect on Russian interests; since the vacuum formed as a result of breaking military-technical ties with the Soviet Union, and then with Russia as well, is being energetically filled by other countries--including those which produce weapons under Russian licenses, of greatly inferior quality than that which Russia herself could offer. It is evident, incidentally, that Russian arms deliveries should not appear in regions of existing and potential armed conflicts, nor in countries with openly dictatorial regimes. Apart from solving the urgent problems cited above, developing stable relations with African countries demands long-term humanitarian and political investment in the future of our ties. In this context one should, obviously, be thinking about the possibility of continuing, in modern conditions, the training of African national cadres in the VUZ's of our country. Such a practice provides its own positive results. It is another matter, that this cooperation should be for the most part placed on a compensatory basis. At the same time it should remain advantageous and attractive for our African partners as well. The question of future Russo-African relations continues to attract the attention of the Russian and world community. Today, it is true, few people doubt whether or not we need Africa in general. On this account, it would appear that at last a more-or-less unified point of view is taking shape--Yes, it is necessary, since Russia, even with her present difficulties, cannot allow herself the luxury of turning her back on Africa, nor to all the other regions of our planet. Russia must assure herself a fitting role in the world balance of influence, and in the multilateral processes for regulating the world economy and international relations. By preserving all that is rational in bilateral political, economic and cultural ties with Africa; applying to them content appropriate to the realities of today; and by developing cooperation in new directions, to include those countries which previously lay beyond the bounds of our active policy, Russia will support her own state interests, and will obtain greater freedom in the choice of foreign policy alternatives. In this manner the prerequisites will be laid down for more solid positions for our country, not only on the African continent, but in the world arena as a whole. Footnotes 1.
