Ulmanis handed the letter over to Russian Ambassador Alexander Rannikh who visited him Thursday [12 May] to discuss Latvian- Russian relations. Rannikh voiced his concern over "insufficient Latvian activities in the new block of the Skrunda radar facility," the president's office told BNS. The ambassador told Ulmanis that the last Russian warship would leave the Liepaja seaport early in July, thus, marking the complete withdrawal of Russian naval forces from Latvia. The officials pointed out that Latvian and Russian executive institutions should act more responsibly and energetically to allow for Russian Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin's visit to Latvia later this month. Ulmanis and Rannikh also assessed the recent Latvian joining to the Western European Union [WEU] in the status of "associate partner" as a major achievement of the Latvian diplomacy. Rannikh claims that the event confirms the unanimous WEU and European Union's backing to the signed package of Latvian-Russian troop withdrawal treaty.
