Member of the LDP Viktor Vishnyakov told lawmakers that the 1991 coup organisers are being tried "for nothing" as, according to him "they protected the Constitution" and their only fault was the abuse of office. The 1991 coup plotters include several former Soviet top officials, two of who were elected to the new parliament. Vishnyakov said that it is hard to legally assess the May 1 developments and added that the clash between police and hard-line demonstrators was "a provocation from police". The main organisers of the bloodshed, according to investigators, are die hard opposition members Viktor Anpilov and Ilya Konstantinov, both of who were arrested after the October armed revolt in Moscow. Dwelling on the October events, Vishnyakov said he would not like to "lose time in order to provide a legal assessment" of the developments. He proposed to first declare an amnesty to the organisers and then probe the reasons of the standoff which ended when tanks sent by President Boris Yeltsin pounded the headquarters of the opposition. The main culprits of the October events are former Vice-President Aleksandr Rutskoy, former parliament speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov and former Security Minister Viktor Barannikov. Although the Duma voted down the proposal of the LDP, it was forwarded, together with other versions of the amnesty, to the parliamentary committees on legislation and legal reform and on security and defence for improval.
