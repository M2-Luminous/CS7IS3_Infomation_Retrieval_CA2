Kumar Ponnambalam (Junior), the leader of the All Ceylon Tamil Congress [ACTC], has appealed to the voters in Eastern Province and Vavuniya District to go to the polling stations in the morning and to cast invalid ballots. In a statement he says: For various reasons, the ACTC does not welcome the scheduled local elections in the north and the east. The northeastern region is still a war zone. Many voters have deserted their homes and are living as refugees outside the Northern and Eastern Provinces. The list of voters is incomplete as a result. Proclaiming themselves members of parties and independent groups, the pro-government Tamil groups are still living in those areas. They have been harassing innocent Tamil citizens. All of these factors will impede the holding of free and fair elections. The ACTC strongly believes that the government's stubborn insistence on holding elections in spite of all these objections does not reflect its good intentions to establish a representative government. This is an insidious attempt to tell the world that the situation has become normal and that peace has returned to the north and east, in order to hold a referendum there. Every Tamil citizen knows that the situation in the northeast is not conducive to elections. Therefore, if any Tamil citizen extends any assistance toward this venture, he should be considered an accessory to the government conspiracy. For these reasons, the ACTC has decided not to be a party to the disinformation campaign. We appeal to the Tamil people in the north and east to go to the polling stations early in the morning to present their indignation, protests, and objections. We make this appeal in order to prevent the impersonation of genuine Tamil voters and the creation of a wrong impression for the rest of the world. The ACTC strongly condemns any Tamil party that makes an appeal for support of candidates favoring the merger of the north and east, as that would be contrary to the goal of opposing the elections. Besides, such a move would also justify a referendum on the merger of the north and east.
