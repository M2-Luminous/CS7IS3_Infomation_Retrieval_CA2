FR940414-0-00077 FR940414-0-00029 50 CFR Part 663 [Docket No. 940257&hyph;4105; I.D. 012494C] RIN 0648&hyph;AF76 Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: NMFS issues this final rule to establish requirements for combining two or more limited entry Pacific Coast groundfish fishery permits endorsed with vessel lengths from smaller vessels into a single limited entry permit endorsed with a larger length for use with a single fishing vessel. This rule is necessary to comply with regulations that require the Director, Northwest Region, NMFS (Regional Director), to develop and implement a standardized measure of harvest capacity for the purpose of determining the appropriate endorsed lengths for limited entry permits created by combining two or more permits with smaller size endorsements. EFFECTIVE DATE: April 8, 1994. ADDRESSES: Copies of the Environmental Assessment/Regulatory Impact Review/Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (EA/RIR/IRFA) and the Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (FRFA) are available from J. Gary Smith, Acting Director, Northwest Region, National Marine Fisheries Service, 7600 Sand Point Way NE., BIN C15700, Seattle, WA 98115&hyph;0070; or Anneka W. Bane, Acting Director, Southwest Region, National Marine Fisheries Service, 501 W. Ocean Blvd., suite 4200, Long Beach, CA 90802&hyph;4213. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: William L. Robinson at 206&hyph;526&hyph;6140, or Rodney R. McInnis at 310&hyph;980&hyph;4030. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Amendment 6 to the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan (FMP) was prepared by the Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council), approved on September 4, 1992, and implemented by NMFS on November 16, 1992 (57 FR 54001), through regulations codified at 50 CFR part 663, subpart C. Amendment 6, also called the ``Limited Entry Plan,'' is intended to control the harvesting capacity of the groundfish fishing fleet by: (1) Limiting the overall number of vessels; (2) Limiting the number of vessels using each of the three major gear types; and (3) Limiting increases in vessel harvest capacity by limiting vessel length. Amendment 6 requires that each limited entry fishing permit be endorsed with the length overall of the vessel that initially qualified for the permit (except for certain exceptions explained in the implementing regulations). A permit can only be used for a vessel that is no more than 5 ft (1.5 m) longer than the endorsed size on the permit or for a smaller vessel. Vessel owners may fish with larger vessels by combining permits for smaller vessels. Regulations at 50 CFR 663.33(g) require the Regional Director, with professional advice of marine architects and other qualified individuals, and after consultation with the Council, to develop and implement a standardized measure of harvest capacity for the purpose of determining the appropriate endorsed lengths for limited entry permits created by combining two or more permits with smaller size endorsements. Amendment 6 bases the system for combining limited entry permits in the Pacific Coast groundfish limited entry fishery on overall length of the fishing vessel. The standard it sets is that the harvest capacity represented by the appropriate length endorsement for the combined permit not exceed the sum of the harvest capacities of the permits being combined. As provided by Amendment 6, the standard applies regardless of the target species being fished, and is applicable equally to trawl, longline, and fish trap (pot) vessels. As a practical matter, any system for combining permits must also provide the flexibility for vessel owners to mix and match permits with a variety of different length endorsements in order to achieve the desired length endorsement for a larger vessel. Once the relationship between length and harvesting capacity is established, a table can be generated that assigns a certain number of capacity rating points for each increment of vessel length. Such a table can be used by vessel owners to determine, at a glance, how many rating points are needed for any particular length of vessel. Under Amendment 6, only limited entry permits with ``A'' gear endorsements may be combined, and only permits for the same gear type (e.g., longline and longline, not trawl and longline) may be combined. This final rule adds a table to the regulations implementing Amendment 6 that assigns a certain number of capacity rating points per foot of vessel length (see Table 1 added to ยง663.33(g)). The table of capacity rating points per foot increment of vessel length up to a vessel length of 150 ft (45.7 m) is based on a curvilinear relationship described as length to the 2.5 power. For vessels larger than 150 ft (45.7 m), the relationship is a straight line (constant slope) increasing the number of 60-foot (18.3 m) permits required per increment of vessel length, so that a 200-foot (61.0 m) vessel would require twelve 60-foot (18.3 m) permits and a 400-foot (121.9 m) vessel would require twenty 60-foot (18.3 m) permits.
