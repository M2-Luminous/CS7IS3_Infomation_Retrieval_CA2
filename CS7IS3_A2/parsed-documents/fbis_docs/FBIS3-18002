Since Estonia has no customs restrictions, the goods coming from Latvia and Lithuania will not add to the workload of customs officers, Raud claimed. Free-trade agreements with members of the European Free Trade Agreement have allowed the Customs Department to gain enough experience in issuing certificates of origin, so the addition of Latvia and Lithuania will pose no problems, he added. Latvians and Lithuanians, on the other hand, may run into difficulties, since they have established a domestic market protection system and now face the task of checking certificates, Foreign Ministry Deputy Chancellor Priit Kolbre claimed. Signe Ratso, an official from the Economics Ministry international relations department, added that many Estonian enterprises are impatiently waiting for the free-trade agreement to take effect to begin export of their output into the neighboring countries.
