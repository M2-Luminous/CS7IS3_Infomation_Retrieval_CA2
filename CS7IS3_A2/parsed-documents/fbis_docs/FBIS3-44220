A defiance of the authority of the state, or better still a foretaste of the "insurrection" which somebody may be planning to dish out to Ivorians after President Houphouet-Boigny's burial? Many are our countrymen who still wonder and anxiously await the end of the state burial which Cote d'Ivoire and the rest of the world are preparing for the deceased head of state. They wonder whether "February 94" is not going to be a repeat of "February 92," as though it were already predestined that the second month of the year will be for us like the month of May for France -- the month of all perils. Remember May 1968 in metropolitan France and May 1958 in Algiers.... among others. If it was a defiance of state authority, then there is reason to ask a few questions. Who is steering the wheel? Who is behind what happened on 22 January? This question is pertinent because no one can prove that it was in a spontaneous fashion that these "supporters" of the former prime minister moved to the airport. Consistent reports talk of distribution of money throughout Abidjan and in the communes and the hiring of minibuses, "woro-woro," and "gbaka" [parallel taxi and minibus services, respectively], the idea being to prove, on the one hand, that the former prime minister's popularity has remained intact and, on the other, that the new head of state, whose assumption of office on 7 December 1993 was by virtue of Article 11 of the Constitution, does not in any way enjoy the trust of his countrymen. The proponents of this thinking, who maintained from the onset that Article 11 was inapplicable and that it "would put the country to fire and sword as soon as Houphouet-Boigny's death is announced," have not yet lost hope of seeing their wish materialize -- i.e. setting the country ablaze, turning it definitely into another Liberia, for the simple reason that "power has eluded them," for the time being.... In short, they have lost "the battle," but have not yet "lost the war." Hence, the end justifies the means, not only in defying the authority of the new head of state but particularly in impressing upon all and sundry that without the former prime minister there can be no salvation for Ivorians, now at the mercy of the worst cataclysm. We all remember the February 1992 attempt which was roundly condemned by all true patriots and men of good judgment from both the Right and the Left, and while the view held then by students and some opposition leaders that the swoop by the military on the Yopougon University hall of residence was "a causus belli," what are we to understand this time? That Cote d'Ivoire is wrong to have had institutions that function? That the Constitution of the Republic ought not to have been applied after President Houphouet-Boigny's death? That a military or civilian coup d'etat would have been far better that a constitutional provision which, even though admittedly imperfect, had the merit of existing? Whatever the case may be, the strategic and tactical alliance formed between a section of the opposition -- which, only recently, held Alassane Ouattara up to public obloquy -- and friends of the former prime minister is a curious one. Together, they are committing the fatal error of consciously setting the stage for disorder through acts of provocation and defiance and by misinforming and poisoning the minds of the people. No one stands to gain from a disintegration of the country. No one has ever gained anything by destroying their own country. Savimbi and Charles Taylor can bear witness to that. This is why it is self-evident that just as the return fire to the "final onslaught" was "fatal," Cote d'Ivoire still has the means to deal with "rabble rousing" were it to resurface. The state must stand firm in the interest of the majority of Ivorians, who aspire to nothing but peace. [Paris AFP in French in an Abidjan date-lined item at 1107 GMT on 26 January adds the following: "These remarks were received with "surprise and regret" by Ouattara who, in a statement to AFP, maintained he had "nothing to do" with what happened and had "never done any act to disturb anything whatsoever," and called for serenity. He stated that for the time being he had made no decision regarding his future, political or otherwise. He also played down his differences with Mr. Bedie, saying he had "nothing against him." Mr. Ouattara further recalled that he had made no public statement since President Houphouet-Boigny's death on 7 December which led to his resignation two days later."]
