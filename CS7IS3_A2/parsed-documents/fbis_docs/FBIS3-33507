Based on that interpretation by the officials close to the minister, the entire mechanism surrounding the imminent visit is oriented in that direction. But when questions are asked, the officials only respond with gestures that are supposed to be eloquent. Camilion will be in Brasilia on 21 February to start a series of meetings with top military officials, and he also will visit Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. The invitation last December came, strangely, from the Brazilian Foreign Ministry and not from any of the three military ministries since there is no defense ministry in Brazil. Several issues will be discussed. The two countries' policy began to go in different directions at some point. It could have been when Argentina gave up its missile project or when it became the only Latin American country that sent troops to the Persian Gulf. Washington is far away but it is known that its look goes far. Some ideas about Argentine desires to join NAFTA, which in Brasilia is an organization considered as a competitor of Mercosur [Common Market of the South], also could have had an influence. For some analysts the main site of friction is not Buenos Aires or Brasilia but the United Nations. Argentina worked hard to get a seat on the Security Council that took office on 1 January for the next two years. Brazil is also a temporary member and ends its term this year. If a decision is made in the United Nations to increase the permanent council members, Argentina will support Germany and Japan over the desires Brazil may have in this regard. Brazilian military officers have emphasized the Argentine-U.S. military exercises held last September in Misiones Province close to the Brazilian border in their reports. The exercises are not new. There were other joint exercises but this time the Brazilians seem to be more sensible. To prevent future irritation, our country will propose a reciprocal information mechanism establishing that when either of the two countries will hold military exercises in border regions with third countries, notification will be made several months in advance. Camilion plans to carry out a work of high diplomacy as in his best years as foreign minister and ambassador to Brazil. According to his aides, that background was evaluated by the Brazilian Foreign Ministry at the time of making the invitation.
