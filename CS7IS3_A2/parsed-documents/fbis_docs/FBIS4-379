The two sides fought with mortars, grenades and automatic weapons, the International Committee of the Red Cross said. The report appeared to contradict a Belgian UN commander's assertion that the two sides, which have engaged in an orgy of violence since the death of the Rwandan president in a plane crash last Wednesday, had agreed to a ceasefire Sunday and were generally respecting it. Western countries scrambled Sunday to evacuate their nationals from the tiny central African country.
