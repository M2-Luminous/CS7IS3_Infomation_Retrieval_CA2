The Rollover Crash Problem Rollover crashes occur for many reasons, and involve the interaction of a variety of factors including the driver, the roadway, the vehicle, and environmental conditions. The relationship of these various factors to rollover crashes can be examined by analyzing data from various sources. The agency estimates that there were 220,000 rollover crashes involving passenger cars, and multipurpose passenger vehicles and trucks under 4,536 kilograms (10,000 pounds) gross vehicle weight rating (collectively, ``light trucks'') in 1991. These resulted in 9,186 fatalities; 56,000 occupants of these vehicles received serious, incapacitating injuries. These numbers have remained relatively constant over the past six years. Ejections are responsible for 63 percent of the fatalities. Safety belts are used by only 13 percent of the fatally injured occupants. Of the 220,000 rollover crashes, 207,000, or 94 percent, were single vehicle crashes and 192,000 of these, or 93 percent, occurred off the road. Various accident studies have indicated that loss of vehicle directional control is a prelude to rollover in 50 percent to 80 percent of all rollover crashes. For the years 1985&hyph;1991, small cars had the greatest number of rollover fatalities, followed by standard-size pickup trucks. However, pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles have fatality rates per million registered vehicles between two and three times as great as that of passenger cars. The difference between the numbers of rollover fatalities and the rollover fatality rates for particular vehicle types is a result of the relative proportions of various types of vehicles in the fleet. There are currently many more small cars than pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles on the road today. (A more extensive discussion of rollover statistics, and the sources for this information, can be found in the ``Addendum to Technical Assessment Paper,'' NHTSA 1994, which is in Docket No. 91&hyph;68, Notice 03.)
