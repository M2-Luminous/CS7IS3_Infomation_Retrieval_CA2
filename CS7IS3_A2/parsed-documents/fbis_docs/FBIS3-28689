FBIS3-28689 "dreas027_a_94030" FBIS-EAS-94-027 Document Type:Daily Report 9 Feb 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Comments on, Reaction to Tax, Stimulus Issues Bond Issuance Plan Boosted OW0902111894 Tokyo KYODO in English 1103 GMT 9 Feb 94 OW0902111894 Tokyo KYODO Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 9 KYODO -- Japan plans to issue a record 36.53 trillion yen in government bonds in the coming fiscal year, up 6.61 trillion yen from its plan in the initial fiscal 1993 budget, the Finance Ministry said Wednesday [9 February]. That will break the record 29.92 trillion yen initially planned for the current fiscal year ending March 31, said a ministry official. The government boosted its bond issuance plan for fiscal 1993 to 37.79 trillion yen through two sets of extra budgets and is to increase it further with a third one slated for release Thursday. The fiscal 1994 forecast includes deficit-covering bonds but their amount will not be officially decided until a cabinet meeting Thursday morning, the official said. Government bond issuance in the private sector is expected to rise 7.56 trillion yen in fiscal 1994 from this fiscal year's initial plan to 28.76 trillion yen, but the total amount digested by the public sector will likely dip by 95 billion yen to 7.77 trillion yen, the report said. It forecast the amount of government bonds placed in public auction will climb by 4.36 trillion yen to 16.56 trillion yen, with big increases in both four and six-year issues for which the official cited strong demand. But despite the inflated supply of bonds in the market, the ministry official said there was "no big concern" over rising rates as the economy remains stagnant and credit policy remains loose. The dip in public-sector handling of bonds will result from a 1.70 trillion yen drop to 3.69 trillion yen by the ministry's trust fund bureau, as its ability to buy bonds is restricted by tight budgets, the official said. But he said the ministry has sought the help of underwriting syndicates to pick up the slack, with the report saying their purchases will rise 3.20 trillion yen to 12.20 trillion yen. Purchases by the Bank of Japan should rise 2.62 trillion yen to 2.82 trillion yen as it rolls over expiring issues in its holdings.
