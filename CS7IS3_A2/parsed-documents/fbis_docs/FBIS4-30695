They are selling themselves as "Asian banks" with the goal of winning the business of major European companies with stepped-up enthusiasm for entering the Asian markets," while sparing no effort in developing ideas for investment in Asian projects on the part of European firms. Among Japanese banks striving to survive in London's international financial markets, "Asia" has become a password. "Asian Seminars" targeting local European firms by Japanese banks are being conducted on a fairly active basis. Such seminars have been held in London by the Industrial Bank of Japan in February and by the Bank of Tokyo in May, and in London and Paris by Sanwa Bank. Seminars have included lectures on economic trends in China and ASEAN nations by instructors such as the former head of a Beijing branch office. Noticeable are attendees from large companies such as British Petroleum (BP) and British Gas. The seminars are used to impress upon participating firms that the banks play a "dominant role in the Asian market." The move by Japanese banks to vocally stress that they are "Asian banks" was inspired by the intensification of actions by major European firms to reduce the number of banks with which they maintain relations. Blue chip firms which had raised capital by organizing major international loan consortia during the latter half of the 1980's have intensified moves toward reducing banks with which they do business to "core banking groups" of 10 or so institutions. A loan officer at a London branch of a Japanese bank says, "Only two or three Japanese banks will be left in core banking groups." As European firms intensify their aspirations to enter such markets as those of China, the appeal of phrases such as a "bank playing a dominant role in the Asian market" will serve as a powerful weapon to engage in transactions covering that area. As an example, when a leading British telecommunications services company was issued approval for loans in March, fierce competition among Japanese banks resulted in the designation of Sumitomo and Sanwa Banks to handle the loans. Sanwa Bank was selected because it had already established close relations with the Hong Kong joint venture of the parent company. London branch manager and managing director Masaaki Fujimoto stresses that his bank's dominant role in Asia "serves as momentum for it to win business in that area." Emphasis on Asia by Japanese banks' London branches is not limited to an appeal for customers. Connections with European firms entering the Asian market have been providing increasing opportunities to develop new business ideas for the Asian market. Mitsubishi Bank played an intermediary role in arranging a $1.5 billion loan by a Japanese-U.S.-European loan consortium signed in the fall of 1993 for the construction of an oil refinery in Thailand by Royal Dutch Shell. The transaction was initiated by the London branch of Mitsubishi by taking advantage of its previous relationship with Shell. Reportedly, "individuals in charge of project financing and aircraft financing are making frequent trips to Hong Kong and Singapore" from Sumitomo Bank's London branch. As growth in demand for capital remains sluggish in Europe, loan officers in London have turned their attention to Asia, where demand for capital is lively. Needless to say, any increased activity by European branches in winning business for the Asian market can cause friction within banks. Thus, the respective banks have devised systems for sharing profits arising from such advisory activities among branches and for conducting business across the branches' regional jurisdictions. Japanese banks' London branches eying Asia face formidable competition from European and U.S. banks. One assistant branch manager of a long-term credit bank's London branch admits, "Britain's Merchant Bank with experience under the old colonial system has far more know-how in the area of providing capital-raising advice." And, U.S. investment bankers are making bold investments in personnel and capital in the Asian market. Japanese banks are working assiduously to establish their own unique strengths. Tadashi Kurachi, the Bank of Tokyo's managing director and London branch general manager for European affairs, stresses, "Our bank has a branch network that covers the world as far as India and Pakistan and has access to detailed information through the Chinese connection." Both Mitsubishi and Sumitomo say, "Not only are we strong in Asia, but we sell ourselves in terms of being superior in handling project financing and aircraft financing." London branches of Japanese banks have finally recovered from losses suffered as a result of inflated real estate investments in the latter half of the 1980's and are now seeking a path to the future. "Asia" is now designated as an ideal target for that purpose. The future will provide the answer to whether they can compete effectively with European and U.S. banks and whether they can make effective use of their full potential.
