At a time of unprecedented growth in this region, the French presence there remains too marginal, despite the media attention given to some industrial contracts, such as Airbus or Alcatel-Alsthom, and the activities of some small and medium-sized enterprises, such as Gemplus, Sopha Medical, or Cisigraph. In a bid to promote French industries in the region, the Ministry of Industry, Post and Telecommunications, and Foreign Trade has just launched a massive project called "French Initiative For Asia", just a few days after the restoration of the traditional French cooperative links between France and China. The aim is to raise Asia's share of French exports from the present 7 percent to 10 percent over the next five years. This wide-ranging venture, pivoting around 10 actions, targets the region as a whole, from Pakistan to New Zealand, and particularly the rapidly developing Far East: China, Hong Kong, Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, and the ASEAN [Association of South-East Asian Nations] countries: (Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Brunei). All the experts agree on one point, their consensus supported by a recent World Bank report on the Chinese economic area: The 21st century will be the "Asian century." This report's conclusions, founded on very cautious hypotheses, are that by the year 2000 the China-Taiwan-Hong Kong triangle could account for 6.5 percent of global trade (including internal trade). By 2030, this zone will account for 12 percent of global GDP, or around the same as the then figure for the United States or Japan. Economic expansion, which has abandoned Europe, has already moved to the Far East. Between 1986 and 1990, Korea, Thailand, Taiwan, and China had real annual average growth rates of 10.2, 9.9, 8.8 and 8.1 percent respectively. Unfortunately, France's market share ranged, depending on the country, between 1 and 4 percent of imports (apart from Vietnam, where the figure is 6 percent). The average figure for the region is 2 percent, or one-third of France's overall global market share and, crucially, well below the figure for France's major partners. It should be borne in mind that Germany's performance in south-east Asia is twice as good. France's performance over investments is even more modest: Its share of foreign investment is 0.7 percent for the Philippines, and 2.5 percent for Singapore. There are, however, a few signs of improvement. In 1992, French exports to the Pacific Rim rose to 86 billion French francs, or 7 percent of our total exports, doubling the 1980 figure. Furthermore, besides the significant reduction in our trade deficit with newly industrialized countries, the value of French exports to Asia rose by 14.5 percent in 1993, compared with a 5-percent reduction in exports to the rest of the world. There were particularly noticeable increases in Malaysia (plus 63 percent), China (plus 23 percent), Hong Kong (plus 34 percent), India (plus 21 percent), and Singapore (plus 33 percent). The French authorities have for some years been actively encouraging companies' activities in this promising region. For instance, it receives around 40 percent of total development aid, and a quarter of the total funding provided by COFACE [French Company for Guaranteeing Foreign Trade]. Besides joint financing by several supporting bodies whose job is to find local partners for joint ventures (OCIFA [expansion unknown] in Indonesia and Taiwan, APRODI [expansion unknown] in South Korea, Malaysia, and Thailand), there has been significant strengthening of local teams. The transfer of DREE's [Management of External Economic Relations] resources to the Ministry of Industry, Posts and Telecommunications, and Foreign Trade, has enabled the number of organizations geared toward economic expansion in the Pacific Rim to rise to 32. However, political leaders consider it is now time to fight back against our traditional competitors -- hence the launch of the "French Initiative for Asia" program. One of the program's strongest thrusts is the organization in 1994 of two entirely French events in East Asia. These are intended as a high-technology shop windows, with an emphasis on industrial goods. The first takes place in Taiwan at the start of July, with the second in Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia) in November. These are free-standing events, rather than being based on a local trade fair or exhibition. The project's second phase, starting in 1995, will also feature three French exhibitions of consumer goods. To support these ventures, a major public-relations campaign will be launched in 1994/95, featuring the distribution throughout the region of a brochure entitled "High Tech, High Touch: France," available in both English and Chinese, in 1994. This brochure, already issued in Japanese and Korean, has been completely updated. Structural measures designed to produce effects in the medium term have also been taken. These include both strong budgetary mobilization of the bodies which promote foreign trade (CFCE [French Foreign Trade Center]; CFME [French Committee for Economic Events Overseas]; ACTIM [Technical, Industrial and Economic Cooperation Agency]) and of the procedures which provide existing trade with financial support, and the development of a policy for Asia in the energy and telecommunications fields. The Industry Ministry also plans to fund the creation of a business center in Singapore to host French small and medium-sized enterprises and industries. This project, under which support for economic development will be sought from partners operating internationally (regions, professional organizations, international chamber of commerce) is currently the subject of a feasibility study. A decision should be made by 30 June. The Ten Actions Under the French Initiative for Asia 1. Measures taken by CFCE over the rapidly developing Asian market to be tripled within three years. 2. A quarter of CFME's credit to be oriented towards Asia. 3. 30 percent of ACTIM's credit to be oriented towards Asia. 4. Priority for financial procedures for supporting trade in east Asia. In particular, the Codex procedure to be 50 percent dedicated to this region from this year. 5. Expansion of major French events in Asia. 6. Intensification of public relations campaigns in Asia to promote French industry and technology's image. 7. Project to launch a French business center for French small and medium-sized enterprises in Singapore. 8. Project for framework agreements for joint investments in Asia. 9. Launch of an Asia telecommunications program. 10. Intensification of French presence in the energy sector in Asia. EDF [French Electricity] and GDF [French Gas] will propose an active international strategy in the countries concerned by 30 April.
