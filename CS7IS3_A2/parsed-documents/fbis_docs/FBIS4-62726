"In our conscience Russia and the Caucasus are inseparably linked notions. One cannot be imagined without the other", Yeltsin said in an address to the Caucasian peoples on Tuesday in connection with the 130th annivesary of the end of the Caucasian war which resulted in the incorporation of the Caucasus into the Russian empire. "The events of a more than a century-long history return us to those years when the interests of the Russian empire, Great Britain, France, Iran and Turkey clashed in the struggle for the Caucasus. All those states bear a share of moral responsibility for the sufferings of the highlanders", the president said. Yeltsin admitted that in various times the Caucasian war was assessed in different ways. "At present, when Russia is building a law-governed state and recognises the priority of human values, a possibility emerges to objectively assess the Caucasian war as courageous struggle of the peoples of the Caucasus not only for survival on their own land, but also for the preservation of their self-styled culture, the best traits of the national character". The president added that the problems inherited from the Caucasian war, including the return of descendants of Caucasian refugees back to their historic motherland, should be solved at the international level through negotiations of all the interested parties. The Caucasus should be "forever with Russia" -- these words are dear for every Russian, Yeltsin stressed.
