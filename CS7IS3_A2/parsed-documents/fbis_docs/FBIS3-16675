The decision has been taken, ANI agency notes, despite the fact that the Ostankino TV channel is the only Russian TV channel relayed throughout Lithuania and has the highest rating in the republic. According to the calculations of Lithuanian communications men, the debt of the transmitting station in Moscow equals approximately 1 billion lits or $250,000. Evidently it is appropriate to remember that in all civilized countries of the world it is the receiving side that pays for the transmission of broadcasts but in our country it is the other way round.
