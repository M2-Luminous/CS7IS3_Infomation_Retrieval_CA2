[Lezsak] A third of our candidates have a real chance to make it into parliament, and a few candidates might also get in from the next third. According to my estimates, more than 60 individual MDF candidates will receive the voters' confidence, and they will be strengthened by the candidates successful on the lists. I have confidence in the election success of the MDF because, in the preparation for the campaign, our candidates visited many households and made contact with people; we set up the election offices, and we will slowly catch up with the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] in organization. [Papp] Some people claim that the MDF started its campaign too modestly. This is a tough and dirty struggle, and other parties carry out their campaign in this way. Why is the MDF so withdrawn? [Lezsak] The MDF does not agree with a styleless struggle; both our leadership and our members clearly declared this at the very beginning. Our election posters do not irritate anyone, and we thank the citizens for their confidence and calm of four years, because the voters also contributed to Hungary being the most stable country in the region. The opposition parties will also realize sooner or later that all that glitters is not gold, and I mean by this that it is not sure that the foreign campaign experts employed by them are aware of the Hungarian reality. In fact, the final election results will tell which party has the real experts. [passage omitted] [Papp] According to the political signs, it may happen that no party will form a coalition with the MSZP, if they get into a position to form a government. What happens in that case? [Lezsak] New parliamentary elections will probably be called, but today no one can even forecast the results of the elections in May; nor can anyone say for sure which party will be the final victor. The MDF has huge resources. Take some 40 percent of the voters: These people are watching domestic political developments with silent passivity. Their votes could be decisive and, therefore, the MDF also hopes to get a lot of votes from this group, because every person of goodwill knows that the MDF has carried out predictable political activity over the past four years, and the party's program is a guarantee that we will continue the policy begun by the late Jozsef Antall. [Papp] Let us suppose that, contrary to all expectations, the MDF does not have the success that you envisage. Will this lead to personal consequences? [Lezsak] Our chances of winning are increasing and, no doubt, the MDF will play a determining role in the new Hungarian parliament and Government. However, if things turn out differently, this will not be the end of the world, because a process of internal cleansing would start and, as a result, we would really have the opportunity to get to know the people. It is more than probable that many careerists would turn their backs on us and would try to get close to other parties. This would not be anything special, because this is also part of life.
