Lysenko's opinion is that the Constitutions of republics should accord with Russia's fundamental law which is "the cornerstone of the strengthening of Russian statehood and the development of federative relations". "This is, of course, not to the liking of all political forces and their leaders. But we all should move on from words to deeds to create a powerful Russian state," Lysenko pointed out. In ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI, writer Yuriy Chernichenko, member of the Federation Council and chairman of the Peasants' Party of Russia, describes the current agrarian reform in the country as a slack one. He says it has no proclaimed goals, a manifest, or an ideology. It has, instead, a lot of purely Russian and "Soviet" peculiarities which determine its slack nature and immediate and distant prospects. The writer's detailed reflections on the subject are to be published in one of future issues of the newspaper. ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA interviewed Sergey Belyayev, general director of the Federal Directorate for Insolvency (bankruptcy). He describes the importance of a new concept of the relevant legislation which is being prepared by his organisation. "Then, we shall have a clear idea of how many enterprises are really insolvent and are potential bankrupts or, on the contrary, can restore their paying capacity". As of now, he said there are about 1,200 large insolvent enterprises in Russia. Pointing out that most people are psychologically unprepared to seek protection under circumstances unexpected for them, Belyayev draws the following conclusion:" "there is no detonator more dangerous for a social conflict than a quiet self-liquidation of insolvent enterprises". KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (Red Star) raises the question of the need to enhance social protection of the military, which is essential, first of all, to uphold Russia's interests. The Army does not ask for something extra. It needs firm social guarantees backed up financially, not lamentations that these are hard times for everyone, the newspaper points out. KRASNAYA ZVEZDA carries an interview with Igor Puzanov, first deputy commander of the troops of the Moscow Military District, who points out the importance of a rise in the professionalism standards in the forces, which is hindered, he said, by the "scarcity of resources". "It is possible and necessary to economise but there is the limit below which one should not go in arrangements for combat and operation training of troops and officer personnel. This would be dangerous for the state and would threaten with irreversible consequences", Puzanov said. TRUD runs an interview with Fyodor Prokopov, director of the Federal Employment Service. He points out that as of May 1, there were 1,180,000 officially registered unemployed in Russia. He predicts that their number will grow to about 12 million towards the end of the year but that six million of them will be able to get new jobs quickly: commercial entities and small-business enterprises gain in scope. Prokopov urges the jobless to learn to acquire skills that the country needs, monitor the labour market situation and try their hand in new lines of business. PRAVDA, referring to the data of the Federal Employment Service, writes that the number of unemployed in Russia has grown by 40 percent since the beginning of the year. The highest unemployment rate was observed in the Jewish autonomous region, Evenkia, Karachai-Cherkesia, Amur region and Khabarovsk territory as well as in central regions of Russia. The newspaper quotes Vice-Premier Yuriy Yarov as stating that mass unemployment threatens with such a social outburst, compared to which hyperinflation consequences would pale into insignificance. PRAVDA carries an interview with Leonid Filatov, a merited artist of Russia, an actor, stage director and writer, who criticises the country's reform process. In his view, the reforms lead "in a wrong direction". NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA runs the full text of a project for the formation of a Euro-Asian union of states. This has been done at the request of Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev, who sent the text out to the heads of state of CIS countries. The document points out that all CIS countries experience a deep crisis. Their development is determined by two trends. There is a further formation of national statehood, on the one hand, and there is a tendency towards CIS countries' integration, on the other. TRUD interviewed Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk who pointed out that Ukraine and Russia had lived "within a single power" for 340 years. No one ever took up arms to fight each other, he said. "When I am asked whether there will be a war between Russia and Ukraine, I answer `no' without hesitation," Kravchuk said. "I want relations between Russia and Ukraine to be built with an eye to long-term development", he emphasised. KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA singles out a report that Ukrainian nationalists' leader Dmitriy Korchinskiy issued an order to paramilitary units "to be prepared to go to the Crimea". An article to this effect is headlined "They Are Already Prepared To Resort to Killing in the Crimea".
