In a state plan for poverty elimination, which is made public today, the State Council said that to attain that goal, it will concentrate China's manpower, materials and funds and mobilize all sectors of society. "Although poor people constitute a small proportion of China's rural population, the task for eliminating poverty is extremely arduous," the plan said. That is because these people are concentrated in areas with harsh natural conditions, such as high mountainous areas, desert areas, loess highlands and areas where much of the land has been taken for reservoirs, it explained. The plan outlined the following points for solving the food problem for these 80 million people by the end of the century: -- The overwhelming majority of poor households will score a big increase in per-capita earnings; -- Poor households will be assisted in creating basic conditions for solving the food problem, such as cultivating stable and high- yield farmland, orchards and woods, expanding livestock breeding and sideline production; -- The problem of insufficient drinking water will be solved by and large; -- Most poor townships will be linked by highways and have electricity; -- Primary education will be made universal and illiteracy among adults will be eliminated; -- Vocational education and technical training will be promoted among adults; and -- Endemic diseases will be prevented and brought under control. The plan said that officials and farmers in poor areas will be encouraged to achieve prosperity by becoming market-oriented, relying on the use of science and techniques, developing local resources and expanding commodity production. Rural residents living in areas with extremely harsh natural conditions will be relocated, it added. According to the plan, the State Council has decided to increase appropriations for the poverty-elimination program from 1994. The plan mandated local governments at all levels to increase funding for the program. It also emphasized the need to promote exchanges and cooperation with the international community in poverty elimination. It is imperative to try to improve the investment environment in poor areas and encourage overseas investors to start productive enterprises to make full use of natural resources there, it noted. The plan also banned the government of any poor county from buying cars, building luxury hotels or constructing office buildings before the food problem is solved among local residents.
