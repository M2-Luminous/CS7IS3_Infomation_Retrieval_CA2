However, I think that the forming of a political party from in the long term and from the viewpoint of the stabilisation of the political scene is more important than a pre-election campaign," Chairman of the Democratic Union of Slovakia (DEUS) Jozef Moravcik told journalists today. Moravcik, who is also Slovak premier, was speaking after the assembly where DEUS was established through a merger between Moravcik's Alternative of Political Realism (APR) and the Alliance of Slovak Democrats (AD) of former foreign minister Milan Knazko. Knazko, who was elected first deputy chairman, said that DEUS was oriented towards Liberal International and hoped to become a full- fledged member in a short time. DEUS' closest partners in the Czech Republic are the Free Democrats (SD) of former Czechoslovak Foreign Minister Jiri Dienstbier, he added. Today's merger conference was attended by leading representatives of Slovak political parties with the exception of the opposition Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) and the Slovak National Party (SNS). The conference was also addressed by representatives of liberal parties from Hungary, Poland and Austria. Moravcik said that in connection with the agreement that no political leaders would be represented in the coalition government, the DEUS statutes say that during his time in the government he would be represented in the leadership of DEUS by Knazko. Asked if DEUS would adhere to the screening law while composing its election list of candidates, Moravcik answered that an amendment to the law had been initiated. This would concern people who were forced to sign collaboration agreements with the StB secret police due to their profession, though they did not operated in the section aimed "against domestic enemies". As an example, Moravcik gave workers in the arms industry. "If the screening law is valid, we will observe it," he added. The screening law, adopted by the Czechoslovak Parliament in 1991, bans people linked to the former communist-run StB secret police, high Communist Party officials and members of People's Militia from high government and economic posts until 1996.
