FBIS4-59349 "drnes092_v_94004" FBIS-NES-94-092 Daily Report 11 May 1994 Pakistan Comments Further on Deployment Comments Further on Deployment BK1105145294 Islamabad PTV Television Network in English 1400 GMT 11 May 94 BK1105145294 Islamabad PTV Television Network English BFN [Text] Pakistan has expressed its concern over the Indian decision to deploy Prithvi and Agni missiles. A spokesman of the Foreign Office, while briefing newsmen in Islamabad today, said that Pakistan has informed the Missile Technology Control Regime countries, including USA, that the Indian decision will further aggravate the threat to peace and security in South Asia and unleash a specter of nuclear missile race in the region. He hoped that the world community will prevail upon India to stop this reckless move. The spokesman said India has increased violations of the Line of Control and its helicopters had twice infiltrated into the territory of Azad Jammu and Kashmir on the 5th of this month. He said three innocent civilians had been killed and five wounded by Indian firing during the last two weeks. Referring to the recent spate of baseless allegations leveled by India regarding Pakistan's involvement in occupied Kashmir, the spokesman said this would further heighten tension between the two countries. In fact, the spokesman said, India was engaged in spreading terrorism in Pakistan. Pakistani troops had recently arrested two armed terrorists from Kotli sector, trained by India to carry out sabotage activities in Pakistan. Fifty-two kg of explosives was recovered from them. The spokesman said that 2,000 Pakistani troops would be deployed in Bosnia-Herzegovina by June this year under UN auspices. He said 40 of them are being trained in Germany, while rest of the contingent is getting training in Czechoslovakia [as heard] with German equipment.
