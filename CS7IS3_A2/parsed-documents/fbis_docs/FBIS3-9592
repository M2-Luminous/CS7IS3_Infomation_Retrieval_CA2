In addition to the president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, Alija Izetbegovic, the session is being attended by representatives of the highest state bodies and political, religious, and military life of the city and the state. In a report on the work of the SDA so far, Party Chairman Mirsad Ceman gave a brief summary of the activity of the SDA, one of the rare organizations which was prepared for the aggression against Bosnia-Herzegovina and which contributed fully -- in political, military, and all other spheres -- to the defense of our homeland and the Bosniak Muslim nation whose political interests it represents. The SDA has fully responded to the historic challenge and it therefore represents a strong political basis and a guarantee for the survival and freedom of the Bosniak Muslims. Speaking about Bosnia, President Izetbegovic said that good and evil, reason and madness came into conflict here. [Begin Izetbegovic recording] I have noticed over the past two years of this war that the world has slowly divided into those who are for and those who are against Bosnia. There are almost no more neutral people. They have either been for or against Bosnia, and no one has remained uninvolved. When you analyze that division, you can see that everything that was good, thank God, sided with us. I have noticed this speaking, for example, about governments in a country. Their sleek politicians placed themselves on the other side, but the free-thinking people in that country -- [word indistinct] all those idealists, romantics, poets, artists -- they were all on our side. The whole of the Muslim world was on our side, but that is a special case. Everything good in the Western world sided with us. [end recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Bosnia will be a country of law and order, Izetbegovic went on to say. At the same time, it will be governed in such a way that a genocide against Bosniak Muslims will never again occur. Despite the fact that they have lost most people for Bosnia's freedom, they will not give up the struggle to recover the captured territories. [Begin Izetbegovic recording] Our people currently living in Germany or Croatia must be able to return to their villages near Zvornik. There is no negotiating there. There is no negotiating there. [applause] That is a practical, everyday, political reason. There is also a moral reason. Could we possibly give them [Serbs] those territories as a reward for (?their job) of having killed us -- please keep it as a reward. We will not allow that. [end recording] [Correspondent] As part of the second item of the agenda, which has not started yet, following a report by Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic on the recently signed agreement with the Croats, seven more reports will be submitted: on the functioning of state bodies, foreign policy, information, refugees, army, veterans' issues, and economic reconstruction of the country.
