Expressing his satisfaction with the high-ranking guest's visit, President Tudjman said that the development of relations between the United States and Croatia was positive and stressed that democratic Croatia had been doing its best since its very beginning to forge as close as possible links with the United States, not only because of the 2 million Croatians living there but because U.S. democracy is an exemplary model for young democracies such as Croatia's. Speaking about the situation in the UNPA [UN protected areas] and the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Tudjman reiterated Croatia's stands regarding a peaceful solution to the crisis in these areas. In this context he stressed that there would be a positive effect if the UN Security Council lent its firm support for the draft solution for Bosnia-Herzegovina proposed within the framework of the conference on the former Yugoslavia. He also pointed out that concordance [suglasnost] among the EU [European Union], United States, and United Nations was a serious precondition for efficiency and a quick end to the war in this area. The president also said that Croatia -- in keeping with its general democratic development and seeking solutions for the UNPA and Bosnia-Herzegovina -- was determined to protect human rights on a lasting basis. It will nevertheless bring those who threaten this development to account. President Tudjman also expressed his deep gratitude to Mrs. Albright for her visit to Vukovar. Speaking about the horror she had seen in Vukovar in the heart of Europe, the ambassador said that the United States would do everything to punish the perpetrators. She also presented U.S. views on solving the situation in the UNPA. In this context she stressed that the United States supported the implementation of Resolution 871. In this respect she emphasized the importance of continuing sanctions against Serbia as well as the fact that these sanctions ought to be linked to reintegration of the UNPA into the system of the Republic of Croatia. Speaking about the situation in Bosnia, Mrs. Albright stressed that the United States was concerned over the fighting between the Croats and Muslims. She also emphasized the problem of delivering humanitarian aid to the suffering population of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The United States wants peace, stability, territorial integrity, and democracy in this region, the ambassador said and added that she hoped President Clinton's Partnership for Peace project would secure peace and stability in the region of Central and Eastern Europe and facilitate the incorporation of this entire region into the European order of democracy, peace, stability, market economy, and respect for human rights. Toward the end of the meeting, Ambassador Albright stressed that relations between the United States and the Republic of Croatia will remain good in the future too.
