In the morning, deputies studied documents in preparation for their afternoon group discussions on the draft civil code. "All the views aired focused on some major issues such as the issue of marriage and families, the issue of transfer of land-use rights within areas stipulated by the civil code, the substance of civil relations, the issue of ownership, and the issue of civil contracts. "Generally speaking, all the debaters favored the idea of promptly approving the civil code since it is a very important law that has great impact on general social activities." Some deputies expressed the view that although many laws have been promulgated by our state over the past 10 years, numerous issues have still been left unadjusted by the legislative sector. This has created considerable difficulties for those organs in charge of adjudicating civil disputes. "In reality, many cases of violation of the rights and the legitimate interests of individuals, collectives, and the state have occurred and there has been a failure to clearly define the legal position of foreigners in Vietnam. That is why a prompt promulgation of the civil code is necessary." The National Assembly deputies will continue their group discussions on the draft civil code tomorrow morning. They will work at the conference hall in the afternoon.
