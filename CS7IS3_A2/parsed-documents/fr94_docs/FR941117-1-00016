FR941117-1-00016 FR941117-1-00004 In the course of developing these proposed regulations, several parties suggested that intensive outpatient services be included as a subcategory of services under the psychiatric L 21 benefit in order to emphasize that outpatient services can often be substituted for inpatient care, with less traumatic impact on the patient. Although we support the goal of substituting outpatient services for inpatient services whenever possible, the statutory language of section 1905(h) of the Act authorizing this inpatient benefit does not provide latitude for including outpatient services; this benefit must be provided in ``a psychiatric hospital *␣*␣* or in another inpatient setting.'' We believe, however, that the system we have proposed for assessing the total needs of each child or adolescent will support the goal of assuring that outpatient services are used whenever this is a feasible alternative. It was also suggested that we consider allowing children and adolescents who do not require inpatient treatment of their mental conditions to enter residential facilities if they require residential placement to remove them from a problematic family setting. In this situation, it was suggested that Medicaid would fund the treatment services, and payment for the cost of room and board would come from other sources. While we recognize that this type of arrangement may be necessary in some circumstances, and we acknowledge that rehabilitative services can be provided in a wide variety of settings, we note that care provided under such an arrangement would not be provided in the context of the psychiatric L 21 benefit, which is restricted by statute to individuals who require inpatient care for treatment of their mental condition (section 1905(h)(1)(B)). Accordingly, we have not incorporated this suggestion into the proposed regulations. V. Provisions of the Proposed Regulations A. Inpatient Mental Health Provisions We would establish a new §441.45, Mental health assessment and service plan, which implements section 1902(a)(26) of the Act. This section requires individual plans of care for psychiatric inpatients and periodic medical review in each psychiatric institution. The State would be required to ensure that a comprehensive assessment is made (§441.45(a)) and that an individual comprehensive services plan (§441.45(b)) is developed for each individual who has been determined to be at risk of requiring inpatient mental health treatment. We propose to extend this requirement to include not only eligible individuals currently receiving inpatient mental hospital services, but also certain eligible individuals who the State reasonably believes may imminently need such services, because we believe that such a requirement is a necessary safeguard to ensure proper utilization of inpatient services. We also believe that such a requirement will help to ensure continuity of care and appropriate service utilization for patients who have had intermittent inpatient mental hospital services. Furthermore, such a requirement is consistent with requirements for comprehensive assessments of medical status and needs under the early and periodic screening, diagnosis and treatment benefit available to individuals under the age of 21. A State must consider at risk of requiring inpatient mental health services at least those eligible individuals who are in the following categories: those who are applicants for inpatient mental health facilities, those determined to need inpatient mental health services on an EPSDT screen or preadmission screening and annual resident review (PASARR), and those discharged from an inpatient mental health facility, during the year following discharge. A State may include other groups of eligible individuals who it believes are at risk of needing inpatient treatment in the near future. For eligible individuals who have been identified based on an EPSDT screen or a PASARR, a State may adopt as its assessment or comprehensive service plan the results of these other reviews if those reviews are sufficient to meet the requirements specified in §441.45.
