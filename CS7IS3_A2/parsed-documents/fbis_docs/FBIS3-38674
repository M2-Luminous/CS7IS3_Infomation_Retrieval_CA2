[Ruehe] It is not easy, but it is a good task. In particular, concerning our identity, we have made great progress. Two years ago there was not a single Bundeswehr soldier in Cambodia, in Somalia, in the Adriatic, or on the aircraft that fly to Sarajevo. This means that today the Bundeswehr is fulfilling new tasks, it is psychologically strengthened. Its identity is also strengthened in national defense, defense of the alliance as well as new international tasks. What is lacking again and again is money. Things have been very unpredictable regarding our funds. They have become less and less, and this has upset our plans again and again. [passage omitted] [Staisch] If in the future we approach similar peacekeeping and peacemaking projects, what else is the United Nations to do if it cannot provide the framework, if the supraglobal structures are actually the decisive factor? [Ruehe] Yes, the United Nations can do a great deal. For example, Cambodia was a greater success, but the United Nations did not go there until after there was a peace treaty. Moreover, it has to be said that if the groups concerned do not want peace, then the United Nations will be unable to help either. That is, the will of those involved to achieve peace is decisive. If two countries or groups come and say we want peace, but we need someone to help us because we haven't the confidence, then the United Nations can help. But in Yugoslavia, for example, it can also be seen that when hatred prevails, when peace is not really wanted, the UN scope comes to an end. Then one can give humanitarian aid, but not really solve a conflict. [Staisch] Could it be the case that the United Nations has simply been overestimated as a result of the events during the Gulf War in 1990-91, because it worked there somehow, as a result of the American mediation. [Ruehe] That was a very different situation. In organizational terms, that was completely in the hands of the Americans, on behalf of the United Nations, so to speak, whereas in Somalia we had what is at present an international army, which has been put together without a really unified command and without knowing who would really come and at what time. It is therefore not comparable. In Yugoslavia, there is of course the combination of civil war and conflict between states. That is a very different situation from that in the context of Kuwait and Iraq. But it may indeed be that there were illusions about what the United Nations could achieve because of what was experienced at that time. The United Nations has a very important task in the future, but, as I said, there must be a close examination of where it is being overstretched and what path should be taken -- I have hinted at one, the way things are done in Europe -- so as to solve conflicts with the United Nations. [passage omitted] [Staisch] Minister, taking action in Bosnia-Herzegovina if the United Nations wants it: If the roof of the world, so to speak, gives its blessing, NATO can intervene. What is the German role in particular? What can we, the Germans, do in that region, bearing in mind our historical legacy? [Ruehe] I have always said that German soldiers out there would be a part of the problem and not part of a solution. We want to solve problems. The international community understands this. The past is still with us. However, we do fly to Sarajevo every day. The soldiers risk their lives. Our planes have been hit, have been shot at several times. We fly three aircraft to Bosnia every night to supply the population with medicine and food. This German contribution is generally recognized. We take the same risks as others -- this is new. There have been specific threats against German aircraft from the Serb side and we have always gone when the others have, despite the dangers. I am very proud of what the Air Force has achieved there. [passage omitted] [Staisch] We have looked in different ways at the Bundeswehr's new international role. At home, the money is becoming tighter and tighter. SPD [Social Democratic Party] Secretary General Werner Hoyer has accused you and all those responsible of having no concept for the future. You must save another 1.25 billion German marks [DM]. The Mauser company is complaining about a drop in orders. [passage omitted] If you take all this together, what is justified criticism, and when do you say it is exaggerated? [Ruehe] Well, one cannot see things as simply as Mr. Hoyer does. One needs financial plans, only then can one make plans for the Bundeswehr. We have had to throw the plans for the Bundeswehr into the trash can twice because there were changes on the financial side. My most important concern has been to secure firm pledges for the Bundeswehr for several years in order to be able to plan things. This has now been disrupted again and that is why this hit us very hard. The pain barrier has been surpassed. The Bundeswehr is underfunded and that means, in its current size, its structure cannot be maintained with the funds available. Therefore, I have said I will now propose strategic plans for development over the next few years, independent of the fact that this year we will have to make tough savings in all areas. In doing this I cannot orient myself by the needs of enterprises, I must ask myself what is absolutely necessary from a military point of view, I must safeguard the core abilities of the Bundeswehr. I would like to add something else. The most important task of the last few years, besides taking on new international tasks, was to develop the Armed Forces of the unified state. This may have been the Bundeswehr's greatest achievement of all. Nowhere else is Germany growing together faster than in the Armed Forces. Directly and indirectly, we spend about DM5 billion in the eastern states. If you want, these are not expenses for military reasons. I could say, for instance, we will leave our aircraft in places that have the most modern airports in Germany. Then they would all remain in western Germany. An aircraft takes only three minutes to get to Eastern Germany to maintain security, but we would not have a uniform air force. It would not be the armed forces of a unified state. [passage omitted]
