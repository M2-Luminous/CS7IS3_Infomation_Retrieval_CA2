FR941116-2-00126 FR941116-2-00095 Wednesday November 16, 1994 Part V Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service Biotechnology Risk Assessment Research Grants Program; Fiscal Year 1995; Solicitation of Applications; Notice Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 220␣/␣Wednesday, November 16, 1994␣/␣Notices DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Agricultural Research Service COOPERATIVE STATE RESEARCH, EDUCATION, AND EXTENSION SERVICE Biotechnology Risk Assessment Research Grants Program; Fiscal Year 1995; Solicitation of Applications Purpose Proposals are invited for competitive grant awards under the Biotechnology Risk Assessment Research Grants Program (the ``Program'') for fiscal year 1995. The authority for the Program is contained in section 1668 of Public Law 101&hyph;624 (the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990, 7 U.S.C. 5921). The Program is administered by the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service (CSREES) and the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. (The CSREES was established by Pub. L. 103&hyph;354, the Federal Crop Insurance Reform and Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994, and the functions of the Cooperative State Research Service were transferred to the CSREES by the Secretary of Agriculture's Memorandum 1010&hyph;1.) The purpose of the Program is to assist Federal regulatory agencies in making science-based decisions about the safety of introducing genetically modified plants, animals, and microorganisms into the environment. The Program accomplishes this purpose by providing scientific information derived from the risk assessment research conducted under it. Research proposals submitted to the Program must be applicable to the purpose of the Program to be considered. Proposals based upon field research and whole organism-population level studies are strongly encouraged. Awards will not be made for clinical trials, commercial product development, product marketing strategies, or other research not appropriate to risk assessment. Proposals should be applicable to current regulatory issues surrounding the ecological impacts of genetically modified organisms, with special emphasis on natural ecosystem consequences. Applicant Eligibility Proposals may be submitted by any United States public or private research or educational institution or organization. Available Funding The amount available for support of the Program in fiscal year 1995 is approximately $1.7 million. Pursuant to Section 712 of Public Law 103&hyph;330 (the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1995), funds available in fiscal year 1995 to pay indirect costs on research grants awarded competitively by CSREES may not exceed 14 per centum of the total Federal funds provided under each award. In addition, pursuant to Sec. 719(b) of Public Law 103&hyph;330, in the case of any equipment or product that may be authorized to be purchased with the funds provided under this Program, entities are encouraged to use such funds to purchase only American-made equipment or products. Program Description Under the Program, USDA will competitively award research grants to support science-based biotechnology regulation and thus help address concerns about the effects of introducing genetically modified organisms into the environment and to help regulators develop policies concerning such introduction. Proposals are invited in the area of biotechnology risk assessment research as appropriate to agricultural plants, animals and microbes. Emphasis will be given to risk assessment research involving genetically modified organisms, but model systems using nongenetically modified organisms also will be considered if they can provide information that could lead to improved assessment of potential risks associated with the introduction of genetically modified organisms into the environment. Proposals will be evaluated by the Administrator assisted by a peer panel of scientists for science quality, relevance for current regulatory issues, and intent to advance the safe application of biotechnology to agriculture by providing new knowledge for science-based regulatory decisions. The development of better risk assessment methods for field testing genetically modified organisms will also be considered.
