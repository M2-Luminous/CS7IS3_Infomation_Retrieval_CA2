Party leader Gen. Constand Viljoen said in Bethlehem last night that international involvement was a safeguard that would be used to put pressure on a future government to respect agreements. Peter Theron filed this report: [Begin recording] [Theron] The meeting in Bethlehem was the beginning of the Freedom Front election campaign in the [Orange] Free State. Gen. Viljoen told the large crowd of people in the town hall he believed the election should be postponed to ensure kwaZulu's participation, and allowed time for unity among the right wing. He remained confident that substantial support for a volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland] would be obtained in the election. [Viljoen, in Afrikaans] I think we will get enough people, enough numbers through provincial votes to prove that there is sufficient support [for a volkstaat]. [end recording]
