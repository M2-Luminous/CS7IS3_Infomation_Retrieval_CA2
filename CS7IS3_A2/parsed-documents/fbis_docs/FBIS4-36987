Advani, says India should exercise the nuclear option for national security and to prevent any attempt of intimidation of neighbors and superpowers. Addressing the three-day national council meeting of the party in Wadodara this morning, he warned of dangers to the country arising out of, what he termed, the U.S. tilt toward Pakistan. Mr. Advani also alleged that the policies of the Narasimha Rao government will affect both the economic and security interest of the nation. The BJP president said behind the nonproliferation initiative of the United States is the assumption that India must subcontract its national security to Washington. He said western influences, particularly American interests, shape the debate on nuclear arms and missile system. Mr. Advani said his party is opposed to the globalization policies of the government. He called for a reversal of the priorities and said that foreign trade and investment should only be useful supplements to national effort. More than 300 delegates are attending the national council session which began this morning. Prominent leaders attending the meeting include Mr. Atal Behari Vajpayee and Mr. Murli Manohar Joshi.
