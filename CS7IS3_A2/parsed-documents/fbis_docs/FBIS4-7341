At a mass rally held in Wonsan, a port city of culture and recreation on the East Coast, on April 23, the speakers said that the South Korean rulers had dumped into the sea nuclear waste amounting to 11,000 trillion becquerels, heavily destroying resources and causing women to give birth to deformed babies. They bitterly condemned nuclear waste dumping as an anti-national, anti-human criminal act which can be committed only by those indifferent to the existence of the nation and heedless of international law. The speakers at a mass rally held in Nampo, a port city on the West Coast, on April 26 said that the Korean people would never tolerate the heinous crimes of the Kim Yong-sam group reducing even the seas to a nuclear dumping ground, not contented with covering the whole land of the South with nuclear weapons of outside forces. They stressed that all the compatriots at home and abroad will wage a more vigorous anti-U.S., anti-war, anti-nuke struggle to check nuclear waste dumping by the South Korean puppet clique and make the Korean peninsula a nuclear-free, peace zone without the danger of war.
