He explained: We are talking about a deputy minister, not about a government minister. I think, he added, there will be no problem. Besides, they are citizens too and have a right to participate in the country's political life. When asked about the policy to demilitarize society, he said he agrees with it, although he noted that we are already a civilian society where the Army always plays an important role. Meanwhile, Adolfo Reyes, the person in charge of security matters, has said he believes the presidential decision to appoint an officer to the post of deputy government minister is adequate but contrasts with recommendations from UN human rights experts. Christian Tomuschat and Monica Pinto, of the United Nations, have recommended that civilian authorities lead civilian security corps, something adhered to by the previous administration, he said. Reyes explained this was a presidential order exercising a sovereign right in an effort to find suitable ways to fight crime. Reyes stated: It looks like this is the time for the military to occupy some positions. This decision must be respected. Reyes said that differences must not be established among Guatemalans based on their professions because what is important is respect for human rights and constitutional public order. Reyes confirmed he had resigned from his post. He submitted his resignation to new Government Minister Danilo Parrinello and to President Ramiro de Leon Carpio because the leave of absence granted him by the Bank of Guatemala expires on 15 April. If he does not resign now, this leave would be extended another year. Reyes said Danilo Parrinello and de Leon Carpio asked him to stay on the job, but he admitted that it would be difficult to remain in this post because I did not help draft the security plan for which they will be responsible. Reyes noted that today, he and the goverment minister will go to the Bank of Guatemala to talk to the bank's president, Willy Zapata, about the possibility of Reyes continuing as an adviser on public security issues.
