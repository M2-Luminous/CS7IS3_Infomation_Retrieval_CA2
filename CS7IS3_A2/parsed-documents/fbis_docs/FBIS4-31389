This has confirmed our good interstate relations, but has also opened up the possibility to extend overall economic cooperation between the two countries. The Romanian prime minister and members of the Romanian state delegation also met Croatian President Franjo Tudjman. President Tudjman and Romanian Prime Minister Vacaroiu had talks about political relations between the two countries, the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Croatia's occupied areas. They dwelled in particular on efforts made by the two countries and the international community with regard to achieving a negotiated end to the conflicts as soon as possible, and fully reintegrating Croatia'a occupied areas into the state and legal system of the Republic of Croatia. In addition, Prime Minister Vacaroiu briefed President Tudjman on the talks being conducted between the Romanian delegation and Croatian officials and businessmen, and also on contracts about to be signed. The possibilities and stimuli to the extension of comprehensive cooperation, particularly economic, were the main topics of the concluding round of talks between representatives of the Croatian and Romanian Governments. On the occasion, proposals were supported for setting up joint commissions and contact groups, which will be tasked with considering the establishment of larger-scale forms of economic cooperation. This refers to the founding of mixed enterprises and joint participation in third markets, and also to the conclusion of treaties on free trade between the two countries. Transport, ferrous metallurgy, shipbuilding, the power industry, and almost all branches of light industry were highlighted as areas of particular interest. The Romanian partners are particularly interested in our experience in the operations of the free zone in the port of Rijeka. The first step in widening cooperation was made by signing three important interstate treaties: on maritime transport, on stimulating and protecting joint investments, and on cooperation in health and medical science. Both prime ministers, following the official talks, stressed the friendly relations between the two countries and the importance of the signed treaties toward the development of comprehensive cooperation in the areas of science, education, culture, and sport. Prime Minister Valentic stressed that these negotiations have opened the way to full economic cooperation, adding: [Begin Valentic recording] Romania is a large country in central and eastern Europe, and an important factor for peace and stability in Europe. Therefore, we believe that good and friendly relations between Croatia and Romania will make a considerable contribution toward peace in the entire region. We have accepted with great pleasure an invitation by the president to visit Romania, and we have set a date in September, when the Croatian Government is to send its delegation, including a large number of businessmen, to visit Bucharest. [end recording] The Romanian prime minister stressed that his talks with President Tudjman, Prime Minister Valentic, and Croatian businessmen were very sincere, and that a mutually expressed wish for even better cooperation in all areas would soon be realized. Vacaroiu added that the Romanian Government wishes to intensify its presence in resolving the crisis on the territory of former Yugoslavia through political means, and that it urges the observance of borders of the newly created states in this area. Romania, according to him, wishes to join the reconstruction of war-ravaged areas of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Both prime ministers announced that interstate treaties on the avoidance of double taxation and on cooperation between chambers of economy are being drawn up. These documents are likely to be signed during the aforementioned visit by the Croatian delegation to Romania.
