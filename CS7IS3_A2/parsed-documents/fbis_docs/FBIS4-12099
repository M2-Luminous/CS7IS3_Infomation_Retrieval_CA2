Close to 70 percent of the issues have been finalized, and the sides plan to conclude the remaining 30 percent in the sessions scheduled to begin tomorrow. Our economic affairs correspondent Shlomi Stein reports: [Begin recording] [Stein] There has been a turning point in the Israeli position: Attainment of the economic accord is no longer a prerequisite for the signing of a comprehensive agreement with the Palestinians. Commenting on the need to conclude all outstanding issues before signing the agreement, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin sounded less categorical this morning. [Rabin] The least we need is a macro framework -- which must also be included in the agreement -- or temporary arrangements, which we could implement until a full economic accord is attained. [Stein] In previous rounds, Israel presented to the Palestinians a 40-page draft accord, 70 percent of which has already been worked out and finalized with the Palestinians. Finance Minister Avraham Shohat noted today that his ministry has drafted a contingency plan in the event that Israel evacuates Gaza and Jericho before attaining a full economic accord and no longer has full influence over what is done in the field. [Shohat] We have worked out an alternative, which we will present to the Palestinians. In practical terms, it is a one-sided move because it does not stem from an agreement on cooperation. [Stein] Shohat voiced cautious optimism today, on the eve of his departure for Paris at the head of the Israeli delegation. [end recording]
