[Lamassoure] The real situation is different. With average customs duties of 6 percent, the European market was already largely open. Now the others have agreed to open up and bow to the rules of international trade. Take the example of South Korea. It is a country with a population four times that of Greece and with the same standard of living. South Korea, which had customs duties of 50 percent, has agreed to reduce them by 40 percent! And it has just bought the TGV [high-speed train] from us. Our companies have benefited greatly from the European Common Market because two-thirds of our exports are now to the European Union [EU], as against only 5 percent to the Asian countries. However, in the next 10 years, half of world growth will be in this region of the world. It is here that the new markets are to be won, and hence new sources of jobs for France. [Fulda] Is that not likely to result in job losses in France? [Lamassoure] Some jobs will disappear, but many more will be created. We must decide whether, like the Germans, the Italians, the Americans, and the others, we accept progress, or whether our objective is to make France a new Albania. At all events, increases in productivity and the emergence of new products are inevitable. In 1985, our exports represented 5 percent of world trade; in 1994, we are nearing 7 percent, an absolute record for 50 years! We have absolutely nothing to fear from world economic competition provided it is carried out in conditions which guarantee fair competition. [Fulda] With regard to your second objective -- the restoration of peace on the European continent -- are you satisfied? [Lamassoure] With regard to the restoration of peace, two important things have been started. First, the division of roles between Europe and the United States with regard to the security of the continent has been revised to take account of the new sources of instability which have emerged on our continent. Second, the beginnings of a common EU foreign policy have been established. Of course, these are only the beginnings, but Europe now exists as a diplomatic player. In the Yugoslav crisis, for the past year, it is at the initiative of France and Europe that all the Security Council resolutions have been adopted, and it is the EU's peace plan which is now the only undisputed basis for an overall settlement to the quagmire in the former Yugoslavia. Another example: At Edouard Balladur's initiative, the EU has decided to organize a conference on stability covering the whole of the European continent. It is an exercise in preventive diplomacy aimed at urging the European countries which have problems with good neighborly relations to sit down at a table, either bilaterally or in a regional framework, with European mediation. [passage omitted] [Fulda] To what extent will the government be involved in the European election campaign? What will your role as European affairs minister be? [Lamassoure] It is primarily the majority's union list, i.e., that of Valery Giscard d'Estaing's [UDF--French Democratic Union] and Jacques Chirac's [RPR -- Rally for the Republic] parties, which will lead the campaign. It is therefore for these parties to decide on the campaign. In this respect, the government, which supports the list headed by Dominique Baudis, welcomes the threefold agreement reached by the UDF and RPR: agreement on the program; agreement to sit in the same group in Brussels; and agreement on a single union list headed by Dominique Baudis. As far as I am concerned, I intend to play an educational role throughout this campaign, to explain the real choices facing us. For instance, today, it is no longer a question of whether or not we must open up our trade borders -- this has been an established fact for 30 years -- but of examining how we can open up other countries' borders with a view to creating new jobs in France. I will try to show where the real issues lie. [Fulda] What do you think of Philippe de Villiers list, which is being presented as the majority's "other list?" [Lamassoure] The Maastricht battle is over. The radically new problem is whether, and how, a political Europe of 24 states can be made to work. Dare we hope that this campaign will be something other than a purely domestic debate in which attempts would be made to settle scores within each political family on a European pretext?
