Working-level negotiators are expected to meet on financial services as they are scheduled to meet again for insurance talks, the Finance Ministry official told reporters on condition of anonymity. Financial service talks kicked off in Paris earlier this month. The U.S. is urging Japan to allow investment advisory firms to enter the Japanese pension market and to ease regulations on the securities business. The official said, "It's still not a matter of making progress" as the talks have just started.
