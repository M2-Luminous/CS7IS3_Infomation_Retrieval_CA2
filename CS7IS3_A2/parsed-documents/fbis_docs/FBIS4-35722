He noted that any Arab and Islamic troops operating within the UN forces would be welcomed by his country, particularly after the withdrawal of some European troops from Bosnia. Ljubijankic expected peace keeping troops from Pakistan, Malaysia, and Turkey to arrive in Bosnia. Speaking at a news conference on the sidelines of the nonaligned foreign ministers' meeting currently being held in Cairo, Ljubijankic added that Bosnia had been reluctant to accept a comprehensive cease-fire for fear that the Serbs might use the truce to legalize their occupation of Bosnian territory and impose a fait-accompli by force. He pointed out that Bosnia's acceptance of the European peace plan is conditional on ascertaining that the refugees who fled war-stricken Bosnian cities would return home. He added: Their return is one of our main conditions for accepting the plan. Their return would mean a rejection of the tendency to acquire territory by force, he added, noting that the return of Muslim refugees to their homes would solve the problem. Asked about the prospects for the survival of the federation between Muslims and Croats in Bosnia, he said that there are cooperation and long-standing common interests between the two sides, even if there is no love lost between them. He noted that this federation is a new development in the Bosnian war that has been proposed by the United States, and it is a good idea. He added: We have prepared everything on paper, but what counts is the actual implementation on the ground. On his expectations about the chances that peace may be established in Bosnia in what is left of 1994, the Bosnian foreign minister said that officials would be happy if peace were achieved by the end of the year. But he expressed his belief that it is hard to persuade Serbia to conclude a peace agreement because its policy is based on the annexation of territory, and it is very difficult for the Serbs to give up this policy. He added that he hopes to meet with a reasonable Serbian official with whom he could talk. Noting that peace can be achieved with any degree of justice, he ruled out the possibility of achieving peace during this year. The Bosnian official praised the efforts of the Nonaligned Movement in resolving the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. He added that in the future his country will seek to gain full membership in the movement, noting that it is attending the current conference as a guest.
