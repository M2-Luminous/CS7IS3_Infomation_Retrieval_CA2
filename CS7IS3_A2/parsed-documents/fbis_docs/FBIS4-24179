The spokesman said the fighting was going on around an area adjacent to Gezira Beach and near Madina hospital. The spokesman said that by launching the flagrant attacks, the SNA had broken the UN-brokered cease-fire agreement signed in March 1992 by the two USC factions and the SNA in order to bring peace to Mogadishu, the Addis Ababa agreement of 22 March 1993, the Hirab community agreement stipulating no further civil war and the Nairobi agreement to which 15 Somali organizations were signatories. The spokesman wishes to inform officials of UN Operation in Somalia II, the USC communities, the Alliance of 12 [Somali Salvation Alliance, headed by Ali Mahdi Mohamed], and the peace-loving Somali people that the SNA has broken the peace agreement, and adds that the SNA will be held responsible for any problems arising from the fighting it has sparked off. In light of the fighting, the spokesman has called on those forces fighting for the defense of Somalia's honor and sovereignty to be extra alert and to prepare to counter the SNA's provocation and aggression. Listeners, we will communicate to you any new developments in our later bulletins.
