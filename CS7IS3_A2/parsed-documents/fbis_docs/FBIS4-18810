Tansu Ciller visited Democratic Left Party leader Bulent Ecevit in the latter's office in parliament in order to hear his views and proposals regarding the economic stability program. She pointed out that the country has serious problems that piled up over the years. We were forced to take certain measures to overcome them, she said, adding that similar problems emerge in other countries as well. [Begin Ciller recording] There might be people who think that the type of measures we are taking could be different. However, we all have the same basic aims and desires: the prosperity of our people, to open the way for this prosperity, to prevent blocking economic progress before the country, to create more jobs for our youths in the future, to enable investments, to prevent the stopping of growth, to prevent a three-digit and eventually a four-digit inflation. [end recording] Ciller said that she will hear Ecevit's views on the economic stability program and on the installations in Zonguldak. We will benefit from these views most extensively, she said. Ecevit said that the economy is going through the most difficult period in the history of the republic. He stressed that the burden must be shared justly. He said he will explain his views specifically and as positively as possible to the prime minister, and that he will posit his criticism and proposals. [Begin Ecevit recording] Turkey is growing fast as far as its population growth and social dynamism are concerned. We are concerned, however, that the economic measures being taken might cause problems in the economy in the future. Specifically slowing down production, preventing new investments, and restricting current investments might cause certain problems for a country whose population growth is about 2.17 percent. [end recording] Ecevit pointed out that the Karabuk Iron and Steel Works can be made much more productive by means of certain additional investments, and that it would not be right to completely close the Zonguldak Coal Works. After the 90-minute meeting, Ciller said that she got what she hoped for from her search for a social consensus for the economic stability package. She said that she is briefing all the sectors of the society on the package and continuing to carry it out without changing the aims of the program. She pointed out that she listened to Ecevit's views who also posited some good proposals. We will study these proposals, she said. Replying to a question on the workers' reaction, Ciller stressed that she is open to dialogue. We will eliminate all misunderstandings, she said. [Begin Ciller recording] As I said, before, the aim is the prosperity of the Turkish people. We were forced to take certain measures. We took them. While implementing them, we will discuss them with everyone. [end recording] In a statement after the meeting, Ecevit said that by making promises left, right, and center before the elections, the parties put both themselves and the country in a difficult positions. The people are now being asked to pay the price for this negative process, he said. Ecevit stressed that the coal mines and the iron and steel industry are of strategic importance for Turkey's independence. He added that he told the prime minister that it would be very wrong to entirely close the Zonguldak Coal Mines and the Karabuk Iron and Steel Works.
