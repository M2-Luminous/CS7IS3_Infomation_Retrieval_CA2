One immediately becomes aware of the great humility of this man, a main player in an international drama. This humility is mixed with a sense of confidence and conviction, a product of years of intense internal as well as external struggle. In a low but firm voice, he methodically expresses the hope that someday, ideally soon, he will be able to return as president of Haiti, and that his return will be accompanied by democracy. [EL TIEMPO] As you know, Colombian President Cesar Gaviria was elected OAS secretary general as a result of, among other things, Haiti's vote. How do you perceive the OAS' participation in the situation in your country? [Aristide] What is taking place in Haiti goes much further than national borders and directly touches the soul of the continent. The OAS has a critical role to play, and so far, it has fortunately played a very positive role. There must be a political willingness and a commitment for reestablishing democracy, however. This is not easy because the OAS is not an institution with the prospects and freedom to force the coupists into honoring what they said they were going to do in the Governors Island Agreement. Along with this, we are in a race against time because each time sanctions are strengthened more strains are placed on the Haitian people. [EL TIEMPO] Do you have an agenda for resolving the situation, and what steps do you believe should be taken? [Aristide] The entire world is certainly more powerful than the coupists. And yet, there still is no political willingness because if an embargo existed, the wait would have been shortened. As long as we continue to move along with an embargo that is not a complete embargo, suffering is going to continue for long time. The presence of ships could be used to transmit messages on short and medium-wave radios to communicate with soldiers, poor people, students, and liberal Haitian citizens. We should give them the necessary information to unite and recover the security that prevailed in the country for seven months. During that time, refugees did not flee from Haiti; we fought poverty and human misery, and we worked with dignity. Democracy is built through the people and by respecting human dignity. [EL TIEMPO] Do you still believe it is necessary to remove the Haitian military leaders in an effort to find a solution? [Aristide] That is the only way. The coupists are holding the Army and the country captive. In Haiti, there is one soldier for every 1,000 Haitians, while there is only one doctor for every 10,000 Haitians. Less than 1 percent of the population owns more than 45 percent of the nation's wealth. This is why we have an illiteracy rate of 85 percent. Because of this situation, the population understands the need for an embargo. Even though they have seen that the Army is making money from the embargo, they are still demanding the implementation of a complete embargo because they know that sooner or later the coupists will have to do something about it. [EL TIEMPO] Is it true that the military leaders who are in power are drug traffickers? [Aristide] Are you asking me if they are drug traffickers? (Aristide laughs) More than $1.2 billion enters Haiti from drug trafficking, which represents a danger for Haiti and for the United States. If we want to protect the families in both countries, we must remove the traffickers who are in power. [EL TIEMPO] What is your opinion regarding the current situation in the Dominican Republic, and how could Balaguer's possible reelection change this? [Aristide] I believe we must talk to the Dominican Republic on how to enforce the sanctions. If the United States categorically expresses its political willingness to respect the agreements, and if the UN and the OAS do the same, I do not believe there will be any problem for that country in applying the sanctions. [EL TIEMPO] Do you still consider the Governors Island Agreement the basis for a resolution to the crisis? [Aristide] Yes, because it has not yet been complied with. [EL TIEMPO] Would you support military intervention in Haiti? [Aristide] This would be problematic because Haiti's Constitution prohibits military intervention. The Governors Island Agreement, however, contains provisions for the presence of international observers to help reconstruct the country, separate the police from the Army, and create a fair legal system, one without impunity. This would have to be done with international cooperation. [EL TIEMPO] Some sectors of the U.S. Congress have tried to discredit you by claiming that you are mentally unstable. How do you view this position by the U.S. right? [Aristide] First, I have a psychology degree and I understand quite well what tarnishing a person's reputation entails. Second, it would only take reading my three books to know my beliefs well. Third, a racist policy and a cynical attitude prevails in the United States. When Haitians and Cubans are on the same boat, as I have seen on television myself, Cubans are allowed to continue while Haitians are turned back. This is a racist policy. [EL TIEMPO] Considering that you do not have a majority in the Haitian parliament, do you believe that conditions exist to build a coalition that would enable you to govern if you are indeed returned to power? [Aristide] That I do not have a majority in the government cannot truly be asserted. Two-thirds of the Senate and more than 30 deputies attended a conference we organized in Miami. More than 65 percent of Haitians voted for me, and they are still committed to such a degree that 31 months after the coup d'etat, they are still demonstrating. In this context, I believe that currently more than 65 percent of the population supports the democratization process. In the parliament, there is a majority that cannot voice their opinion because they have rifles pointed at their heads. Many members of parliament have gone into hiding in order to survive. In this sense, it is the power of the coupists' weapons that rules the country. I am convinced that once the coupists withdraw, we will free the Army and the country and create unity and justice. [EL TIEMPO] Some people view you as part of the problem rather than part of the solution. Have you considered the possibility of withdrawing from the process to facilitate a solution in Haiti? [Aristide] This view is part of that cynical attitude. The truth is that after 31 months, currently more than 65 percent of the population is still fighting for the return of democracy. With this in mind, our fight is irreversible. We believe in humanity and surrendering would be a lack of respect for those who sacrificed their lives.
