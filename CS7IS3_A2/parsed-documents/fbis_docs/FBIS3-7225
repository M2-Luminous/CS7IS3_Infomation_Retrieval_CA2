In response, Japanese automakers and other manufacturers are perplexed at the U.S. request. "In the past, Toyota Motor Corporation and Honda Motor Company announced their plans to increase the share of foreign-made semiconductors in their purchase of semiconductors to 20 percent by 1993. In fact, however, this year's share of foreign-made semiconductors in the purchase of semiconductors by the entire Japanese automobile sector is expected to fall to 8 percent" (according to an official concerned at the Semiconductor Industry Association). This prospect is believed to have prompted the U.S. side to make the request at the Japan-U.S. semiconductor talks. The Japanese automakers are taking a different view, however. They are rebuffing the U.S. request, claiming that "the share of foreign-made semiconductors in our purchase of chips is supposed to have already reached 20 percent" (says a senior official of Toyota Motor Corporation). Motorola, Texas Instruments, and other American chip makers have admitted that the purchase of foreign microchips by the Japanese automakers has been steadily increasing. Game machine makers are responding the same way. The share of foreign chips in Nintendo Company's purchase of semiconductors in 1993 was 21.3 percent and the share of foreign semiconductors in the total purchase of chips by Sega Enterprises is said to be hovering around 16-23 percent.
