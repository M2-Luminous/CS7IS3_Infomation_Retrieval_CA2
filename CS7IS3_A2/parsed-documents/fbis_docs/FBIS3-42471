This past autumn the Army discharged at the same time those men who had served 18 months and those 24 months, a situation that could have brought on a disaster in the form of a virtually total loss of combat capability, if the call-up were unsuccessful. This would hold true for Army large units proper and for the other Armed Forces in Russia (MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs], Border Troops, etc.). Therefore, the abovementioned undesirable event was prevented and the Army manpower stabilized. The Army's average strength presently consists of conscripts in the amount of 54 percent, while in especially important, elite large units (VDV [Airborne Troops], strategic nuclear triad), this figure runs at 70 to 90 percent. The present call-up plan is 73 percent fulfilled. This, however, is not the final tally, since students about to graduate from tekhnikums and PTU's [professional and technical schools], who were granted the opportunity to undergo accelerated instruction for the purpose of earning their diploma, will be called up for induction into the service as far in the future as April. The poorest situation obtains in the case of manpower of the Russian troops stationed in foreign countries. The General Staff has virtually ceased sending replacements to Germany and the Baltics, whence troop withdrawal is nearing completion, and to the Dniester area, where, in the words of Mikhail Kolesnikov, "Army Commander Lebed persists in causing us problems." The Troop Grouping in the Transcaucasus (Georgia, Armenia) is receiving a minimum of replacements, and only volunteers, at that, since the Russian General Staff is of the opinion that the situation in that area poses no threat. At the same time the Ministry of Defense is attempting (also on a volunteer basis) to improve the strength of the 201st Division stationed in Tajikistan, the spot that is the "hottest" at the present time. There is a distinct manpower shortage there (the 201st Division consists of slightly more than 5,000 men - P. F.). By and large, on 12 December Russian citizens voted for the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia], communists, and for other ultra-and simply patriotic candidates, but, when it comes to the personal level, they tend to shy away from civil deeds associated with sacrifice, continuing in the General Staff's opinion to employ on a mass scale any means at their disposal to avoid being called up. The Ministry of Defense (working with law enforcement agencies) is taking measures to apprehend deserters, and, in addition, will do all it can to restrict the legal means for obtaining a draft deferment. Also to continue in 1994 is recruitment of professional soldiers: contract servicemen. They presently number somewhat in excess of 120,000 men in the Army (amounting to 10 percent of the total number in the lower grades). In this connection, the 1993 contract servicemen recruitment plan was fulfilled in literally several months. The Ministry of Defense generally did not anticipate such a large number of persons desirous of serving in the Army for money (the minimum pay for a contract private as of 1 January 1994 was 110,000 rubles.) On 18 January President Yeltsin signed a ukase calling for the recruitment of 150,000 additional contract servicemen for 1994. By the beginning of 1995, the General Staff hopes to bring the total number of professional soldiers, including women and personnel in extended service, to 400,000 (to 32 percent of the authorized strength). In addition, the Ministry of Defense officially submitted to the government a proposal calling for additional cuts of the Armed Forces manpower limit to 2 million men to replace the 2.1-million manpower figure that was planned for 1994. As a result, assuming that the call-up will be successful, the manpower needs of the Army, MVD, and Border Troops by the end of the year will be met in the amount of 90 to 95 percent. In that case, all Russian Armed Forces subordinated to the government will assume complete combat readiness, standing, if necessary, fully ready to deal with possible difficulties and conflicts, whether the latter occur on the borders or in nearby countries.
