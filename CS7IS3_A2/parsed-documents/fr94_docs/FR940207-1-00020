FR940207-1-00020 FR940207-1-00002 •An institution accepts a deposit from a consumer to an account the institution previously deemed to be ``closed'' by the consumer New account disclosures are not required when an institution acquires an account through an acquisition of or merger with another institution (but see §230.5(a) regarding advance notice requirements if terms are changed). (a)(2) Requests (a)(2)(i) 1. Inquiries versus requests. A response to an oral inquiry (by telephone or in person) about rates and yields or fees does not trigger the duty to provide account disclosures. However, when a consumer asks for written information about an account (whether by telephone, in person, or by other means), the institution must provide disclosures. 2. General requests. When a consumer generally asks for information about a type of account (a NOW account, for example), an institution that offers several variations may provide disclosures for any one of them. 3. Timing for response. Ten business days is a reasonable time for responding to a request for account information that a consumer does not make in person. (a)(2)(ii)(B) 1. Term. Describing the maturity of a time account as ``1 year'' or ``6 months,'' for example, illustrates a response stating the maturity of a time account as a term rather than a date (``January 10, 1995''). (b) Content of Account Disclosures (b)(1) Rate information (b)(1)(i) Annual Percentage Yield and Interest Rate 1. Rate disclosures. In addition to the interest rate and annual percentage yield, a periodic rate corresponding to the interest rate may be disclosed. No other rate or yield (such as ``tax effective yield'') is permitted. If the annual percentage yield is the same as the interest rate, institutions may disclose a single figure but must use both terms. 2. Fixed-rate accounts. To disclose the period of time the interest rate will be in effect, institutions may state the maturity date for fixed-rate time accounts that pay the opening rate until maturity. (See Appendix B, B&hyph;7_Sample Form.) For other fixed-rate accounts, institutions may disclose a date (such as ``This rate will be in effect through June 30, 1994'') or a period (such as ``This rate will be in effect for at least 30 days''). 3. Tiered-rate accounts. Each interest rate, along with the corresponding annual percentage yield for each specified balance level (or range of annual percentage yields, if appropriate), must be disclosed for tiered-rate accounts. (See Appendix A, Part I, Paragraph D.) 4. Stepped-rate accounts. A single annual percentage yield must be disclosed for stepped-rate accounts. (See Appendix A, Part I, Paragraph B.) However, the interest rates and the period of time each will be in effect also must be provided. When the initial rate offered on a variable-rate account is higher or lower than the rate that would otherwise be paid on the account, the calculation of the annual percentage yield must be made as if for a stepped-rate account. (See Appendix A, Part I, Paragraph C.) (b)(1)(ii) Variable Rates (b)(1)(ii)(B) 1. Determining interest rates. To disclose how the interest rate is determined, institutions must: •Identify the index and specific margin, if the interest rate is tied to an index •State that rate changes are solely within the institution's discretion, if the institution does not tie changes to an index (b)(1)(ii)(C) 1. Frequency of rate changes. Institutions that reserve the right to change rates at any time must state that fact. (b)(1)(ii)(D) 1. Limitations. A floor or ceiling on rates or on the amount the rate may decrease or increase during any time period must be disclosed. Institutions need not disclose the absence of limitations on rate changes.
