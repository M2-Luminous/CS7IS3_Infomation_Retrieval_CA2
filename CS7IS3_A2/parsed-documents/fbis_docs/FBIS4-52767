Mr. Lord's complaint was old hat, of course, to Asian countries which are at the receiving end of Washington's increasingly capricious foreign policy. They are already aware that "the sense of optimism and partnership forged in Seattle", when President Bill Clinton seemed genuinely to be moved by the conviction that his country's destiny was linked with the future growth of the Asia-Pacific region, is in danger of being eroded because of the unnecessary squabbles and hamhanded bullying that the US tries to pass off as diplomacy. The intriguing feature is what provoked Mr. Lord to give vent to his frustration at this juncture, and how the letter came to be printed in a Washington newspaper. Leaks are a way of life in Washington, it has been so since the Watergate hearings, useful both as an instrument of vendetta and a means of floating constructive ideas. The trouble with such a weapon for all seasons is that it is not always easy to identify the precise purpose. But it can be assumed that most readers will see Mr. Lord's letter not as a product of the departmental rivalries and personal animosities that are probably rampant in a virtually rudderless administration, but as a plea for clarity and coherence so that Asian nations are not forced into a united front against the US. What this underlines is that US policy has been lacking in purpose and direction in a part of the world that is so vital for American economic regeneration. The State Department spokesman's bland assertion of "excellent" ties with Asian countries, and attempt to blame the press for distorting Mr. Lord's letter, merely avoided the evidence of consistent inconsistency. The most charitable explanation for vacillation is that Mr. Clinton is so consumed by domestic preoccupations and electoral compulsions that he has little time for foreign affairs. Such astounding disinterest at the top may have emboldened certain members of his administration to grind their personal axes at the cost of long-term American interests, as well as global harmony. But the possibility of calculated blow-hot-blow-cold tactics, with trade department militants or crusaders for human rights roped in to do their acts cannot be ruled out, either. Whether the strategy is naive or devious, the end product is the same: instead of winning friends and influencing people, the Clinton administration seems to be alienating one nation after another. Asian countries that value their close economic and security ties with the US find such drift disconcerting. If business is the business of the US, then Asia is its major business partner, today and, even more, tomorrow. The statistics for American trade and investment speak for themselves. Picking quarrels with Asian countries will eventually hurt both sides destroying whatever remains of the spirit of Seattle. It is a worrying thought that the world's only superpower should act so irresponsibly. The "malaise" that Mr. Lord complained of is not confined to relations with Asian countries. Evidence of disoriented initiatives in respect of Somalia, Haiti and Bosnia only compounds concern. The most effective answer to Mr. Lord's indictment would be a firm and coherent policy framework based on a clear vision of America's international role and permanent relationships. Global security demands such an enunciation. If Mr. Clinton fails to respond, he fails the world.
