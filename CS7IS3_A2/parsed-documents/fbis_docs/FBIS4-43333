Once the perception of division gets around, it is extremely difficult to shake off. The Conservative Party must shake it off. Every party has a variety of views over Europe but, if we go on parading them as a great doctrinal divide, then we will go down the road to defeat. So a period of silence from the two extremes of Tony Marlow on the Right and Hugh Dykes on the Left would be welcome. John Major laid down the line for the Tory Party very firmly -- and the party must unite behind him. He wants to see a multi-layered, multi-track, multi-speed Europe. This is not only right, it's popular. That view was expressed in ballot boxes all over Europe. John Major campaigned well and deserved a much better result. In my own constituency in Surrey, the Liberals boasted of a landslide. But we found on the doorstep that John Major's speech had gone down well. We also found that people were fed up with tax increases. Ken Clarke, please note. What his speech expressed was the positive approach to Europe, not the centralist dream of Delors of the all-powerful, bureaucratic and interfering government from Brussels and Strasbourg. The new Europe will be a looser association of nation states. This is not anti-Europe, it is pro-Europe realism. It is now up to the Government to put flesh on these bones. It has the chance to do this in preparing for the Inter-Governmental Conference in 1996. Our approach must be to contain the powers of the European Commission, to resist further qualified majority voting; and not to allow any more powers to be transferred from Westminster to Strasbourg. The multi-layered approach is the heart of subsidiarity. That's the winning ticket. The ultra pro-Europeans in the Conservative Party must not challenge that approach. I hope that Ted Heath will not divide the Tory Party by campaigning against John Major. When he became leader he received the support of Alec Home and Harold Macmillan. More recently, Neil Kinnock fully supported John Smith. It is the job of the elder statesman to support the party leader. The party that is in trouble over Europe is Labour. One of its successful candidates was crowing on television that the Strasbourg Parliament would make Westminster virtually redundant, a minor county council at the best. That, of course, is what Euro-socialism is all about. But that is not in tune with the mood of the country. The reason why the Liberal Democrats did so badly is that people had come to realise they wanted to surrender everything to Europe. They didn't win the Euroseats in which their famed by-election victories of Christchurch, Eastleigh and Newbury are situated. Those Westminster seats will come back to the Conservatives at the next General Election. The Liberal-Democrats' most bitter disappointment was not to win their target seat on the Welsh border of Hereford and Shropshire. There it was Labour that turned out the Conservatives. Mr Ashdown knows that from now on it is downhill all the way for his party. He has to worry most about Tony Blair because Blair is a younger, more intelligent version of himself. Blair will go fishing in Liberal Democrat waters. So what are the Conservatives going to do? First there must be no question of dropping the pilot. John Major should and will remain the leader of the Conservative Party. He has shown a certain dour resilience which is the most important quality to see a ship through a heavy storm. If the Conservative Party went into a contested leadership contest, it would tear itself apart. John Major must lay down the party line more clearly and crisply, exactly as he has done in the Euro-elections. It's up to the party to accept it and back him. He doesn't need to have a General Election until April 1997, which is nearly three years away. That is a very long time in politics. During that time, the Liberal-Democrats will prattle and the Labour Party will rattle. They will be rattled over taxes, rattled over Europe and rattled over the reform of the Welfare State. Mr Blair is going to have to spell out his party's concrete policies for all of these issues. At the moment, Labour's support is boosted by the unpopularity of the Government and the vacuum of Labour's own policies. You do not win General Elections with a vacuum.
