A. The Basic Features of the New RMB Exchange Rate System After the unification of exchange rates, the state also carried out corresponding reforms of the mechanisms of exchange-rate formation and adjustment, adopting a unitary, controlled floating rate system based on market supply and demand. This was an important measure to reform the RMB exchange rate system, a measure which was based on referring to the successful experience of Western developed countries, on international practices, and on a full consideration of the realities in our country. The new RMB exchange rate system has the following several features: 1. Exchange rates based on market supply and demand. This refers to the fact that the supply and demand situation and exchange rate level on the foreign exchange market constitute the main factor determining the RMB exchange rate level after the unification of exchange rates. For instance, the exchange rate for the RMB against the U.S. dollar published by the People's Bank of China on 1 January 1994 was the weighted average price of the U.S. dollar on the major foreign-exchange swap markets nationwide on 31 December 1993. In the future, after the unified standardized interbank foreign exchange market is formed, exchange rates on that market will become the main basis for the exchange rates published by the People's Bank of China. In addition, fluctuations in the exchange rates for the major currencies against the U.S. dollar on the international foreign exchange market are also an important factor determining the exchange rates for those currencies against the RMB. 2. Unitary exchange rates. The exchange rates quoted by each designated foreign exchange bank independently on the basis of the exchange-rate medium prices published by the People's Bank of China and the floating range set by regulations will be applicable to settlements involving foreign exchange and RMB and foreign exchange-RMB exchanges (encompassing trade foreign exchange, nontrade foreign exchange, and capital account activities of earning and spending foreign exchange), and will also be applicable to domestic and foreign-funded enterprises as well as Chinese and foreign nationals. 3. Controlled exchange rates. This is mainly manifested in the macro-regulation and -supervision of RMB exchange rates exercised by the People's Bank of China through the State Administration of Exchange Control; that is, when there occur large exchange-rate fluctuations on the market, the central bank should intervene in the foreign exchange market through releasing or retrieving foreign exchange, so as to keep RMB exchange rates basically stabilized at an appropriate level. 4. Floating exchange rates. This is mainly manifested in two respects: first, the market exchange rates published by the People's Bank of China on a daily basis are floating rates; second, the exchange rates quoted by each designated foreign exchange bank in its foreign exchange transactions with the general public may float within the confines of the market rates published by the People's Bank of China and within the range set by regulations. The new RMB exchange rate system is based on the taking of full account of the existence of the two foreign exchange markets, the domestic and external markets, and is therefore full of vitality; it is certain to further stimulate our country's opening up to the outside world, develop economic and trade cooperation and contacts between our country and countries around the world, and be conducive to giving greater play to RMB exchange rates' role as an economic lever, thereby promoting the overall reform, opening up, and economic development of our country, and will also constitute an important step toward RMB convertibility. The reform of the exchange rate system has been widely welcomed and highly regarded by people of various circles at home and abroad. In addition, because the state has adopted some transitional measures in the transition period, taking full account of the interests of all sectors of society, the transition has been smooth up to this moment. It can be said that the reform of the RMB exchange rate system has been successful. B. RMB Exchange Rates Will Be Kept Stabilized at an Appropriate Level After the unification of exchange rates, some comrades have some doubts, believing that the RMB will devalue in a sustained and significant manner. In my view, such a worry is not well founded. First, the economic strength of a country is the basis for determining the external price (exchange rate) for the national currency. In 1992-1993 our country had the highest economic growth rates in the world for two years in a row; the steady economic growth enabled our country's overall capabilities to climb another step. The major Western developed countries place high hopes on the Chinese economy. At the same time our country has adequate foreign exchange reserves and enjoys a good balance-of-international-payments situation, while foreign debts are being kept below the internationally recognized safety warning line. This is the material foundation for keeping our country's RMB exchange rates stabilized at an appropriate level. Second, in accordance with international practices, our country's central bank will use economic means such as currency and interest rate policy as well as direct intervention in the foreign exchange market to regulate the supply and demand for foreign exchange, so as to maintain relative stability in RMB exchange rates. This is the practice common to all developed countries in regard to exchange rate policy. In fact the central bank's intervention in the foreign exchange swap markets in our country in the second half of 1993 was very successful, not only stabilizing market exchange rates but also accumulating rich experience on intervention in the foreign exchange market. Maintaining basic stability in currencies' domestic as well as external prices has always been the main part of the monetary policy of central banks of various countries. Our country will not be an exception either during the process of establishing the socialist market economic system and enhancing macroeconomic regulation and control. Currently, not only is the RMB very welcome in neighboring countries, but its exchange rates are rising. This can also serve as an important basis for judging the future trend of the RMB in our country.
