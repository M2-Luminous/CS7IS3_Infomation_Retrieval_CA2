FR940812-0-00036 FR940812-0-00010 Regulatory Procedures The Department, even when not required by statute, as a matter of policy generally follows the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) and public comment procedures specified in 5 U.S.C. 553 in the development of its regulations. The APA provides exceptions to its notice and public comment procedures when an agency finds there is good cause for dispensing with such procedures on the basis that they are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest. We have determined that, under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), good cause exists for dispensing with the NPRM and public comment procedures in this case. Good cause exists because this regulation is of a technical nature and involves no discretionary policy. Therefore, opportunity for prior comment is unnecessary, and we are issuing these changes to our regulations as a final rule. Executive Order 12866 This final rule does not meet the criteria for a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order (E.O.) 12866 and, thus, is not subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review under E.O. 12866. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 This regulation imposes no new reporting or recordkeeping requirements subject to OMB clearance. Regulatory Flexibility Act We certify that this regulation, if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because it affects only individuals. Therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysis as provided in Pub. L. 96&hyph;354, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, is not required.
