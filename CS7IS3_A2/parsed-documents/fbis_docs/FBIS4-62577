Security Council resolutions and the return of overthrown president Jean-Bertrand Aristide to the country, head of the Russian Foreign Ministry's information and press department Grigoriy Karasin told a briefing here today. In his words, Russia is concerned over the military junta's proclamation of a member of the Haiti Supreme Court temporary president in evasion of constitutional procedures. "The recent illicit action of the Haiti regime testifies to its unwillingness to listen to the insistent appeals of the international community for restoration of Haiti democratic institutes. It will make more complicated the uneasy achievement of political settlement in Haiti," stressed the Russian diplomat.
