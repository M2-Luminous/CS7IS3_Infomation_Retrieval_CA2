This decision does not respect the citizen's rights, Shaykh Qasim added. Shaykh Qasim urged the officials to reverse their decision and to find the right path to overcome this crisis. He noted that the government must work out the proper legislation. In a statement to AKHBAR AL-YAWM news agency, Shaykh Qasim said that Lebanon is a country of rights and it cannot live without them. We have cooperated with all parties so that peace will prevail and so the logic of one's word and truth will replace the language of arms, Shaykh Qasim said. In his statement, the Hizballah official maintained that the pretexts used are absolutely invalid, because the country's security cannot be jeopardized by a word or a statement. Rather, security is threatened by the tools of destruction. He added: The officials must curb those who disturb the internal situation and do things harmful to the citizens' interests. But to stifle all voices under various pretexts is unacceptable and runs counter to the freedom of expression, which must be enjoyed by all Lebanese citizens. He pointed out that the unanimous denunciation by almost all factions is unequivocal evidence that the cabinet's step is wrong. Shaykh Qasim continued that if this step is a prelude to more stringent steps, the government's monopolization of the radio and television media, or a prelude to restricting the freedom of the press it will have no positive results nor promote freedom and peace in this country. Therefore, no side can impose its opinions on others, not even the authorities backed by the law. This is because the laws and authority in Lebanon are committed to safeguarding the people's freedoms. Shaykh Qasim said that the three-year delay in issuing the law on organizing the media is irrational. He noted that there are various whimsical attitudes to limiting the freedom of expression. Asked whether the officials support freedom of expression in the country, Shaykh Qasim said that many people seek to impose the law of the jungle in which some people would dominate politically, economically, and militarily. These people also want to manipulate the freedoms to enable them gain control. Asked whether the Hizballah deputies would heed his opinion and defend it in the Chamber of Deputies, Shaykh Qasim said: Certainly; because they are committed to defend the party and the people. He expressed readiness to coordinate with all the media.
