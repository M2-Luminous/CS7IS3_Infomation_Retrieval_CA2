I believe that that only required a declaration of secession. Could the secession become legitimate, considering that the prerequisites for the unitary state had been fulfilled and the president acquired legitimacy to govern? Again, I believe that as the unity decision was a free-choice decision and not an arbitrary decision, the secession was also a free-choice decision and any attempt to impose unity by force would require a great miracle to be carried out and sustained. That was the mistake committed by the Yemenis when they resorted to force to settle their differences. The result was complete divorce. The dispute could have continued for one or two years without secession. Internal differences do occur, particularly in a state still trying to speak the same political common laguage. We do not know of any political unity in contemporary Arab history that was imposed by force. We exclude annexation and occupation from this. That is why unity in Yemen would never succeed if the parties resort to force because it would then become a case of hegemony which the locals would resist with force as they did in the past. Some might ask: What about the guarantees offered previously for the fulfillment of unity and reinforcement of the foundations of the unitary state? What happend to these guarantees and how could the Yemeni state's legitimacy be torpedoed? The legal argument is not always enough, and launching a military war is the weakest legal argument. The unitary state agreement was signed by the two leaders and the two presidents personally, both of whom are still alive. Unity was then approved almost unanimously in a public referendum. The third phase came with the recognition of the unitary state by all the states which had previously recognized the two independent states, including the brothers and neighbors. That state took a fourth step towards securing its legitimacy when it lodged its registration papers with the United Nations as one state with one flag, one representative, and unified laws. The war, however, has broken the state's legitimacy and weakened its legal value, regardless of the causes which prompted the armies to act. We should here particularly keep in mind that we are talking about a unitary state on paper. In reality, the two states remained as they were before the unity, with two armies, two currencies, and two regimes. The two sides concentrated on the form, not the substance, of unity. That is why it has taken only two weeks of war to break it, with undeniable popular support. War within a state trying to be one state cannot be the solution, rather a certain cause of division and enmity. That is why we cannot understand why a war has been launched without any logical political concept. War will not make the victor popular because war between brothers would mean an insult to the loser but it would not subjugate the loser because he would see the victor as an occupation force and would therefore resist him as such. War cannot be a cane used to break enough heads to get revenge. War has broken unity, not rectified it.
