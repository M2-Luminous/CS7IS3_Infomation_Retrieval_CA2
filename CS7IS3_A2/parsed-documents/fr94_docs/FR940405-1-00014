FR940405-1-00014 FR940405-1-00004 Paperwork Reduction Act The collection of information contained in the rapid growth rule, which consists of the required written notice of rapid growth, has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq .). The current estimate of annual reporting burden for the collection of information in this regulation is 1,625 burden hours. Rescission of the rapid growth rule would result in a saving of 1,625 burden hours a year. Regulatory Flexibility Act The FDIC's Board of Directors has concluded that the proposed amendment, if adopted, will not impose a significant economic hardship on small institutions. The proposal does not establish any recordkeeping or reporting requirements that necessitate the expertise of specialized accountants, lawyers or managers. The proposal would, in fact, reduce the reporting requirements to which banks are presently subject. Rescinding the rapid growth rule will afford some insured banks the opportunity to conduct activities previously prohibited unless notice were given in accordance with the rule (for instance, the solicitation of fully insured deposits outside a bank's normal trade area, or the acquisition of secured borrowings, including repurchase agreements, such that one or a combination of both activities were designed to increase the bank's assets by more than 7.5 percent during any consecutive three-month period). The FDIC's Board of Directors therefore certifies pursuant to section 605 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605) that the proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq .).
