We may even sympathize with this young couple who rule the White House and wield the helm of world events, or so we think. We understand the nervous pressure and frayed confidence of the strongest man in the world when his job is placed on the line and his position is jeopardized by a scandal that threatens to drown him in Whitewater, a scandal reminiscent of President Nixon's Watergate. We may also sense the influence and see the fingerprints of some U.S. officials who are concerned with the Middle East crisis on Washington's tendencies, policies, statements, and, of course, decisions. Among these officials are Dennis Ross, the chief coordinator; Daniel Kurtzer, deputy assistant secretary of state; Martin Indyk, National Security Council and White House official; and Aaron Miller, Ross's assistant. But there are things that we fail to understand, comprehend, or even imagine and, therefore, find unacceptable and objectionable. For example: -- We fail to understand why President Clinton should try to emerge from his dilemma at the expense of the truth, why he should make an offer for which someone else would foot the bill, and why he should present Jerusalem as a sacrifice at the alter to please certain people, hoping that they may then back him and make the Whitewater affair disappear before it ends his career as Watergate ended Nixon's. -- We find it unacceptable and objectionable that the judge, partner, and mediator should hand down his final verdict in the case before the defense has ended its presentation, before the case is summed up, before the contestants are brought into court, and before the rivals face each other at the negotiating table. -- We object to Clinton's issuing a unilateral decision that undermines the international order, violates the legitimacy of its resolution, and slaps the members of the international community in the face. -- We find it incomprehensible and bewildering that President Clinton should break with his country's tradition and turn his back on its known positions for the past 27 years. That is, from June 1967 until Clinton declared unified Jerusalem as Israel's capital. For 27 years, for more than a quarter of a century -- President Johnson, who instigated, planned, funded, armed, and orchestrated the 1967 aggression, could not declare or state that Jerusalem was Israel's capital; and Presidents Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, and Bush stopped short of what Clinton, all of a sudden and with bizarre timing, did. On the contrary, for a quarter century resolutions were issued, statements were declared, and positions were stated by successive U.S. Administrations, the UN General Assembly, and the UN Security Council, all of which emphasized that East Jerusalem is part of the Arab territories occupied in 1967. An element of flexibility had been advocated by James Baker, the former U.S. secretary of state, who maintained that the peace process should begin by addressing the easy issues. This, he reasoned, should lead to progress and generate momentum that could be useful in addressing the difficult and intricate issues at a later stage. The idea, then, was not to make concessions and compromises for their own sake, but to expand the areas of agreement through discussion of less thorny matters. That is, once a climate of understanding and a spirit of mutual confidence had been created, difficult matters would be brought to the table. President Clinton's declaration, although made during a private meeting with U.S. Jewish leaders, does not show the astuteness of a "professional" statesman as much as it betrays the opinion of an "amateur politician". There's a big difference between amateurism and professionalism. Amateurism is a whim, a personal inclination motivated by bias and fed by emotions. Professionalism is a job, work, and responsibility. Professionalism means calculations, assessments, and rules. It has principles and codes of conduct. Anyone who disregards them breaks the rules. If he circumvents them, he violates the law. If he breaks the rules and transgresses, he is taken to account. Governing -- particularly on a very high level, on a state level, indeed on a universal level, as the case is with the U.S. President -- must signify justice and responsibility. It must never be an attention grabbing "arbitrary move" that shifts the focus from Whitewater to Jerusalem, or from the Hebron massacre to an assault on a Lebanese church or a monastery in al-Qusiyah, Egypt. Governing should signify decisions and statements that have been thoroughly thought out, sober conduct, and a word of reason at this difficult, embarrassing time. During a recent meeting with Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] -- at a time when his chief negotiator Nabil Sha'th had just returned from Washington following lengthy meetings with Christopher and his aides -- Abu-'Ammar disclosed part of the news Sha'th had brought to him from the U.S. capital. Among the things he revealed were some of the reasons for the obstruction of a UN Security Council resolution on the Hebron massacre. The most important of these reasons was a "firm, stern, and emphatic U.S. refusal to allow any direct or indirect reference to Jerusalem." There was a U.S. commitment to "banning the word Jerusalem from the draft of the resolution and subsequently from the resolution itself." Everyone was perplexed by this strange attitude and this intransigence and insistence because the draft resolution included nothing new about Jerusalem. It added nothing new, made no new request, and did not emphasize a principle that some people were trying to obliterate. All that the Palestinians asked for was that the draft and the final wording of the resolution should include a passing reference to Security Council Resolution 799 of 1992. It was meant to be a reference to that resolution in the wake of the Hebron massacre. Resolution 799 speaks of implementing the fourth Geneva Convention pertaining to territories and residents living under occupation, including occupied Palestinian territories in the West Bank and Gaza, including Jerusalem. This reference to a binding UN resolution and a firm international principle -- a resolution and principle accepted by the United States when the vote on Resolution 799 was taken in 1992 -- was now unacceptable, prohibited, and a taboo. No one knew at that point the reason for the prohibition of something which had, in fact, been accepted and agreed upon as a matter of course. It was to be a Palestinian reference, a necessary one after the Hebron massacre proved that Palestinians under occupation enjoy no form of protection whatsoever. People became apprehensive at this point and the Palestinians realized something "was being cooked up" in the dark. The perplexity and fear persisted until President Clinton revealed his intentions and "detonated his bombshell" in the dark. Israel Radio then lifted the veil and "laid it bare". This attitude to the resolution and its draft form, to which the U.S. negotiators adhered throughout the Security Council's deliberations, was based on frank, definite, and clear instructions from the White House. It does not reflect the U.S. Administration's calculations. It rather shows "a deception." It reflects a circumvention and contradiction of former positions and commitments. It shows an abandonment of the responsibility the United States bears as a full partner in the peace process. This position reflects a bias, indeed a U.S.-Israeli alliance, against the Arabs. Perhaps this maneuver or change in the U.S. position would have been acceptable before Oslo and before the signing ceremony at the White House. Perhaps this position could have been the subject of discussion, argument, and negotiations before the Hebron massacre. But after the signing ceremony at the White House and the festival of martyrdom in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque, it is impermissible for the United States -- irrespective of the personal reasons of President Clinton and his wife Hillary -- to adopt such a stand, unless the game is much bigger than this, the deception hides behind it a greater tragedy, and the peace process for which we are sincerely working is a big lie. I am afraid that President Clinton's calculations and assessment of the overall situation were the result of political amateurism and not responsible professionalism, which is necessary for one who occupies this high position at the center of the empire that runs the affairs of the entire world. This political amateurism may have been nurtured or attracted by an easy or naive calculation based on the facts and developments at that moment. This naive and tempting calculation may have been based on dealing with the situation in light of the material relations between the forces. These material relations say that Israel is now the strongest country as a result of its alliance with the United States, its military arsenal, nuclear bombs, and internal cohesion, despite the internal struggle for leadership and power. The material relations also say that the Arabs are now at the peak of their division and weakness. They also say that this weakness and disintegration have led many Arab states to run after Israel, seeking science, knowledge, experience, money, gain, and good administration. Many of the Arabs have rushed to compete for the Israeli treasures. This is the general picture of the relations and balance between the forces in the area. There are those who seek progress, wealth, and knowledge from Israel and those who have placed security in the back or front of their minds as their main concern and have imagined that a military alliance with Israel in the near or distant future will spare them from the evil of troublemakers among their Arab brothers who covet their territory and wealth. They also imagined that this will spare them from the evil of the troublemakers among the Muslim brothers in the neighboring countries who are seeking to restore past glories by establishing a Muslim empire that transcends borders. This, as we said, is the material calculation, the calculation based on the relations and balance between the forces. This is a misleading calculation as much as it is tempting. Furthermore, there is a difference between weakness resulting from a defect in relations between the forces and capitulation, which is out of the question. Therefore, the reality is very different and the reasons for that are many. For the foreseeable future at least, military superiority has become ineffective. Nuclear and military potentials have, to a large extent, become inoperative and useless. We have the example of the second superpower, which broke down and collapsed on itself while possessing the largest weapons arsenal of all kinds. It also had the largest supply of resources, expertise, and scientists on the face of the earth. We have the second example in South Africa, which was founded as a racial state in the same year as racial Israel was founded, 1948. Both of them came to be part of the post-World War II arrangements. The whites established their racial state there and deprived around 30 million people, that is the black Africans and sons of the area, of their land. The whites armed themselves with everything and deprived the others of everything. They armed themselves with education, monopolized work including agriculture, built an atomic bomb, set up a military arsenal, and at the end of the road, discovered that the world had changed. They found out that arrangements made after World War II had collapsed and were being replaced by post-Cold War arrangements. They discovered that they were up against the wall and had no other option but coexistence, dismantling the racial state, and building a democratic state. They discovered that bullets were blank and grenades had no triggers. They changed and decided to bravely join the rest of the world, led wisely, expertly, and with good intentions by de Klerk. They made way for free elections for all -- for the blacks, the whites, and the coloreds -- elections that will take place on 27 April. They decided to go ahead despite the fact that they know the results beforehand -- the black majority will win. However, they did not withdraw, as Rabin is doing today. The noticeable fact is that the two racial states, Israel and South Africa, were founded in 1948. Also, in both cases peace negotiations based on change started in 1992. The difference is the regression, through massacres, in Palestine and the progress, despite problems, in South Africa. The second fact in the unseen, intangible, and invisible formula is that when Israel accepts or shows readiness to accept a part of the land under a just peace, it should do so on the condition that the Palestinians regain their rights and land, topped by Jerusalem. This condition is binding, not only to Israel, but even to those who have competed to sign secret agreements with Israel, be they security or cooperation agreements. The region and its people have accepted peace as a condition for cooperation -- a just, fair, and equitable peace. Anything less than this is rejected and unimplementable; no one can impose it on them. Therefore, the real calculations of the superpowers do not rely on material and military relations. In actual fact, they rely on general popular acceptance by all the countries and peoples in the region. This is the effective and decisive factor. Anything less than this, is a fancy flitting through the minds of amateurs.
