In terms of the General Peace Accord, the process for the creation of the Mozambique Defense Armed Forces [FADM] will occur simultaneously with the assembly and integration into civilian life of FAM/FPLM soldiers who are progressively demobilized as a result of the implementation of the cease-fire accord. The General Peace Accord also states that all units must be demobilized by the time FADM is fully staffed. Even though the troop confinement process is not over yet and the formation of the FADM forces has met with some problems, it is important that troop demobilization begins, principally for the following reasons: - The troop confinement process was conceived of as a stage in the transition to civilian life or to the FADM forces. That stage should not have lasted longer than one month. Unfortunately, you have had to stay longer than that at this assembly area due to unforeseen reasons; - Most of the confined soldiers are to be demobilized; - There is the imperative need to speed up the implementation of the General Peace Accord by removing difficulties and making it easier for its goals to be achieved; - Most troop assembly areas are more than 100 percent full, so it is imperative to demobilize soldiers so that space can be opened for other soldiers to be confined; - Basic organizational and financial conditions are already in place for demobilization to begin. The Mozambican Government has decided to begin demobilizing its forces for all these reasons, and in the spirit which guided the signing of the General Peace Accord. We can clarify at this stage that this is no unilateral demobilization. Instead, it is a matter of the government taking the first step in a simultaneous demobilization process that must be complied with by both sides. In view of that, the government, Renamo, and the UN Operations in Mozambique must guarantee that the process occurs simultaneously for both sides. Demobilization is an import stage in the process for strengthening peace in this country. It is an important stage in redirecting our country's human, material, and financial resources so they can be used to rebuild the nation, to improve the people's living standards, and to help develop our country's social and economic sectors. FAM/FPLM soldiers, noncommissioned officers, and officers: those of you who are leaving today to rejoin your families, whether it be in urban or rural areas, are leaving their uniforms and weapons today to rejoin civilian life. We have come here on behalf of the Mozambican State and the Mozambican people, united from Rovuma River to Maputo River, to pay the nation's homage to its beloved sons. [passage omitted] The sodliers who are getting demobilized today have fought for peace. The principal goal of demobilization is to solidify peace by neutralizing the reasons for war. So, demobilization cannot and should not be a unilateral move, or it may become the reason for new conflicts. A simultaneous demobilization process means that there are neither victors nor vanquished. The Mozambican people are the sole winners in that they gain much desired peace. To you, the heroes, we do not hesitate to pay due homage for the heroism you have shown in your struggle to defend freedom and our fatherland's independence. We are proud to pay you homage today. It is with pride that you must now return to your homes in the country's cities and rural areas, because you have accomplished your mission. You must now work to help solidify peace and normalize the lives of all our people, including your own lives. You will know how to behave in line with the spirit of reconciliation, freedom, dignity, and justice. [passage omitted] While you prepare for your new professions, you will continue getting financial support for two years, the first six months of which will be paid directly by the state. The other 18 months will be the result of generous contributions and support by the international community, which has decided to listen to the Mozambican Government's call for increased efforts in that direction. We are well aware of the fact that you have many needs but only very limited financial resources, but that is all the government and the international community can make available. We do not have the means to satify our desire to give you more. In addition to those salaries, upon arrival in the area where he wants to settle for good, each demobilized soldier will receive complementary support in terms of seeds, agricultural tools, and other small production tools that will help them resume productive work. That means that we need to work very hard so that we can guarantee our own upkeep and create surpluses that will help stabilize and raise our standards of living. Only work can help us improve. Only disciplined work can release us from famine, poverty, and misery. [passage omitted] The government is well aware of the fact that the most important consideration, in all this, is the creation of conditions that will guarantee work for each citizen. However, it is up to us and our efforts alone to create really stable jobs. We have to continue working very hard. [passage omitted] Some of you have expressed a desire to be paid the first six months in full upon demobilization. Though the government views with sympathy the reasons for your concern, it is nonetheless important that you do not arrive in your homes empty-handed. The government will pay promptly the first three months when you get demobilized. You will receive the remainder in your districts. Conditions are being created to ensure that everyone will receive his dues, even in areas where there are no banks or administrative posts. [passage omitted] We want you to be an important factor in the development of the national economy and in the reconstruction of the fatherland for whose freedom, sovereignty, and territorial integrity you fought so hard and gave so much of your youth. The people and the government expect of you that you will be the safekeepers of peace, freedom, and democracy wherever you may be. [passage omitted] Long live the FAM/FPLM forces! Long live the Mozambican people, united from Rovuma River to Maputo River! Long live the Republic of Mozambique! Long live national unity! Long live hard work! Long live democracy! Long live peace!
