Parliamentarian J. Macheka, secretary of the Zimbabwe-Korea Solidarity and Friendship Association, was elected chairman of the committee at the meeting. A letter of protest to the South Korean puppet authorities was released at the meeting, which denounced their brutalities in invaliding Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan, former soldiers of the Korean People's Army, by tortures and inhumane maltreatment, keeping them in prison for tens of years for refusing to be converted, and strongly demanded that they be immediately returned to the northern half of Korea.
