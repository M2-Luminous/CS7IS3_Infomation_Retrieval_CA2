Ossetian Emergency Zone LD2105203294 Moscow ITAR-TASS in English 1919 GMT 21 May 94 LD2105203294 Moscow ITAR-TASS English BFN [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Shanayev] [Text] Vladikavkaz May 21 TASS -- The situation in parts of north Ossetia under the state of emergency remains tense, according to reports from military sources. Shooting broke out five times in the Prigorod district last night. On the whole, the situation is under control of the Russian army and local law enforcement bodies. Head of the temporary administration Vladimir Lozovoy said in his address to the population that "attacks on civilians and police and army check points and hostage taking continue in the zone of the state of emergency. It is outrageous when members of local administrations become organisers of and accomplices in unlawful actions. Heads of bodies of power and power structures who are unable or unwilling to carry out their duties to ensure law and order will be called to account. I call on the citizens of North Ossetia and Ingushetia to resist provocations of extremists who use any means to thwart the settlement of the conflict."
