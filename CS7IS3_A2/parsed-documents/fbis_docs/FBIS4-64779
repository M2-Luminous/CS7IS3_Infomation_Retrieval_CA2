The trainers, led by a brigadier and including three RAF [Royal Air Force] members, are part of an expected expansion of Britain's military and commercial ties with South Africa. British contractors are ready to strike deals in avionics, shipbuilding and technical training. British security interests are expected to increase significantly throughout southern Africa; military trainers are already working in several countries in the region and Mr Mandela, the President-elect, has indicated that South Africa might return to the Commonwealth. South African and British officials regard the appointment of Mr Joe Modise as South African Defence Minister as indicating that Mr Mandela intends to maintain a strong defence force which could help the United Nations throughout southern Africa. South African officials suggest the renewal of military links with Britain would be at the expense of Pretoria's ties with Israel, which has helped maintain South Africa's high-technology weapons industries. South Africa is making a determined effort to sell Britain its new Rooivalk attack helicopter. The Ministry of Defence has allowed the Rooivalk to be officially entered as another serious contender, along with American and European firms, for a 1 billion pound contract for up to 91 helicopters. It will be demonstrated in Britain for the first time this week at the Army Air Corps air show at Middle Wallop, Hants.
