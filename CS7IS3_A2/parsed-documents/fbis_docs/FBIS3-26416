The cut, contained in the 1.5 trillion dollars fiscal 1995 budget, would lead the U.S. Military to an active force of 1.52 million people. That includes 510,000 for the Army, 442,000 for the Navy, 174,000 for the Marine Corps and 400,000 for the Air Force. Although the 1995 budget for national defense increases to 263.7 billion dollars from 260.9 billion dollars this year, real spending would actually decline 0.9 percent if projected inflation elements were taken into account. That decline is far from the 5.9 percent real drop planned for 1996 under the Clinton administration's five-year spending plan, representing its intention to hold the line on overall spending. The 1995 defense budget includes 252.2 billion dollars for the Department of Defense, 10.6 billion dollars for nuclear weapons programs of the Department of Energy and 900 million dollars for other defense-related spending. It includes 2.8 billion dollars for the closing of military bases, 5.7 billion dollars for environmental cleanup and pollution prevention at military facilities, 5 billion dollars for military construction and 3.3 billion dollars for military housing. Reflecting the military "bottom-up review" conducted under former Defense Secretary Les Aspin that stresses readiness, the 1995 budget gives an increase of 1.7 billion dollars for readiness in real terms.
