Do you feel the same? [Olechowski] Current events will determine Poland's position within the continent's future political configuration. First, we need to define what our role is to be within NATO and the European security system. We also need to take into account the state of relations between the Western world and Moscow. Poland cannot forget that Russia is its largest and most powerful neighbor. We therefore want our voice to be heard and taken seriously. [Turowski] Is there not a risk that this Polish voice may be stifled by Russia's, which the West appears more willing to listen to? [Olechowski] Seen from Warsaw, the priority for European powers, including Russia, must be to establish a reliable and strong European security system. Our position is therefore that existing institutions must be expanded and that Poland must be allowed to join such institutions as soon as possible. We believe they are the only guarantee of peace there is. However, Russia has so far remained wary of NATO, which makes for excessively rigid policies. Still, Warsaw and Moscow have now established good cooperative relations from both a bilateral and a regional standpoint. [Turowski] The strategy of the United States has been visibly pro-Russian. Does that worry you? [Olechowski] The United States has been doing everything in its power to incite Russia to embrace the rules of democracy and market economy. President Clinton's attitude is quite understandable. However, I would definitely worry should the Americans seek a strategic alliance with Russia. In the current context, such a move would be highly premature. [Turowski] Poland was the first country to formally recognize the new Ukrainian state. How do you explain the special relationship that has since developed between the two nations? [Olechowski] Poland is delighted with Kiev's rising political profile on the international scene. At first, Ukrainian independence created much uncertainty in the West. Today, the United States and Russia have initiated a political dialogue with Ukraine. Washington and Moscow have given assurances that are tantamount to a commitment to preserve Ukraine's independence and security. It would be desirable that the headquarters of an existing international institution be moved to Kiev in order to further anchor Ukraine to Europe. [Turowski] Does this alliance between Poland and Ukraine not stem from an anti-Russian feeling? [Olechowski] By definition, this cooperation between our two countries, both of which have an equal aspiration for liberty and democracy, cannot be a threat to anyone. Nowadays, Poland has many more neighbors than four years ago, and we have signed friendship treaties with all of them. For the first time in a region that was racked by fratricidal wars for centuries, all nations have recovered their independence. Consequently, there is a need to create good neighborly relations, a basic requirement for security in Europe. [Turowski] Moscow made its considerable clout felt on the occasion of the settlement negotiated in Sarajevo by the United Nations. How do you view this change of tack? [Olechowski] This is an unqualified success for Russian diplomacy. As for Poland, we have always supported European initiatives meant to put an end to the conflict in the former Yugoslavia. And our participation is commensurate to our means: UN forces in Bosnia include a Polish military contingent. This tragedy is also a warning, reminding us that similar conflicts could happen just about anywhere in Europe. This is a lesson we cannot afford not to learn if we intend to prepare for the future. And this is why Poland is so adamant about human and minority rights, and also why it supports the Balladur [French prime minister] plan for conflict prevention in Europe. [Turowski] Two years ago, in your capacity as finance minister, you voiced some bitterness with respect to French-Polish relations. What is your point of view today as foreign minister? [Olechowski] You could say that France and Germany have been our mentors within the European Union. The periodic meetings between the three countries' foreign ministers are the best testimony to this. Furthermore, these meetings are now supplemented by meetings between the defense ministers. Should France and Germany succeed in integrating Poland in the WEU [Western European Union], that would be proof that their efforts were effective. [Turowski] And yet French companies seem strangely absent from Poland... [Olechowski] While French companies are absent from Poland today, they will regret it tomorrow. Indeed, whatever the COFACE [French Insurance Company for External Trade] may think, Poland is no longer a risk-prone country. Those who invest now can be assured of very healthy returns.
