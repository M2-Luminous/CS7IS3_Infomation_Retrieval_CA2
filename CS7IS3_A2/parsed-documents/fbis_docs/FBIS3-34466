Nearly 70,000 people have fled camps along Sudan's southern border with Uganda since the bombings intensified in the past two weeks, United Nations officials said. Sudan's hard-line Islamic government launched one of its biggest military offensives against the mainly Christian and animist southern rebels last month, relief sources said. Khartoum, however, has denied the bombings and blamed rival rebel factions for fighting in the south, where UN officials say millions need food and emergency aid. But reporters who visited Pageri on Tuesday had to dive for cover as a lumbering Soviet-built Antonov military plane dropped four bombs shortly before noon (1000 GMT) on the village. About half of Pageri's 10,000 residents sought refuge there after being forced to flee their homes by the civil war that has ravaged the south for more than a decade. Minutes later the Antonov dropped another two bombs which fell harmlessly close to the nearby Aswa camp, sheltering 21,000 displaced people. Aswa and Pageri are less than 20 kilometres (12 miles) from the Ugandan border. Western diplomats said the rebels had no aircraft and the Antonov must have been a government bomber. The United States government strongly condemned Khartoum for two air strikes Friday near camps in the same area sheltering hundreds of thousands of displaced people. There were no casualties, but Sally Burnheim of the UN Operation Lifeline Sudan said 18 people had been killed and another 17 wounded in a third bombing raid Monday on Parajok, about 100 kilometres (60 miles) east of the camps, where some of the displaced people who fled had gathered for safety. Khartoum has banned relief flights to several destinations along the Ugandan border where 200,000 displaced people are gathered. "If we can't reach the people in need, there's going to be a colossal disaster," Burnheim said. Bullets crackled as they exploded when flames engulfed the ruins of one of Pageri's largest buildings, which was directly hit. Youths darted into the building and ran out seconds later clutching Kalashnikov rifles which they had saved from the fire. Mario Muor, head of the relief wing of the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), dismissed suggestions that Pageri housed a rebel base. He said the building contained arms and ammunition because it was "a military police station." But few women and children were seen in Pageri on Tuesday. Most of the panic-stricken inhabitants who streamed out of their beehive-shaped grass-thatched huts were young men. Many carried Kalashnikovs. A women hit by shrapnel in both legs was carried bleeding from the burning ruins of a house and driven to a makeshift hospital in Aswa. Doctors said she would die if not evacuated to neighbouring Kenya for a blood transfusion within 24 hours. Local sources said SPLA leader John Garang was near Pageri to chair a meeting of top commanders Tuesday, but there was no confirmation. The government recaptured most major southern towns in a major offensive launched a few months after the SPLA split into two warring factions in 1991. Muor accused the splinter group led by Riak Machar of collaborating with Khartoum, a claim Machar has repeatedly denied.
