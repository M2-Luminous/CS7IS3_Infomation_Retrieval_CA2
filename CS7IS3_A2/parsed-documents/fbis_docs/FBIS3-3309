The consensus was included in a joint ministerial statement on guiding policy formation of the APEC members which issued at the end of the ministers meeting of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC). The ministers recognized the "sound macroeconomic policies and stability should remain a pillar of sustained, low-inflation growth in the region." "Increasing cross-border flows of goods, services and investment should be another pillar for strong economic performance in the region," the ministers said in the statement. They also agreed that further development of capital markets is needed for effective mobilization and allocation of private and business capital. The one-day meeting discussed some of the fundamental economic challenges facing the Asia-Pacific region, including sustaining growth with low inflation, financing investment and infrastructure development. The ministers also discussed the issues of promoting capital and market development. It had been stressed at the meeting that large and growing inflows of private investment from external sources have been, and will continue to be crucial. The ministers agreed that they will pursue policies which promote ongoing large and diversified inflows of foreign direct investment. The ministers decided to meet again next year in Indonesia to consult on specific issues as well as regional economic development as a whole. U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen told a press conference after the meeting that the ministers also "agreed on the importance of concluding the Uruguay Round and implementing its results." Asked about relations between China and the United States, Bentsen said, "I must say that U.S.- China relationship is very important to the United States, to China and to all of Asia." The APEC finance ministers meeting was convened under the vision statement issued November 20, 1993, in Seattle, when the APEC leadership conference was held. APEC accounts for over 40 percent of world trade and over 13 trillion in output. It groups Australia, Canada, Brunei, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, Singapore, Chinese Taipei, Thailand and the United States. Chile was invited to the meeting as an observer pending to its full membership to the organization in 1995. The 17-member group was founded in 1989 as a loose organization aimed at promoting trade, investment and economic cooperation.
