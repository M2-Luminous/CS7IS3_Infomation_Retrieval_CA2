TRADE UNIONS EXPRESS SOLIDARITY WITH LAWYERS AFTER ATTACK The newspaper devotes its front page and many inside pages to reports, comments, interviews, and pictures of the government's violent confrontation of the demonstration staged by the Lawyers Association [LA] in Cairo on 17 May to protest the death of lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani while in police custody. Under the banner headline "Flagrant Aggression Against the Lawyers' Demonstration," Ashraf Khalil writes a 600-word report on pages 1 and 7 in which he says representatives of the various professional associations held an emergency meeting to discuss the developments in the LA "after the security forces shelled their peaceful march with rockets and tear gas bombs." The report says the conferees were demanding the immediate release of detained LA Council members and a speedy investigation into the circumstances that led to the death of Lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani. The conferees are also cited as having expressed full solidarity with the LA Council. According to the report, the LA Council officially asked the public prosecutor "to immediately investigate the security forces' excesses" against the lawyers. The Council declared a state of emergency and considered itself in permanent session. A statement from the Council reportedly blames the interior minister and security commanders for the incidents. The statement demands the immediate release of all detained lawyers and rejects the charges brought against them. A 600-word report by 'Ala' al-Bahhar and Khalid Yunus on page 4 discusses the arrest of several leading LA council members and other activist lawyers. It says security forces raided the houses of those people at dawn and took them to police stations. The report says the lawyers formed a committee to defend the detainees and rushed to the office of the public prosecutor to condemn the "oppressive measures." CORRESPONDENTS DESCRIBE VIOLENCE AT LAWYERS' DEMONSTRATION On pages 2 and 3, the paper gives an on-the-spot account of what it describes as "the brutal aggression against lawyers" in front of the LA headquarters in Cairo. It introduces its stories -- a 800-word report by 'Abd-al-Rahman Isma'il on page 2, a 700-word report by Salah Budaywi on page 2, and an 1,500-word report by Mu'tazz al-Hadidi and Subhi Buhayri on page 3 -- by an unattributed comment that reads in part: "The government has added to its criminal antihuman rights record two new characteristics: stupidity and ignorance. Can any sane person attack the protectors of law with bullets and tear gas inside their association? It is an open invitation in the most intense form of extremism, and an opening to the doors of hell. It gives violence -- which all of us reject -- a fertile soil to flourish and take full control." The comment adds: "The government perpetrated its crime and was caught red-handed. The evidence is conclusive. So, what is the government waiting for before it leaves? Through its unsuccessful policy, the government has placed the entire country on the edge of a volcano that may erupt at any moment if the ignorant ones fail to return to their senses." The three reports detail the situation before, during, and after the confrontation between the lawyers and the security forces in Cairo. They describe the heavy security cordon imposed around the LA building before the demonstration, how police officers threatened the organizers of the march and harassed journalists, how "hundreds" of lawyers suffocated from tear gas, and how security forces chased lawyers and citizens in nearby streets and conducted random arrest campaigns. The reports also cite lawyer leaders addressing the crowd before the demonstration. They reportedly demanded that the government stop torture and exceptional rules, and they urged lawyers to demonstrate unity and remain the strong defenders of law and freedom. LAWYERS ASSOCIATION DOYEN INTERVIEWED Page 2 also contains an approximately 1,500-word interview with Ahmad al-Khawajah, the doyen of the Lawyers Association, who, unlike most of the LA Council members, is not affiliated with the Islamic trend. Al-Khawajah refuses to blame the government for the incidents, but he describes the confrontation as "a serious setback for democracy." He notes the "over enthusiasm" of some young lawyers and says the problems arising from lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani's death could have been solved through dialogue. Expressing his belief that there are suspicious circumstances behind Madani's death, he explains his efforts and contacts to reveal the truth of the matter. EDITOR SAYS FALL OF GOVERNMENT MATTER OF TIME In a 1,000-word article entitled "The Government Is Banging Its Head Against the Wall", Chief Editor Majdi Ahmad Husayn writes on page 1 that the government opted for "the brute force" to face the lawyers' moves after the "torture to death" of one of their colleagues. This, he says, reflects the weakness of the government, which fears that even a single demonstration may bring it down. Noting the various forms of oppression that the government uses to impose itself on the people by force, Husayn comments: "I tell you: your attempts will go in vain. Prolonging the life of a patient in the intensive care unit by artificial means will not be useful. It will only delay the date of the funeral, but the funeral is inevitable, as you know. The country cannot be ruled by tear gas and plastic bullets; this is new proof of the political void which the government and the hollow ruling party represent." HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS CONDEMN ATTACK ON LAWYERS Page 4 contains unattributed reports on statements by the Egyptian Organization of Human Rights [EOHR] and the London-Based Liberty organization denouncing the attack against the lawyers. The Egyptian organization's statement reportedly says: "The EOHR condemns the use of force by the security forces to break up the peaceful demonstration of the Egyptian lawyers because it is a violation of Article 54 of the Egyptian Constitution, which gives citizens the right to gather in a peaceful manner without prior notice. It is also a violation of Egypt's international obligations under Article 21 of the international convention on civilian and political rights, which was ratified by the Egyptian Government. The EOHR views the attack as new incriminating evidence against the authorities' position toward the citizens' right to express their views by all peaceful means, foremost through demonstrations and peaceful gathering." The EOHR also reportedly sent a letter to President Mubarak expressing "profound fears" that lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani died as a result of torture. The letter urges the president to conduct an immediate and honest inquiry into his death. MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD ISSUES STATEMENT ON RECENT VIOLENCE Page 4 also includes a 700-word report on a statement by the Muslim Brotherhood discussing the recent developments and maintaining that the group has never advocated sedition or violent confrontations. POLITICIANS, TRADE UNIONISTS REACT ANGRILY TO POLICE VIOLENCE Page 5 contains three reports on reactions to the police confrontation of the lawyers' demonstration. In the first 1,800-word report, 'Abd-al-Hayy Muhammad and 'Adil al-Bahnasawi cite some party and trade union officials as condemning or regretting the incident. Liberal Party Leader Mustafa Kamil Murad is cited as saying that the police made a grave mistake in using force against the demonstration. Counselor Ma'mun al-Hudaybi, spokesman for the Muslim Brotherhood is cited as saying: "We regret and denounce what has happened. It is people's right to express their views as long as this is done in a peaceful and civilized manner. The use of force was meaningless. But what can we do knowing that the current regime is now characterized by violence, viciousness, and unjust oppression, and that state violence has become a firm policy?" The second 1,500-word report by Tariq 'Abd-al-Hamid, and the third 1,500-word report by Khalid Yunus cite reactions by some lawyer leaders in Cairo and the governorates. They all denounce "government terrorism" and violation of law and human rights. WILL SHAYKH AL-GHAZALI DELIVER 'ID AL-ADHA SERMON? A 50-word announcement-like report on page 1 says leaders and members of the Labor party in Cairo will tomorrow, 21 May, perform the 'Id al-Adha prayers in Mustafa Mahmud mosque in Cairo. The report says Islamic preacher Shaykh Muhammad al-Ghazali will deliver the 'Id sermon. [Cairo al-Wafd in Arabic on 24 May reports that the government barred Shaykh al-Ghazali from delivering the sermon]
