Zaveryukha's address at 1994 Russian Wholesale Food Fair in Smolensk] [Text] The day after the conference in Orel, Vice-Premier A. Zaveryukha of the RF Government flew to Smolensk for the 1994 Russian Wholesale Food Trade Fair. The vice premier's interest in the fair is understandable. After all, it is taking place in an atmosphere of budding market relations and essentially should serve as the prototype of future business contacts between the producers and buyers of food. When the agrarian reform was being carried out, priority is known to have been assigned to changes in forms of property ownership and economic management. The problems of product sales were virtually overlooked. In fact, to put it more precisely, they were ignored. It is not surprising that this resulted in the emergence of numerous middlemen (experts estimate that there are 7 million of them at this time) who are appropriating a high percentage of the earnings of agricultural producers--up to 30-40 percent of the market price. All of this is heightening the local monopolism of the processing industry and trade and impeding sales of agricultural products. This has resulted in the creation of the artificial problem of simulated agricultural overproduction. When A. Zaveryukha addressed visitors to the fair, he said that the government is now planning ways of accumulating national food resources. To this end, the ministries of economics and finance will have to arrange for government regulation of public purchasing power, the guaranteed sale of agricultural products, and the provision of agricultural producers with incentives for increased output. In addition, this year there will be a substantial decrease in federal demand and the number of federal consumers. Food purchases by the government will be used only to satisfy the needs of military personnel and equivalent groups of consumers, to contribute part of the food supplies of the cities of Moscow and St. Petersburg and regions of the Far North, to supplement state reserves, and to create operational government reserves of a select group of products: grain, potatoes, vegetables, meat, dairy products, eggs, sugar, vegetable oil, and fish. The emphasis will be on local production, because less food will be brought in from CIS countries, and there are virtually no plans for centralized imports. In this way, the supply of food for the public and all consumers will be redirected into market channels. Wholesale food markets are to be set up on the federal and regional levels to speed up the transition to more effective forms of trade, facilitate the offer of agricultural items and food to consumers by producers, give consumers free access to goods, speed up the delivery of food products to the retail trade network, establish realistic market prices, and regulate settlements. This system should include rayon wholesale markets, interrayon livestock markets, and large urban wholesale potato, produce, meat, and fish markets. The system will also include specialized and general exchanges trading in grain, oil and oil-bearing seeds, sugar, and several other foods, as well as forward exchanges and futures. The Russian wholesale food fair was attended by more than 1,700 representatives of industry and wholesale trade in Russia, the CIS countries, and the Baltic states and of several foreign firms, small businessmen, and the agents of various commercial structures.
