The Navy commander said that the protocol signed in Massandra was a protocol of intentions. This has never been a solution. According to Volodymyr Bezkorovaynyy, this issue has been studied and rejected. The transfer to Russia of our share of the fleet is no longer discussed. Instead of this, the commander added, the two sides agreed to set up a committee for compiling an inventory of ships and other fleet property for their further division in accordance with earlier agreements between the presidents of the two states. Volodymyr Bezkorovaynyy believes that the fleet should be divided equally by the end of 1995.
