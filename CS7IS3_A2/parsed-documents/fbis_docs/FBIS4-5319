A Malaysia- Cambodia Joint Commission is to be set up soon to promote bilateral activities. The idea was suggested by Sirivut himself at his one-hour meeting with Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi. The commission will, among others, coordinate training and cooperation in agriculture, tourism, and forestry apart from the exploitation of oil and minerals. Cambodia has also requested Malaysia's assistance in the formulation of trade and investment policies for the country. Ever since the two-decade-old civil war was brought to an end, Malaysia has been in the forefront in that country's reconstruction and development. Prince Sirivut expressed his country's gratitude to the Government and people of Malaysia who had greatly contributed toward the peace process in his country. Cambodia plans to set up an embassy in Kuala Lumpur before proceeding to do so in other countries of ASEAN. The embassies are necessary to enable Cambodia keep abreast with developments in the region as they have been isolated during the last 20 years. Right now, Cambodia's priority is to revive its economy. The new Cambodian Government, which was formed after last May's general elections, is keen on attracting Malaysia's private sector to invest in the country. It is also seeking Malaysia's expertise in various fields, especially in agriculture. It is relevant to find out that 85 percent of the Cambodian people live in the rural areas. Thus, Cambodia naturally wants to learn from Malaysia how the latter has achieved immense development and improved the quality of life in the rural areas. The visit of Prince Sirivut, who is also minister of foreign affairs and international cooperation, was also to finalize details of the Malaysian premier Dr. Mahathir Mohamed's three-day visit to Cambodia next week. Dr. Mahathir is scheduled to hold discussions on bilateral, regional, and international issues with the co-prime ministers of Cambodia, Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Mr. Hun Sen. According to Sirivut, the official visit of the Malaysian premier is interpreted and considered by the Government of Cambodia as a very important political event. The people of Cambodia are reported to be looking forward to the visit, especially because of Malaysia's role in the country's peace process. Malaysia, just like its other ASEAN partners, considers Cambodia as an important and integral part of Southeast Asia. Malaysia may be remembered as among the first countries to send troops to serve in the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia, UNTAC. And now that peace has come about as a result of the UN-brokered 1991 Paris peace accord, Malaysia would like to see that country grow and prosper in all fields, and come on par with other countries in the region.
