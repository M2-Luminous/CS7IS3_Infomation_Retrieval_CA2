"In its brief existence, the TEC has wrapped itself in secrecy" and not "proved immune to other unsavoury habits of the Nationalist elites" such as "currency fiddles," avoiding import duties and "the far-flung pleasures of office"--foreign junkets. "As for the character of the new democracy, the instincts of the TEC are less than reassuring: much of its effort seems to have gone into surpressing Radio Pretoria," the editorial notes. "Fortunately, this phase of the transition is brief and, when the government of national unity comes into power, the protections of the interim constitution also comes into play." "But for the constitutional safeguards to be fully effective, we need in parliament as many people as possible who do not belong to the cosy alliance that now dominates the TEC." "If the TEC is any guide, the next five years will be similiar in many respects to the past five, only more so." SUNDAY NATION Talks Boycotters--"South Africa stands on the threshold of what could be a major disaster as the constitutional settlement reached at the multiparty talks is regarded as not being inclusive by players within the Freedom Alliance (FA)," an editorial in the Johannesburg SUNDAY NATION in English on 30 January on page 10 states. "FA groupings are demanding more powers for the provinces and the abolition of a single ballot system" in the forthcoming elections. "However, some parties who oppose the one ballot system are either behaving hypocritically or have themselves to blame." "Inkatha chose the old-fashioned politics of boycott. It does not help the process of change when we behave like spoilt babies and later cry crocodile tears when our actions fail to derail negotiations." "If the IFP decides not to contest the elections, what will be the purpose of changing the one ballot system or even continuing to negotiate with it?" ANC Manifesto--The second editortial of the SUNDAY NATION notes that the ANC's manifesto "looks like what the majority of South Africans may have been looking forward to," but the manifesto "is just a commitment and not the practical action." The manifesto concentrates on "the improvement of the delivery system" rather than "the availability of more resources. We therefore believe that, if this is the case, there is nothing unrealistic about ANC promises." "The manifesto sets a very high standard for other parties that are still to unveil theirs. We can only hope for better commitments which would make the lives of our countryfolk better than the old days of apartheid." BEELD ANC-Farmers' Agreement Welcomed -- "Pragmatism was in evidence in the exploratory talks which took place this week between the Orange Free State Agricultural Union and the African National Congress [ANC]," notes an editorial on page 8 of the Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans of 26 January. "While several problems still remain to be resolved, according to the two parties, the meeting has already produced positive results, the most important being the undertaking by the ANC, under the leadership of Mr. Patrick Lekota, to do everything possible both before and after the election to ensure the safety of farmers and their right to property." "Just like the ANC, the farming community is a real part of the real South Africa. Both already play an important role in the country, and can continue to do so in the future." "Just as the ANC has recognized the rights of the farmers to their land, and does not intend to drive them off their land, so too the farmers must recognize the fundamental rights of their laborers and other black and brown fellow countrymen. For the Free State farmers it means that their province, in which blacks form the great majority, cannot become a white homeland." "Time and time again it has been shown that negotiations between parties which are serious, and are prepared to make pragmatic compromises, can succeed. The Free State farmers can show their colleagues in other parts of the country just what is possible." "Enormous" Upliftment Task in East Rand -- A second editorial on page 8 of BEELD says: "What takes place in the war zones of the East Rand goes largely unnoticed by whites. But this does not mean that they or anyone else will not be touched by it. On the contrary. The extent of the upliftment task waiting, both social and political, is enourmous." "No normal society can be created before the culture of violence has been defeated. No political, economic, or social structure can remain in place while there are people who feel that peace is a joke when they have to live with murder." "We must remember that those are human beings living in the East Rand, people who also desire protection and a good life. No one can sleep peacefully while they have such restless neighbors."
