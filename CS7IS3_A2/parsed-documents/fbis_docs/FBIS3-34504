Al-Sharif Zayd Bin-Shakir, chief of the Royal Hashemite Court, attended. His majesty chaired part of the Cabinet session, during which his majesty emphasized his support for and constant confidence in the prime minister and ministers. His majesty was briefed by the prime minister on the most important topics discussed during the Cabinet session, especially the general tax on sales and agricultural conditions in the Jordan Valley. His majesty reviewed his visits to the United States, Croatia, and Austria, saying these visits were very successful. He said: In the United States, emphasis was placed on the fact that peace must be comprehensive and just and that Jordan cannot accept the idea of signing a peace treaty and then go back to discuss its provisions. The matters agreed upon in the common agenda must be discussed first and when they are all resolved, then discussion of a peace treaty can start within the framework of the principle of comprehensiveness. In this regard, his majesty said that some of the provisions of the agenda could be implemented before signing the peace treaty. If agreement is reached on territory or borders, then Jordan will regain its waters within this context. He also said he found understanding and positive response from President Clinton and the U.S. Administration on this point in particular. Regarding his visit to Croatia, his majesty stressed that the Jordanian soldiers there are fulfilling their duties with a great degree of service and without bias and are demonstrating good manners and prudence. He said the Jordanian peacekeeping force in the former Yugoslavia is the second largest international force after France. He also said he was pleased to meet with the soldiers there. Regarding his visit to Austria, his majesty said he met with Austria's current and former presidents, as well as the Austrian chancellor. He said he found a readiness and understanding to increase cooperation between Jordan and Austria. As for his visit to Syria, his majesty said the visit was primarily made to offer condolences to President Hafiz al-Asad on the death of his son. He said they also discussed issues within the context of coordination between the two countries. His majesty briefed President al-Asad on the impression created with the U.S. side on the meeting between Presidents al-Asad and Clinton. His majesty said he found that the U.S. President created a positive impression of his meeting with Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad. His majesty then moved to speak about domestic issues. He stressed the need to pay attention to the individual, stressing that attention must always be given to the individual, especially regarding his material needs, water, food, and medicine. He said we must always develop scientific and technological resources within this context and follow the correct standards and specifications that will enable us to protect the individual and provide the best quality products for his basic needs. His majesty said: We must pay attention to the individual's education, especially at this phase. There are many challenges awaiting us in the coming phase which dictate that the individual must always be ready to bear and confront the challenges that may face him in the future. His majesty touched on certain domestic issues that must be addressed by the government, particularly the fight against narcotics, administrative control and reform, and awarding productive employees and punishing wrongdoers. He said we must address our issues with some degree of precision, because generalization may create a distorted image of Jordan, especially since some people may try to take advantage of this situation. Some ministers then reviewed some of the activities conducted by their ministries. At the end of the session, his majesty gave statements to reporters. [passage omitted]
