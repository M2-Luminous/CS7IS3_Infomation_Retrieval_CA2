The symposium also called for exploiting all means in order to increase the production of wheat and grains and to build strategic storage for these crops. It also called for the formation of joint working teams to help coordinate Arab positions on the purchase of wheat and grain, and for the establishment of an authoritative Arab center for scientific research and technological development concerned with making bread and setting unified Arab specifications for a standard Arab loaf. Dr. Falah Sa'id Jabr, secretary general of the Arab Federation of Food Industries, told AL-THAWRAH that the symposium proposed the establishment of an operations room to follow world wheat and grain prices in light of the new world changes that are expected to follow the application of the integrated "quality" and new "GATT": agreements. Dr. Jabr pointed out that the symposium also proposed revising the existing law on grain publicity, improving the competence of those in charge of laboratory tests, and setting up new standards for evaluating the performance of governorates in grain production. The symposium called on the peasants productive cooperative movement, investors, and farmers to build silos according to proper engineering designs in order to store produced grain close to the production areas, where it will be at the disposal of the Ministry of Trade. The symposium's recommendations also proposed improving current milling methods, examining methods of refining flour in all mills, limiting use of very fine sieves in the first sieving and grinding stages, deploying mobile maintenance workshops to serve mills and bakeries in all parts of Iraq, paying greater attention to the question of producing home-made bread, encouraging the use of home gas ovens, and reducing waste as a result of sieving flour at home.
