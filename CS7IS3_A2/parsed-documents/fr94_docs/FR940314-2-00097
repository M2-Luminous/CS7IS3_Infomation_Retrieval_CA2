These interpretations are issued in Unemployment Insurance Program Letters (UIPLs) to the State Employment Security Agencies (SESAs). The UPLs described below are published in the Federal Register in order to inform the public. Unemployment Insurance Program Letter No. 13&hyph;94 This UIPL advises SESAs of the provisions of Public Law (Pub. L.) 103&hyph;152 which affect the unemployment compensation (UC) program. Public Law 103&hyph;152 requires that States establish and utilize a system of profiling all new claimants for regular UC in order to identify those claimants most likely to exhaust regular UC and in need of reemployment services in order to obtain new work. It also requires that an individual identified pursuant to the profiling system must participate in reemployment services as a condition of UC eligibility. Unemployment Insurance Program Letter No. 14&hyph;94 This UIPL advises SESAs of the provisions of Public Law 103&hyph;182 relating to self-employment assistance as it affects the UC program. Public Law 103&hyph;182 amended Federal law to give States the option of permitting, for a five-year period, certain individuals to receive payments from a State's unemployment fund for the purpose of assisting such individuals in establishing businesses and becoming self-employed. Dated: March 8, 1994. Doug Ross, Assistant Secretary of Labor.
