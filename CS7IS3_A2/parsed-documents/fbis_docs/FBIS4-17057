The union said "neither the leftists nor the rightists care about peasants in Lithuania, therefore there is nothing left to do but to unite ourselves into a party." The new party's principal aims will be to implement the land reform and the law on cooperatives. During its congress, the union sharply criticized the previous parliament for its "ruinous" land policy and the present government for reducing import tariffs on agricultural production. The union qualified such measures as "the government's direct aggression against local farmers." The congress elected independent MP Albinas Vaismuzis to head the new party. Vaismuzis, who was elected in a single-mandate district, said his party's orientation is "to the left of the center."
