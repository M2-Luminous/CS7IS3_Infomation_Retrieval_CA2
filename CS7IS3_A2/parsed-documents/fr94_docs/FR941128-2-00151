Summary of Facts and Representations 1. The Employer, a Massachusetts corporation, is a closely held corporation that was established in 1906 and currently employs approximately 186 individuals. It is located in Chicopee, Massachusetts where it is engaged primarily in the manufacture and distribution of wiping products that include woven (textiles) and non-woven (paper and synthetic) materials. 2. The Plan is a defined contribution plan with individual accounts for participants that is intended to meet the qualification requirements of sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Code. The Plan intends also to comply with section 404(c) of the Act whereby participants self-direct the investments of assets in their respective individual accounts. As of January 31, 1994, the Plan had 79 participants and total assets of $499,249.87. Approximately 2.25 percent of the total assets of the Plan, valued at $12,906.58, remain invested in the GICs for individual accounts of 19 participants of which 4 are retired. At the adoption of the Plan by the Employer on September 29, 1989, Edward S. Wright (president, director, and shareholder of the Employer) and his wife, Jean C. Wright (treasurer, clerk, director, and shareholder of the Employer) were appointed Trustees of the Plan. In their undertakings, the Trustees are authorized by the Plan to employ agents and to pay their reasonable expenses and compensation. The Plan also provides that the Employer may make appointments of persons to direct and manage the Plan. In the absence of such an appointment the Employer is the Plan Administrator and Named Fiduciary. Currently the Plan is administered by a committee (the Committee) which consists of 11 members of which 4 members act as a quorum (the Executive Committee) in administering daily activities of the Plan. This includes the Executive Committee selecting the optional investment vehicles used by Plan participants in directing investments for their respective accounts. The Executive Committee also appoints legal counsel, accountants, investment advisors, and administrators for the Plan. The Executive Committee has currently retained Lamoriello & Company, Inc. of Warwick, Rhode Island to perform various functions for the Plan, which include the preparation and filing of annual earnings reports and disbursing periodic reports to participants. The Executive Committee also has retained Inside Management, Inc. of Wellesley, Massachusetts as the current registered Investment Advisor for the Plan.
