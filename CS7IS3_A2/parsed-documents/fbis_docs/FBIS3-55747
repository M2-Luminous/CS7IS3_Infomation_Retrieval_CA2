TRUD on the Federation Council's first meeting: "The first meeting of the Federation Council did not at all resemble the vociferous and ungovernable gatherings of the Congress of People's deputies, or vice versa, the too 'manageable' meetings of the dissolved Supreme Soviet." The newspaper describes the social status of the deputies to the Federation Council: 152 out of 171 deputies are white-collar workers. Among them, representatives from regional legislative and executive power bodies constitute a considerable proportion. Eight deputies are entrepreneurs, three are farmers. There is one military officer. Seven are jobless. There are no industrial workers among the deputies. TRUD also points to high educational qualifications of the parliamentarians: there are ten professors, and 19 candidates of science (12--in the field of economics, 5--technology, and 2-- philosophy) In ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI, Ivan Kivelidi, chairman of the Entrepreneurship Council to the Russian Government and general director of the Interagro Foreign Economic Association, reflects on whether the parliament will manage to undo the `Gordian knot' of economic problems. Emphasising the need to draw up a market-oriented liberal legislation, Kivelidi points out as follows: "There are plenty of entrepreneurs in the new parliament. In my view, people, who can find unconventional solutions inn an extreme situation marking the establishment of market relations, may well constitute a creative backbone in parliament". ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA runs an account of the meetings of the Federal Assembly houses under the headline "Good Luck to You, the Parliament of Russia". NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the U.S. President's upcoming visit to Moscow. The newspaper writes that the distinguishing feature of the forthcoming Moscow summit will be the participation of yet another leader in it, namely, Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk. A tri-partite agreement will be a "giant step for global security", the newspaper quotes Clinton as saying. "Accords that are expected to be reached during the two leaders' talks are certain to be of benefit to Russia, particularly considering the latest actions of the West which conceded to Moscow over the NATO enlargement issue, which has shown once again which aspect of U.S. foreign policy is a priority". PRAVDA views the forthcoming summit in Moscow in a somewhat different way. "It is the first time that the leader of the only remaining superpower after the break-up of the Soviet Union calls on the president of Russia. In this respect, the forthcoming summit is a historic one. "The lack of parity in relations with Washington is the main flaw of the Moscow summit. Without equality, one can hardly count on stable and long-term results". ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA on the same subject: "The first meeting between the Russian and American presidents in Moscow promises to be rather productive. The American President arrives in Moscow on Wednesday night with considerable achievements in his foreign policy activities which will, doubtless, be rather highly evaluated in Moscow". KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA on the arrest and release of two Russian generals in Latvia. The newspaper carries an item headlined "Russian Generals in Latvian Handcuffs", about the unlawful actions of Latvian authorities against the two Russian military officers. "Latvia and Russia found themselves on the verge of an armed conflict after two Russian generals were forcibly driven into the forest. "The incident, it seems, has been settled. However, would the issue end at that? A local newspaper still continues to publish lists of officers and members of the families of Russian servicemen, with their residential addresses and places of work indicated..."
