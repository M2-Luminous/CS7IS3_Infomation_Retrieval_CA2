UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) spokesman Eric Chaperon said the Moslem-led forces had heavy weapons and many patrols on Mount Igman, to the west of the city, facing Bosnian Serb lines within the 20-kilometre (12.5-mile) exclusion zone ordered by NATO in February under the threat of air strikes. Another UNPROFOR officer, speaking anonymously, said helicopter patrols had on Monday counted four mortars and two anti-aircraft guns deployed alongside 1,000 Bosnian army troops around Mount Igman, a strategic height overlooking the Bosnian capital. Chaperon also reported fresh fighting between Bosnian troops loyal to President Alija Izetbegovic and soldiers following orders of Fikret Abdic, the renegade Moslem leader of the northwestern Bosnian pocket of Bihac.
