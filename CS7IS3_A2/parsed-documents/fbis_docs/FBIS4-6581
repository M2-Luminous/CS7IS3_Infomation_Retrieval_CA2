FBIS4-6581 "dreas078_c_94015" FBIS-EAS-94-078 Daily Report 22 Apr 1994 North Korea `Sinister Acts' Against Chongnyon Condemned `Sinister Acts' Against Chongnyon Condemned SK2204051894 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0454 GMT 22 Apr 94 SK2204051894 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["Papers Rap at Anti-Chongnyon Rowdyism" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, April 22 (KCNA) -- More than 70 gangsters belonging to an ultra-rightist organization of Japan, "the Kanto Council of the Great Japan Patriots Union" kicked up a row in Tokyo on April 19, shouting "Chongnyon, get out of Japan" and "North Korea, promptly stop nuclear threat to Japan." Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today says this was an organised and premeditated provocative act perpetrated under the backstage manipulation of the Japanese authorities for a sinister political purpose. The analyst says: This rowdyism staged in Japan in broad daylight was also a product of the Japanese reactionaries' hostile policy toward the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and their moves against the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon.) Drawing attention to the fact that the incident occurred at a time when the United States was intensifying its aggressive and belligerent moves on the Korean peninsula and shortly after the traitor Kim Yong-sam toured Japan, the analyst continues: Chongnyon is an authoritative and dignified organization of overseas citizens of the DPRK. We will decisively cope with the attack on Chongnyon and its subsidiary organizations and Japan-resident Koreans, regarding it as an attack on the DPRK. The Japanese authorities boasting of Japan being "a constitutional state" took no step to check the incident that occurred in the city center of Tokyo. They must now make a thoroughgoing investigation into the incident, apologize for it, arrest and punish all the criminals responsible for the provocation, make clear the truth behind the incident and take responsible steps to prevent the reccurence of such incidents. A MINJU CHOSON analyst says: If an unhappy thing occurred due to the sinister acts of the reactionary forces against Chongnyon and its branch organs, we will regard it as a provocation against the DPRK and call the Japanese authorities to account for it.
