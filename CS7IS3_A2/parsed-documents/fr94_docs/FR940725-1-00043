FR940725-1-00043 FR940725-1-00009 (3) *␣*␣* (i) *␣*␣* Prior to issuance of the order, the juvenile must have received the full due process rights guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States. * * * * * 17. Paragraph (f)(3)(iv) in §31.303 is amended by revising the last sentence thereof to read as follows: §31.303 Valid Court Order. (f) *␣*␣* (3) *␣*␣* (iv) *␣*␣* A juvenile alleged or found in a violation hearing to have violated a valid court order may be held only in a secure juvenile detention or correctional facility, and not in an adult jail or lockup. * * * * * 18. Paragraph (f)(3)(vi) in §31.303 is amended by adding the following to the end of the paragraph: §31.303 Valid Court Order. (f) *␣*␣* (3) *␣*␣* (vi) *␣*␣* This determination must be informed by a written report, to the judge, that: reviews the behavior of the juvenile and the circumstances under which the juvenile was brought before the court and made subject to such order; determines the reasons for the juvenile's behavior; and determines whether all dispositions other than secure confinement have been exhausted or are clearly inappropriate. This report must be prepared and submitted by a public agency or organization other than a court or law enforcement agency. A multidisciplinary review team that operates independently of courts or law enforcement agencies would satisfy this requirement even if some individual members of the team represented court or law enforcement agencies. * * * * * 19. Paragraph (f)(4)(vi) in §31.303 is revised to read as follows: §31.303 Rural Area. (f) *␣*␣* (4) *␣*␣* (vi) Pursuant to section 223(a)(14) of the JJDP Act, the non-MSA (low population density) exception to the jail and lockup removal requirement as described in paragraphs (f)(4) (i) through (v) of this section shall remain in effect through 1997, and shall allow for secure custody beyond the 24 hour period described in paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section when the facility is located where conditions of distance to be traveled or the lack of highway, road, or other ground transportation do not allow for court appearances within 24 hours, so that a brief (not to exceed an additional 48 hours) delay is excusable; or the facility is located where conditions of safety exist (such as severely adverse, life-threatening weather conditions that do not allow for reasonably safe travel), in which case the time for an appearance may be delayed until 24 hours after the time that such conditions allow for reasonably safe travel. States may use these additional statutory allowances only where the precedent requirements set forth in paragraphs (f)(4) (i) through (v) of this section have been complied with. This may necessitate statutory or judicial (court rule or opinion) relief within the State from the 24 hour initial court appearance standard required by paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section. States must document and describe in their annual monitoring report to OJJDP, the specific circumstances surrounding each individual use of the distance/ground transportation, and weather allowances. * * * * * 20. Paragraph (f)(5) in §31.303 is revised to read as follows: §31.303 Monitoring Report. (f) *␣*␣* (5) Reporting Requirement. The State shall report annually to the Administrator of OJJDP on the results of monitoring for section 223(a) (12), (13), and (14) of the JJDP Act. The reporting period should provide 12 months of data, but shall not be less than six months. The report shall be submitted to the Administrator of OJJDP by December 31 of each year. (i) To demonstrate compliance with section 223(a)(12)(A) of the JJDP Act, the report must include, at a minimum, the following information for the current reporting period: (A) Dates covered by the current reporting period. (B) Total number of public and private secure detention and correctional facilities, the total number reporting, and the number inspected on-site. (C) The total number of accused status offenders and nonoffenders, including out-of-state runaways and Federal wards, held in any secure detention or correctional facility for longer than 24 hours (not including weekends or holidays), excluding those held pursuant to the valid court order provision as set forth in paragraph (f)(3) of this section. (D) The total number of accused status offenders and nonoffenders, including out-of-state runaways and Federal wards, held in any secure detention or correctional facility for less than 24 hours for purposes other than identification, investigation, release to parent(s), or transfer to a nonsecure facility. (E) The total number of accused status offenders (including valid court order violations) and nonoffenders securely detained in any adult jail, lockup, or nonapproved collocated facility for less than 24 hours. (F) The total number of adjudicated status offenders and nonoffenders, including out-of-state runaways and Federal wards, held for any length of time in a secure detention or correctional facility, excluding those held pursuant to the valid court order provision.
