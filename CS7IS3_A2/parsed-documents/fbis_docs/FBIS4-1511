"Each Taiwan resident consumed an average of eight grams of gold in 1993, the highest among all countries around the world," a spokesman for the world council's representative office in Taipei said Saturday [26 March]. Hong Kong trailed behind, with each resident consuming six grams of gold on average, the spokesman said. Mainland China, however, took the lead in total gold consumption at 223 metric tons, the spokesman noted. Per capita gold consumption on the mainland stood at 0.2 grams last year. According to the council's tallies, Taiwan consumed 160.6 tons of gold in 1993, while Hong Kong's consumption totaled 36.4 tons. Altogether, the spokesman said, the three Chinese societies consumed 420 tons of gold in 1993 alone, accounting for 65 percent of Asia's total consumption. A recent survey conducted by the World Gold Trade Promotion Council found that more than 80 percent of Taiwan, Hong Kong and mainland consumers like pure gold jewelry, particularly those fashionably designed and reasonably priced. It also found that women between 16 and 34 were the mainstay of the clientele. The spokesman said he believes the burgeoning "greater China economic sphere" will be the world's most important gold market in the years ahead. A seminar on the latest gold jewelry design trends and a gold jewelry design contest are being held in Taipei under the auspices of the gold council. "The events are aimed at helping Taiwan goldsmiths and designers expand their market shares," the spokesman noted.
