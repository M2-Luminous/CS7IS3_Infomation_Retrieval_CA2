He told the semi-official newspaper AL-AHRAM the men were rounded up "a few days ago" on charges of hampering the execution of court rulings. He refused to identify the men and did not specify the charges. Although the Moslem Brotherhood was banned in 1954, it has been largely tolerated by the Egyptian government because of its non- violent stance. Some of its members have in the past joined the parliament in coalition with other parties. But the government has lost patience with the group after it took part in rallies last month protesting the death of lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani, who died while in police custody. Four members were also arrested last month for allegedly distributing anti-government leaflets. Brotherhood leader Hamid Abu-al-Nasr was questioned on Sunday on the same charges, after answering a summons. Moslem militants have been waging a two-year campaign to topple the government of President Husni Mubarak in which close to 400 people have been killed.
