The assembly also unanimously adopted a "resolution calling for the expansion of harbor areas near Naha Port" in order to promote the second reclamation project, and a "statement calling for an early lifting of the ban on the use by civilians of water areas that are now used exclusively by Makiminato Supply Depot." The statement against relocating Naha Military Port said, "there are news reports of plans to relocate Naha Military Port to Makiminato Supply Depot." It continued: "The relocation could greatly impede a reclamation project that Urasoe City plans to promote. We absolutely do not approve of the relocation." Explaining why the ruling party supported the statement against the relocation of the military port, assembly member Genichi Uehara said: "The alleged secret agreement on the relocation of Naha Military Port has turned out to be groundless. Successive mayors of Urasoe City have opposed the relocation." The statement against the relocation of Naha Military Port will be mailed to the prime minister, the foreign minister, the transport minister, the director general of the Defense Agency, the director general of Okinawa Development Agency, the director general of the Defense Facilities Administration Agency, the governor of Okinawa Prefecture, and Okinawan officials in charge of managing major ports in Naha City. The resolution calling for the expansion of harbor areas near Naha Port was adopted by the assembly on the basis of an agreement concluded between the mayors of Naha and Urasoe Cities. Under the agreement, Urasoe City, not Naha City, is in charge of managing the waterfront areas, and will meet the costs of reclaiming land along the waterfront. The resolution was adopted by a vote of 15-4. A statement on the resolution issued by Naha City said: "It is best if the assembly adopts the resolution unanimously, but this is a case where it cannot do so." In response, Urasoe City plans to ask the Naha City Harbor Deliberation Council for advice on how to expand the waterfront areas available for reclamation.
