FR941104-1-00052 FR941104-1-00009 10. Port-Orford-cedar ( Chamaecyparis lawsoniana ). Port-Orford-cedar (POC) is endemic to southwestern Oregon as well as northwestern California, in an area that is generally coastal, mostly from about Coos Bay to Arcata. The species has been significantly reduced in natural standing volume, and is now logged almost entirely for export (primarily to Japan). An introduced pathogen ( Phytophthora lateralis ) has been spreading particularly as a side effect of soil transport by vehicles and logging equipment. Within the comment period the Service received 28 comments, 17 in favor of submitting a proposal to include this species in CITES Appendix II, and 11 against. Dr. D.B. Zobel, a plant ecologist and professor at Oregon State University, who has studied and/or observed the species and its situation since 1972 and is senior author of the monograph Ecology, Pathology, and Management of Port-Orford-Cedar (1985), considered that an attempt to control POC harvest through CITES would not be appropriate or effective, and could be counterproductive. He provided a detailed review that sometimes questioned whether assertions of threat, management, or protection were unproven belief or fact. Dr. T.T. Lawson, a forest pathologist of Lawson-Rasor Associates, who has spent several years monitoring research and control efforts on the POC disease, submitted a detailed evaluation and concluded that listing POC in Appendix II is appropriate and needed to reduce spread of the root pathogen. Dr. E.M. Hansen, Professor of Forest Pathology at Oregon State University, has worked with POC and Phytophthora lateralis for 22 years. He submitted detailed information and data about research on the root-rot disease and assessments of its present status and potential effects. While continuing to be seriously concerned about the impact of the disease on POC, he opposed listing because he believed that [even] halting log exports would not slow the spread of the disease, and might indirectly lead to a reduction in the management efforts to protect POC. The Oregon Natural Resources Council provided additional information on POC and its situation, including the report ( In press ) by T.T. Lawson, Port-Orford-Cedar: A Species Under Siege. The Siskiyou Regional Education Project and Siskiyou Audubon Society supported proposed inclusion of the species in Appendix II, providing a detailed analytical report. They stated that POC has been found to be a keystone species in riparian forests, enhancing their biodiversity (including fisheries), and that this species also is sometimes a critical riparian colonizer. They questioned various relatively recent regional and local USFS administrative plans, decisions, and activities. They detailed concerns and evidence about spread of the disease, even into areas designated as wilderness, wild-and-scenic rivers, and botanical areas, consequent to salvage-logging and new logging operations as well as travel on back-country roads inadequately restricted or not closed. They included and endorsed a statement also sent separately by Mr. J. Rogers, a professional forester of Rogers & Associates who since 1968 has been familiar with the species and consequences of the root-rot disease from logging. He stated that unless export is halted, most of what remains of the species will be logged and/or infected, including the largest known individual of the species. The NRDC expressed support for inclusion of this species in Appendix II, and supplied detailed additional information and data on its situation. They stated that this species is the only Pacific Northwest conifer that can still be exported from Federal lands in log form legally since it had been designated a surplus commodity, and because of high foreign demand for logs_almost exclusively from old-growth trees. They noted concerns about genetic erosion, and provided details regarding the water mold and its potential and likelihood of spreading. The NRDC believes that a halt to logging has become necessary. Greenpeace USA supported the proposal to include the species in Appendix II, stating among other concerns that continued logging of the best POC stocks could further reduce the genetic reserves of the species and the possibility of finding potential genotypes that could resist or overcome the disease. The Fauna and Flora Preservation Society (London, U.K.) indicated that the export appeared to clearly warrant inclusion of the species in Appendix II. The chair of the AIA Rainforest and Natural Resources Task Group, who is also a member of the Steering Group of the AIA Committee on the Environment, wrote on behalf of the architects of the AIA, in favor of inclusion of this species. He stated that he understood CITES Appendix II listing would not constitute a trade ban, and that inclusion of the species could help architects and designers to make more responsible and objective decisions concerning its use [since they could purchase from the CITES-approved supplies]. During the comment period eight letters from the general public supported submission of a proposal to include POC in Appendix II.
