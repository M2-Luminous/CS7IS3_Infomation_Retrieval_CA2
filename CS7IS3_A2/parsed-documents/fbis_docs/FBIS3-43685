Allegations of drug smuggling have rocked Chiluba's cabinet in recent weeks and cast doubt on the future of his government. Chiluba spokesman Richard Sakala says the reshuffle cannot be interpreted as an admission of guilt. [Begin recording] [Sakala] He has made the reshuffle to replace ministers who had resigned, in particular, there were three ministers ... [changes thought] two ministers who have resigned -- the minister of foreign affairs, Mr. Vernon Mwaanga, and Princess Nakatindi. These were two cabinet ministers. Mr. Mwaanga, as I said was Foreign Affairs, and Princess Nakatindi was Community Development and Social Welfare. Now these two resigned in order to give government an opportunity to investigate allegations that have been made in the media and by some people, that they were involved in drug trafficking. They felt that an investigation could not be carried out effectively if they remained in office and, as a matter of principle, they decided to step down to allow for an investigation. [De Preuter] Now how are you going to ensure that the investigations into these allegations will not be a cover-up? [Sakala] Yes absolutely, the investigations will be done. We have, what we call the DEC, the Drug Enforcement Commission, which is a body that deals with nothing but investigations and prosecutions in the cases of drugs, and these matters have been referred to them and they will undertake an investigation, and obviously, at the end of it all they will produce a report for everybody to see. [De Preuter] The Zambian people appeared to have lost faith in the Chiluba government as far as corruption and drug trafficking is concerned. What are you going to do to restore that confidence? [Sakala] I don't know the basis of that conclusion, because yesterday at the press conference it was made very clear -- in fact the president did produce a report of investigations that have been undertaken into issues of corruption where ministers are involved. All the cases involving about five ministers, who are alleged to be involved in corruption, were fully investigated by the anti- corruption commission and where necessary steps were taken. The director of public prosecution was advised to consider prosecution, and where he felt it fit, he would prosecute. There is not a single minister who has been prosecuted for corruption because there has been no such corruption proved against them. [end recording]
