"I can could get angry and disclose some things," he said. The Renamo leader said this at his residence shortly after introducing to the public the 30 Renamo advisers chosen to work with the provincial governors as of next week. Afonso Dhlakama is particularly concerned about continuing accusations by the government that Renamo's bases are harboring a Malawi Young Pioneers battalion. "I have already said that that they are welcome to investigate the matter on the ground or to fetch at least one of those men so he can be shown to the public," the Renamo leader said. "UN Special Representative Dr. Aldo Ajello has helicopters and trucks that he can use. There are UN observers here, and they can go to the bases to see if it is true," he added. He thinks the government and the press are acting in bad faith and making serious accusations when they say Renamo received support from Malawi and its leaders traveled in Malawian aircraft and were seen in the company of Malawian policemen or Malawian religious figures. "Today, it appears to be a novelty to the government that we used Malawi as a stopover, a place where meetings took place to get the peace process moving," he said, adding that "President Chissano and I agreed to use Malawian territory for secret meetings among our men." He also noted that "many people do not know that Chissano sent Minister Pascoal Mocumbi to Malawi to meet Jose de Castro before the signing of the General Peace Accord. President Chissano and I authorized that meeting. Many people are not aware that I flew on several occasions to Malawi during the war to meet [Italian peace broker] Mario Rafaelli, Herman Cohen, and with religious leaders. I met Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe in Malawi. The government knows that we used aircraft and cars to go there and that we were accompanied by Malawian policemen. How can they now come forward disclosing things which they are well aware of?" Dhlakama insisted on the need for the government and the press to show good faith. He says that there is no journalist, researcher, or historian trying to get the truth from Renamo. About Kenya, for instance, he says that he only got to know Nairobi after Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi had come to Maputo and had been asked by Chissano to become involved in the Mozambican peace process. "I had gone to Nairobi to meet the bishops when Chissano convinced Moi to allow his territory to be used for such encounters. It was there that I received the first message saying `let us talk about an end to the war.' Then, Kenya and Malawi became stopovers on our way to Rome from Gorongosa or Maringue," the Renamo leader explained. Afonso Dhlakama noted that his party "has many responsibilities in this country," adding that that is why "we avoid responsing to such accusations with facts and disclosures which could compromise the government." Dhlakama says he has disclosures to make in good time or not at all. "We are only too well aware that the government might become seriously unsettled over certain disclosures about things we used to do together in those times." The Renamo leader added that "we should not be taking part in dishonest politics." However, Afonso Dhlakama sees two findings as rather reassuring: "Chissano is a serious man who wants peace" and the government resorts to "petty behavior" in relation to Renamo because it knows full well that "it is a strong party, a great opponent." And he added, ironically: "If we were a small party, they would have given us five vehicles, some houses here and there, and that would have been enough. We might even have been friends."
