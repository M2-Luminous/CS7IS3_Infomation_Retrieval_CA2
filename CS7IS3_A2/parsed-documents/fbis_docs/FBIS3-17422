The Present State of Russia. A Brief Description The present state of Russia may be defined as general crisis enveloping the main spheres of social life -- statehood and the economy, politics and culture, everyday life and morality. The "free" market has divided society. A tiny minority is becoming fabulously rich out of plundering national wealth. While the huge majority whose labor created that wealth is reduced to poverty. The swift division is breeding a civil split and social strife. Ruthless exploitation of working people and the embezzlement of natural resources are taking place in Russia. The people have been deprived of fundamental socioeconomic and political rights. Economic crime has become the basis for all other types of crime. The criminalization of society is threatening personal and public safety. The class of a new bourgeoisie, primarily a comprador bourgeoisie, is being purposefully and swiftly formed through the destruction of the social sphere and the Russian state. Since the forcible elimination of the soviets in September-October 1993 an authoritarian regime -- a regime of personal presidential power -- has been established in Russia. In effect what has been established is dictatorship by capital, which is merging with the criminal world. The corrupt state apparatus is serving the interests of mafia clans, which control much of the country's economy. The people are debarred from management and from monitoring state power. The confrontation between the ruling regime and the huge majority of the population is deepening with every passing day. There is a ripening understanding among the masses that the general crisis enveloping Russia is the consequence of the breakdown of the socialist system and the deliberate destruction of a unified and powerful state -- the USSR. The Soviet Union was the victim of betrayal by the ruling elite which had seized the leading posts in the CPSU and of the actions of national-separatists, who aligned themselves with the most aggressive forces of international capital, which is seeking a new repartition of the world. The perestroyka of socialism announced by the bureaucratic CPSU elite turned out to be an adventure without precedent in the history of manipulations of mass consciousness. The so-called "new thinking" and demagoguery about "pan-human values" eroded ideas about working people's genuine interests and about the country's national, state interests. This was aided by the "radical democrats," who secured the adoption of declarations of the sovereignty of Russia and other republics and ratification of the Belovezhskaya agreements, which ignore the results of the referendum on preserving the USSR. The destruction of the Soviet Union created a threat of the disintegration of Russia, exacerbated national relations everywhere, and resulted in fratricidal civil wars. A great power was thrown onto the margins of world politics. It is increasingly becoming a raw materials appendage, a market for low-grade goods, and a source of cheap skilled manpower. The crisis that has erupted in Russia is taking place in conditions of a world crisis. The West is seeking to escape it at the expense of our country. The weakening of Russia is to the advantage of the strategists of the new world order. The threat of economic, political, and spiritual enslavement hangs over a great multinational community of people linked by a common historical destiny. II. The Lessons of History and the Way Out of the Crisis At the start of the 20th century the exacerbation of inter-imperialist contradictions led to our country's involvement in World War I contrary to its national-state interests. The October Socialist Revolution extricated Russia from that war. Great October was a breakthrough to the future -- to socialism. History demonstrated that the turn onto the path of socialist development ensured the sovereignty of the working people, the qualitative renewal of the centuries-old Russian statehood, and the salvation of Russia as a great power. After tremendous sacrifices caused by World War I and the civil war, the party elaborated a program for stable development -- it took the road of the New Economic Policy. The NEP prevented a fresh outbreak of civil war and ensured the necessary conditions for the next stages of state development: electrification and industrialization of the national economy, broad socialization of the means of production in city and countryside, and cultural revolution. This policy underwent serious changes as a result of the external threat hanging over the USSR. The mobilization economy and the swift development of education, science, and technology enabled the country to create the necessary potential for defense from military danger. This subsequently ensured restoration of the war-ravaged economy within the shortest possible time. Social ownership and the people's selfless, heroic labor saved the country. Despite the distortions and the violations of democracy and legality, the people's masses retained and strengthened their belief in socialism. At the same time the mobilization economy, which had demonstrated its effectiveness during the war and the restoration of the national economy, began to lag behind the demands of the scientific and technical revolution that had begun in the world. Without democratization and improvements in the management system, without the use of flexible and adaptable forms of economic activity, it became a brake on the development of many spheres of social life. Society needed new ideas and stimulation of the creative and production activeness of individuals and labor collectives. However, the reforms launched for these purposes did not produce the expected result. Everything was stifled by the opposition of the party bureaucracy, the unpreparedness of cadres, and the inertia of mass consciousness. Socialism's economic potential was not realized in conditions of the world technological and information revolution. The pursuit of wealth by any means, careerism, corruption, irresponsibility, and incompetence were not properly assessed in society. Private capitalist tendencies emerged in society. The exploited section of working people began to lose faith in the justice of the existing system, which devalued socialist and communist ideals in the eyes of millions. The crisis enveloping Soviet society stemmed to a considerable extent from the crisis in the CPSU, which had been the ruling party for many decades. Its theoretical activity and methods of managing the economy and the state as a whole were in particular need of renewal. The "communist arrogance" of the leaders, who had come to believe that their position was unshakable, plunged the CPSU into the state of a "conceited party," which in turn foreshadowed its defeat. The inequality between the party "leadership" and the "grassroots" emerged increasingly clearly; the careerists became increasingly deeply isolated from the millions of Communists and from the working people. The CPSU was transformed from a mass party into an apparatus party. The upshot of this was primarily that the CPSU, assuming responsibility for all spheres of social development, was unable to find solutions to pressing problems. The gap between word and deed, between program promises and the fulfillment of those promises, became increasingly marked. The errors and miscalculations made by the CPSU in the process of socialist building were presented in a distorted form by the mass media, which were in the hands of renegades and pseudo-democrats. The consciousness of the working people's masses was thoroughly muddied by a powerful stream of denigration of Soviet history. Along with ideological and psychological indoctrination of the masses, a section of the working class was suborned for use in the political struggle against the Communists and Soviet power. As a result the majority of the working population remained indifferent to the dramatic fate of the CPSU and the soviets. The so-called "Gorbachev perestroyka," which was ostensibly aimed at renewing socialism, deepening democracy, and overcoming the distortions and abuses, was in fact a deviation from socialism. The equality of all forms of ownership was proclaimed and the role of the most viable form -- social ownership -- was undermined in every way, and the essence and forms of the cooperative movement were distorted. This gave a free hand to shady capital and other antisocialist and antipeople forces opposed to the gains of October, Soviet power, and the unified union state. During this period the conditions were created for a transition to a monopoly of private ownership and for the fusion of the new bourgeoisie and corrupt functionaries. Yeltsin's "reforms," the liberalization of prices, and the predatory privatization struck a crushing blow to the country's economy and caused chaos and disarray, total impoverishment of the people, and a slide by society toward national catastrophe. The political formalization of these actions was the August events of 1991, October 1993, and the finagling through of a constitution of private ownership and presidential autocracy via a referendum supported by a minority of voters. The country can and must emerge from the crisis. How can this be done? This is impossible, first, without stopping the capitalization and colonization of the country, and, second, without turning toward socialism. The CPRF [Communist Party of the Russian Federation] sees three political stages in consistently resolving these tasks: a general democratic stage, people's power; the transition to socialism along with the restoration of the power of the soviets, working people's power; socialist development proper. During the first stage Communists in alliance with the progressive patriotic movement seek the formation of a government of the people's trust. This is called upon to eliminate the catastrophic consequences of the "reforms" and to stop the slump in production. Here it is necessary to return to the population the illegally appropriated (privatized) property and to involve working people in control over production and the distribution of national wealth. During this stage the mixed economy foisted on society is retained. The government and representative organs of power ensure security and the country's independence from the colonial policy of the makers of the "new world order" and promote integration processes among the former USSR republics. During the second stage, after relative stability has been attained, working people increasingly participate in the management of the state via soviets, strike committees, and other social organs of people's power brought forth by life. A transition to transformations based on the dominance of the socialist mode and the consistent economic elimination of private ownership begins. The third stage of social transformations is the development of a socialist society on the basis of post-industrial and information technologies while utilizing the best domestic and world achievements of science and culture. We see the new socialism as a society stimulating the individual's creative activeness and working people's self-management. At the same time the foundations are laid for the future -- a communist association in which the free development of each will be the condition of the free development of all. III. The Minimum Program During the first stage, proceeding from tactical aims, the CPRF deems it necessary to implement a number of priority measures and presents these in a minimum program. Using vigorous activity in the Russian Federation Federal Assembly and all accepted methods of extraparliamentary struggle, the CPRF will seek: In politics -- the formation of a government of people's trust accountable to the Russian Federation Federal Assembly; -- nationwide discussion of a new constitution and its adoption by a real majority of voters; -- the adoption of a new electoral law; -- the restoration of the Soviet form of people's power; -- national accord on the basis of a renaissance of the age-old friendship of the peoples; -- the restoration of the union state by constitutional means and on a voluntary basis, beginning with denunciation of the Belovezhskaya agreements; -- the implementation of an independent foreign policy according with the country's national-state interests and its security, even including the abrogation of international treaties and agreements damaging Russia's interests and dignity. In the economy -- a change in economic course, the abandonment of "shock therapy," and the implementation of measures of state regulation with a view to ending the slump in production and combating inflation and unemployment; -- the reform of tax policy with a view to stimulating investment in domestic production; -- state regulation of the sale of military output on the world market; -- the elaboration of targeted programs of state support for producers for specific sectors of the national economy (primarily science-driven, high-technology production facilities); -- state support for highly productive and efficient farms in the agro-industrial complex irrespective of their forms of organization and ownership; -- state investments in modern production facilities for the processing of agricultural output; -- the priority right of commodity producers (kolkhozes, sovkhozes, joint-stock companies, farmers) to acquire controlling blocks of shares during the flotation of enterprises in the food and processing sectors of industry; -- the establishment of control by the Russian Federation Federal Assembly over the expenditure of money on major projects in order to prevent departmentalism and parochialism in forming the expenditure side of the state budget; -- the elaboration of a state program to extricate the country from the environmental crisis; -- the creation of state, regional programs to ensure employment; the definition of a package of measures to eliminate unemployment. In the social sphere -- the restitution to Russia's citizens of guaranteed socioeconomic rights: to labor, rest, housing, free education and medical services, and a secure old age; -- the formulation and signing by the supreme organs of state power and the trade unions of an agreement on ensuring a realistic subsistence minimum for working people; -- guarantees of the preservation of working people's property; -- state support for the family, mothers, and children, the restoration of the destroyed network of preschool and young people's cultural, recuperative, and sports institutions, support for the disabled and pensioners, and the introduction of state grants for underprivileged families; -- the priority safeguarding by the state of the development of science, education, and culture at a higher standard than that of advanced countries, as used to be the case even during the difficult postwar years; -- the creation of state-guaranteed normal conditions for the life of servicemen and their families and the safeguarding of dignified living conditions for retired servicemen, first and foremost job availability; -- the restoration of state centers for youth training and employment. In the protection of the people's personal and public safety and spiritual health The CPRF advocates the peaceful development of revolution but will not be indifferent to violence against the working people or the flouting of human and civil rights. It has supported and will support civil resistance and disobedience toward illegality and tyranny, utilizing all forms of nonviolent resistance. It will seek: -- the restoration, through the mediums of public education and enlightenment and the mass media, of the prestige of honest, voluntary labor and a creative attitude to things in general, to the traditions of community and Russian collectivism, and to the Russian language and the culture of the peoples of Russia, which are the basis and medium for spiritual inter-ethnic communication and mutual enrichment; -- an end to the policy of implanting westernism and Americanism, historical vandalism, and the cult of profit, violence, and depravity; -- the prohibition of the propagation of ideological revanchism and political vengeance; -- an end to the denigration of Soviet history and the memory and teaching of V.I. Lenin; -- the suppression of crime and the toughening of punitive measures against people engaged in the theft of property, corruption, speculation, banditry, and the selling off of the country's natural and intellectual resources; -- the adoption of laws to intensify the struggle against organized crime, to protect witnesses and judges, and to provide social guarantees for law-enforcment agency staffers. IV. The CPRF Is a Party of State Patriotism and Social Justice The CPRF is a party of the working people. Its traces its lineage through the Russian Social Democratic Workers Party, the Russian Social Democratic Workers Party (Bolsheviks), the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks), the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and the Communist Party of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. The CPRF takes on board everything of value from the past experience of the Russian and world communist movement, which is enabling it to take shape as a self-renewing party of working people seeking to provide answers to the most acute problems currently arising for society. In the current specific historical conditions the CPRF utilizes nonviolent methods for changing social life and opposes developments which could lead to civil war. The fatherland will be saved by an effective alliance of progressive state-patriotic forces. The CPRF expresses and defends the interests of hired labor, the overwhelming majority of whom are industrial and agricultural workers. The program being formulated by the party is intended to become a document for working people to determine the direction of their life so they can say, as during Lenin's time: "Here we have our comrades, our brothers, here we have our common cause." The strengthening of the alliance of workers, peasants, and the intelligentsia and the solidarity of working people of all nationalities is not history but an insistent requirement of the present day. The working class will fulfill its historic mission if it is aware of the vital need for society to emerge on the path of socialist development. If it heads up a people-wide, nationwide movement for Russia's independence and integrity and for the restoration of the union state. It is the CPRF's duty to give it every assistance here. The disintegration of the Soviet Union and the destruction of the state and economic foundations of the Russian Federation have led primarily to social vulnerability for working people. The establishment in the country of the omnipotence of mafia comprador capital, for whom the motherland is a commodity, has also hit the interests of the small stratum of patriotically minded private property owners and civil servants. In present-day conditions the CPRF defines state patriotism as the ideal of a Great Russia, the ideal of restoring a Soviet union state and acquiring reliable allies beyond its borders. The CPRF considers that the strengthening of the nationwide patriotic ideal is only demonstrated when it is combined with the socialist ideal. V. The CPRF Is a Party Advocating an Alliance of Communist Parties and Unity of Action by All Communists The CPRF is an independent party which has defined its path to the future as the path of the nonviolent transition of society to a socialist condition. The CPRF considers that the communist parties active in the former union republics are independent political organizations. The CPRF advocates an equal and strong alliance among them and regards this as an essential precondition for the restoration of the union state. The CPRF advocates cooperation among the communist parties active in the Russian Federation on condition of their recognition of the restoration of the union state on a voluntary basis; the restoration of the Soviet state system; the inadmissibility of political extremism in any form; noninterference in intraparty affairs and inadmissibility of abuse against one another; and unity of action in fulfilling the commitments assumed by each side. The CPRF does not permit double membership -- the presence in its ranks of members of another party with its own program and statutes. The CPRF is a party of creative Marxism and progressive social thinking and advocates the constant exchange of ideas and experience. The CPRF sets the following as priority tasks for its activity inside and outside the party:" -- the organizational strengthening of the party, starting with its foundation -- primary party organizations; -- the ensuring of party discipline on the basis of equality and moral relations among party members; -- the giving of moral and material assistance to the older generation of the CPRF -- CPSU veterans; -- the expansion of the reserve of party activists and activist party supporters; -- participation in elections to organs of supreme and local power and organs of local self-government; -- maximum utilization of the party's factions in the Federal Assembly and local organs of power and self-government to protect the interests of hired labor; -- the ensuring of a CPRF presence in all spheres of social life; -- the maximum utilization of legal forms of work in labor collectives; -- the conducting of actions in defense of rights to support the just demands of labor collectives and all working people; -- the implementation of measures of social assistance to deprived people; -- the defense of civil and human rights when they are violated in the Russian Federation and nearby and distant foreign countries; --the scientific and ethical protection of the fatherland's history and its Soviet period; -- participation in various forms of nationwide people's patriotic movements for the restoration of the friendship of the peoples and the union state. The CPRF retains the red color of its banner and the symbol of working people's unity -- the hammer and sickle. The CPRF's slogan is: "Russia, labor, people's power, socialism." The theses were adopted as a basis at a CPRF Central Executive Committee plenum on 15 March 1994. The text was finalized taking account of proposals received from the commission approved by the plenum with the following membership: Comrades Belov, Zorkaltsev, Zyuganov, Kosolapov, Kuptsov, Lukyanov, Melnikov, Osadchiy, Slavin, Tsiku, and Shabanov.
