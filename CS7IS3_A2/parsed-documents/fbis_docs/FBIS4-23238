FBIS4-23238 "drafr105_e_94013" FBIS-AFR-94-105 Daily Report 31 May 1994 WEST AFRICA Nigeria NADECO Official on Reasons for Continuing Boycott NADECO Official on Reasons for Continuing Boycott AB3105174394 London BBC World Service in English 0600 GMT 31 May 94 AB3105174394 London BBC World Service English BFN [From the "Network Africa" program] [Text] The elections for a national constitutional conference, organized by the military government, ended on schedule over the weekend, in spite of a boycott in some parts of the country. Well, the boycott was called by the NADECO, the National Democratic Coalition. NADECO say they want a sovereign national conference, whose decisions would be final, instead of this one, which they fear may not have any significant powers. The government says that the conference will start its work on 27 June on schedule, but NADECO says that, in spite of that, its boycott will continue. Well, the former governor of Ogun State, Chief Segun Osoba, is a leading member of NADECO. Sola Odunfa met him and asked him what they are going to do now: [Begin recording] [Osoba] We intend to start series of legitimate actions, legitimate actions -- I want to repeat -- to ensure that we get our rights. [Odunfa] The military government has all instruments of coercion. The first which they can use is to arrest all of you and dump you in detention. Are you prepared for that? [Osoba] I have told my family that as soon as they do not hear from me, they should know that I have been arrested. We are all ready, in fact fully mobilized, to be detained, and we are fully ready for whatever action the government may want to take. [Odunfa] Is this action not belated? Why did you not take this action when the election was annulled last year? [Osoba] At that time, the government created a division within the political class, and they were using the leadership of the two political parties to cause the confusion, and so there was no united front. But when the military came in, we thought we could give them a chance -- hoping that they will rectify the situation quickly. Up till now, we don't know the program of this government, which is unfortunate. A military government should come in to do a surgical operation and leave immediately. So unfortunately, this government hasn't given us any political program of any kind. We don't even know the agenda of this conference, nobody knows the rules and regulations governing this conference, there is no enabling decree governing this conference, so everything is illegal. And that is why we are moving, because we now think that we are back again to an unending transitional program that we started in 1985. [Odunfa] Will it therefore be correct to take this, your proposed action, as a direct confrontation with the military? [Osoba] I wouldn't call it confrontation with the military, because we respect the majority of our compatriots in uniform as being patriotic, and not part of the little clique who want to cling to power. So, we should separate the military, as a group who believe that they must go back to professionalism. That movement started under Babangida, and 99 percent of those still in uniform are still in support of democratization. But, there is a small clique of them who are politicians in uniform, who are bent on staying in power -- a continuous change of baton from one uniformed military head of state to another one. There is that small cabal that we are facing, not the entire military. [end recording]
