Certain people said it had a political motive and that it was connected to divergences within the PL. To competent observers however, the alleged murder attempt on Justin Mugenzi was just for show. After a close examination of the facts, one is hardly convinced that a real murder attempt took place. First of all, the news was announced that very evening by RTLM radio [FM station in Rwanda]. One is left to wonder how it was that the radio station was the first to broadcast the news in such a short period of time--the very evening of the murder attempt. Secondly, it was said that the would-be criminal used a pistol in the murder attempt on Mugenzi's well-protected life. However, it is difficult to understand how one could lay an ambush with a pistol, especially against someone flanked by a bodyguard and inside a vehicle. Finally, Radio Kigali said that there had been heavy shooting, whereas Mr. Justin Mugenzi's bodyguard said the criminal had fired three or four bullets after the vehicle left. It is clear that it was just a performance to make the public believe that someone wanted to kill Justin Mugenzi for political reasons and to discredit his opponents. It is worth recalling that Mr. Mugenzi is being manipulated by the president of the Republic, Juvenal Habyarimana, to delay the establishment of the broad-based transitional institutions.
