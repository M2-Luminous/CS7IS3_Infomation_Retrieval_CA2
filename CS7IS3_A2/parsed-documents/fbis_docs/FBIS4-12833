FBIS4-12833 "drnes072_s_94011" FBIS-NES-94-072 Daily Report 13 Apr 1994 Iran Regime's `Antipopular' Policy on Kurds Viewed Regime's `Antipopular' Policy on Kurds Viewed NC1404091894 (Clandestine) Voice of Iranian Kordestan in Persian 1630 GMT 13 Apr 94 NC1404091894 (Clandestine) Voice of Iranian Kordestan Persian BFN [Unattributed commentary] [Excerpts] During the past few months, the clerical regime has again limited border transactions in the Iranian-Iraqi border areas and regime officials in the various cities of Kordestan are alleging that this directive has been issued by the National Security Council and should be seriously [words [indistinct]. When the residents in Iranian and Iraqi Kurdistan can meet their needs through such local transactions, the closing of routes and borders in this way is considered incorrect, a kind of hostility by the Islamic Republic against the people of Iraqi Kurdistan. The clerical regime has not closed the border routes to everyone and every type of transaction. It has encouraged some of its own people and profiteering entrepreneurs to disregard the closure of the borders and go to Iraqi Kurdistan to continue the regime's old policy of plundering and pillaging national assets and destroying the economic basis of the region. [passage omitted] A glance at this antipopular attitude shows the depth of the regime's hostility toward the Kurdish people on both sides of the border. It also shows that by plundering and pillaging Iraqi Kurdistan it wants to destroy the livelihood of the people in this area and that it is determined to resort to violence toward the people in Iranian Kordestan to keep them impoverished. The Islamic Republic is doing its best to upset things in Iraqi Kurdistan and it stops at no plot or unsuitable act in this direction. The clergymen are constantly trying to coordinate their policy and acts with Ankara and Damascus against the situation in Iraqi Kurdistan. Clearly, the Islamic Republic is not satisfied with this and, by persistently trying to export narcotics and terrorist elements in a bid to spread corruption and insecurity in Iraqi Kurdistan, it is daily increasing the hostility it shows toward the Kurdish people in Iraqi Kurdistan. Undoubtedly, the people in Iraqi Kurdistan have realized the hostile nature of the clerical regime and know of its tension seeking policies. They know how hostile the Islamic Republic is toward the Kurdish people in general and how dissatisfied it is with things in Iraqi Kurdistan in particular. The people's hatred and aversion toward the Islamic Republic of Iran grow daily and the regime is regarded as the sworn enemy of the Kurds.
