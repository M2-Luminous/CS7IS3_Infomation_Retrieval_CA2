If there were any lingering doubts that Bill Clinton would renew its Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trading privileges, a decision many believed was already inevitable, then the sudden release from prison of democracy activist Wang Juntao removed them at a stroke. With an astute eye on the U.S. political scene, China handed Mr Clinton the gilt-edged gesture he so desperately needed to honourably fulfil his pledge of no MFN without "significant progress" on human rights. For good measure, Beijing even threw in a second smaller carrot, with the revelation it had reached unspecified "understandings" with the International Committee of the Red Cross over another issue that has been at heart of the MFN debate; that of access to mainland prisons. The news will come as an unexpected gift to Chief Secretary Anson Chan Fang On-sang as she today begins her mission to lobby Washington for a renewal now almost assured, even as she contemplates the unfortunate impact the death of former President Richard Nixon will have on her previously jam-packed schedule. Much of the credit for Wang's release must go to his brave and indefatigable wife Hou Xiaotian, who by ceaselessly campaigning for his freedom, at great personal risk, made his plight a matter of international concern. Now she has helped to achieve what was once believed almost impossible -- Wang was, after all, freed after serving little more than four years of a 1 3-year jail term -- relatives of other dissidents may be encouraged to adopt a similar approach, thus causing further headaches for the Chinese security authorities. But that is a small price for Beijing to pay to reap the benefits of a strategy which became startlingly clear yesterday. Having repeatedly humiliated Washington in recent months, especially by rounding up dissidents during the visit to Beijing of U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, China has now thrown in a last-minute concession -- therefore not only securing MFN renewal, but also ensuring Washington will think long and hard before ever linking trade to the mainland's human rights record again. That will be good news for Hong Kong, which has had to live with the uncertainties caused by the annual arguments over MFN for the past four years. It is sad to see sick dissidents being exploited in such a cynical way. But it can only be hoped that his release will be followed by many more: especially fellow victims of the 1989 crackdown, such as Chen Ziming and Bao Tong, who were jailed on similar charges.
