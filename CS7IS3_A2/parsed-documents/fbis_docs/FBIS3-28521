An official statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the shelling by Serbs of a busy market in Sarajevo was an act against the norms which respect human dignity. The attack, which wounded 200 innocent people, must be condemned as it constituted a brutal act, unacceptable to civilised people, the statement said. "This incident should call for the attention of the international community that settlement of conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina is now on a very pressing stage," the statement said. Strong reactions also came from other countries such as the Organisation of Islamic Conference (OIC), China, Pakistan, Bangladesh. Germany, France, the United States, and Turkey, in principle, they called on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to launch an air strike for the liberation of Sarajevo from the siege of Bosnian Serbs, the daily said.
