PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN Interior Votes To Decide Elections -- The elections this year will be decided by the voters living in the interior of the country, and not by those in the capitals. A study conducted by the Superior Electoral Board (TSE) shows that 70 million of the voters who will elect the new president live in the interior, and only 20 million in the capitals. The study was based on data collected during the 1993 plebiscite. The study indicates that Sao Paulo, with the largest number of voters in the country, has nearly 22 percent of Brazilian voters, and Minas Gerais, the second largest, about 12 percent. The TSE believes that more than 100 million people will vote in the 3 October elections. (Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in Portuguese 30 May 94 p 9) Main Presidential Candidates View Unemployment -- The four main presidential candidates have commented on their plans to fight unemployment. Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the Workers Party (PT) candidate, wants to build agricultural villages and cooperatives, invest $25 billion in projects to create jobs, and build huge warehouses where small entrepreneurs can set up their industries without having to pay rent. Democratic Labor Party (PDT) candidate Leonel Brizola wants to register unemployed people and update the data on how many they are, grant incentives and technical assistance to micro and small enterprises, create new temporary jobs in public construction work, and invest Severance Pay Fund and Workers' Assistance Fund resources to create jobs and incorporate 8 million families into the job market. Progressive Renewal Party (PPR) candidate Esperidiao Amin wants to create 10 million new jobs in five years by making the micro-enterprises more dynamic and by granting incentives to agriculture, agro-industry, exports, and tourism, and by implementing a "Program to Fight Unemployment." Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB) candidate Fernando Henrique Cardoso proposes creating 8 million jobs by defeating inflation, which will result in an increase in governmental resources, a reduction in taxes on salaries, and the possibility of allocating more funds to professional training and irrigation programs. Cardoso believes that these programs alone will create nearly 2.7 million direct and indirect jobs over the next four years. Finally, Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB) candidate Orestes Quercia promises to invest in the infrastructure, but has not yet defined his goals and does not want to reveal his financial means.

The poll also shows that if Brizola is not elected in the first round of elections, PDT members will support Lula (27 percent), Fernando Henrique Cardoso (20 percent), none of them (44 percent), and 8 percent still do not know whom they will support. Asked whom they would support if they had to choose between Lula and Quercia, 43 percent would choose Quercia, 24 percent Lula, 26 percent neither of the two, and 8 percent remain undecided. If the choice had to be between Quercia and Cardoso, 43 percent would support Quercia, 26 percent Cardoso, 24 percent neither of the two, and 7 percent are undecided. (Sao Paulo FOLHA DE SAO PAULO in Portuguese 31 May 94 Section 1 p 4) Lula Gains Support in Bahia State -- The Bahia office of the PSDB and the PT reached an agreement on 1 June that can benefit Lula: The PT withdrew the candidacy of its candidate for the Senate, Zezeu Ribeiro, and added its support to the PSDB ticket. The PSDB candidate for the Bahia governorship, Jutahy Magalhaes Jr., believes that this alliance will give Lula more than 1 million votes and increase support for him by 20 percent to 30 percent of state voters. In his first rally in Bahia, which is scheduled for 2 July, Lula will already be accompanied by Magalhaes. Lula believes this agreement will reduce the PSDB presidential candidate's possibilities.

Deputy Chico Vigilante, Federal District, said that the PT leadership is comprised of "a bunch of stupid bureaucrats," and he fears that the prohibition is harming Lula's candidacy. Deputy Helio Bicudo, Sao Paulo, also protested the decision. When Lula visited Brasilia at the beginning of June, only gubernatorial candidate Cristovam Buarque and vice presidential candidate Paulo Bisol were allowed to participate in the rallies organized there. Rio Grande do Sul Deputy Jose Fortunatti, PT leader in the Chamber of Deputies, harshly criticized the decision.

Maciel said that the new electoral legislation seeking to ensure the openness of political campaign financing is frightening entrepreneurs who had planned to contribute to Cardoso's campaign. The PSDB-PFL-PTB coalition was the first to request campaign bonuses at the Superior Electoral Board. The requested bonuses amount to 10 percent of the overall cost of the campaign.
