FR940323-1-00023 FR940323-1-00005 G. Presumptive Eligibility for Pregnant Women Section 9407 of OBRA '86 added a new section 1902(a)(47) to the Act, redesignated section 1920 as section 1921, and added a new section 1920 to allow States to provide ambulatory prenatal care to certain needy pregnant women to help ensure that these women receive health care early in pregnancy. Section 411(k)(16)(B) of the MCCA and section 4605 of OBRA '90 amended section 1920. Under section 1920, ambulatory prenatal care is available during a presumptive eligibility period on the basis of income eligibility only before a woman is formally determined to be eligible or ineligible for Medicaid and for a specified number of days while a woman is waiting for a Medicaid eligibility determination. Under the statutory provisions, a qualified provider, who is defined in section 1920(b)(2), determines whether a pregnant woman is presumptively eligible for Medicaid. These qualified providers make the presumptive eligibility determination on the basis of preliminary information about the pregnant woman's family income. The qualified provider determines whether the pregnant woman's family income appears to meet the income criteria applied to any of the eligibility groups specified in the approved State Medicaid plan under which the pregnant woman might be eligible. At the time of the determination, a qualified provider must refer a pregnant woman to the Medicaid agency. The qualified provider must also assist a pregnant woman in completing and filing an application for full Medicaid services if she wishes to apply for Medicaid at that time. The Medicaid agency then would establish whether or not she is eligible for regular Medicaid. Any provider that is eligible for payment under the State plan for services which the State considers to be ambulatory prenatal care can furnish these services to presumptively eligible pregnant women during the presumptive period. (We note that the purpose of presumptive eligibility is to provide temporary, limited coverage to pregnant women who are likely to be eligible for Medicaid. Under section 1905(a) of the Act, individuals who are inmates in public institutions are ineligible for Medicaid. Therefore, because she is not ``likely to be eligible for Medicaid,'' any pregnant woman who is an inmate in a public institution could not be determined presumptively eligible for Medicaid and receive ambulatory prenatal care under section 1920 of the Act.) In accordance with section 1920(b)(1), as added by OBRA '86 and amended by section 4605 of OBRA '90, the presumptive period of eligibility for ambulatory prenatal care begins on the day a qualified provider makes a presumptive eligibility determination. The pregnant woman then has until the last calendar day of the month following the month in which the presumptive eligibility determination was made to file a regular Medicaid application with the Medicaid agency. If she does not file a regular Medicaid application by that last day, presumptive eligibility ends on that last day. If she files a regular Medicaid application, presumptive eligibility under section 1920 ends on the date a decision is made on the regular Medicaid application. We are proposing to allow only one presumptive eligibility period for any one pregnancy. We believe that this limitation is consistent with the intent of Congress as evidenced in the language of the Senate Committee Report on OBRA '86 (S. Rep. 348, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. 153 (1986)). In explaining the provision, the Committee stated that under the presumptive eligibility program, States may ``for any one pregnancy, grant presumptive eligibility for a period not to exceed *␣*␣*'' (emphasis added). Congress' use of the underscored phrases leads to the conclusion that only one presumptive period was intended. We solicit comments on the proposed policy to allow only one presumptive eligibility period per pregnancy. The new section 1920 specifies that a presumptive eligibility determination is to be made if the pregnant woman appears to the qualified provider, on the basis of preliminary information supplied by her on family income, to meet the applicable income level of eligibility only. Resources and other Medicaid eligibility requirements that would be considered under the approved State plan if the woman were to apply for regular Medicaid benefits are not considered in making the presumptive eligibility determination. In addition, section 1920 provides that a determination of presumptive eligibility be based on ``preliminary information'' about family income. Therefore, a qualified provider may only request information that is correct based upon a pregnant woman's best information and belief and may not require exact information under a penalty of perjury. A State may require that women reveal what their incomes are or only that their incomes are below the applicable level.
