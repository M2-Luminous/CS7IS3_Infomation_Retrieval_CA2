According to the Estonian Security Police, the material originates from scrapped Russian minesweepers. The radioactivity of the radiation sources in military use may be lethally high, the Estonian authorities warn. Ulla-Maija Maeaettaenen reports from Tallinn: [Maeaettaenen] The Estonian Security Police have already investigated the origin of three pieces of metal the size of attache cases and containing radioactive substances found here. The first was found in mid-January in the stores of the Estonian state metal export company, EMEX. The others were found somewhat later, one in a truck container in the port. This consignment was on its way illegally to the West, bypassing the state's export company. Juri Pihl, the head of the Estonian Security Police, told Yleisradio today that two pieces of metal containing radioactive substances originate from two minesweepers sold by the Russian Army for scrap. The parts belonged to the vessel's security system. One piece came from a Hovercraft. All these radioactive pieces have been buried near Tallinn in a store for radioactive substances. The vessels, from which the radiating scrap originated, were sold to an enterprise operating in Narva. A Finnish company acted as distributor of the metal. According to the Estonian Security Police, it distributes most of the scrap metal exported from Estonia to foreign countries. Juri Pihl, the head of the Estonian Security Police, says that some 10 radiating pieces are missing; a couple of radiating pieces may also be in Finland. The radiation from one piece recently destroyed in Estonia rose to about 200 roentgen an hour or about two sieverts an hour, which means that the maximum annual dosage by Finnish standards was reached in only a few minutes. According to Juri Pihl, lethal metal pieces may find their way to the West with scrap metal from Latvia and Lithuania too, without anybody knowing. He is also concerned about seven Russian Navy vessels lying at the bottom of the Tallinn mine harbor. They may also carry parts containing radioactive substances. The metal trade is also being linked to organized crime. The Estonian Security Police recently arrested here two of the chief underworld bosses who are accused of unlawful possession of weapons. The men in police custody were in total control of the underworld, distributing so-called paid franchises to other mafia groups. According to the Security Police, three mafia groups are permanently operating in Estonia. Many of their leaders have fled the country; several may be staying either in Finland or Sweden. They have Finnish and Swedish visas in their passports. The trial of the recently arrested mafia bosses will begin here in Estonia this week, Juri Pihl told Yleisradio. This is Ulla-Maija Maeaettaenen in Tallinn.
