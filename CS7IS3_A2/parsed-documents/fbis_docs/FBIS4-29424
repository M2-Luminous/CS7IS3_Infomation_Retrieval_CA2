"Tremendous changes" means that the relationship between the ruling and opposition parties formed since the birth of the new government will be shaken to its roots. It appears that this change will create great waves within the ruling and opposition parties and will become a new compass by which the direction of the political situation is determined. Symptoms of the change in the relationship between the ruling and opposition parties appeared in the negotiations on and handling of the approval of the appointment of Prime Minister Yi, which went through a repeated game of hide-and-seek: full confrontation--narrowing of opinions--rupture of negotiations. A surface change in the relationship between the ruling and opposition parties is that their mutual images have changed. The ruling party may want to deny it, but it is a change deeply felt by all in political circles. Only a year ago, when the new administration was born, the opposition party disappeared from the political stage. An extreme expression would be that only President Kim Yong-sam got the spotlight. It was hard to see or hear anything of the opposition party. It ran about in confusion, without even knowing where to stand in the whirlwind of reform and the anticorruption drive. A so-called "identity crisis" heavily burdened the minds of the opposition. Now, however, they are undeniably the star of the stage. Achieving symmetry with the Kim administration, they have returned in the form of a "new opposition," having clearly secured a space for opposing the present administration. The advent of the "new opposition" signifies that the ruling party has lost part of its right to manage the political situation." It is now actually impossible to direct the political situation according to the purposes and plans of only the ruling party, as it had done in the past. An internal change in the relationship between the ruling and opposition parties is that their perceptions of each other have changed. The present ruling and opposition parties have the same roots; they came out of the opposition of an era of authoritarian regimes. All one has to do is think of the old New Democratic Party [Ku Sinmindang] and the Council for the Promotion of Democracy [Minchuhyop]. Although divided into ruling and opposition parties, they shared a common denominator of antidictatorial, anti-military-regime emotion. Now, however, they have entered into a completely hostile, competitive relationship. Having become no different than the relationship between the ruling and opposition parties of the past, hatred and disregard have accumulated about as much as is possible. At one time applauding the president's reform so much as to shame the vested forces of the ruling party and calling for the strengthening of national competitiveness as if competing with it, the opposition has now entered an attack phase, saying it is "the president's form of rule and consciousness which should be the objects of reform." This change in the relationship between the ruling and opposition parties is a key for predicting the future of the political situation. The importance of this change can be felt more intensely when reflection is made upon its background and causes. Most carefully to be considered of the factors behind this change is that it was not a result of the spontaneous choice of the political world. The change was neither agreed upon nor even based on a tacit understanding between the ruling party and the opposition. Rather, external conditions and structural factors of the political world brought change. Inasmuch as it was not a spontaneous choice, it is difficult to gauge the influence accompanying this change. If it had been a choice in which the will and preferences of the political world had functioned, it would be easy for the political world itself to control the direction and breadth of the change. The situation, however, was just the opposite. Korea's political climate, used to considering moral justifications important and to confrontation between camps, makes it more difficult to control change. Factors outside the political arena pressing for change include not only various domestic, environmental and other outstanding issues, but also international factors as well, such as the Uruguay Round. As for opposition to the ratification of the Uruguay Round Final Performance Plan, it became an opportunity for reviving the practically-exhausted opposition party. Of course, there have been issues, such as the Uruguay agreement, difficult for the political world to endure, but it is hard to deny that other blunders of the ruling party played a big part in getting the opposition back on its feet. Circumstances inside the ruling and opposition parties will be different, but a structural factor of the political world accelerating change was the leadership of the minority faction. The Democratic Liberal Party [DLP] has been led by the minority Democratic-Party [DP] faction. Apart from an objective evaluation, one got a sense that the minority's control of the political situation was insufficient to effectively lead the majority, the Democratic-Justice-Party [DJP] and Republican-Party [RP] factions, at least as far as the front against the opposition party is concerned. Most really feel that the passive posture of the DJP and RP factions caused a loss of the DLP's power to deal with the minority faction within the National Assembly. Party President Yi Ki-taek, belonging to the minority faction in the DP, has lead the opposition party. Although the largest faction, the Tonggyo-tong faction, supports President Yi, there cannot help but be a difference between this and the Tonggyo-tong faction exercising direct management of the party. More important is the fact that the Tonggyo-tong faction's support for President Yi has varied according to the situation and issues under consideration. What has caused this gap to widen is the system of collective leadership called the Chief Executives Council. As it is a collective leadership system, it is very possible for it to lean toward the selection of an inconsistent, hard party line toward the ruling party based on vividness, rather than one which is realistic and flexible. Butting heads as a result of thus overlapping factors both inside and outside the political arena, in one fell swoop the ruling and opposition parties raised to the ceiling the intensity of their attack and defense. With the traditional course of problems posed and counter attacks launched generally abbreviated, the situation got hot in the blink of an eye. The opposition naturally attempted to make changes. They seemed intent on redeeming in a day the silence they have kept up to now. As was seen in the exposure of the Sangmudae scandal, the opposition made an all-out attack on the ethics of the present administration, as if going for its Achilles Heel. The administration had advocated reform as though it had a patent on it. In a special press interview on 2 May, DP President Yi Ki-taek, taking aim directly at the president, demanded he explain the Sangmudae scandal. The ruling party ignored and disregarded this. Meanwhile, teamwork broke down within the ruling party. It was the Kim Hoe-chang crisis. As the ruling party became the object of the scrutiny of public opinion, and of the stinging scrutiny of the middle class in particular, it hastened to bring the situation under control, but it was too late. The crisis had already worsened. In this state, both the ruling party and opposition both did their best to control the crisis in a manner benefiting themselves. This made conflict between the two more intense. The DP brought up the president's closest aides, criticizing them; the DLP officially presented the idea that Asia-Pacific Peace Foundation Director Kim Tae-chung was interfering in politics. Although this was not a full mobilization of the means of attack from which the two had been refraining, it was the first use of subjects which till now had been considered taboo. Looking back over such circumstances, it appears the change which has started to show itself in the relationship between the ruling and opposition parties will become greatly accelerated. Particularly, it appears that, as long as there is no change in the situation, the fight for leadership of the political situation will grow much fiercer and that this will be the epicenter of the accelerating change in the relationship between the ruling and opposition parties. Looking at it by their time table, in the short term, prospects are that the ruling and opposition parties will clash severely over invoking the right of parliamentary investigation into the Sangmudae scandal, house composition of the National Assembly which must be completed within six months, National Assembly ratification of the Uruguay Round, and disposal of the budget for the new year in the regular session of the National Assembly. Of these, the UR ratification cannot be omitted, so it is clear that it will be a battle from which neither side can withdraw. However, avoiding an open confrontation in the National Assembly, etc., the possibility the ruling and opposition parties will enter a full-scale propaganda battle for securing a support base and for taking control of the overall situation cannot be excluded. For example, the ruling party, completely ignoring the opposition, will carry out national affairs directed toward the public and will strongly pursue a policy of reform and of strengthening national competitiveness; the opposition may strengthen its out-of-parliament attack on the ethics of the ruling party. If this happens, the battle in the National Assembly will deteriorate into one line of confrontation between the ruling and opposition parties. No matter what their side, within the minds of those in the clashing ruling and opposition parties will always be drawn a picture of the local autonomy system, [the election for which will be held] in less than a year (June of next year). Strategic and tactical concern about from what position and in what mode they should carry out the local elections will regulate the actions of the ruling and opposition parties. This may be premature, but the results of next year's local elections will be a decisive variable by which to judge the composition of the management of the political situation in the latter half of the ruling party's time in power. In the opposition party too, it will become a chance for an outline to come into focus of the direction of the party leadership and of the battle for the party candidacy for the next presidential election.
