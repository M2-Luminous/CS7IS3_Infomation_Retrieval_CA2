Heightened Definition Proposal_Business Roundtable and National Association of Manufacturers Rule 3b&hyph;6. Liability for Certain Statements by Issuers. Preliminary Note The Commission has recognized for many years that investors make decisions about the purchase and sale of securities with the future in mind. The market value of securities accordingly reflects the judgments of investors about the future economic performance of an issuer. Notwithstanding the inherent uncertainty of all statements about the future, investors regard forward-looking statements by issuers as an important source of relevant information. Forward-looking statements therefore make an important contribution to the efficiency of the U.S. securities markets, and the Commission wishes to encourage issuers to make such statements. At the same time, the Commission recognizes that issuers have a justified concern about becoming involved in litigation arising out of such statements. As the Supreme Court has observed, ``even a complaint which by objective standards may have very little success at trial has a settlement value to the plaintiff out of any proportion to its prospect of success at trial so long as he may prevent the suit from being resolved against him by dismissal or summary judgment. The very pendency of the lawsuit may frustrate or delay normal business activity of the defendant which is totally unrelated to the lawsuit.'' Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Store, 421 U.S. 723, 740 (1975). In order to encourage the release by issuers of forward-looking information, the Commission has adopted this ``safe harbor'' rule. The Commission encourages the courts to apply the rule so as to implement the Commission's intent, i.e., to provide issuers with reasonable assurance regarding the standards that will govern their liability for such information while at the same time assessing liability where an issuer's conduct falls outside the rule and is otherwise actionable under the federal securities laws. (a) General Rule. A statement within the coverage of paragraph (b) below which is made or alleged to be made by or on behalf of an issuer or by an outside reviewer retained by the issuer shall not serve as the basis of a violation of the Act unless (1) it relates to a misstatement or omission that is material within the meaning of paragraph (f), (2) it is made or omitted with scienter within the meaning of paragraph (g) and (3) the person challenging the statement (other than the Commission) relied on the statement within the meaning of paragraph (h). (b) Covered Statements. This rule applies to the following statements: (1) A forward-looking statement (as defined in paragraph (c) below), provided that: (i) At the time such statements are made or reaffirmed, either the issuer is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and has complied with the requirements of Rule 13a&hyph;1 or 15d&hyph;1 thereunder, if applicable, to file its most recent annual report on Form 1O&hyph;K, Form 1O&hyph;KSB, Form 20&hyph;F, or Form 40&hyph;F; or, if the issuer is not subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the statements are made in a registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933, offering statement or solicitation of interest written document or broadcast script under Regulation A, or pursuant to Section 12 (b) or (g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and (ii) The statements are not made by an issuer that is an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940; and (2) Information which relates to (i) the effects of changing prices on the business enterprise, presented voluntarily or pursuant to Item 303 of Regulation S&hyph;K, or Regulation S&hyph;B, or Item 9 of Form 20&hyph;F, ``Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations,'' or Item 302 of Regulation S&hyph;K, ``Supplementary financial information,'' or Rule 3&hyph;20(c) of Regulation S&hyph;X, or (ii) the value of proved oil and gas reserves (such as a standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves as set forth in paragraphs 30&hyph;34 of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 69) presented voluntarily or pursuant to Item 302 of Regulation S&hyph;K. (c) Forward-Looking Statement. For the purpose of this rule, the term ``forward-looking statement'' shall mean and shall be limited to: (1) A statement containing a projection of revenues, income (loss), earnings (loss) per share, capital expenditures, dividends, capital structure or other financial items; (2) A statement of management's plans and objectives for future operations, whether qualitative or quantitative, including plans for the development and delivery of new products or services;
