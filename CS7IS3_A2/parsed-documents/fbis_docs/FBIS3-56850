Gritsyus stated that Lithuania will vote against Russia's admission to that international organization. According to its leader Ye. Kelam, the Estonian delegation will adhere to the same position. As we know, some time ago Russia was refused admission to the Council of Europe [CE] because at the time it lacked a Constitution and democratically elected parliament. "Yes, today Russia has a Constitution and a parliament. But they are only part of the requirements which that state must fulfill," A. Gritsyus believes. In his opinion, before being admitted to the Council of Europe Russia must also resolve its national and ethnic problems. In addition one of the new conditions set by the Baltic states is the demand that it publish a statement officially denouncing the USSR's aggression against Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia in 1940. The unacceptability of this latter demand for Russia -- as indeed, for any other state -- is obvious. Poland, for instance, categorically refused to include a point denouncing its seizure of Vilnius and the Vilnius district in 1920 in the treaty on friendship and cooperation between Poland and Lithuania, which was thus not adopted for that reason. Polish politicians believe that this point could be interpreted too freely. Does the repetition of a similar demand but this time against Russia not signify a kind of "return salvo" in response to Lithuania's unsuccessful attempt to join NATO, which Moscow categorically opposed? The aim of these demarches is clear. It is to isolate Russia from the all-European peace process and to prevent it from taking its lawful place in the Council of Europe and other European structures. In the opinion of the Baltic politicians, the opposite course of events would, albeit obliquely, legitimize Russia's right to the role of guarantor of stability in East Europe.
