An advisory panel to the posts and telecommunications ministry will publish Monday a set of recommendations calling for wide- ranging deregulations on broadcasting firms, the sources said. The centerpiece of the panel recommendations is a proposal to allow broadcasters to list their stock as freely as ordinary companies. The ministry will adopt the proposal and lift the current restrictions on stock listing in March, the sources said. To protect the broadcasting industry against intervention by outside capitals, the government imposes a virtual ban on Japanese broadcasting companies' going public, based on a revision in the commercial code in 1966. The firms are currently required by the ministry, which issues licenses for broadcasting, to set a corporate rule that mandates an approval of the board for selling its shares. Among the 189 broadcasting firms throughout the nation, only five are presently on the stock exchange, as they were already listed before 1966. The new rule would give broadcasting companies full discretion over its stock listing, according to the sources. They said the panel will also suggest allowing local broadcasting firms to expand into areas beyond local boundaries. A restriction that forbids a company that holds a broadcasting station from holding more than 10 percent of shares in another broadcasting firm may also be eased, they said. "The move will no doubt provide a favorable boost for the broadcasting companies that are considering stock listing," said a senior official of a major network.
