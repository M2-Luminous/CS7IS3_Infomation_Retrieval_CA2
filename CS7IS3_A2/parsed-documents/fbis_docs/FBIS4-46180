A deputy of the opposition Spanish Popular Party, who says he has clues regarding the presence of ETA members in Mexico, also has this suspicion. Would you tell us about that? Carpizo: Of course, several Spanish media have reported this for several months, and some Mexican media have echoed the story. Undoubtedly there are people in our country who come from Spain, who come from that part of the Basque region, but we do not have any evidence that there are any guerrillas. If we had proof -- this is being investigated and we will continue to investigate it -- Mexico would act according to the law. Zabludovsky: Thank you very much Dr. Carpizo. Carpizo: Thank you very much for giving me this opportunity to be with you again.
