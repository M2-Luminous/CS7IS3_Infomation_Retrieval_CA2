At that time, a parliamentary National Democratic Group of the Slovak National Party [SNS] came into being, headed by Ludovit Cernak. The existence of two parliamentary groups under the roof of one political party should have definitively been solved by the sixth SNS congress in Zilina today. Anna Samelova and Ivan Samel report: [Passage omitted] [Samelova] The delegates slimmed down the original congress agenda. Instead of the planned address by Ludovit Cernak with a report on the activity of the party since the last congress in April of last year, the report by Jozef Prokes on the situation in the Slovak National Party, following the birth of the SNS parliamentary National Democratic Group, a debate on the two addresses, and the following voting on the recall of Ludovit Cernak from the post of SNS chairman, the delegates reduced by voting all the four points into one: And that is recalling Ludovit Cernak. The explanation was on the pretext of saving time. After that, however, Jozef Prokes granted the following explanation to the journalists. [Begin Prokes recording] This assembly was called as extraordinary on the basis of a 15 January Central Council resolution on the basis of the fact that the chairman does not fulfill the resolutions of this Central Council or any other resolutions, thus infringing upon the statutes. This congress has not been convened to discuss the development of the whole party or its administration, but because of his [Cernak's] activities. For example, the actual Central Council resolutions of 15 January presented to the deputies, members of the SNS, to return to the SNS group. Then it [the Council] asked him to give up the post of chairman, which he did not do. [end recording] [Samel] Ludovit Cernak, Vladimir Miskovsky, Anton Hrnko, and 63 participants in the congress, out of this approximately 50 delegates from 18 districts, considered the explanations formulated in this way to be an undemocratic solution to the problems. That is why they left the debating hall at 1230 and moved to the Zilina House of Technology. [passage omitted] [Samel] From this moment, two independent groups of the formerly united SNS had talks. As to Ludovit Cernak, we were interested in the next political steps of his group. [Begin Cernak recording] In Slovakia political parties cannot be born by division like cells. On the other hand, as politicians, we are responsible for crystallizing embryos that crystallize on the Slovak political scene. That is why I should like to address very briefly the other parties in the center, right of center, possibly those on the other side of the center, on the political orientation and to coordinate the progress. Consistent policies are then capable of shifting those political forces that only talk and do not act according to their orientation. [end recording] [Announcer] According to the latest information, a group of Ludovit Cernak's supporters decided to form a new political entity under the working name of the National Democratic Party [Narodno-Demokraticka Strana (NDS)]. Meanwhile, the delegates to the original SNS congress dismissed SNS Chairman Ludovit Cernak and, after two voting rounds, elected Jan Slota as his successor. He received 70 votes, with 59 against. [Bratislava Rozhlasova Stanica Slovensko Network in Slovak at 2030 GMT reports a varying final total, noting that Jan Slota was elected SNS chairman by 70 votes in favor and 49 opposed.]
