FR940720-0-00024 FR940720-0-00001 Section 171.16 Annual fees: Materials Licensees, Holders of Certificates of Compliance, Holders of Sealed Source and Device Registrations, Holders of Quality Assurance Program Approvals, and Government agencies licensed by the NRC. ยง171.16(c) covers the fees assessed for those licensees that can qualify as small entities under NRC size standards. Currently, the NRC assesses two fees for licensees that qualify as small entities under the NRC's size standards. In general, licensees with gross annual receipts of $250,000 to $3.5 million pay a maximum annual fee of $1,800 per licensed category. A second or lower-tier small entity fee of $400 is in place for licensees with gross annual receipts of less than $250,000 and small governmental jurisdictions with a population of less than 20,000. Although the amounts of the small entity fees have not changed for FY 1994, they are being published for purposes of convenience. Paragraph (d) is revised to reflect the FY 1994 budgeted costs for materials licensees, including Government agencies, licensed by the NRC. These fees are necessary to recover the FY 1994 generic costs totalling $63.7 million that apply to fuel facilities, uranium recovery facilities, spent fuel facilities, holders of transportation certificates and QA program approvals, and other materials licensees, including holders of sealed source and device registrations. Fee Category 2 is amended by establishing two new fee categories 2.A.(3) and 2.A.(4) relating to the disposal of Section 11e.(2) byproduct material as defined by the Atomic Energy Act. The current 4.D. category has been eliminated. This action recognizes that (1) part of the budgeted costs for the uranium recovery class of licensees should be allocated to source material licenses that authorize receipt and disposal of 11e.(2) material because some of these budgeted resources are used to regulate these licensees and (2) a further distinction should be made between those licenses whose primary purpose is to authorize disposal of 11e.(2) byproduct material requiring the establishment of a new mill tailings pile for disposal of 11e.(2) material and those non-operating mills that accept 11e.(2) byproduct material for disposal incidental to tailings piles created by mill operations. In addition, Fee Category 18 is amended to assess fees to the Department of Energy (DOE) for use of the general license provided under 10 CFR 40.27. Currently, DOE is billed for the issuance of transportation Certificates of Compliance. The general license fulfills a requirement of the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act of 1978 (UMTRCA) (Public Law 95&hyph;604) that the perpetual custodian of reclaimed uranium mill tailings piles be licensed by the NRC. The ยง40.27 general license covers only post-reclamation closure custody and site surveillance. In September 1993, DOE became a general licensee of the NRC because post-reclamation closure of the Spook, Wyoming site had been achieved. Because DOE now holds an NRC license, it is subject to annual fees. The NRC had previously indicated its intent in the FY 1991 final fee rule to bill DOE for UMTRCA costs once post-closure was achieved and the sites were licensed by the Government (56 FR 31481; July 10, 1991). As a result, DOE will be billed for the costs associated with NRC's UMTRCA review of all activities associated with the facilities assigned to DOE under UMTRCA. As with other licensees, the annual fee for this class of licensees (DOE UMTRCA facilities) will recover the generic and other regulatory costs not recovered through 10 CFR Part 170 fees. Because DOE, as a Federal agency, cannot be assessed Part 170 fees under the IOAA, the NRC will assess annual fees for the total costs of DOE UMTRCA activities to DOE. Tables VI and VII show the NRC program elements and resources that are attributable to fuel facilities and materials users, respectively. The costs attributable to the uranium recovery class of licensees are those associated with uranium recovery research, licensing and inspection. For transportation, the costs are those budgeted for transportation research, licensing, and inspection. Similarly, the budgeted costs for spent fuel storage are those for spent fuel storage research, licensing, and inspection.
