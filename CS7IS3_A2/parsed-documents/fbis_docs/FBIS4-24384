Recently, public security personnel could be seen outside the houses of some well-known democracy activists in Beijing; they stood guard, watched them, and followed them closely. It is believed that they want to restrict contacts between the dissidents and foreign reporters. Some democracy activists, including former student leader Wang Dan and the old scholar Xu Liangying and his wife, have had short trips arranged by the authorities to areas outside Beijing to avoid "June 4," a date which causes concern among the authorities. Chen Ziming, an intellectual who has just been released, is staying outside Beijing with his wife Wang Zhihong; they have gone to a hot springs resort to recuperate. A medical examination found that Chen Ziming has hypertension and a heart problem (Chen Ziming's blood pressure is too high, over 100), however, Chen Ziming's skin disease, which was not able to heal in jail, has improved a bit after days of immersion in the hot springs water (Chen Ziming had not taken a bath in a whole year while in jail, and as he could only rub his body with water, his skin disease got worse). It is believed that Chen Ziming and his wife can only return to Beijing after the fifth anniversary of the "June 4th" incident. His family said that after Chen Ziming returns to Beijing, he must visit the hospital for a thorough medical examination. In addition, Chen Ziming wants to complete a book on China's modernization--a book he started writing in jail; at present, he has almost finished writing the book. When Chen Ziming was in jail, his wife Wang Zhihong and his sister Chen Zihua made a living by doing temporary jobs. Chen Ziming was originally president of the Beijing Research Institute of Social Sciences and Economics, a nongovernmental think tank. According to his family, Chen Ziming, after several years of hardship in jail, remains loyal to his view on the country's affairs and has not changed his beliefs. Bao Zunxin, another intellectual who was jailed for his part in the 1989 pro-democracy movement, was a historian at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences; he has not been able to regain his job so far and has been ill. Therefore, he relies on his wife and daughter to earn wages to support the family, and this means he has greater difficulties in his life. Bao Zunxin's health was affected by his imprisonment. Since he was released at the end of November 1992, he has been recuperating up to this moment. Last week, he had a minor operation to remove a polyp from his colon. He sighed and said that medical costs in Beijing are very expensive and he cannot afford it; for example, a visit to the doctor to treat influenza costs more than 80 yuan, so he usually does not go to see the doctor when he has influenza and just takes medicine prepared by a pharmacy. Bao Zunxin hopes to continue his academic research, and he is writing an article on the history of thought during the late Qing period. As the fifth anniversary of "June 4th" draws closer, two public security personnel have appeared in front of Bao Zunxin's house to watch him. He was forbidden from leaving to buy vegetables, but he insisted on going out, and the public security personnel let him go but followed him at all times. In another development, apart from Wang Dan, who will leave Beijing to avoid "June 4th," the well-known intellectuals Xu Liangying and his wife have also had to leave Beijing temporarily as a result of arrangements by the authorities. According to their family, the Xu couple left Beijing last Wednesday (25 May) for a certain locality, and will return to Beijing on or after 8 June. As for other young and middle-aged intellectuals who were jailed for their part in the 1989 pro-democracy movement, such as Liu Xiaobo and Min Qi, they are in Beijing but feel bored and can only amuse themselves by playing cards.
