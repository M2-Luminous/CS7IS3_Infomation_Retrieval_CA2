FR941219-1-00045 FR941219-1-00015 S8.5.2.5␣For 5,000 cycles at ^40 ○C (^40 ○F), hydrostatically pressurize the container from (1) a level not more than 10 percent of the service pressure to (2) the service pressure. S8.5.2.6␣The cycling rate does not exceed 10 cycles per minute. S8.5.3␣Determine that the container has not leaked or permanently changed in external configuration or dimension. With respect to changes in the container's external configuration or dimension, adjust a pass/fail gauge to fit the container. Compare the measurement with the one in S8.5.1. S8.6␣Charpy impact test procedures. S8.6.1␣Cut one set of three longitudinal 5X10 mm Charpy Vee notch specimens from one container or liner. Each specimen is then tested at ^40 ○ C (^40 ○ F) in accordance with the Methods for Notched Bar Impact Testing of Metallic Materials , ASTM E 23. S8.7␣ Gunfire test procedures . A container is pressurized with nitrogen or air to service pressure. The container is then impacted by a 0.30 caliber armor-piercing projectile having a muzzle velocity of 853 meter/second (2,800 feet/second). The container is positioned so that the projectile impact point is in the container sidewall, with the trajectory passing through the container longitudinal centerline at an angle of 45 degrees and exiting through the opposite sidewall. The distance from the muzzle to the test container is 46 m (50 yards). S8.8␣ Flaw tolerance test procedures . S8.8.1␣Adjust a pass/fail gauge to fit the container before the test. S8.8.2␣Make a 25.4 mm (1 inch) long longitudinal cut into the outer wall of a CNG test container at its midlength. The cut's depth is 0.75 mm (0.030 inch) and width is 0.75 mm. S8.8.3␣For 1,5000 cycles at ambient temperature, hydrostatically pressurize the container from (1) a level not more than 10 percent of the service pressure, to (2) the service pressure. S8.8.4␣Determine that the container has not leaked or permanently changed in external configuration or dimension. With respect to changes in the container's external configuration or dimension, adjust a pass/fail gauge to fit the container. Compare the measurement with the one in S8.5.1 or S8.81. S8.9␣ Pendulum impact test procedures. S8.9.1␣The container is empty and at 21 ○C (70 ○F). S8.9.2␣A pendulum impact testing fixture is used for the test. The impact body is a steel pyramid with equilateral triangle faces and a square base. The summit and the edges of the pyramid are rounded to a radius of 3 mm (0.12 inch). The center of percussion of the pendulum coincides with the center of gravity of the pyramid. The center's distance from the axis of rotation of the pendulum is 1 meter (40 inches). The total mass of the pendulum referred to its center of percussion is 15 kg (33 pounds). The energy of the pendulum at the moment of impact is not less than 30 Nm (22.1 ft-lbf). S8.9.3␣During the test, the container is held in position by the end bosses or by the mounting brackets. S8.9.4␣The impact body strikes the test container at any point and any angle on the container. S8.9.5␣For 1,500 cycles at ambient temperature, hydrostatically pressurize the container from (1) a level not more than 10 percent of the service pressure to (2) the service pressure. S8.9.6␣Determine that the container has not leaked. S8.10␣Drop test procedures. S8.10.1␣The container is drop tested at ambient temperature without internal pressurization or attached valves. The container is held in a horizontal position with the bottom 3.05 meters (10 feet) above the surface onto which it is dropped. The surface is a smooth, horizontal concrete pad or flooring that is 4 inches thick. S8.10.2␣For 5,000 cycles at ambient temperature, hydrostatically pressurize the container from (1) a level not more than 10 percent of the service pressure to (2) 125 percent of the service pressure, and then for 13,000 cycles from (1) a level not more than 10 percent of the service pressure to (2) the service pressure. S8.10.3␣Determine that the container has not leaked. S8.11␣Road salt environmental test procedures . S8.11.1␣Adjust a pass/fail gauge to fit the container before the test. S8.11.2␣A CNG fuel container, free of any protective coating, is cycle tested as follows: S8.11.2.1␣Subject the container to a salt spray (fog) test in accordance with ASTM B&hyph;117&hyph;73, ``Method of Salt Spray (Fog) Testing,'' for 240 hours consisting of ten successive 24 hour periods. During each period, the container shall be mounted in the middle of the chamber and exposed for 23 hours to the salt spray. The spray is not activated during the 24th hour. S8.11.2.2␣For 5,000 cycles at ambient conditions, hydrostatically pressurize the container from (1) a level not more than 10 percent of the service pressure to (2) 125 percent of the service pressure. S8.11.2.3␣Stabilize at zero pressure and ambient conditions. S8.11.2.4␣For 5,000 cycles at ^40 ○ C (^40 ○ F), hydrostatically pressurize the container from (1) a level not more than 10 percent of the service pressure to (2) the service pressure. S8.11.2.5␣The cycling rate does not exceed 10 cycles per minute. S8.11.3␣Determine that the container has not leaked or permanently changed in external configuration or dimension. With respect to changes in the container's external configuration or dimension, adjust a pass/fail gauge to fit the container. Compare the measurement with the one in S8.11.1.
