Salvador Sanchez Ceren, FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] leader, said the creation of the joint commission tasked with investigating the alleged irregularities within the PNC, is part of the latest rescheduling of the peace agreement. The last report by the UN secretary general to the Security Council, in which he underscores irregularities in PNC training, has already been acted upon by those involved. On Monday, Ter-Horst said the group is already doing verification work to report, by 30 June, whether the new security corps has militarized. [Begin Ted-Horst recording] I believe that right now it is not practical or constructive to describe whether the PNC is militarized. The government has a clear resolve to correct any error or irregularities detected in June. [end recording] Ted-Horst said that like any new institution, the PNC has its problems, however, these are being quickly faced and resolved. Salvador Sanchez Ceren, FMLN representative to the National Commission for the Consolidation of Peace, expressed confidence in the commission tasked to evaluate how civilian the PNC is. [Begin Sanchez recording] All the irregularities the UN secretary general lists will be investigated. We have also verified this on site and have been able to confirm that the academy is militarized, starting with the monitor corps, and that there is an imbalance in the chain of command. The academy is made up of a majority of national policemen, and this creates an imbalance. [end recording] The new scheduling between the government and the FMLN mentions, among other dates, 15 March 1995 for completing the National Police demobilization and the full deployment of the PNC, with an average of 8,000-10,000 policemen. The land transfer process is scheduled to be 70 percent complete by 30 April 1995. With this new schedule, the head of Onusal said President Cristiani has cleared all pending peace matters. Nevertheless, for Sanchez Ceren, Cristiani leaves instead a more specific schedule, which the new Calderon Sol administration shall be unable to elude.
