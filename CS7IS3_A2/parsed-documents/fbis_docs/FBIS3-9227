Notes added to the bill by Meciar's government before its fall a week ago, were not accepted by parliament. This means that the most controversial point in the law, which forbids members of the government or parliament from simultaneously being members of the presidium, executive committee, or supervisory council of the National Property Fund (FNM), was not changed. FNM representatives must be nominated by the relevant parliamentary committee, whose proposal must be approved by parliament. The only proposal of the former government accepted by parliament in the legislation was that FNM funds may be used for the purpose of increasing the capital stock of trade companies that are associates of the FNM or in which the FNM has a stake. The law should ensure that conditions for the transfer of property from the state to a third party not be subject to suspicion or criminalization, said Juraj Plesnik, vice-chairman of parliament's Privatization Committee. Parliament will look into the privatization methods used by Meciar's government in February, when capital stock in enterprises in which foreign firms are interested were sold under very lucrative conditions, he added. Most of the approved privatization projects are not backed financially, he stated. Meciar's government in its last weeks sold property valuing three billion Slovak korunas ($96.800 million), but only 600 million korunas (about $19 million) worth was backed by loans.
