Background on the Wyoming Program On November 26, 1980, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Wyoming program. General background information on the Wyoming program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and conditions of approval of the Wyoming program can be found in the November 26, 1980, Federal Register (45 FR 78637). Subsequent actions concerning Wyoming's program and program amendments can be found at 30 CFR 950.11, 950.12, 950.15 and 950.16. II. Submission of Amendment On May 1, 1986, Wyoming submitted a proposed amendment to the Wyoming program under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, 30 U.S.C. 1201&hyph;1328, concerning contemporaneous reclamation. In the amendment, Wyoming proposed changes to its time and distance performance standards for rough backfilling and grading (Administrative Record No. WY&hyph;25&hyph;3). By letter dated November 30, 1993, Wyoming submitted additional information regarding the proposed amendment (Administrative Record No. WY&hyph;25&hyph;1). In its letter, Wyoming requested that OSM reopen its review of the May 1, 1986, proposed amendment regarding time and distance performance standards for rough backfilling and grading, on which the Director had deferred action in the November 24, 1986, Federal Register (51 FR 42209) (Administrative Record No. WY&hyph;25&hyph;2). Wyoming also provided additional information that was intended to clarify Wyoming's May 1, 1986, proposed amendment. OSM published a notice, in the December 16, 1993, Federal Register (58 FR 65681), announcing receipt of the additional information and in the same notice, opened the public comment period and provided an opportunity for a public hearing on its substantive adequacy. The public comment period closed on January 18, 1994. A public hearing was not held because none was requested. III. Director's Findings Set forth below, pursuant to SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.15 and 732.17, are the Director's findings concerning the amendment submitted by Wyoming on May 1, 1986, as subsequently clarified on November 30, 1993. On May 1, 1986, the State of Wyoming submitted a proposed amendment revising nine Chapters of its approved permanent program regulations, known as the Rules and Regulations of the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality, Land Quality Division (DEQ/LQD). The amendment was in response to a December 23, 1985, letter that OSM sent in accordance with the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.17(d). Included in the submittal were proposed changes to Wyoming's regulation at Chapter IV, Section 2(b)(i), regarding Wyoming's time and distance performance standards for rough backfilling and grading. In the May 21, 1986, Federal Register (51 FR 18621), OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment package and invited public comment on its adequacy. Because no one requested a public hearing, none was held. The comment period closed on June 20, 1986.
