FR940202-0-00014 FR940202-0-00003 Some commenters objected to limiting qualifying intangibles to 50 percent of core capital. One suggested that less disruptive ways to achieve the same goals exist such as substituting a case-by-case supervisory approach to determine capital adequacy of depository institutions holding PMSRs. The OTS is adopting a 50 percent of core capital limit on PMSRs to be consistent with the rules issued by the other federal banking agencies. 4 OTS capital rules are in the main patterned after those of the other banking agencies, especially the OCC. The statute, as well as sensible practice, dictates uniformity to the greatest extent feasible. 4 See 58 FR 7973 (Feb. 11, 1993) (FRB); 58 FR 16481 (Mar. 29, 1993) (OCC); and 58 FR 6363 (Jan. 28, 1993) (FDIC). 2. Annual Independent Market Valuation of PMSRs Many commenters objected to an annual independent valuation of PMSRs as excessively costly and unnecessarily burdensome when combined with other limitations in the proposal, and suggested that the requirement be eliminated. Many commenters noted that banks regulated by the OCC and the FRB are not subject to this requirement. Some commenters recommended establishing a minimum threshold below which OTS would not require independent annual valuation of PMSRs. Other commenters suggested that an independent valuation be required only where an institution cannot produce a satisfactory internal valuation. In response to these comments, the OTS is modifying ยง567.12(d) to remove the independent valuation requirement. The OTS, however, will reserve the right to require certain savings associations to obtain independent valuations, either on a case-by-case basis or according to general guidance issued in conjunction with the adoption of this rule. 3. PMSR Valuation Basis Some commenters proposed that an association should be permitted to calculate the discounted book value of qualifying intangibles on an aggregate basis for the institution's total purchased servicing portfolio rather than on a pool-by-pool basis. The OTS and the other agencies will permit an institution to use either method. The accounting practices otherwise required by this rule protect adequately against potential abusive practices. 4. Discounting Approach Some commenters stated that limiting PMSRs and PCCRs to 90 percent of fair market value was arbitrary and that no other assets are subject to such treatment. Two commenters argued that a constant discount rate should be applied to book value, but not market value. One commenter suggested using a case-by-case approach based on criteria such as efficiency, effectiveness, and profitability. Section 475 of FDICIA requires PMSRs included in capital to be valued at no more than 90 percent of fair market value computed at least quarterly. The agencies have chosen to apply the same limit to PCCRs for consistency. The OTS and the other agencies never intended to require institutions to use a constant discount rate in computing market value. This rule, however, retains the proposed rule's requirement that savings associations use a discounting approach in calculating book value because the OTS believes that the nondiscounted approach can result in inflated carrying values. The OTS has issued a Thrift Bulletin regarding the valuation of PMSRs. 5 5 See OTS Thrift Bulletin 60, June 23, 1993.
