Dlouhy was speaking to journalists after his meeting with U.S. presidential envoy and deputy chairman of a political guiding group for Central and Eastern Europe, Richard Schifter. The United States is also to conduct negotiations with the other members of the Visegrad Four -- Slovakia, Poland and Hungary -- and Schifter will visit these countries within the next few days, Dlouhy said. Dlouhy pointed out that the countries of the European Union account for between 55 and 60 percent of exports from the Czech Republic, while the United States represents only about one or two percent. Therefore it was a long-term priority of the Czech Republic to gain admission to the European Union, he explained. Dlouhy announced there will be a White House sponsored conference of leading American and Central European companies in the summer.
