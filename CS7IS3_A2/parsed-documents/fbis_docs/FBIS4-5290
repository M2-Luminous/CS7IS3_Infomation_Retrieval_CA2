In addition to indicating it is ready to reexamine the balance among taxes on income, consumption, and assets, the party has also suggested that, in view of the aging of society, "the times require a shift in the balance with more weight on consumption taxes," as well as a permanent source of revenue to make up for shortfalls resulting from income tax cuts. In its draft policy outline, the SDPJ wants, as conditions for its endorsement of a consumption tax rise, a strategic welfare policy to be drawn up, the implementation of administrative and fiscal reforms, the removal of current shortcomings in consumption tax, and the redressing of inequities in the tax system. In the draft document, the party says: "It is inevitable that indirect taxes will be the major sources of revenue." It also stresses the need to raise indirect taxes to help finance local government welfare programs. However, the party fails to touch on the issue of turning the consumption tax into a "tax intended for the financing of pensions program," although this has been a party demand in the past. The omission seems to be part of the party's attempt to find a compromise with its ruling coalition partners, so the draft outline can be expected to have a big impact on debates within the ruling coalition parties' council on reform of the tax system. As a prerequisite to discussing tax reform, the SDPJ document stresses the following points must be considered in addition to working on a strategic policy for social welfare: 1) to redress inequities in the tax system completely, such as through consolidated taxation; 2) to remove shortcomings in the current consumption tax, such as by reexamining the simplified tax system and relaxing the regressive nature of consumption tax; 3) to redouble efforts to promote administrative and fiscal reform, such as through spending cuts; 4) to maintain taxation on land and rationalize taxation on assets; and 5) to improve indirect taxation as an independent source of revenue for local governments. The draft outline also points out that "we must tackle the problem of securing necessary revenue sources, taking into account the effect on revenue sources of the implementation of administrative and fiscal reforms and the redressing of inequities in the tax system." The SDPJ is thereby tacitly acknowledging the need to seek new revenue sources to offset shortfalls due to income tax cuts and to finance future social welfare. The draft outline also says that "considering the likely details of any future welfare policy, it seems inevitable that indirect taxation will be a revenue source," indicating that the party believes there must be a debate on the issue of a increasing consumption tax. On the balance among income, consumption, and assets taxes, the draft outline clearly states that "the times require a shift in the balance with added weight on consumption tax, which should be levied at the time goods are purchased." The outline also stresses the need to debate the issue of raising consumption tax, saying "it is the responsibility of the party as the largest group in the ruling coalition to hold in-depth discussion on whether to make a consumption tax rise the centerpiece of taxation reform once its shortcomings have been corrected. In the recent uproar over the announcement of a national welfare tax, the SDPJ opposed its introduction, saying "it has not been discussed sufficiently." In particular, the party firmly asserted that the revenue generated by the consumption tax rise should be used "to finance the pensions program." The party, however, failed to touch on this issue in the draft outline, merely saying it plans to "make a constructive, responsible judgment on such matters as the propriety of designating taxes for certain purposes." The party has clearly tried to avoid clashing with the other ruling coalition parties, which oppose the SDPJ's idea. Instead, it makes only a passing reference to a "medicare-oriented" approach on the issue of improving welfare. It stresses the need to study plans to introduce a local consumption tax which have emerged among other ruling coalition parties. It says that, from the point of view of the local governments which actually handle the services, it is essential to "improve consumption taxation (indirect taxes) which places the emphasis on local governments." As far as income tax cuts are concerned, the SDPJ spells out in its draft outline that it plans to maintain the fixed tax rate reduction in the drastic tax system reform plan at the same level set for this fiscal year. The party also proposes to reconsider tax rate classifications, as well as raising the minimum taxable income, mainly through raising earned income deductions and basic deductions. At the same time the draft outline proposes that the possibility of reducing corporate taxes should be studied. On the issue of securing a source of revenue to offset shortfalls resulting from such tax cuts, the SDPJ intends to allocate "revenue garnered by reviewing the corporate tax system to offset expected shortfalls." For example, the party proposes reexamining various kinds of special tax exemptions, in which corporations already have vested rights and interests, and a reduction in corporate reserves. The SDPJ's draft policy outline was drawn up by the party's Research Commission on the Tax System (chaired by Ichiro Hino). The party, which holds the key to successful tax system reform, plans to discuss this draft outline by assembling concerned officials from its local chapters and holding a national convention of policy board chairmen and policymaking officials on 8-9 April.
