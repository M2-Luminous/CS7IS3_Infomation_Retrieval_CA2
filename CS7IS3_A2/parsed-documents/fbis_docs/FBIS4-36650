The message states the following: The Republic of Yemen emphasizes its concern to observe a cease- fire in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution No. 924. This is despite the secessionist rebels' repeated flagrant cease- fire violations since 1800 on 9 June--the date set by brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, Presidential Council chairman and supreme commander of the Armed Forces, after his meeting with Lakhdar Brahimi, the UN secretary general's envoy. These violations were still continuing up to the time this message was drafted. Although the forces of legitimacy and unity complied with the the Armed Forces supreme commander's order not to respond to those violations, the apostate and secessionist elements persisted in their cease-fire violations, intensifying their air and naval bombardment of our forces in Aden and Abyan governorates, resulting in material and human losses among their ranks. Despite all that, the Government of the Republic of Yemen has instructed the permanent representative to inform the UN secretary general of all those violations and to submit a new initiative, on condition that the rebels abide by the cease-fire as of midnight last night, Friday, 10 June. Out of the Government of the Republic of Yemen's concern not to allow the apostate and secessionist elements to continue the letting of Yemeni blood within their criminal scheme, the brother chairman of the Presidential Council has instructed members of the Yemeni military committee, which had been set up by a decision by the chairman of the Presidential Council and supreme commander of the Armed Forces, to supervise the cease-fire by holding its first meeting in a specific place named (Ja'ulah), located between Sabir and Dar Sa'd villages, at 1100 today, Saturday, 11 June.
