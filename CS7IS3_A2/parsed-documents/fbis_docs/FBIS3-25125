Today, more than 5,000 shells were fired by UNITA at the martyred city of Cuito. The death toll resulting from UNITA's shelling has risen to 175. Hospital sources say about 350 people -- mostly children, elderly men, and women -- have been wounded. The hospital lacks the means to cope with the situation. Today's clashes were fiercer than yesterday's. The city of Cuito has become a true inferno. Jonas Savimbi's UNITA continues to shell the city and mount strong attacks on it. The situation, however, is under the control of government forces, who continue to deal severe blows to the enemy of the people.
