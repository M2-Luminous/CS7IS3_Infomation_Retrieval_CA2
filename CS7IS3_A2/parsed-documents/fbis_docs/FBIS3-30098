Cabinet ministers, including Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and International Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai, gathered at Hosokawa's official residence Friday to start determining the specifics of an earlier-announced government plan to open up the domestic market. Aimed at overcoming the deadlock in Japan-U.S. "framework" trade talks, the plan includes encouraging imports and investment, lifting regulations, facilitating the procedures involved in government orders and spurring competitive policies. The government hopes the measures will help allay criticism mounting in the United States over Japan's huge trade surplus, and stave off the possibility of U.S. retaliatory measures. The Japanese officials started discussions on the government's policy to introduce liberalizing measures for the automobile, auto parts and insurance markets -- three areas in which Japan spurned U.S. requests to set "numerical import targets."
