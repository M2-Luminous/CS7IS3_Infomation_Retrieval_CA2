What post do you occupy in the leadership of the new party of the same name? [Tatarchuk] So far we have a provisional party name but the party itself does not yet exist. It is my and my colleagues' job to form it. What some of us are going to be will be determined by the constituent congress during the selection of the party's leading organs. Naturally, after its program and rules have been approved. Right now I am deputy chairman of the organizing committee to form the party. [Korneshov] What exactly do you, the new party's founders, mean by the words Russia's choice? The choice of capitalism or some other path? [Tatarchuk] We are retaining the name of the election bloc and of our parliamentary faction in order to stress the genetic link to the movement to which a considerable number of voters gave their votes last December. It is on this basis that the party program is now being elaborated. Naturally, it will be refined and expanded. But it will retain the fundamental approaches to questions concerning the Federation, economics, ethnic policy, and foreign policy, and to social problems. To us there is an obvious need for the sound reformation of our state in order to create a reliable market economy, freedom of choice for people, protection of human rights, freedom of enterprise, protection of private ownership, and to create normal conditions to develop all types of ownership, while realizing that state ownership in this country will not disappear overnight. [Korneshov] What sort of social base does your party have? [Tatarchuk] It seems to us that many people involved in ownership are now appearing as a result of the reforms. This is the nascent stratum of entrepreneurs. As a result of voucher privatization tens of millions of Russians are becoming shareholders, that is to say private owners, and private farming is developing. [Korneshov] It is known that you will try to rely on the workers aristocracy for support. I have a question here: Is there such a thing as the workers aristocracy in Russia today, in conditions when ZIL is closed and the giants of Altay and other industrial regions are becoming idle maybe not forever but for a long time? [Korneshov] The workers aristocracy is a somewhat unhappily chosen term. It refers to the section of workers who are fairly highly skilled and who realize that reform must be purposeful and accelerated, but without a further fall in the social level. [Korneshov] It is known that to a considerable extent the political orientation of parties, movements, and their leaders can now be determined by their attitude toward the president and government.... [Tatarchuk] We are prepared to work constructively in parliament with the government and president until such time as the government and president support the advance of the reforms. If the reverse process is observed we will, of course, state this and defend our line. [Korneshov] You have had meetings with the president. Could you interpret a little of what was discussed at them for our readers? [Tatarchuk] We briefed the president on the work we are doing to create a parliamentary-type political party on a platform known to the president. And on questions associated with the slowing down of reforms and the growth of national extremism. [Korneshov] At your press conference Organizing Committee Chairman Yegor Timurovich Gaydar said in passing that all of us in Russia are Marxist-educated people. As we know, Marxists-Leninists believed that the most effective way to create a party is to set up a party-wide newspaper. Will you, Valentin Ivanovich, have your own press? [Tatarchuk] That is our dream. But you work for a newspaper and know what that costs nowadays, whereas we do not have such resources. We will rely on already existing publications, specifically on the regional press, which in our opinion needs special support. [Korneshov] Valentin Ivanovich, since we are talking about finances.... What do you see as the main sources of funding for the party's activity? [Tatarchuk] We hope that those people and those already established structures which believe that the reform process needs to be made irreversible and continued will give the party material support. We are setting up a fund and are counting on the fact that our supporters will contribute what they can to it. The party will also have a system of membership dues. Although we do not see our party as a mass, amorphous party. [Korneshov] Please tell us whether the attempt, if it did indeed take place, to involve [singer] Alla Borisovna Pugacheva and other popular people in the process of forming the party was really an attempt or just rumors. [Tatarchuk] I would like to say that we have made no attempt whatever to "involve" anybody in the party. This applies to Alla Borisovna too. Initially she agreed to sign an address on the party's formation, but then behaved somewhat strangely. But that is really her affair. [Korneshov] Valentin Ivanovich, there are now a multitude of parties in Russia and the vast majority of them are salon parties, what I call invisible parties. But there are still parties which enjoy a certain popularity. Which of them do you see as your natural allies? [Tatarchuk] Indeed, several parties and movements could unite in blocs to achieve certain aims. Essentially some of our fundamental approaches toward solving the most important problems coincide with those of the "12 December" group, "Yabloko".... This formation of blocs in parliament would make sense. In many respects our tendencies also coincide with those of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord and a considerable number of the "New Regional Policy" group's members. [Korneshov] So we are talking about a very broad democratic bloc? [Tatarchuk] That is our main task -- to unite democrats in the face of the impending danger of a backward slide and the threat of fascism. Now is not the time to share out portfolios or leadership.
