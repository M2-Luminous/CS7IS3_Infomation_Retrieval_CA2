The priority in naturalization should be granted to those non-citizens who have finished educational establishments with Latvian teaching language rather than to the spouses of citizens, as stipulated by the present bills, said Abikis. Non-citizens should take another state language exam before getting citizenship because the present language commissions often issue undeserved language certificates, he said. In addition, state language inspectors in Riga have faced violence on several occasions, said Abikis. An inspector in the Latgale district, for example, was severely beaten recently. Abikis claims that the brutal acts are directed against the Latvian state and evidence of reluctance of part of non-Latvians to respect the Latvian nation and its language. The State Language Center has applied to the Justice Ministry in a bid to receive salary additions from collected fines for breaking of the state language law. State inspectors presently receive 59 lats per month. The language learning among adults proceeds with difficulties but the younger generation gives grounds to hope for the better, said Abikis. In the largest cities, especially in Daugavpils and Kraslava, many non-Latvian children learn in Latvian-language schools. The Latvia's Way faction believes that professional training in Latvia should fully transfer to the Latvian teaching language, said Abikis.
