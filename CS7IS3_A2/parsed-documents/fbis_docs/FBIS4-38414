At their prompting, the Duma Council has decided to include in the plan of immediate legislation laws on the subsistence wage and on veterans, which were elaborated with the active participation of "Russia's Choice." The portfolio of the faction and the committee also contains a program to combat poverty, draft laws on social services, on social protection for the disabled, and on ritual support (a euphemism for burial services). Thus, the organizers of the news conference underlined, "Russia's Choice" is as good as its pledge to the voters. The faction's approach to social policy is special in that it is trying to find a common denominator of social payments. For example, there are now 54 decrees in effect on provision of benefits to veterans. Some normative acts, however, treat all alike. Mr. Osovtsov cited the example of Robert Kennedy, a father of nine, who would have been legally eligible for the "multiple children benefit." There is an equal mess about housing, and so on. "Our objective is not to endlessly discuss the issue but to give at least a spoonful to each who are hungry," Mr. Osovtsev underlined. Such a common denominator should apply to the subsistence wage. The law on it relies on federal budget appropriations to the tune of 2.6 trillion rubles (for benefits to the needy) and is supposed to go into effect as of 1 January 1995. The draft law provides for a dual principle of counting: The subsistence wage level to be established in every federation component is 40 percent of the average per capita income but not less than the cost of the consumer basket. The same dual macro-approach of the "Choice" applies to social policy. On the one hand, Mr. Gaydar constantly reminds about the need to cut back centralized subsidies, while on the other hand, "Russia's Choice" men seem to be dealing the budget a serious blow promising protection for the underprivileged. The organizers of the news conference specially underscored that this is a seeming contradiction because the men's activities in drafting laws in the social sphere do not set the aim of the "each will get an apartment" type -- this is demagoguery. Their efforts are aimed at a just distribution of state assistance so that "a one-room family with two children, two domestic servants and two Volvo cars could buy an apartment rather than wait for municipal housing." A smart plan. Unfortunately, such social policy leads to the need to withdraw benefits from those who undeservedly enjoy them -- like the above-mentioned family or that same family of Robert Kennedy -- and it is common knowledge that we like to get benefits and hate to give them back. On the other hand, voters who enjoy "dishonest" benefits may not make up Mr. Gaydar's electorate after all. At any rate, the journalists were made to understand that unpopular measures are not something he has to come to terms with.
