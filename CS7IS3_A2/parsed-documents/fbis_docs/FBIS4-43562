A draft resolution is to be presented next week to the United Nations. This morning, President Francois Mitterrand spoke in Paris at a UNESCO conference. He supported the idea of French humanitarian intervention in Rwanda. The French president said the situation requires urgent measures, even if the United Nations does not give its blessing to the operation: [Begin Mitterrand recording] We can no longer wait. Everyone can see that. There remain a few hospitals, churches, some sites where not everyone has been massacred. It is therefore the extreme urgency of the situation which pressed Foreign Minister Alain Juppe to say that without waiting for the arrival of the UN force, France, together with those of its European or African partners who might be willing to help, is prepared to send a humanitarian protection force aimed at ensuring the security of the civilian population which has so far avoided extermination. This is being organized, it is now a matter of hours or days. This is the point we have reached. I must say that two or three African countries have replied positively, and we are still waiting for firm responses from European countries. Whatever happens, we'll do it. I repeat: every hour counts. [end recording]
