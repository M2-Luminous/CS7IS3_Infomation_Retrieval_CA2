Shumeyko added that "later, we shall probably live to see a federation, each member of which will remain free". According to Vladimir Shumeyko, the former Soviet republics will never give up their freedom, but will continue to gravitate towards one another on the strength of their economic, cultural, and spiritual traditions. Shumeyko noted that the Baltic republics alone are not "seeking contacts with the former Union parts, while all the others are feeling the attraction". In this connection, the head of the upper chamber of the Russian parliament expressed his belief that in Byelorussia [Belarus] and Ukraine "the people will vote in the presidential elections for those whose attitude to Russia they think correct". Vladimir Shumeyko said the council of the heads of parliaments of the Commonwealth member-states, which met in St. Petersburg the other day, discussed strengthening economic ties in the framework of the Commonwealth of Independent States. Participants in the discussion said the creation of a strong union can be boosted by legislative acts and it is necessary to "provide a legal frame for the economic union". The council adopted a resolution on CIS peacekeeping forces, which also calls for preparing a relevant regulation. Shumeyko noted that the CIS peacekeeping forces already exist de facto, but mainly at a cost to Russia. According to Shumeyko, this gives rise to rumours about Russia's alleged imperial ambitions. In order to avoid such rumours and ease Russia's economic burden in maintaining the forces, it is necessary to create CIS collective forces. Shumeyko said that the participants in the St. Petersburg forum called for joining the Commonwealth summit on September 9 to discuss this proposal, as well as preparations for the festivities marking the fiftieth anniversary of the victory in the last world war.
