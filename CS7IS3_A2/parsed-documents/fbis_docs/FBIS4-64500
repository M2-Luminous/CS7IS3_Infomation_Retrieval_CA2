Hata told Scalfaro that Japan needs to make important contributions to the international community, and hopes to promote cooperation with European nations knowledgeable and experienced in affairs in Africa, the Middle East and East Europe. During the 45-minute meeting, the Italian head of state asked about the future prospect of economic relations between Japan and the United States, the world's two largest economic powers, saying the relationship will affect many other countries. The prime minister expressed hope to settle a bilateral impasse over trade "framework" talks at an early date, the officials said. Hata assured Scalfaro that the outcome of talks between Japan and the United States will apply to any other country. Hata's predecessor, Morihiro Hosokawa, and President Bill Clinton failed in their February summit in Washington to strike a deal on a new framework to slash Japan's trade surplus and increase its share of imports. Talks have not been resumed. Hata arrived in Rome Monday night, kicking off a series of official visits to Italy, France, Germany and Belgium. Hata's trip, less than a week into his post as prime minister, is aimed at forging personal ties with leaders before the July summit of he Group of Seven (G-7) major industrialized nations, in Naples, Japanese Foreign Ministry officials said.
