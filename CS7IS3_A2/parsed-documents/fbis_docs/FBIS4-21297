Kerry, a Democratic senator from the state of Massachusetts and chairman of the U.S. Senate's hearings on terrorism, narcotics, and international crime, stated last Saturday that although "organized" crime prevailed in Panama during the regime of former General Manuel Antonio Noriega, "disorganized" crime now persists under the Guillermo Endara administration. Mulino, who recently traveled to the Vatican and Russia on diplomatic visits, pointed out to Radio KW Continente that he believes Kerry's statements are "unfortunate" and that they should not be interpreted as originating from the U.S. Government. The foreign minister also stressed that the U.S. senator's statements "have not been very prudent." Mulino explained: "The entire world is aware of the efforts we have made, despite our government's economic and human resource limitations, to straighten out what Noriega left us in 1989 after being deposed by the U.S. invasion." On the other hand, the foreign minister also referred to statements by Robert Gelbard, deputy assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs [title as published], who acknowledged Panama's efforts against drug trafficking and the importance of a high-level meeting between the two nations to discuss the issue, as proposed by Panama. Meanwhile, legislator Leo Gonzalez admitted Panama has not done enough about the problem of money laundering via corporations, and this is where the focus of all U.S. Government complaints lies. According to Gonzalez, the struggle against drug trafficking has been tremendous, but the government has fallen short in combating money laundering, which is the one activity that ensures the drug traffickers' survival.
