During the opening of the World Economic Forum in Davos this evening, he said this was the truth, even if it had to be said with "anger and bitterness." The primary aim remains "to guarantee the supply of humanitarian aid to the people in Bosnia-Herzegovina." All military experts were agreed that a comprehensive "ground intervention aimed at ending the war would require many hundreds of thousands of troops." Such an operation would involve many victims, not least among the civilian population. "The question as to whether lasting peace could be secured in this manner is still open." As war has not been banished from Europe once and for all, the European Union will have to do everything it can "to develop an effective and credible common foreign and security policy."
