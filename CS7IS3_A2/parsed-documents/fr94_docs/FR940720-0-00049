FR940720-0-00049 FR940720-0-00003 After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. There are approximately 94 Model MD&hyph;11 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 42 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD. Accomplishment of the required inspections for installation of parts will take approximately 4 work hours per airplane, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of these requirements of this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $9,240, or $220 per airplane, per inspection. Accomplishment of the required verification for tightness of the shear pin retainer attaching parts will take approximately 6 work hours per airplane, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of these requirements of this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $13,860, or $330 per airplane, per verification. Accomplishment of the required terminating modification will take approximately 6 work hours per airplane, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Required parts will be provided by the manufacturer at no cost to operators. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of these requirements of this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $13,860, or $330 per airplane. The total cost impact figures discussed above are based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Incorporation by reference, Safety. Adoption of the Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration amends part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. §39.13␣ [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by removing amendment 39&hyph;8403 (57 FR 47991, October 21, 1992), and by adding a new airworthiness directive (AD), amendment 39&hyph;8973, to read as follows: 94&hyph;15&hyph;02 McDonnell Douglas: Amendment 39&hyph;8973. Docket 93&hyph;NM&hyph;216&hyph;AD. Supersedes AD 92&hyph;23&hyph;03, Amendment 39&hyph;8403. Applicability: Model MD&hyph;11 series airplanes; as listed in McDonnell Douglas MD&hyph;11 Alert Service Bulletin A54&hyph;31, dated September 17, 1992, and McDonnell Douglas MD&hyph;11 Alert Service Bulletin A54&hyph;31, Revision 1, dated June 3, 1993; certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent structural damage to the engine mount structure, which could lead to loss of airplane components, accomplish the following: (a) For airplanes listed in McDonnell Douglas MD&hyph;11 Alert Service Bulletin A54&hyph;31, dated September 17, 1992: Within 15 days after November 5, 1992 (the effective date of AD 92&hyph;23&hyph;03, amendment 39&hyph;8403), unless previously accomplished within the last 30 days, perform a visual inspection of the thrust link of the center engine forward mount to verify installation of the shear pins, the shear pin retainers, and the shear pin retainer attaching parts in accordance with McDonnell Douglas MD&hyph;11 Alert Service Bulletin A54&hyph;31, dated September 17, 1992, or Revision 1, dated June 3, 1993. (1) If shear pins, shear pin retainers, and shear pin retainer attaching parts are installed, repeat the visual inspection thereafter at intervals not to exceed 60 days until accomplishment of paragraph (c) or (d) of this AD. (2) If any shear pin retainer or shear pin retainer attaching part is missing or loose, and if any shear pin has migrated, prior to further flight, repair in accordance with a method approved by the Manager, Los Angeles Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate.
