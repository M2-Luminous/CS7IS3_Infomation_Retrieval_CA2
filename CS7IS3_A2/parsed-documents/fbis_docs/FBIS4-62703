The statement runs as follows: "The recent developments in the Crimea, statements and acts of the Crimean officials provoke Ukrainian and international concern over a possibility of sharp deterioration of the Crimean social and economic situation and formation of a danger and instability spot in Central Europe. ``The new leadership of the autonomy has passed over from declaration of its intentions to actions aiming to change the legal status of the Autonomous Republic of the Crimea as an integral party of Ukraine. ``For instance, a regular meeting of the Crimean Supreme Soviet plans to discuss the return to specific provisions of the Crimean Constitution in the edition of 6 May 1992, which ran counter to the Ukrainian Constitution and were changed by the Crimean Supreme Soviet itself in September 1992. Thus, an attempt is being made to revise the current Crimean constitution and create grounds for the Crimean separation from Ukraine which would be a gross violation of the Ukrainian territorial integrity. ``Attempts of the Crimean leadership to legalize Crimean citizenship, create the Crimean Armed Forces and change the status of the city of Sevastopol provoke alarm. ``All this runs counter to the Ukrainian Constitution and laws, as well as universally-recognized principles of the international law. ``Ambitious strivings of some Crimean politicians run counter to the Ukrainian goodwill to contribute to the comprehensive social, economic and cultural development of the Crimea. It was the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet that gave the Crimean region a status of the autonomous republic within Ukraine, adopted a law `on division of powers between the Ukrainian and Crimean state power bodies.' The Ukrainian president issued a decree `on regime of open economy on territory of the Crimean Republic.' The Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers has regulated with the Crimean Government the property issues, the formation of the budget and implemented a number of measures to stabilize the Crimean economy. ``Ukraine is holding a policy to restore historical justice as regards the deported peoples, and helps the return of Crimean Tatars to their historical motherland. ``Instead of fully using the possibilities to overcome the economic crisis, certain political forces of the Crimean Autonomous Republic have adopted a different course. They are clearly speculating on economic difficulties in Ukraine and other Commonwealth states. Even under these complicated conditions Ukraine finds it possible to cover the deficit of Crimean financial and material resources. Despite the objective realities, anti-Ukrainian and anti-state feelings are being stirred up among the Crimean population. ``The facts show that dangerous processes in the Crimean Republic not only have purely Crimean nature but also, to a considerable extent, encouraged by certain Russian political forces, whose actions are growing into clear interference in the Ukrainian internal affairs. ``In accordance with the Ukrainian Constitution and the current legislation, the Republic of Crimea is an integral autonomous part of Ukraine, which has broad rights in the sphere of the economy, the use of natural resources, ecology, culture and public life. Being an integral autonomous part of Ukraine, the Republic of Crimea is not a carrier of state sovereignty and cannot have political relations with foreign states. ``The Ukrainian Constitution is valid throughout Ukraine, including the Crimea. The Ukrainian territory is single, indivisible, inviolable and integral. The Republic of Crimea cannot have its own, separated from Ukraine, citizenship. Citizens of the Crimean Republic are also citizens of Ukraine. The autonomy cannot have its own armed forces. ``The press service of the Ukrainian president and the Cabinet of Ministers is authorized to state that the Ukrainian president and the Supreme Soviet will take all measures necessary to stabilize the Crimean political situation and ensure territorial integrity of Ukraine. The Ukrainian president will provide for unconditional observation of the Ukrainian Constitution and laws throughout territory of the state, including the Crimea as an integral part of Ukraine. ``The press service of the Ukrainian president and the Cabinet of Ministers calls attention to the fact that some Russian politicians and public figures are breaking the rules and norms of behavior on territory of a foreign state. In this connection any further attempts to interfere in the Ukrainian internal affairs will be resolutely stopped in accordance with the current Ukrainian legislation.''
