The new company is a 13 billion won joint venture between PosData, a telecommunications service arm of Pohang Iron and Steel Co. (POSCO), and Telstra, state-owned telecom operator of Australia. "We will start with the domestic value-added network (VAN) service market...but in the future we hope to play an active role in the Northeast Asian market," said Kim Tae-kyu, president and CEO of Atel, 51 percent of which is owned by PosData. The company has already taken over some of PosData's VAN services including electronic data interchange, electronic mail and network integration and information services. The company also plans to provide international services in enhanced fax, voice mail and other VAN services. To this end, the company has established extensive links with such international services as CompuServe, Nifty-Serve, EasyNet and SprintNet. Company officials said they are banking on the technological and market expertise of Telstra and the geographical location of Korea to launch into the Northeast Asian region including the Russian Far East and North Korea. Telstra, which was created in 1992 through a merger of Telecom Australia and international call carrier OTC, is the second biggest telecom operator in the Asia-Pacific region after NTT of Japan. PosData runs a nationwide computer network service called PosServe and also offers various VAN services including a data network linking giant steelmaker POSCO and its numerous subcontractors.
