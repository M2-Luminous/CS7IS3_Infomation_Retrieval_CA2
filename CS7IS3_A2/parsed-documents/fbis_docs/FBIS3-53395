However, today they did present the embassy with a letter written on behalf of the settlers, which urged the United States to avoid pressuring Israel on the negotiations with Syria. The U.S. Embassy's First Secretary Kyle Scott warmly welcomed the visitors in the embassy lobby. He promised that the letter would be faxed to Geneva, as well as Washington. He said the United States will do all it can to help Israel and Syria reach joint solutions. The delegation members were satisfied. Here is what Sammy Bar-Lev, the Qatzrin local council head, said: [Begin Bar-Lev recording] He reiterated several times the U.S. stand that the United States is not pressuring the State of Israel on the Golan matter, that it views it as a matter for Israeli-Syrian negotiations, which it is ready to assist. It will definitely not intervene or pressure. This is a very strong message to all kinds of commentators and advisers and politicians, who predicted that we will be unable to stand up to U.S. pressure. [end recording]
