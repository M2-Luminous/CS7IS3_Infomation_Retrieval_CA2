This new appeal, which concerns the whole of the Cameroon-Nigeria border, from Lake Chad to the Atlantic, follows "the occupation of Cameroonian villages in the northern part" of the country, the minister added on national radio in Yaounde. According to Cameroonian military sources, Nigerian troops took up positions in two villages in northern Cameroon about two weeks ago. Such incidents have been common along the 1,500-km land border between the two countries since the 1960's, particularly in the Lake Chad Region. In early 1994, Yaounde had already appealed to the ICJ regarding its border dispute with Abuja over the Bakassi Peninsula, an oil- rich region of 1,000 square kilometers in the Gulf of Guinea, over which both countries claim sovereignty.
