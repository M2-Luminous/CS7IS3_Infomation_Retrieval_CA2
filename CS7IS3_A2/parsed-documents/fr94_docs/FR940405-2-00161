FR940405-2-00161 FR940405-2-00068 12. If the annuitant dies prior to the annuity date, a death benefit is payable upon receipt of due proof of death as well as proof that the annuitant died prior to the annuity date. Up to the fifth anniversary of the Contract, the death benefit will be equal to the greater of: (1) Purchase payments paid, reduced by any partial surrenders (including applicable surrender charges and any incurred taxes); or (2) the Contract value on the date the applicable Company receives due proof of death. If a Company receives due proof of death after the fifth anniversary of the Contract, the death benefit is the greatest of: (1) Purchase payments paid, reduced by any partial surrenders (including applicable surrender charges and any incurred taxes); (2) the Contract value on the date the applicable Company receives due proof of death; or (3) the Contract value at the end of the fifth Contract year preceding the date the applicable Company receives due proof of death, plus purchase payments, less partial surrenders (including applicable surrender charges), and less any incurred taxes. 13. The Companies deduct an administration charge of $30 per Contract year ($45 if a PAC agreement was in force at any time during the Contract year) to compensate the applicable Company for the administrative services provided to Contract owners. This charge will be deducted from the Contract value at the end of each Contract year prior to the annuity date, and upon a full surrender on any date other than a Contract anniversary. Applicants represent that the administration charge will be deducted in reliance on Rule 26a&hyph;1 and Rule 6c&hyph;8 under the 1940 Act, and represents reimbursement only for the administration costs expected to be incurred over the life of the Contract. This charge is guaranteed not to increase for the duration of the Contract, and the Companies neither expect nor intend to make a profit from this charge. 14. The Companies will assess a daily administrative charge under the Contracts to compensate them for the administrative expenses they will bear in connection with the Contracts and the Accounts. For incurring these administrative expenses in connection with the Contracts and the Accounts, the Companies will deduct from their respective Contracts a daily administrative charge at an annual rate of 0.15% of the value of net assets in each subaccount. This rate will be guaranteed not to increase for the duration of the Contract. 15. A contingent deferred sales charge of 6% of the amount withdrawn is imposed on certain full surrenders or partial surrenders of Contract Value to cover expenses relating to the sale of the Contracts, including commissions to registered representatives and other promotional expenses. 16. Purchase payments paid at least five or more Contract years prior to the date of surrender or partial surrender are not subject to the contingent deferred sales charge. The Companies will also waive the contingent deferred sales charge for the first partial surrender in any Contract year if equal to or less than 10% of current premiums (premiums paid within the previous four Contract years, less any prior partial surrenders or systematic withdrawals from current premiums), and if the Contract owner has not elected the systematic withdrawal privilege for that Contract year. The Companies will not deduct the contingent deferred sales charge from investment earnings. 17. The Companies will assess a daily charge to compensate them for bearing certain mortality and expense risks in connection with the Contracts. This charge is equal to an effective annual rate of 1.25% of the value of the net assets in the applicable Account. Of that amount, approximately 0.55% is attributable to mortality risks, and approximately 0.70% is attributable to expense risks. The Companies guarantee that this charge will never increase. 18. The mortality risk borne by the Companies arises from: (1) Their contractual obligations to make annuity payments (determined in accordance with the annuity tables and other provisions contained in the Contracts) regardless of how long all annuitants or any individual annuitant may live; and (2) their possible obligation to pay a claim for a death benefit in excess of a Contract owner's Contract value. The Companies also will assume an expense risk through their guarantees not to increase the charges for issuing the Contracts and administering the Contracts and the Accounts, regardless of their actual expenses, including maintaining policy records, communicating with Contract owners, and processing transactions. 19. If the mortality and expense risk charges under a Contract are insufficient to cover actual costs and assumed risks, the loss will fall on the applicable Company. Conversely, if the charges are more than sufficient to cover costs, any excess will be profit to the Company. The Companies currently do not anticipate a profit from these charges.
