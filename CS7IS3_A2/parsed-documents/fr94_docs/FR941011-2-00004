FR941011-2-00004 FR941011-2-00002 _The use providing for the release of records pursuant to a grand jury subpoena or request (previously numbered 12), is proposed to be revised to recognize the role of the cognizant U.S. Attorney and it would be renumbered as 11. The other routine uses would remain basically the same as previously published except for the following changes in the numbering sequence: routine uses previously numbered 7, 8, 9, and 15, would now be numbered 6, 7, 8, and 12, respectively. Concerning USDA/OIG&hyph;2, ``Intelligence Records, USDA/OIG,'' the proposal would change the system name to ``Informant and Undercover Agent Records'' which represents a more descriptive title for the records contained in the system. Also, to clarify the categories of individuals covered by the system, USDA/OIG proposes to delete subjects, who are covered in USDA/OIG&hyph;3, and add confidential informants, investigative operatives, and undercover OIG special agents or other law enforcement personnel. In addition, the proposal includes adding criminal histories and undercover identification documents as categories of records in the system. For USDA/OIG&hyph;3, ``Investigative Files and Subject/Title Index, USDA/OIG,'' the proposal would change the system name to ``Investigative Files and Automated Investigative Indices System'' to reflect computerization of part of the system. This proposed change from manually prepared index cards to an automated indices system is also reflected throughout the system description. Concerning categories of individuals covered by the system, USDA/OIG proposes to delete applicants for employment (who are covered under USDA/OIG&hyph;1), individuals whose names have been checked through the system, and complainants who have requested anonymity or confidentiality regarding their identity. The proposal also changes the retention period for records in this system from 15 years to 10 years to bring it into line with the guidelines in the National Archives and Records Administration General Records Schedules. In regard to the system numbered USDA/OIG&hyph;4, the system now called ``Liaison Records'' is being deleted because these records are no longer maintained, and it is proposed to assign the number USDA/OIG 4 to ``OIG Hotline Complaint Records,'' which records are proposed to be taken out of the ``Investigative Files'' system (USDA/OIG&hyph;3) and set up as a separate system of records. OIG has a special staff just for the initial handling of incoming hotline complaints and the volume of activity in this area is sufficient to justify a separate system. Also, not all complaints result in investigations and in those instances there would not be an investigative file as such. In addition, this would be of assistance to individual complainants in that OIG would be able to respond more quickly to followup requests from individuals as to the status or disposition of their complaints. This record system would be exempt from certain provisions of the Privacy Act just as the hotline records are currently exempt under system USDA/OIG&hyph;3. For USDA/OIG&hyph;5, ``Management Information and Data Analysis System, USDA/OIG,'' the proposal would change the name of the system to ``Consolidated Assignments, Personnel Tracking, and Administrative Information Network (CAPTAIN),'' to reflect an update of this computerized data base system. The proposal also includes changes in various data elements of the system so that they accurately reflect the information in these updated automated records. The routine uses are basically the same as in the previous system. Concerning the system numbered USDA/OIG&hyph;6, the proposal is to eliminate the system now called ``Audit Information System'' because these records are no longer maintained in such a manner that they can be retrieved by individual name or other individual identifier, and then reassign the number USDA/OIG&hyph;6 to the ``Training Tracking System,'' which records will be separated from the ``Employee Records'' system (USDA/OIG&hyph;1). The majority of employee training records will still remain part of the ``Employee Records'' system. The proposed system is only for tracking OIG audit employee training. This separate computerized system is needed because of the complex continuing education requirements for auditors. For instance, General Accounting Office Government Auditing Standards require that every 2 years auditors complete 80 hours of training contributing to their professional proficiency, of which at least 20 hours of the training should be completed in any 1 year, and for auditors working on Government audits, at least 24 of the 80 hours should be directly related to Government auditing. The data elements in this system are similar to those in ``Employee Records'' except that a routine use has been added concerning the furnishing of records to a Federal agency or professional organization if relevant to a determination of professional proficiency and compliance with general qualification standards for Government auditing.
