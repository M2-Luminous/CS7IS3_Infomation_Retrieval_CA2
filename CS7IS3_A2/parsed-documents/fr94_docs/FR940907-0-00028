The intended effect of this action is to approve Maryland's revised VOC regulations to correct deficiencies in Maryland's ozone SIP. This action is being taken under the Clean Air Act (the Act). EFFECTIVE DATE: This final rule will become effective on October 7, 1994. ADDRESSES: Copies of the documents relevant to this action are available for public inspection during normal business hours at the Air, Radiation, and Toxics Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region III, 841 Chestnut Building, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107; the Air and Radiation Docket and Information Center, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460; and the Maryland Department of the Environment, 2500 Broening Highway, Baltimore, Maryland, 21224. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Maria A. Pino, (215) 597&hyph;9337, at the EPA Regional office listed above. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On September 30, 1993 (58 FR 51028), EPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) for the State of Maryland. The formal SIP revision was submitted by Maryland on September 20, 1991, April 2, 1992, and January 18, 1993. The NPR proposed approval of revisions to Maryland's ozone SIP to EPA as a SIP revision to comply with part of the reasonably available control technology (RACT) fix-up requirement of the Clean Air Amendments of 1990 (the Amendments). Maryland's September 20, 1991 submittal consisted of the addition of COMAR 26.11.19.16 and Technical Memorandum 91&hyph;01 (TM 91&hyph;01), and revisions and additions to COMAR 26.11.01.01, 26.11.01.04, 26.11.06, 26.11.08, 26.11.10, 26.11.13.02, 26.11.14, 26.11.19.02, 26.11.19.07, 26.11.19.11, 26.11.19.12. On April 2, 1992, Maryland submitted further revisions to COMAR 26.11.01.01, 26.11.01.04, 26.11.04, 26.11.06, 26.11.10, 26.11.13.04, 26.11.13.05, 26.11.14, 26.11.19.02, 26.11.19.09, and 26.11.19.12, and TM 91&hyph;01. On June 17, 1992 Maryland submitted a letter to EPA withdrawing the capture efficiency protocols (Method 1003 of TM 91&hyph;01) from its September 20, 1991 SIP revision submittal. However, on January 18, 1993 Maryland formally resubmitted TM 91&hyph;01 to EPA as a SIP revision. This January 18, 1993 submittal also included amendments to COMAR 26.11.01.04, 26.11.06, 26.11.13.04, 26.11.13.05, and 26.11.19.07, and 26.11.19.15. Revisions to COMAR 26.11.04, 26.11.06, 26.11.08, 26.11.10, and 26.11.14, which are not related to VOCs, are addressed by separate rulemaking actions. Revisions to COMAR 26.11.13.04 and 26.11.19.15 also are the subject of separate rulemaking actions (58 FR 8565). This rulemaking action is approving the addition of Appendixes A and B and Methods 1000, 1002, 1003, 1006, 1007, 1008, 1009, 1011, and 1012 contained in TM 91&hyph;01 and COMAR 26.11.19.16 into the Maryland SIP, as well as amendments to COMAR 26.11.01.01, 26.11.01.04, 26.11.13.02, 26.11.13.05, 26.11.19.02, 26.11.19.07, 26.11.19.09, 26.11.19.11, and 26.11.19.12, which were proposed for approval on September 30, 1993 (58 FR 51028). Specifically, this action is approving the following revisions to the Maryland ozone SIP: (1) Amendments to the definition of the term ``volatile organic compound (VOC)'' to reflect current EPA guidance and to update citations (COMAR 26.11.01.01DD); (2) Amendments to COMAR 26.11.01.04C to delete a reference to Maryland's old technical memorandum and add a reference to: (1) Maryland's Technical Memorandum 91&hyph;01 (TM&hyph;91&hyph;01), Test Methods and Equipment Specifications for Stationary Sources , (January, 1991) as amended by Supplements 1 and 2 (July 1, 1991 and July 1, 1992, respectively); and (2) all EPA test methods contained in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, 1990 edition; (3) The addition of test methods applicable to VOC regulations: Methods 1000, 1002, 1003, 1006, 1007, 1008, 1009, 1011, and 1012 and Appendices A and B contained in TM 91&hyph;01; (4) Amendments to COMAR 26.11.13.02C(2), Maryland's storage tank regulation to exempt storage tanks with liquid mounted seals from the secondary seal requirement for consistency with the applicable control techniques guideline (CTG); (5) Amendments to COMAR 26.11.13.05B(2) and 26.11.13.05C(2) to delete specific references to the EPA approved test methods and replace the old reference with references to COMAR 26.11.01.04C. (6) Amendments to COMAR 26.11.19.02D, 26.11.19.09, 26.11.19.12F to delete references to Maryland's old technical memorandum and replace the old references with references to COMAR 26.11.01.04C. (7) Amendments to COMAR 26.11.19.07A to add definitions for the terms sheet-fed paper coating and ultraviolet curable coating. (8) Addition of new COMAR 26.11.19.07D, a RACT regulation for sheet-fed paper coating. Sheet-fed paper coating is a source category for which EPA has not issued a CTG, a so called ``non-CTG'' source category. (9) Amendments to COMAR 26.11.19.11B and C to clarify the applicability of this miscellaneous printing and coating regulation. (10) Addition of new COMAR 26.11.19.16, which contains VOC leak detection and repair requirements. This regulation applies to persons subject to any VOC regulation in COMAR 26.11.19 and not subject to a more specific leak requirement. Other specific requirements of these revisions, and the rationale for EPA's action are explained in the NPR and will not be restated here. No public comments were received on the NPR. Final Action EPA is approving the addition of Appendices A and B and Methods 1000, 1002, 1003, 1006, 1007, 1008, 1009, 1011, and 1012 contained in TM 91&hyph;01 and COMAR 26.11.19.16 into the Maryland SIP, as well as amendments to COMAR 26.11.01.01, 26.11.01.04, 26.11.13.02, 26.11.13.05, 26.11.19.02, 26.11.19.07, 26.11.19.09, 26.11.19.11, and 26.11.19.12, which were proposed for approval on September 30, 1993 (58 FR 51028) in Maryland's ozone SIP, which Maryland submitted to EPA on April 5, 1991. Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. I11This action has been classified as a Table 3 action for signature by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The OMB has exempted this regulatory action from E.O. 12866 review. Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action, pertaining to corrections to VOC regulations in the Maryland ozone SIP, must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by November 7, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2).)
