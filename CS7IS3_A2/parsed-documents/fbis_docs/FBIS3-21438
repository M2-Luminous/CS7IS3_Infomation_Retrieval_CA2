Narasimha Rao, today warned that the balance between religion and politics, which are distinct and separate spheres, is under challenge as never before. "Freedom of religion does not imply freedom to misuse religion for political ends," he said while opening an international conference on `religion and politics' here. Cautioning the people against divisions of majority and minority on the basis of religion, he said the polarisation with a religious focus was sought to be turned into "political polarisation for party advantage." "This obviously violates the basic secular structure of the Constitution under which democracy operates. The line between the two is thus abundantly clear and needs to be enforced in whatever manner necessary," he stressed. Organised by Rajiv Gandhi Institute for Contemporary Studies, under the aegis of Rajiv Gandhi Foundation, the conference has drawn distinquished scholars from India and abroad. The Human Resource Development Minister, Mr. Arjun Singh and Ms. Sonia Gandhi, chairperson of Rajiv Gandhi Foundation, attended the conference. Mr. Rao said religion has and will continue to have a profound influence on the way people think, feel, act and react. This influence could not be wished away but the issue had to be examined with an empathetic understanding of human nature and evolve solutions in consonance with it. Three key points: Highlighting three important aspects, Mr. Rao said that first the Constitution had the necessary clarity to specify the domain of religion in respect of politics and to take care of any transgressions. Second, freedom of religion does not imply freedom to misuse religion for political ends and this needs to be specifically spelt out. Third, our ancient civilisation provides a sound base on which to build a model for regulating the interaction of religion and politics. Dwelling upon religious tolerance in Indian society, Mr. Rao said a liberal outlook was the distinctive feature of our civilisation. "This is a remarkable example of a society, and a polity, in which there is a wide range of religious communities that co-existed over long centuries," he said. Brushing aside as "romantic" suggestions that the co-existence between diverse religious communities had been entirely free of social violence and communal strife, Mr. Rao said the dominant characteristic of religious interaction within Indian society is that of tolerance and harmony. It would be appropriate for scholars to explore how our religious and political leaders were able to create in the past a durable, liberal society within a multi-religious polity. Pausing upon his reflections, the Prime Minister added that while life is taken as comprehensive, its various aspects have also been developed separately, each with an autonomy which makes it free and unaffected by the other to a great extent. "This could be a form of the separation of religion from politics, which has been achieved quite naturally and spontaneously. Neither has questioned the other, nor interfered with the other. There appears to be no time when an adversarial relationship developed between religion and the political process." Paying rich tributes to Mahatma Gandhi whose 46th death anniversary was observed today, the Prime Minister said it was tragic that this apostle of non-violence met his end at the hands of a religious fanatic. "In the manner of his death we have a demonstration of the difference between faith and fanaticism and of the damage that religious fanaticism can inflict." `Disturbing develoments': Stressing the need to examine the relation between religion and politics urgently because of certain disturbing developments in recent years, Mr. Rao expressed disdain over the divisive influence of religious fanaticism on the international scene. "Today, when a scholar proposes that the next major conflict in the world will be on religious lines, people listen with attention. Forty years back such a thesis would have been dismissed out of hand," he said. In his keynote address, Mr. Arjun Singh said the foundations of the Constitution rest upon the sanctity of liberal institutions and also upon the freedom of religious worship. The imperative to strike a meaningful balance between religion and politics to avoid disruption of social order and human progress is universally recognised, he said. In her brief opening remarks, Ms. Sonia Gandhi, touched upon the universality of Indian culture. She said the beauty and profundity of Indian culture was that it had received and welcomed several faiths and was home to several major religions.
