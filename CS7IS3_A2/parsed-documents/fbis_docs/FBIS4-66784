Both sides seem to have gone through a routine exchange of their respective positions without conceding any ground. While Mr Talbott reiterated the Clinton administration's view that the supply of military equipment, including F-16 fighters, will assist the verifiable capping of the production of highly-enriched uranium for making nuclear weapons in Pakistan, India has refused to endorse the deal and expressed concern over the move to supply the weaponry. Given the history of distrust between India and Pakistan and, for the matter, between India and the United States it was difficult for India to accept what it sees as a step that will boost Pakistan's military strength at a time when the latter is in a particularly belligerent mood. The American side argues, perhaps somewhat tendentiously, that the supply of military equipment will not affect the India-Pakistan military balance, but New Delhi obviously thinks otherwise. Indian and Pakistani forces are currently evenly matched if there is a short, sharp conflict. But the addition of 38 fourth generation fighters along with 3C Orion maritime reconnaissance and strike aircraft is liable to tilt the balance against India. Contrary to expectations, the American visitor did not bring any package of "suggestions" on the nuclear non-proliferation issue for India. This may have been due to the awareness that the issue just does not fit into the U.S.-Pakistan matrix and requires to be addressed separately. It is possible that Washington may have decided that the complex South Asian scene has to be untangled gradually and has decided to devote the first part of its efforts to Pakistan. It has to be remembered in this context that it was American forbearance that resulted in Islamabad not only acquiring the bomb but also the delivery systems in the form of the first batch of F-16s. In any case there are far too many imponderables relating to Washington's new initiative in South Asia, the attitudes of Pakistan and China being the most obvious, to come to any immediate conclusion about future prospects. Mr Talbott cannot but be aware that in its first year, the Clinton administration had not only ignored South Asia, but through statements of the President and some of his officials unnecessarily soured the relationship between New Delhi and Washington to an extent not seen recently. Insofar as it sought to make amends, the visit was useful, as were the nuances suggesting that America might be willing to deal with India as India, and not as a function of its relationship with Pakistan. But he should not be surprised if he detected a note of scepticism in Indian responses.
