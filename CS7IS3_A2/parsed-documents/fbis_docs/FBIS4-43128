In the meantime, Labor Minister Clemente Mastella is sending out peace signals, and has announced the government's preparedness to adopt the provisions on employment through a draft bill, thus renouncing the controversial decree option. "I told the prime minister that we had to speak with the unions: Negotiations must work," the minister explained. In the meantime, reactions from the trade unions are cautiously positive. According to Bruno Trentin, CGIL [Italian General Confederation of Labor] leader, "it is essential" that the fiscal "bonus" for employers taking on new staff be limited to indefinite duration contracts, since otherwise "many forms of precarious employment would benefit from tax deductions." For his part, CGIL "number two" Sergio Cofferanti expressed the suspicion that the provision's postponement was a way of avoiding the issue until after the elections. On the other hand, Sergio D'Antoni, CISL [Italian Confederation of Trade Unions] secretary, believed that Berlusconi had "acted wisely." [Petrini] Minister Mastella, despite the mediation attempts, your proposed legislation is at a standstill. Why is this so? [Mastella] If we want to safeguard the employment situation, we must bear in mind three factors: We must place our stakes on recovery, guarantee social peace, and implement flexible instruments. Therefore no sudden breaks. [Petrini] Therefore the way forward is through negotiations? [Mastella] Certainly. [Petrini] Was everyone agreed on this line at last Wednesday's [8 June] Council of Ministers meeting? Were there no "hawks"? [Mastella] I attended the Council of Ministers meeting after meeting with the trade unions, and I explained that we could not move toward a head-on confrontation if we wanted to preserve social peace. They listened to me. [Petrini] How did things go with Berlusconi? [Mastella] I explained to Berlusconi that the trade unions were also requesting to speak with him in order to get a full picture of the situation, and that we should not be perceived to be mistreating them. [Petrini] However, now everything has been postponed until next week, when the prime minister will meet the unions. As far as the proposed legislation is concerned, has a rapprochement taken place? [Mastella] For my part, I have not taken up any rigid positions. [Petrini] How do you mean, minister? The trade unions do not want this area to be tackled by means of decree laws. Do you agree? [Mastella] If we draw up a draft bill instead, it will not be the end of the world. [Petrini] Another hurdle is constituted by entry wage levels. The unions will not listen to any talk about reducing wages by law, but seem to be better disposed to a solution based on free bargaining between the two sides. What is your position? [Mastella] I am also prepared to discuss this point. Among other things, we must determine whether the question is to be solved at national or, alternatively, at company level. In any case, we must realize that something must be done. [Petrini] Furthermore, there is the issue of the overlapping incentives for new employment, including limited time contracts, entry wage levels, part-time arrangements, and so on. The unions seem to have adopted a fairly rigid stance in this respect. What is your opinion? [Mastella] In this respect, we view things differently from the unions. In my opinion, the measures are complementary, rather than alternative. My philosophy is not a Dash-type philosophy, according to which "two temporary jobs are better than a single permanent job." However, it is undeniable that a temporary job is better than nothing at all. Let me remind you that families take this view too. [Petrini] Yet, a temporary job does not seem to be anyone's maximum aspiration.... [Mastella] We must bear in mind that these measures are to be taken at a specific stage in the development of the economy. We are not aiming to keep them in force for ever. Two or three years from now, we can review the situation.
