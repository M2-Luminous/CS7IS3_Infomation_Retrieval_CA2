Secretary of State at the Defence Ministry Jerzy Milewski, who is accompanying the defence minister in his American visit, explained that only assistance within the framework of bilateral cooperation is concerned because one cannot count on the American side to grant money to cover Polish part of costs involved in the implementation of the "Partnership for Peace" programme. Kolodziejczyk added that NATO intends to assign between 15 and 40 million dollars for the whole "Partnership for Peace" programme and costs Poland would have to bear are estimated at 25 million dollars. Jerzy Milewski said that the Polish delegation tried to persuade the senators with whom it met that means for assistance to Poland should be assigned from the U.S. budget. This matter was supported by Senator Hank Brown, who promised to put forward a motion to the effect. Minister Kolodziejczyk said that the modernization of the Polish Army is the condition of top priority for the development of military cooperation between Poland and the United States. Although the present policy pursued by the Pentagon does not envisage the sale of arms to countries of eastern and central Europe, minister Kolodziejczyk said that he was striving also for this. "We have to gain a supplier alternative to the previous eastern one because such are the attributes of a sovereign state," the minister added. He also revealed that joint Polish-American manoeuvres would be held in Poland this year. He explained that he settled this issues during the Wednesday meeting with Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staffs John Shalikashvili, who is to monitor the exercises. On Thursday, Kolodziejczyk met with director of the Central Intelligence Agency James Woolsey with whom he discussed cooperation in the field of military intelligence. On Friday Kolodziejczyk is to sign a Polish-American agreement on military cooperation.
