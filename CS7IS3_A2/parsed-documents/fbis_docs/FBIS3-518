In a statement, Mr Terreblanche said: "The AWB has undertaken to provide President Mangope with any support he may need including, if necessary, physical force to prevent the communist rabble from turning Bophuthatswana into another African National Congress [ANC]-type Transkei tin pot state." He expressed the AWB's concern at what he called attempts by the ANC/South African Communist Party/(Foreign Minister) Pik Botha alliance to undermine and destroy the government of Bophuthatswana. "Mr Botha was the same man who, four years ago, actually sped to the assistance of President Mangope when the communist rabble tried to overthrow the legal government of Bophuthatswana. "It is a sad reflection on the National Party that they are prepared to stab their former loyal friends in the back in this despicable manner."
