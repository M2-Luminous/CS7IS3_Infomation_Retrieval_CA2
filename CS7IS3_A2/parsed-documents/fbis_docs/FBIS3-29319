The turmoil, however, has left an indelible mutual distrust between Prime Minister Hosokawa and Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura who are playing a pivotal role in the coalition government. Their discord still remains deep in the prime minister's official residence, and there is a possibility that discord could erupt some day in the future. At a news conference on the afternoon of 8 February, Prime Minister Hosokawa apologized to the people for his failure to undertake the proper procedure prior to the announcement of the "national welfare tax." Shortly after the news conference, Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura murmured, "Although I did not see well, I wonder if Mr. Hosokawa bowed his head to the people." Mr. Takemura's expression revealed his discontent with the prime minister, who devoted much of his time in the news conference to the clarification of his position while apologizing to the people. Mr. Takemura was notified of the plan for the "national welfare tax" that the prime minister had drawn up behind the scenes on the advice of Ichiro Ozawa, representative secretary of Shinseito [the Japan Renewal Party], and Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary general of the Komeito, shortly before dawn 3 February, when the prime minister announced the new tax system at a news conference. The Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] resisted the new tax system with the posture of not hesitating to back out of the coalition government. Speaking at a news conference on the morning of 3 February, Mr. Takemura said: "It cannot be said that all things are right. There is a saying that it is best to correct mistakes." In this way, from the outset, Mr. Takemura urged the prime minister to think of shelving his plan for a national welfare tax. The chief cabinet secretary, who is in a position to assist the prime minister, admonished the prime minister. In reaction, people in the ruling coalition parties criticized Mr. Takemura, saying, "He is like a wife who calls her husband a `bad guy at home' when her husband is criticized by people," (according to a senior official of a ruling party). At the time of inaugurating the coalition government, they were widely known "allies." They have promised a "marriage" of merging the Japan New Party and Sakigake [the Harbinger Party]. The story of the marriage, however, still floats in the air as the prime minister increasingly attaches importance to his ties with Messrs. Ozawa and Ichikawa, and the feud is intensifying between Mr. Takemura and Messers. Ozawa and Ichikawa. The differences between the prime minister and Mr. Takemura on the strategy and prospects for a realignment of political parties are becoming apparent. In the midst of the uproar over the tax issue, Mr. Takemura met with Keigo Ouchi, health and welfare minister and chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party, and Satsuki Eda, director general of the Science and Technology Agency, and representative of the the United Social Democratic Party. Mr. Takemura is solidifying his ties with social democratic forces while arranging a meeting between Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the SDPJ, and Chairman Ouchi. There is no doubt that he is making those moves with the second realignment of political parties taken into account. His moves also aim at keeping the prime minister from tilting toward the Shinseito [the Japan Renewal Party] and the Komeito. Mr. Takemura once spoke highly of the prime minister, saying, "Mr. Hosokawa is a person who can make manly decisions." Of late, however, Mr. Takemura has not praised the prime minister's ability to make decisions. Now they are unable to read each others' real intentions, and Mr. Takemura appears to have sensed that the prime minister is making decisions on the advice of Messers. Ozawa and Ichikawa while "leaving him out in the cold." During the government of the Liberal Democratic Party, the practice was that the post of chief cabinet secretary went to a politician who had served the prime minister as his confidant for a long time. The relationship between the prime minister and the chief cabinet secretary has changed under the coalition government. Less than two years have passed since the prime minister and Mr. Takemura began to work together as political allies. It seems that Mr. Takemura thinks of himself as a key player on an equal footing with the prime minister. At the prime minister's official residence, their uneasy relationship has become the daily target of attention.
