Rosemary Thomson, Magistrates' Association chairman, said in a statement to Mr Howard: "The fact of the matter for sentencers is that few cases of possession reach the magistrates' courts. Police seem to be cautioning or doing nothing about possession for personal use." The magistrates joined the police and drug counsellors in criticising the decision as having little impact on the problem of drug abuse. Latest Home Office figures show that [the] majority of those dealt with by the police for possession of class B drugs, which includes cannabis and amphetamines, are cautioned. About 22,000 of the 41,352 cases arising in 1992 were dealt with by a caution and never reached court. About 10,000 defendants were fined for possession, with the average fine working out at £86. Only 365 people were fined more than £200 for possession, and of these only 52 were given the maximum fine. Current sentencing guidelines for magistrates suggest that £180 is the appropriate fine for offences of "average seriousness" in this category. The amount of cannabis found in possession of the defendant is a key determinant of the level of the fine. Mr Howard yesterday defended the decision to include the change in the Criminal Justice Bill currently before Parliament. "All we are doing is increasing the maximum level of the fine in line with other maximum fine levels which have been increased over the years," he said. The level of soft drug fines had been unchanged since 1977. "Magistrates will take into account the means of the people who come before them in deciding where to pitch the level of the fine in any particular case." He said that the £2,500 maximum was necessary to allow the courts to impose a heavy penalty where the quantity seized was so large it was believed that the defendant had intended to be a supplier but it had been too difficult to prove. Mike Goodman, director of Release, the national drug counselling agency, said he was alarmed by the Home Secretary's last suggestion. "That is fining people for crimes that have not been proved." Mr Goodman added that no single British authority on drugs or law enforcement had suggested that increasing the penalties was the way to deal with the growing problem of drugs misuse. Michael White adds: With a week to go before MPs vote on the homosexual age of consent, Downing Street last night rejected suggestions that Mr Howard's move to raise drugs fines was sending voters a signal of an anti-permissive kind. "It's an entirely separate issue," said a spokesman. COPYRIGHT: Guardian Newspapers Limited, February 15, 1994
