However, there is a large part of the territory that is free. We have consolidated there, politically and militarily, as a precondition for the liberation of the entire territory and linking with the surrounding territories of Tesanj, Maglaj, and Teslic communes. The true faces of all who were, until yesterday, our alleged friends and neighbors have been clearly shown by the example of Zepce. The ustashas and the chetniks have jointly done what they have done. However, I am truly puzzled that the Serbs have forgotten what the ustashas have done [words indistinct] they have committed a massacre upon the innocent civilians on that occasion, but are now friends with a common objective of destroying everything Muslim. The trust in neighbors, peace, and respect for oneself and one's property has backfired on Zepce in the most brutal possible way. Bearing in mind the betrayal and humiliating surrender of a great part of the command and soldiers, a clear message remains to all Zepce residents regardless of where they are: To those who have not done so yet, join a brigade as quickly as possible; to those who can help in any other possible way, do this immediately to help the brigade that has been formed very hastily with the help of other brigades which are situated on the free territory of Zepce commune and which are taking an active part in the combat. We shall return to Zepce. We do not doubt this. We will punish all criminals, ustashas, and Mate Boban. To those who did not bloody their hands and commit crimes, we will guarantee freedom and life together. We know who the criminals are and what they have done, and they have done many things not befitting civilized people.
