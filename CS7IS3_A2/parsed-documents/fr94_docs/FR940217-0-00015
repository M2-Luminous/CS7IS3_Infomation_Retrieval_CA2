FR940217-0-00015 FR940217-0-00006 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;112&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;8815; AD 94&hyph;03&hyph;08] Airworthiness Directives; McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;10 Series Airplanes and Model KC&hyph;10A (Military) Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment supersedes an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;10 series airplanes and Model KC&hyph;10A (military) airplanes, that currently requires certain structural modifications and inspections. This amendment requires additional structural modifications and inspections. This amendment is prompted by an evaluation by the Model DC&hyph;10 Task Group, which identified additional modifications for mandatory action. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent degradation in the structural capabilities of the affected airplanes. This action also reflects the FAA's decision that long-term continued operational safety should be assured by actual modification of the airframe, where feasible, rather than only repetitive inspections for known service problems. DATES: Effective March 21, 1994. The incorporation by reference of McDonnell Douglas Report No. MDC&hyph;K1571, ``DC&hyph;10/KC&hyph;10 Aging Aircraft Service Action Requirements Document,'' Revision B, dated March 24, 1993, as listed in the regulations, is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of March 21, 1994. The incorporation by reference of McDonnell Douglas Report No. MDC&hyph;K1571, ``DC&hyph;10/KC&hyph;10 Aging Aircraft Service Action Requirements Document,'' Revision A, dated February 28, 1990, as listed in the regulations, was approved previously by the Director of the Federal Register as of September 10, 1990 (55 FR 31816, August 6, 1990).
