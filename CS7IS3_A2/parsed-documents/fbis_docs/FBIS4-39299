According to Heilongjiang Vice-Governor Wang Zhongzhang, quoted by the "HONGKONG CHINA NEWS AGENCY", the province is bound to revise its foreign economic strategy shortly with due account of "the new situation in the region". The heavy industry of this northeastern province, which borders on the Russian Far East and the Russian maritime territory, was built up with Soviet assistance in the fifties. It now accounts for an important share of the country's heavy industry. This is why the province was traditionally linked by close economic ties with its northern neighbour. However, trade between Heilongjiang and Russia had dropped drastically in the first quarter of this year -- by almost 45 per cent. This is partially due to Moscow's decision to impose visa restrictions on the entry of Chinese into the Russian Federation and also due to the growth of customs duties. Since Russia is short of convertible money, needed to trade with China, Wang Zhongzhang said, Beijing has already taken measures to limit the import of Russian raw materials and semifinished goods, for instance, steel rolled stock. As to Heilongjiang firms, which are in great straits due to the state sector's growing debt, they were recommended to seek "new external sources of financial revenues", primarily in Southeast Asian countries, where local Chinese businessmen have much weight. The volume of Russo-Chinese trade amounted to approximately 6.7 billion U.S. dollars in 1993 and Heilongjiang Province accounted for its lion's share. It is not without reason that Moscow had always praised this Chinese province. Three of its high-ranking officials were decorated in 1992 with Russian "people's friendship" orders for their "large contribution to the development of Russo-Chinese friendship".
