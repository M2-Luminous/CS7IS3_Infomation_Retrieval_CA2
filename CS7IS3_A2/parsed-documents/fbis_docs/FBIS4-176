FBIS4-176 "drafr064_c_94029" FBIS-AFR-94-064 Daily Report 4 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 2-3 Apr South African Press Review for 2-3 Apr MB0304100294 MB0304100294 BFN [Editorial Report] WEEKEND STAR Natal State of Emergency -- As troops are "settling into their new postings in Natal and kwaZulu," one man stands "at the center of the drama:" kwaZulu Chief Minister Buthelezi, an editorial in the Johannesburg WEEKEND STAR in English on 2-3 April on page 8 notes. Believing his "continued brinksmanship" would eventaully gain what he wanted, Buthelezi ignord a "lifeline from President de Klerk," allowing late registration for the election. With the "crumbling of the Freedom Alliance Buthelezi became increasingly isolated and desperate" and "with the apparent complicity of his king" he opened an "ethnic Pandora's box," attempting to "terrify Zulus in his kraal with talk of `ethnic cleansing' and `obliteration.'" As a result, the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] supporters on the ground "reacted with predictable militancy" and "just as predictably blood flowed." "It is an indication of the severity of the crisis" that de Klerk declared a state of emergency as "he must have been aware such a step would mean loss of conservative votes." Buthelezi is "left with a stark chioce -- to order a futile last stand, or finally face reality and order his administration to co-operate with the IEC [Independent Electoral Commission.]" SUNDAY TIMES Natal State of Emergency -- An editorial in Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES in English on 3 April on page 20 states the "declaration of a full state of emergency in kwaZula-Natal smacks of expedience, perhaps panic. It is in any case an unseemly way for the new South Africa to be born." While the "slaughter between Inkatha supporters and the ANC is of course a matter of desperate concern," "South Africa's problems are not caused in the first instance by the lack of law: this country has been bowed through decades by a surfeit of laws." The state of emergency is "open-ended, not subject to review," "it invites perpetuation." "The one truly remarkable thing about the adoption of this state of emergency is the alacrity with which the ANC has joined the National Party in defending these undemocratic measures on the basis that they protect democracy." There is "one small gesture which would go some way to ameliorating suspicion. Amend the emergency regulations to build in an immediate review facility which would allow an authoritative body -- why not the Independent Electoral Commission -- to scrap the emergency when a visible and pre-determined level of peace is established." SUNDAY NATION Natal State of Emergency -- "At long last, the Transitional Executive Council (TEC) has heard the cries of the people of Natal, and has responded," an editorial in Johannesburg SUNDAY NATION in English on 3 April on page 6 notes. "We are convinced" that this state of emergency is "directed at those who have been causing deaths and sufferings -- and are keen to continue doing so -- in the Natal/KwaZulu province." "It will give the security forces the powers they needed all along to act against para-military training which has been boastingly shown in our television screens. We mean the training of Inkatha's Self-Protection Units, the Boer Command's and also the ANC's Self-Defence Units. We also hope that Inkatha and rightwing leaders' war talk amd threats of civil war will come under serious scrunity from this state of emergency." "Surely, if it is a state of emergency that is needed to end all these things, then the principle that a state of emergency is necessarily a wrong thing does not apply in this case. We, however, need to caution the security forces against over-stepping their mark and make this state of emergency yet another licence to curtail civil liberties. We hope that the TEC, in particular, will place its sharp eye on the men and women that will enforce the state of emergency so as to prevent abuses from taking place."
