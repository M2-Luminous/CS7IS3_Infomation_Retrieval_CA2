So says the appeal by the Forum of North Caucasian Mass Organisations and Movements and Cossacks to the president, prime-minister and speakers of both parliamentary chambers of the Russian Federation. The forum took place in Nazran. In the opinion of its participants, the Russian leaders should proceed from an all-round analysis of the causes of inter-ethnic conflicts, to be conducted by well-trained and civic-minded experts. The appeal expresses the hope that wisdom and foresight of Russian politicians and statesmen will enable them to make a profound estimation of the conditions in the northern Caucasus and take effective political, economic and legal measures aimed at stabilisation.
