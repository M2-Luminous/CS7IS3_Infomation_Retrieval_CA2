To the farmers living in mountainous regions and wishing to have enough to eat and wear, this will not be just a dream. The Chinese Government has vowed to redouble efforts to send electric light to every county, to 95 percent of rural households by 2000. "China will make preferential policies concerning loans, taxation and revenues in this regard to speed up electric power projects to aid the poor in the vast countryside," said a government official. Meanwhile, China will implement a "source plan" to make comprehensive use of water sources in mountainous areas, for meeting the needs of people and livestock, for irrigation and for generation of electricity. According to statistics, 97 percent of the country's towns and 89 percent of its rural households had been electrified by 1993. Per capita consumption of electricity in the countryside rose to 275 kwh from less than 65 kwh in 1978, bringing the gross figure to 249 billion kwh, or 35 percent of the country's total consumption. However, 28 counties and some 120 million of the rural population in China remain without electricity, mainly in eight areas such as eastern Inner Mongolia, Guizhong and the Three Gorges. Among them, some eight million people even don't have enough to eat and wear. It has become obvious that the construction of hydroelectric power facilities and the electrification of China's rural areas have become priorities for farmers to overcome poverty. China announced the building of facilities to electrify a batch of counties in the early 1980s. By 1989, altogether 109 counties had met the requirements for rudimentary electrification. The second batch of 200 counties is now constructing power grids. As a result, more than 33 million rural people have benefited from the projects in getting electricity and drinking water. Moreover, government revenues of those counties doubled within the five years of the electrification campaign, and redoubled in the ensuing three years. The ongoing National Electrification Work Conference has set the target of building a total of 1,000 electrified counties across the country by the turn of this century. However, the shortage of capital, among others, is seriously threatening the realization of this objective. "Despite increased investments in the construction of electric power for rural areas," explained an official, "The gap between supply and demand expands." Wang Shucheng, vice-minister of power industry, said that about 30 billion yuan is needed simply to get electric power through to the areas and households without electricity -- averaging more than four billion yuan each year in the next seven years. The State Planning Commission, the State Economic and Trade Commission and the Ministry of Power Industry proposed phased arrangements of construction projects after careful planning and selection. They suggested the expansion of big grids be the main trend for covering the rural areas with electric power and reasonable increases in investment be made to innovate rural power grids and small hydroelectric and coal-fired power stations and to set up demonstration projects in using new sources of energy. In addition, they said, more channels should be opened for the flow of capital in this direction and joint power construction should be encouraged.
