Despite denials in Brussels yesterday, Mr Hurd told the Commons that the EC had confirmed undertakings in relation to health and safety issues and social affairs. "These assurances have been given by the Commission with the full authority of Commission President Jacques Delors, and reconfirmed this morning," he told sceptical Opposition MPs at question time. His comments came as the Prime Minister was facing his biggest test yet over what has been portrayed as a "humiliating climbdown" in the row over EU [European Union] voting rights. The "concessions" offered by the EC were pivotal to the Cabinet's decision yesterday to accept the compromise proposal -- a move which led one Tory backbencher, Tony Marlow (Northampton N), publicly to call for Mr Major to quit. In the Commons today, Nigel Spearing (Lab Newham S) said that when the Commission's undertakings were put to Mr Delors yesterday, his response had been "no, no, no!". He demanded: "How do you reconcile that statement with what we were told yesterday?" Mr Hurd said: "The Commission have confirmed that their legislative programme does not envisage the use of the health and safety articles of the treaty other than for measures directly and demonstrably relevant to health and safety at work. The Commission have also confirmed that proposals in the social chapter will not apply to the UK. For the purposes of the agreement, the UK should be considered as a third country." Foreign Affairs Select Committee chairman David Howell (C Guildford) said there had been "confused and mixed reports" about what the Commission had agreed to. He asked for confirmation that "undertakings have been given to relinquish back to national level, where they are far better handled, very important regulations and controls over important health, safety and social affairs legislation." Mr Hurd said: "The assurances given are the ones given by the Prime Minister yesterday, which I have detailed again today, and were given by the Commission with the full authority of Mr Delors and reconfirmed this morning." Tory Winston Churchill (Davyhulme) said that while welcoming enlargement of the EU, there was "an overwhelming majority of people in the UK and a significant element among our EU partners that does not wish to see us end up in a centralised federal Europe." He asked: "Will you undertake to fight all the way to ensure that when this matter comes up to be decided again in 1996, we have as many allies as possible to ensure that national rights and sovereignty are not ridden over roughshod." Mr Hurd said he was right and that there was a "growing number of people right across Europe who reject the idea of a centralised super state. There was a time when people felt that in order to be a good European you had to believe that executive power should be moved step by step to the centre. That is no longer the belief of sensible people -- for example Chancellor Kohl (of Germany)." To Labour jeers, he said this would be a principal issue in the forthcoming European elections, because it separated the Tories from Labour. Shadow foreign secretary Dr Jack Cunningham accused him of misrepresentation. There was no question of his party supporting a federal Europe, or abandoning the position of requiring unanimity on economic, foreign and defence policy issues, he said. Mr Hurd said Labour leader John Smith had signed up to the Euro Socialist manifesto and said that majority voting should be the norm. "It is not the norm now," he said. He told Tory James Paice (Cambridgeshire SE) that in 1996 "we will be looking forward to a community not of 16, but considerably larger and the kind of arguments which have been tossed about in this House in recent months and years will be well out of date by then. I cannot imagine that the EU will be able to accommodate more members than 16 without a very radical look at many aspects of its institutions and policies, such as the common agricultural policy."
