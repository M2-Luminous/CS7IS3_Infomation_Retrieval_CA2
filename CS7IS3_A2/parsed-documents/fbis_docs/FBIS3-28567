The officials said the decision was reached at the inaugural session of an administrative reform promotion group presided over by Hosokawa. They said the program, based on the goal of total removal of regulations, calls for abolishing controls in 866 areas and easing them in 725 categories. A total of 160 areas was added to the scope of deregulation announced by the government last December, they said. To implement the deregulation, about 60 existing laws have to be revised, and the government will submit a host of law-revising bills to the current session of the Diet for approval, they said. The officials said the people will be informed of the progress of deregulation through a white paper to be released by the government. The deregulation includes an easing of automobile inspection requirements and paves the way for small-scale brewers to produce local brand beer, the officials said.
