Through the World Trade Organization (WTO), GATT regulations have finally obtained -- GATT being a part of that organization -- the international force of law. The precise and binding process of settling multilateral disputes is of particular importance within the WTO framework. This means that threats and bilateral restrictions will no longer have a legal basis. Stihl said: "What that means in effect is that the law of the jungle will no longer apply in international trade policy." However, despite the Uruguay agreement and the establishment of the WTO, many questions remain open, such as the links between world trade on the one hand and aspects of environmental, social, and competitiveness policy on the other hand. According to the Stihl, the DIHT position is as follows: Environmental standards naturally have a direct impact on companies' competitiveness. Some Western countries view the differences compared to developing countries as a blatant distortion of competition. Thus, this has given rise to the demand for a harmonization of standards. Stihl: "I have doubts about whether we should force our environmental standards, which are restrictive on trade, on less developed trading partners. Just imagine a country in black Africa suddenly having to introduce a clean air or sewage charge just to be able to trade with us. That would be absurd." The question of minimum social standards has also recently been linked to trade policy in countries such as the United States, France, and southern EU [European Union] countries above all. However, there are also some people in the FRG, for example, in the unions and the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany], who are of the opinion that German social standards must be recommended to other countries. According to Stihl, these other countries owe their competitive advantages internationally to modest social standards and the favorable cost structures that those entail. This particularly applies to the former socialist states of East Europe: "To want to measure their social standards according to the criteria of our affluent society that provides for all needs amounts to cynicism." A further topic is the harmonization of national policy on competition. In one country, company mergers may constitute a violation of the law on cartels, whereas in another country, they may receive massive support for competitive reasons. This undoubtedly gives rise to serious distortions. However, Stihl cannot imagine a "world cartel office" or a general, internationally accepted law on competition. An adequate consensus on basic rules governing the free market economy and competition is lacking. "What does seem realistic to me is the introduction and raising of national minimum standards and their gradual harmonization." The problem of harmonizing export controls remains unsolved. The export of goods that can or could serve civilian or military uses is subject to severe restrictions in Germany. Other countries do not have such a mass of export controls. Thus, foreign competition enjoys immense advantages. The FRG is seeking harmonization within the framework of the EU. The results that negotiations have yielded to date are disappointing: "Everything points to a sham harmonization allowing everyone to maintain his national standards: we will maintain high ones and our neighbors will maintain low ones." A further threat to world trade is posed by the fact that the world economy is increasingly breaking up into regional trade zones. Since GATT came into force in 1948, over 80 preferential regional accords have been concluded, of which very few are in keeping with the actual provisions of the GATT treaty and scarcely one is in keeping with its spirit. It is estimated that by the year 2000, over half of world trade will be conducted within preferential regional zones. Stihl: "However, it must be ensured that if internal walls collapse, external walls are not raised." Stihl is very concerned about bilateralism, which is assuming increasingly aggressive forms in international economics. In bilateral "managed trade," two-page agreements that can scarcely be described as "voluntary" constitute a danger to the international trade order. The most-favored principle is circumvented and market shares are simply allocated and the free market is taken out of operation. Both the EU and the United States are to blame for that. Just a few weeks ago, the commission in Brussels yet again forced through an agreement with Japan on two-way automobile exports. This has protected automakers in selected EU member states from the rise in exports in the Japanese automobile industry. The United States, bolstered by the powerful protective instruments of national trade legislation, also practice this form of trade by government accord. It has concluded agreements with Japan on the semicondcutor industry and recently on mobile telephones. If bilateral agreements cannot be avoided, then their results must subsequently be given a multilateral form. It would, of course, be better if the United States and the EU were to come up with a common policy for Japan.
