In an interview here this morning with Hatsuhisa Takashima, chief commentator of the Japan Broadcasting Corporation [NHK], Jiang said the Japanese political situation had changed on several occasions. But, he said, the friendly cooperation between the two countries in every field was still growing in a stable way. He said Japanese parties in and outside the government, and Japan's people, share views on the expansion of bilateral good- neighborly ties. Jiang said the China-Japan friendship established on the basis of their common interests and a long history of culture and on the grass-roots level is full of strong vitality. A statesman, he said, should seriously do practical things to conform to the historical trend of the times. Jiang said the 20th century will come to an end. The existence of a Sino-Japanese non-governmental committee on the 21st century showed that the two peoples are willing to take the Sino-Japanese ties of mutual understanding, mutual trust, equality and cooperation and common prosperity into the 21st century, carrying on such friendship from generation to generation. "I have full confidence in the future development of such relationship," he said. When asked about China's stand on Japan's hope of becoming a permanent member of the Security Council of the United Nations, Jiang said: "We have noticed Japan's hope of being a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council so as to play a greater role in international affairs. "We appreciate and attach great importance to your desire," Jiang said. He said China agreed to appropriately enlarge the security council when the time was ripe, to reflect the changing international situation and the facts of increasing membership of the United Nations. At the same time, Jiang said: "We should not take the poor or the rich country as the only condition to consider this issue. "It is imperative to fully demonstrate the principles of the rational regional distribution and the coordination of consultation," he said. At present, the U.N. Security Council is in a stage of discussing reform, so it needs to fully listen to the opinions of member states. Takashima, a well-known Japanese commentator on international affairs, has interviewed many countries' leaders. Chinese President Jiang first met him in November, 1989.
