Simic based his optimism on "the political reality that relations between Belgrade and Zagreb will have the decisive influence on the outcome of the crisis which is rocking the lands of former Yugoslavia and the Balkans as a whole." He was speaking for the local radio in Kragujevac, central Serbia. "Therefore, I am not inclined to speak of a halt in the normalization process, but rather of a lull which I expect will be followed by progress in political dialogue which will reflect positively on the Bosnian civil war," said Simic, who chairs the Yugoslav Commission on Normalization of Relations between Yugoslavia and Croatia. Yugoslavia is ready to make the utmost contribution to improving bilateral relations in accordance with the 1993 Geneva Declaration, he added. Speaking about the breakdown in talks on normalizing economic relations between the republic of Serb Krajina (R.S.K.) and Croatia, Simic said this was giving rise to apprehensions, especially in view of extremely immoderate and war-mongering statements by Croatian officials. The R.S.K. was proclaimed in late 1991 by the local Serbs in their ancestral lands within the arbitrary Communist-era borders of Croatia in response to Croatia's violent secession form former Yugoslavia and trampling on their rights. The R.S.K. was placed under U.N. protection in early 1992, which has, however, failed to deter Croatia from launching four offensives on the territory, killing a thousand Serbs, mostly civilians, in the process. Simic said that a comprehensive settlement for the problems between the R.S.K. and Croatia was possible only with full respect for the political reality. The implementation of such a settlement must be phased -- unconditional peace should be established first, followed by the resumption of communications and economic and other ties, with political normalisation coming last, he explained. He dismissed as unfounded the insistence of Croatian officials that the key to the R.S.K.-Croatia problem lies in Belgrade, and explained that Yugoslavia had been taking pains to strengthen equality-based dialogue between the R.S.K. and Croatia. Simic denied allegations that he was to blame for the delay in a meeting of Yugoslav and Croatian intellectuals in Belgrade. Yugoslavia is a free, democratic country which guarantees full safety and freedom of speech to all visitors, he stressed.
