Australia is still deciding whether to provide the war ravaged Asian nation with arms. Senator Evans said Australia was still discussing Cambodia's request for military assistance with other potential donors -- the United States, France, Malaysia, and Indonesia. He said there was a general view among the donors that Cambodia's primary need was for a training of an effective military force. The foreign minister said a competent noncorrupt government in Cambodia would be able to deal with the Khmer Rouge insurgency.
