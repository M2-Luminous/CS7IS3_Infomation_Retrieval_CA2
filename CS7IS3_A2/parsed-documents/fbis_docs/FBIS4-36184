Our correspondent Moti Amir reports: [Begin Amir recording] The police minister held an urgent and secret meeting with al-Husayni because of the need to publicize Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres' letter to his Norwegian counterpart. Palestinian sources reported that Minister Shahal reiterated to al-Husayni that Israel has no intention of impeding the activities of the Palestinian institutions established in East Jerusalem after the Madrid conference and that there will be no change in the status quo on the issue. According to them, al-Husayni voiced his concern over statements by Israeli cabinet ministers regarding the activities in Orient House and once again demanded that the Israeli Government lift the closure on East Jerusalem, which cuts it off from the territories. Al-Husayni came to the meeting with Shahal after an emergency session at his office in Orient House with members of the Jerusalem Committee. His fellow committee members accused Israel of trying to determine unilaterally and already at this point the status and future of Jerusalem. [passage omitted] It should be pointed out that the Jerusalem Committee headed by al-Husayni set up a subcommittee to monitor Israel's actions against the Palestinian institutions in East Jerusalem. [Tel Aviv YEDI'OT AHARONOT in Hebrew on 7 June, in a page-9 report by Roni Shaqed, says that "yesterday, Arab leaders in Jerusalem decided to take action to strengthen the Palestinians' status in the city and raise the plight of the city within all negotiating frameworks without conceding its status as the Palestinian capital. It was also decided to continue to develop the Palestinian institutions in Jerusalem and not to heed Israel's orders to transfer these institutions to the autonomy area." [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0600 GMT on 7 June adds that Dr. Hanan 'Ashrawi told correspondent Moti Amir last night that "all the Palestinian autonomy institutions will be located in Gaza and Jericho during the interim period but could relocate elsewhere, including East Jerusalem, later."]
