Under this policy, the Kim government has embarked on various reform programs designed to develop the economy's growth potential with a small but efficient government since he took office last February. Kim's economic team, led by former Economic Planning Minister Yi Kyong-sik and Senior Presidential Secretary for Economic Affairs Pak Chae-yun, worked out an initial 100-day plan to stimulate the economy by removing controls on business activities. After the plan's completion in early July, the team drafted a new five-year blueprint stressing development of the economy's growth potential. Under the 100-day plan, the government took measures for increased corporate investment, small business restructuring, technological renovation, elimination of red tape and price stabilization of basic prices. Thanks to these measures, the economy began to pick up, with increasing corporate investment in equipment and plants. On Aug. 12, however, the economy felt shock waves from the surprise announcement of an emergency presidential order requiring the use of real names in all financial transactions, the Kim administration's "reform of reforms." The real-name financial transaction system was considered by many economists as an obstacle to corporate investment which might negate stimulus measures taken under the 100-day plan. However, the new system has proved successful in helping the economy move upward from the bottom, instead of pulling down corporate investment. Most of the money supplied to cushion the adverse effects of the real-name system on the money market has been siphoned out of circulation, and the stock market is emerging from its slump of the past several years. The economy as a whole is looking up on the strength of increasing exports. Under the real-name system, however, the practice of using borrowed names in financial transactions is still rampant, as seen in the financial fraud involving Chang Yong-cha. This necessitates strong measures against the use of borrowed names for the real-name system to achieve complete success. In late November, the second phase of the financial liberalization plan was put into effect to bring the financial market closer to a complete opening, a reform carrying as much weight as that of the real-name system. The Kim Yong-sam government also initiated fiscal policy reform for a salutary budget system, with stress placed on increased investment in infrastructure. For this purpose, oil taxes will become traffic taxes totaling 3.2 trillion won (four billion U.S. dollars) a year for investment in roads, railways, airports and seaports. The government has since come under attack for breaking its promise to introduce a sliding scale system linking domestic and international oil prices. As international oil prices are on the decrease, however, the government has announced a big rise in oil taxes to ensure that domestic oil prices are unrelated to the falling international prices and thus keep consumers from benefiting from the plunging world oil prices under the sliding scale system. Under the new fiscal policy, shortages of grain purchase funds will be made up for with government funds, not with funds raised by issuing grain bonds. Private industries will be encouraged to make social overhead investment in a bid to lessen the government's burden of investment in infrastructure. To this end, various incentives will be given to corporations investing in infrastructure. To achieve a small but efficient government, the Kim Yong-sam administration plans to restructure the 23 state-run enterprises and their 102 subsidiaries and eight state-run non-profit institutions through mergers and privatization. Under the plan, 68 state-run enterprises including citizens national bank and Korea exchange bank will be restructured through mergers and privatization by 1998, and the 7 trillion won to be raised through privatization will be poured into infrastructure expansion projects. The Kim Yong-sam government has conducted more economic reforms in the past one year than any previous government did in office, but its price and labor policies have failed. Initiating the new five-year economic plan last year, the government froze civil servants' wages and restrained personal service charges and manufactured goods' prices from rising to stabilize prices, but consumer prices nonetheless rose 5.8 percent last year and 1.3 percent year-on-year in January this year. Moreover, the labor policy supporting the "no work, partial pay" principle was blamed for the extreme labor-management conflict at Hyundai Group companies last year.
