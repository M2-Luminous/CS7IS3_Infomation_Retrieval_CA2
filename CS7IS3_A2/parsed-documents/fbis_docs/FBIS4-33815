Thus, the FG and US blocs expressed their repudiation of the approval of an article in the regulations indicating that the Nucleus of Basic Agreements must be voted on as a whole and not point by point, as repeatedly requested by the opposition. The provincial parties and Movement for Dignity and Independence blocs, which also are challenging the regulations proposed by the majority, decided to remain in the Constituent Assembly meeting and vote against the regulations.
