In this meeting, the participant mainly studied and implemented Order No. 129 of the State Council and Order No. 11 of the Ministry of Radio, Film and Television, and made arrangements for the management of ground facilities for reception of satellite television broadcasts. (Wen Xuande), member of the standing committee of the provincial party committee and director of the provincial propaganda department; Vice Governor (Zeng Guiyu); and others attended and addressed the meeting. The meeting pointed out: At present, more than 20 satellite television programs from outside the border are receivable in China, and 13 television programs are receivable in our province via satellite. With the increase of satellite television broadcast channels, there are more and more ground reception facilities. Owing to the fact that in the past, China lacked perfect laws and decrees for the management of these facilities, a number of units and individuals have watched, via such ground reception facilities, programs with vulgar or even reactionary contents which harmed the building of our socialist spiritual civilization. The State Council's regulations on the management of ground reception facilities for satellite television broadcasts have placed the management of ground reception facilities under the procedures of the legal system. This is beneficial to maintaining the principle of administering the country characterized by doing two types of work simultaneously while attaching equal importance to both. these also are important measures for exercising and safeguarding our country's territorial air sovereignty so as to ensure that our satellite television broadcasting develops in a healthy and orderly way.
