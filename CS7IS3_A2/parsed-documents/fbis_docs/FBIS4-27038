Sergio Balanzino, deputy secretary general of NATO, said this would contribute to the "peace and stability of Europe." Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev described the move as "turning to a new chapter of bilateral relations." In order to sign the "framework document," both NATO and Russia made compromises and concessions. NATO recognized Russia's power status and agreed to "implement an extensive partnership scheme commensurate with Russia's size, important position, and capabilities" and to have dialogue with Russia on issues of common interest. Meanwhile, Russia no longer stuck to the principle that NATO must sign a legally binding "protocol" which would recognize its power status. On the surface, both Russia and NATO achieved the main things they wanted: NATO succeeded in getting Russia to sign the "framework document of the Partnership for Peace," whereas Russia's power status was recognized by NATO. But in reality, their conflicts have not been settled yet. The basic difference between NATO and Russia is who should play the lead in the security affairs of Europe. Russian Defense Minister Grachev suggested that Russia and NATO should establish a "strategic partnership" to jointly undertake the responsibility of defending the security of Europe. However, Balanzino said, "NATO is the most powerful organization for European defense" and should "play a leading role" in defending the security of Europe." Balanzino also said that NATO would neither reach a "new Yalta" agreement with Russia nor draw a new "boundary of Europe" with Russia. It seems that such differences concerning the future pattern of European security will not be settled in the short term. A related issue over which both parties are at odds is the eastward expansion of NATO. In Russia's view, due to "historical and geopolitical reasons," Russia has major strategic and economic interests in Central and Eastern Europe, hence it objects to the absorption of Central and East European countries into NATO, saying that this is a practice of "isolating" Russia. Balanzino stressed that NATO's expansion "does not intend to isolate Russia" but "contributes to the stability of Europe," and that Russia neither has the "right to supervise" nor the "right to veto" NATO's eastward expansion. Another major difference is how to consult each other about security issues. Russia has asked for the establishment of a formal and automatic consultation system with NATO on European and global security issues. NATO agreed to hold dialogue with Russia on security issues, but it did not agree to establish an automatic consultation system. In addition, Russia also stressed that the CSCE is the supreme organ responsible for European security and NATO is a military organization subordinate to the CSCE. However, NATO insisted on objecting to this view, saying that NATO is the "pillar" of post-Cold War European security. As far as the issue of European security is concerned, NATO needs Russia and vice versa, and it is impossible to have real stability in Europe if either of the two parties is excluded. It was precisely because both parties are soberly aware of this point that they signed the framework document for the partnership of peace. However, both parties have divergent views on the question of how to cooperate with each other in Europe. Russia intends to "jointly administer" Europe with NATO, whereas NATO undoubtedly reckons itself as the "key player." In view of this, Russia and NATO must go through a relatively long process of bargaining or even conflict before their relations can be readjusted and the new pattern of European security finally takes shape.
