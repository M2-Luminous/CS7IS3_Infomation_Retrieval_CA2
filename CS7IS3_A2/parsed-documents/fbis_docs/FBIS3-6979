A copy of the finalized draft statement of the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECC) obtained by KYODO NEWS SERVICE on Wednesday said no region should be stopped from forming its own economic group as long as it is not protectionist. "PECC expresses concern about the tendencies of some member economies to condition trade and investment on achievement of political or ideological objectives," said the statement, to be officially released at the end of PECC's 10th assembly. Delegates said this is an implicit reference to the tendency of some Western powers, such as the United States, to pressure Asian nations into adopting Western standards of human rights and democracy by threatening trade sanctions. Called the "Kuala Lumpur Concord on Open Regionalism," the statement, which will be signed by representatives of each of the 21 member economies of the PECC, also stressed "the rights of all regions to organize in nondiscriminatory groupings, whether this be in the northern, southern, eastern or western Pacific." Delegates said this phrase apparently alludes to Western opposition toward the East Asian Economic Caucus (EAEC), which is being planned by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The PECC statement was pushed by Malaysia, which wants to use the opportunity as host country of the current meeting to rap the United States for trying to institutionalize Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) when it hosted the first APEC informal leaders' meeting in Seattle last November. The meeting was boycotted by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed, who strongly opposes the institutionalization of APEC. "The danger to a Pacific community, to the Pacific age, to our common future, can come from many directions," the statement warned. While "the end of the Cold War has clearly contributed to the making of a wider Pacific community...excessive domestic preoccupation can put a brake on the Pacific movement," it said. "A diversion of commitment to narrow regional interests and pursuits can be a serious detour from a path to which some might never return." It pledged to establish measures to study and monitor the development of protectionism and liberalization in the Pacific and elsewhere and "ensure that any subregional grouping contributes to open regionalism and to lowering the barriers to nonmember economies." PECC, whose members include ASEAN, the United States, Japan and some Latin American countries, is a nongovernmental organization that allows eminent thinkers, business leaders and government officials to meet every 18 months for spontaneous discussions on ways to promote economic cooperation in the region. Started in 1980, the PECC paved the way for the formation of the governmental APEC forum in 1989 and advises governments in the region on matters of economic cooperation.
