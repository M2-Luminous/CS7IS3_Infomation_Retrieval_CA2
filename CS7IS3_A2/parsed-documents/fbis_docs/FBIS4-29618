The negotiators held discussions on improvements in bidding procedures, which the Japanese Government compiled last spring, and on benchmarks (objective criteria) to gauge the openness of Japanese markets to foreign access. Apparently, "progress was made" (as stated by a Japanese negotiating official) in the talks. However, U.S. negotiators reiterated that they wanted to hold discussions regarding the procurement of telecommunications equipment by the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT), something which Japan has rejected. As a result, the negotiators were unable to narrow the gap between their opposing views.
