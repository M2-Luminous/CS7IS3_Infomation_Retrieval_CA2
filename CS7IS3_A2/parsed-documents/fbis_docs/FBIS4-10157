The minister announced that the Paraguayan Government has thus been virtually exempted from paying the loan, which, including overdue payments and arrears interest, reportedly stands at more than $45 million. During Stroessner's regime, the Italian Government approved a loan for Rossi Inc. which was allegedly guaranteed by its Paraguayan counterpart through fraudulent actions committed by former roving ambassador Gustavo Gramont Berres. Following the downfall of the dictatorship it was confirmed that the loan was not guaranteed by the Paraguayan State or by Congress. Scavone said: "In late March, the Italian Government admitted that the debt had not been legally granted to Paraguay." This situation virtually paves the way for the Paraguayan Government's plan to reschedule its foreign debt payments with the Paris Club. A Paraguayan delegation will go to the French capital tomorrow to negotiate this alternative. The French Treasury is coordinating the Paris Club's interests. The Paris Club comprises the seven industrial powers, including Italy. Paraguayan Central Bank official Luis Breuer is in Paris to begin the preliminary negotiations. The negotiations will reportedly be concluded in the presence of Wasmosy. Our debt with the Paris Club totals about $600 million. Our government's basic idea is to renegotiate $300 million so as to allocate more funds for poor segments by implementing specific projects. [passage omitted]
