It called on Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization to continue their multilateral peace talks in Washington. Foreign Secretary Roberto Romulo announced this amid reports that three Arab delegations were suspending participation in the talks following the Hebron massacre, where a Jewish setler opened fire inside the Ibrahim mosque and killed at least 43 Muslims and wounded many others. Romulo yesterday met with Palestinian Ambassador Musa Amer Odeh [as published], who asked the Philippine Government to formally condemn the massacre. Odeh sent a formal request to President Ramos through the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA). Odeh said Israel's "official terrorism" cannot continue if the United States and the United Nations or the whole international community would really want to stop it. He said countries may impose trade and economic sanctions on Israel through a UN resolution. "But any despicable act should be condemned in no uncertain terms by everybody," Romulo said, in response to reports that the UN was being asked to issue a resolution condemning the massacre. Romulo said the Philippines also welcomes announcement by Israel that it would take steps to disarm some 120,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. He said the DFA is in a "unique position" as it can coordinate with the Palestinian and Israeli ambassadors in Manila to encourage the continuation of peace talks among parties concerned. Odeh described the crime against Palestinians by the Jewish settler as "a time bomb which may explode any minute," and that this could endanger the ongoing peace initiatives between two peoples. He said that for years the settlers have been allowed by Israel to carry weapons to terrorize the Palestinians. Since 1967, this issue has been addressed several times by the UN Security Council in numerous resolutions which considered settlements as illegal and have to be dismantled. He told Romulo that is is about time that security needs of Palestinians be addressed by every country.
