He said the meetings with the presidents were excellent, and there was great communication. This visit, he pointed out, provided great possibilities for explaining the island's current situation, the measures which are being adopted, and the importance of the struggle against the U.S. blockade in our conditions. Lage added that he also met with other leaders, officials, and businessmen of those nations and he noticed there is a very positive atmosphere for strengthening the political, economic, and social relations. With regard to the most outstanding points of these meetings, the Cuban vice president said: [Begin Lage recording] I think the most outstanding aspects were respect for the Cuban Revolution, interest in our country's situation, the growing awareness of the need to fight the U.S. blockade, an understanding of the measures the country is adopting to adapt to the circumstances we are living under, and the possibilities these measures will provide for an economic integration with Latin America. I believe the results have stimulated the participation process with investments in the Cuban economy, strengthened economic and commercial relations, and opened (?possibilities) of exporting Cuban products to those countries in the region.
