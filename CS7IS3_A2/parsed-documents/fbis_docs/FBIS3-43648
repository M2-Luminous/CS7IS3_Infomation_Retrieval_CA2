The attack on the National Party was launched to disguise the dilemma currently facing the ANC. This dilemma concerns the fact that the ANC, campaigning for the withdrawal of the Internal Stability Unit of the South African Police [SAP], now suddenly criticizes the SAP for its absence during the shooting incident. The dilemma and embarrassment of the ANC is worsened because their leaders are not repudiated when they instigate their supporters to turn their rifles and bullets on the SAP. To criticize the National Party in order to disguise one's own shame is scandalous and laughable. The ANC's double-talk is already absolute proof that the electorate will not trust their vote and their future to a party characterized by a culture of double-talk.
