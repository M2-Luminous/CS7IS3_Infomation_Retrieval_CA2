His decision followed a motion of no-confidence in the Christian Democrat minister by the parliament in the Hague. Yesterday a majority of the lower house ordered the justice minister and Interior Minister Ed van Thijn to refrain from any further involvement in combatting organized crime. Parliament decided that the two ministers had made too many mistakes in that area. Both the motion of no-confidence and the minister's resignation are unusual, since the entire cabinet has been outgoing since the elections of 3 May. It's not known whether Minister van Thijn will also resign.
