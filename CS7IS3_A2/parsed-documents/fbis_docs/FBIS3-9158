The first meeting, with UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali, lasted 45 minutes and took place in an open and working atmosphere. President Tudjman thanked the United Nations for its efforts to achieve peace in southeast Europe. However, there can be no peace until the issue of UN-protected areas in Croatia is resolved. Croatia calls for effective control of its borders in accordance with resolution 769 of the UN Security Council. It insists on restoring Croatia's authority over the so-called pink zones. In line with resolution 820 of the UN Security Council, trade with the protected areas cannot be undertaken without exclusive permission from Croatian authorities. Three UN Security Council resolutions, 815, 847 and 871, which confirmed that the protected areas are integral parts of the Republic of Croatia, will continue to provide the foundations for resolving this issue. In Croatia's view, the resolution of the issue of the protected areas will release UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] military units to perform other tasks and will at the same time help to resolve the world organization's financial difficulties. Croatia called for implementation of the UN General Assembly's resolutions which provide for funds to finance the reconstruction of the destroyed parts of Croatia. Following his meeting with Butrus-Ghali, President Tudjman met the UN Security Council. President Tudjman stressed Croatia's readiness to cooperate with the UN Security Council and the UN secretary general in implementing the UNPROFOR mandate. The Washington agreements mark a watershed in the peace process, President Tudjman said, and went on to emphasize the major role played by the United States in reaching the agreements. This positive development should be seized and used to achieve peace in Croatia. Peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina will not last unless there is peace in Croatia. Serb extremists refuse to cooperate with Croatia and the authorities in Belgrade have not been behaving in line with the agreement to normalize relations between Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The positive experience from Bosnia-Herzegovina, where a resolute threat of force proved effective, should be used in the efforts to resolve the issue of the protected areas. Croatia has offered a high degree of autonomy to the Serb population in the areas where it was in the majority according to the 1991 census. In conclusion President Tudjman called on the UN Security Council and the world organization to help create conditions for the resettlement of several hundred thousand refugees.
