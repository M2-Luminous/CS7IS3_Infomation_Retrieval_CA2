The guest stated to the press that on this occasion the sides discussed issues referring to cooperation between Romania and Germany and he showed satisfaction with the development of economic relations in the past months. Waffenschmidt said that the German minority in Romania represents a connecting bridge between the two countries and he expressed thanks for every positive action taken for the ethnic Germans. However, he did voice some claims, such as exemption from German taxes for humanitarian aid from Germany, a better selection of television programs in the German language, and the implementation of the land law, and called for a public declaration to be issued that refers to discrimination after World War II in Romania and the new cooperation between Romania and Germany. He also stressed that Germany and Romania should cooperate in Europe and see to it that people on this continent live in peace and freedom, which is an essential requirement of a united Europe. In turn, President Ion Iliescu, answering a question on customs duties on humanitarian aid and on the implementation of the land law, said that these problems concern the Romanian state and its citizens and they will be examined with interest; however, they are part and parcel of a larger group of problems that our country is currently facing. Iliescu also said that he believes that the Deutsche Welle radio station presents the realities of Romania in a malicious and subjective manner and added that what disturbs us is not fair criticism but the distortion of reality, our correspondent Sorin Croitorescu informed us.
