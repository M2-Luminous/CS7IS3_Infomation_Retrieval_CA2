FR940111-1-00016 FR940111-1-00004 Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the proposed rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report summarizing each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this proposal will be filed in the Rules Docket. Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 93&hyph;ANE&hyph;43.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. Availability of NPRMs Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, New England Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 93&hyph;ANE&hyph;43, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA 01803&hyph;5299. Discussion The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, recently notified the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) that an unsafe condition may exist on Rolls-Royce, plc (R&hyph;R) Spey series turbofan engines. The CAA advises that they have received a report of a three-inch crack extending radially outward from the bore of a steel stage 7 high pressure compressor disk installed in an R&hyph;R Spey 506&hyph;14D engine. The crack had originated from a corrosion pit that apparently had been present at the disk's entry into service. Subsequent investigation revealed that engine failure due to disk burst was imminent. The CAA has determined that steel stage 1 and stage 2 high pressure turbine (HPT) and low pressure turbine (LPT) disks could also contain corrosion pitting that could have been present since original manufacture. Rolls-Royce, plc has informed the FAA that all turbine disks installed in Spey engine models type certificated in the United States are made of steel. This condition, if not corrected, could result in an HPT or LPT steel turbine disk burst due to cracking attributed to corrosion, which may result in an uncontained engine failure. Testing and further analysis indicate that to ensure that steel stage 1 and stage 2 HPT and LPT disks do not operate under prolonged exposure to levels of corrosion greater than the overhaul manual limits, at least one inspection is required after 40% of the disk cyclic life is expended in order for the disk to continue in service and to reliably attain full disk cyclic life. Rolls-Royce, plc has issued Service Bulletin No. Sp72&hyph;1044, dated September 1992, that specifies a one-time inspection of steel stage 1 and stage 2 HPT and LPT disks for cracks and corrosion pitting. The CAA classified this service bulletin as mandatory in order to assure the airworthiness of these R&hyph;R Spey series turbofan engines in the United Kingdom. This engine model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of ยง21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other R&hyph;R Spey series turbofan engines of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require a one-time inspection of steel stage 1 and stage 2 HPT and LPT disks for cracks and corrosion pitting once the disks have completed at least 40% of their published Group ``A'' cyclic life limits as specified in the applicable overhaul manual. These disks must be inspected in accordance with the applicable overhaul manual during the engine's next shop visit for either HPT or LPT overhaul after the effective date of this AD. Accomplishment of this inspection will allow stage 1 and stage 2 HPT and LPT disks to complete the remainder of their current published cyclic life limits. The FAA estimates that 173 engines installed on aircraft of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. The FAA estimates that it would take no additional work hours per engine to accomplish the proposed actions to the HPT's as the inspection is performed during scheduled overhauls. Approximately 80% of the engines will require an additional 25 work hours of extra access, inspection, and rebuild time to perform the required LPT inspection. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $189,750. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption `` ADDRESSES .''
