Speaking at a press conference where they discussed this normally quiet British territory's 7.8 percent increase in crime from 1992, Ratcliffe said, "There is evidence drugs are shipped here to go to north. Some do find the local market but it's impossible that all seized drugs are for the domestic market." Ratcliffe said the 4,330 pounds of marijuana and 52 pounds of cocaine seized by police in 1992 would represent a major consumption by all of the islands 27, 000 residents if it stayed in the Cayman Islands. He said he believed the amounts seized represent only 10 percent of all drugs reaching the Cayman Islands. And he added these figures were only what police seized, not what customs officers confiscated in 1993. 1993 customs seizures were not available. Cutts said Cayman "is like a giant warehouse" for the trans-shipment of drugs from Jamaica and Honduras. He said most of the marijuana and cocaine come in boats under cover of night. The Cayman Islands has no coast guard or navy and only one police patrol boat for approxiamately 300 miles of coast line. Ratcliffe said the 7.8-percent rise in crime was directly attributable to drug arrests and offences. "There is evidence there are far more drugs on Grand Cayman than have ever been here before," he said. Drug-related arrests jumped from 606 in 1992 to 894 in 1993, a rise of 47.5 percent. There were 3,298 crime reports in 1993 compared with 3058 in 1993, Ratcliffe said. The number of burglaries in the territory fell in 1993 from 765 to 680. The solution rate on those crimes was 36 percent, up 12 percent from 1992, said Ratcliffe. Drugs are an increasing problem in the Cayman Islands. A local high court judge recently said 80 percent of all inmates at the local prison were convicted on drug or drug related offences. Ratcliffe said he believed more than 80 percent of property crimes--burglary and theft--were done to obtain property or money to trade for drugs. For 1994, Cayman has already had its first ever armed robbery of a tourist. Two local men have been arrested in connection with the incident and are currently awaiting trial.
