Saro-Wiwa, a former national president of the Association of Nigerian Authors, was placed under house arrest last Sunday by soldiers in Port Harcourt, capital of the southern Rivers State, was released on Tuesday [4 January] night. He heads the Movement for the Survival of Ogoni People (MOSOP), a pressure group representing about 500,000 people. The troops surrounded his residence in the oil city and prevented him from going out and from receiving visitors, said the reports. Two other MOSOP officials who were arrested on December 28 and taken to unknown destinations have also regained their freedom, the reports said. Saro-Wiwa was detained for about two months last year by the regime of former president General Ibrahim Babangida for championing the cause of the ethnic Ogoni, who have in recent years been complaining about what they see as the neglect, injustice and degradation suffered by their community. The Ogoni area in Rivers State furnishes a large amount of crude oil, the mainstay of the Nigerian economy. The authorities arrested the three as officials called off the celebration of "Ogoni week," scheduled to start on December 28 with a planned address by Saro-Wiwa as a guest speaker, the reports said. The Campaign for Democracy (CD), an umbrella organisation representing some 40 human rights groups and pro-democracy organisations, condemned the arrests of the Ogoni activists.
