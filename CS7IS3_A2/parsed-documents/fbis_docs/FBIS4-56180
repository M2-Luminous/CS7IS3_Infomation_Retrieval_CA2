Jose Ramon Balaguer, a member of both the Council of State and the Communist Party Politburo, cited the Zambian statesman's efforts in the struggle to eradicate colonialism and the disappearance of the obsolete apartheid regime. Balaguer also spotlighted Zambia's active role in the Nonaligned Movement and the Frontline Nations. Chiluba expressed thanks for the award, saying this gesture strengthens the traditional fraternal ties between the two people, and he recalled Cuba's role in the liberation of several African countries. He also said the end of the Cold War will lead to the establishment of a new international economic order and the achievement of a world in which equal opportunities will be the basis for international relations. The Zambian president arrived here on 25 April for an official, friendly visit. It has been learned that he held official talks on 26 April with his Cuban counterpart to reach bilateral cooperation agreements in the sugar industry, agricultural, and health fields. Speaking to national television, Chiluba said the Angolan situation and the processes related to the disappearance of the Soviet Union were among the international topics addressed during the talks. The Zambian delegation was also honored today at the Biotechnology and Carlos J. Finlay Institutes, vanguard scientific institutions involved in the development of Cuban medicine. The visiting president and his delegation are carrying out a tight working agenda that includes touring industrial, agricultural, health, and sports centers. Sources from the two countries have said he will also meet with Zambian students who are studying in different Cuban provinces and African diplomats accredited here. Chiluba, 51, concluded political, governmental, economic, and English studies in London and New York and union and industrial relations studies in Germany.
