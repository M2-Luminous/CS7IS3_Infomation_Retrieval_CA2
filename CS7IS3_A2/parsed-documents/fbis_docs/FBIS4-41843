Agrarian members of parliament described the situation in the AIC as catastrophic and requiring urgent economic measures. For instance, farm produce this year will decline 45-50 percent against the average level of 1986-1990. Gross grain production is estimated at no more than 80 million tonnes (as compared with 99 million in 1993 and 106.8 million in 1992). In livestock farming the number of cows is down to the level of 1970, and sheep, at the 1952 level. The statement dwells at length on the falling production in farm machine turn-out, the curtailed social programs in rural areas and other negative effects of reforms in the AIC. The committee demands budgetary allocations for the agrarian sector in 1994 in keeping with the government's resolution of February 23, 1994 as well as protectionist measures. A member of the committee's technical staff told Interfax on the condition of anonymity that none of the committee's leaders had been invited to the meetings of agrarians with President Yeltsin on June 27.
