In statements for PRENSA LATINA, Alarcon pointed out that the final resolution will serve as a foundation for State Council legislation. There is a consensus among the 551 assembly members, he said, regarding the contents of that document, which will outline the general guidelines and policy to be followed with regard to the measures that are undertaken. The consultation process initiated four months ago with the participation of approximately 3 million workers, students, and peasants will not end, he said, adding that at the end of this month rank-and-file meetings will be initiated in the neighborhoods during which regional delegates will reflect on these complex economic issues with the people. Thus, the measures adopted and those about to be executed will continue to be debated in what Alarcon characterized as Cuban society's uninterrupted process of parliamentarism. Alarcon added that the labor unions will soon initiate a series of assemblies at all the work centers, thereby reestablishing the examination of economic efficiency, increased production, and profitability. He said the Assembly members are more prepared now than they were in December, when the Assembly initiated the debate on financial reorganization. I, especially, participated in over 50 meetings throughout the country and all the National Assembly members accompanied me and participated in the national debate, he said. Alarcon described as very positive the results of the first day of sessions, at which over 30 deputies spoke outlining the paths that should be followed and the measures that should be implemented to resolve such a complex problem as Cuba's current financial imbalance. According to figures provided by Jose Luis Rodriquez, minister of finance and prices, at present, there is a working capital surplus estimated at approximately 11.3 billion pesos (equivalent to dollars at the government exchange rate). Cuba is also burdened with a budget deficit of approximately 4.2 billion pesos, which we are trying to counteract by eliminating subsidies because of the losses suffered by unprofitable businesses, the selective increase of prices and rates, and a new tax system.
