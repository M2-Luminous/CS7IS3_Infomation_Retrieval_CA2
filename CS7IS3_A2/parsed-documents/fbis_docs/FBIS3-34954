He said he hoped such an agreement would be signed in the next 24 hours. Following two rounds of talks in Taba today, 'Asfur said the differences between the two delegations concern numbers more than principles. They are differences about the size of the police force and the type of weapons. He stressed that these differences are not substantial. He added: We will continue to discuss these issues and we hope we will reach agreement in the next 24 hours. 'Asfur said that a timetable for the gradual release of Palestinian detainees is expected to be discussed this evening. General Amnon Shahaq, head of the Israeli delegation, said the talks have made progress. He hinted that an agreement might be signed by the end of the week and added: I believe we can give details in this regard by the end of the week. [passage omitted] 'Asfur said the arming of the Palestinian police force is still under discussion. He added that the Israeli side has agreed in principle for the Palestinian police to use armored cars, noting that the number of these vehicles and armored personnel carriers is currently being discussed with the Israeli delegation. He pointed out that the current controversy over the size of the Palestinian police force is whether the number should be 10,000 or 6,000. He said there is a possibility of resolving this issue, which is primarily technical. He said that the issue of joint patrols will be discussed within the Joint Coordination and Cooperation Committee as of tomorrow morning, Wednesday. He added that the Palestinian delegation requested the institution of coastal guard patrols, noting that the Israeli side does not object to this in principle. He added that the dispute is over the number of the patrol members and stressed the need for Palestinian police on the Mediterranean coast. 'Asfur, deputy head of the Palestinian side of the Palestinian-Israeli Security Committee, said the Palestinian detainees in the Golan and in Israeli prisons will be discussed this evening. He expressed his hope that all issues concerning the release of Palestinian detainees according to a clear timetable will be addressed. He added: We already have an Israeli stand [mawqif] on the release of the detainees. He affirmed the need to reach agreement on a timetable for the release of all detainees by July, in time for the Palestinian council elections due that month. He pointed out that the Palestinian side had previously proposed a complete timetable for the detainees' release in groups, on condition that all the detainees, who number over 9,000, be freed without exception. He stressed the need to free all the detainees, including those arrested after the signing of the Palestinian-Israeli accord on 13 September. It is noteworthy that the Palestinian side demands that there be 9,000 in the Palestinian police force. It also demands that this force be divided up after civilian authority is transferred to the Palestinians into a police unit belonging to the Palestinian Public Security Department--a unit that will provide security for personnel and property--plus a national security force to be stationed on the borders with Israel, and a Palestinian civil defense unit that will include first aid, fire department, and rescue squads.
