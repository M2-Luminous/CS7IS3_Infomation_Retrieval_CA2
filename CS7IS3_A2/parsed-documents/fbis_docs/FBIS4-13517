The argument here over whether to establish relations with you now has become legitimate. The moment there is peace, the Gulf states will have deeper and more serious relations with Israel than your neighbors, because we do not harbor any residual hatred for Israel." The next session of the water talks will apparently be held in Kuwait in October. This will be the first time Kuwait hosts an official Israeli delegation. The fifth round of the multilateral water talks ended yesterday. All the delegations will conduct a tour of Oman today and then return to their respective capitals. In a meeting Beilin and senior Omani officials held to sum up the Israeli visit, the hosts admitted that they had greatly feared hosting the Israeli delegation and disclosed that various Arab elements had pressured them to change their mind about hosting the water talks. The Omani officials said that they had feared that Israel would use the visit for propaganda purposes and to infiltrate the Arab world. In the beginning they attempted unsuccessfully to lower the profile of the visit. Now, on the eve of the country-wide tour, they feel much better and their attitude toward Israel has changed. Oman has not fallen in love with Israel, but its government now realizes that Israelis do not have horns, and both countries have joint interests and can cooperate. The local press has also joined in the publicity. Omani citizens know that an Israeli delegation is visiting their country. The question of whether or not this visit is followed up depends to a great deal on the continuation of the peace process. In principle, Oman harbors no hatred toward Israel, like the Palestinians for example, although Israel is still considered an enemy. Dr. Beilin pointed out that in all his meetings, he was constantly told that Syria is the key to peace in the Middle East and that the Gulf states would immediately establish relations with Israel once its problems with Syria were resolved. The Omanis also tentatively explored whether Israel could further their interests in the White House and on Washington's Capitol Hill. Officials in Muscat are concerned about a possible erosion in their economic ties with the West due to U.S. complaints about human rights violations. Beilin noted that Israeli desalination experts would arrive in Muscat and that Omani experts would later conduct a reciprocal visit. What is on the agenda is long-term cooperation. Oman also seeks Israel's help in training professional workers to replace the foreign workers in Oman: the Indian managers and the blue-collar Thai workers. Oman expects Israel to help it with marketing its products. Today, 95 percent of its exports are shipped through Dubai marketing chains. This dependency constitutes a heavy burden on Muscat. In the view of Omani officials, Israel, with its proven marketing capabilities and experience, can help Oman set up independent marketing chains. Oman hopes that Israel will assist in developing tourism, a field which has lain dormant so far despite its great potential. Jerusalem will also send medical and agricultural experts to Oman and help convert local industry to several hi-tech branches. [passage omitted]
