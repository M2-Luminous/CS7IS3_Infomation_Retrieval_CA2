On March 9, the 50th session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights decided, by a vote of 20 to 16, not to take action on the draft resolution tabled by some Western countries on the so-called "situation of human rights in China", thus frustrating the attempt to interfere in China's internal affairs under the pretext of human rights issues. "This is not only a victory for China, but more important, it is a victory of the united struggle of the forces of justice in the international community," the spokesman said. In recent years, the spokesman noted, China has made remarkable achievements in its reform and opening drive. A situation unprecedented in its history has prevailed throughout the country, featuring political stability, economic growth and a life of peace and contentment. However, he said, in total disregard of these facts, a few Western countries once again tabled an anti-China draft resolution at the U.N. Commission on Human Rights. The spokesman pointed out: "This only shows that they are not happy with the achievements the Chinese people have made. In fact, by feigning concern about the human rights situation in China, they harbor the true intention to exert political pressure on China and interfere in its internal affairs." This act of politicizing the human rights issues and practice of hegemony undoubtedly met with the opposition of the majority members of the U.N. commission, he added. The spokesman noted that the anti-China draft resolutions tabled successively in 1990, 1992 and 1993 by some Western countries all failed to be put to vote. This year, they suffered yet another defeat. He stated: "A just cause enjoys abundant support while an unjust cause finds little support. The attempt by a small number of countries to manipulate U.N. activities in the field of human rights by way of power politics is unpopular and bond to fail." "Gone are the days when China was subjected to willful bullying, humiliation and outside interference. And no one can stop the Chinese people from marching victoriously along the correct path of their own choosing," he stressed. He expressed the admiration and thanks of the Chinese Government to all countries that have upheld justice and supported China and its appreciation for those that withheld their support for the anti-China draft resolution. "The Chinese Government wishes to reiterate its willingness to work with the international community on the basis of equality and mutual respect and under the guidance of the principles of the U.N. Charter in a common effort to promote and protect human rights," the spokesman concluded.
