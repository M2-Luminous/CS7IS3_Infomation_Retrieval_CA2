A Sunday newspaper yesterday revealed that kwaZulu had paid 33 million rands for the Hawker 800 jet. [Begin Buthelezi recording] A plane like this, according to the Department of Finance, is therefore cost-effective in the sense that it is an asset which could be sold by the government at a profit at any time. So I mean all the song that is made about it, the hullabaloo about it, is amusing because it seems to me that they want to seek anything that can be used negatively against the kwaZulu government in particular.
