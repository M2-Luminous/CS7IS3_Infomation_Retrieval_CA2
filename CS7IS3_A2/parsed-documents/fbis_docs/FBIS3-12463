These measures should include the following: 1. The results of the investigation into the al-Sayfi [Phalangist Party headquarters] bombing must be made public and if evidence and suspects are available, they must be tried by a military tribunal and executed on the spot. 2. The same measures must be applied without hesitation against the recently apprehended pro-Israeli gangs. According to reports, the Army intelligence service recently uncovered and arrested such groups. 3. A request must be submitted to the French Government to hand over the individuals suspected of attempting to assassinate President Ilyas al-Hirawi. According to our information, these individuals possess much information and command dangerous groups hostile to the country's security. 4. The country's various intelligence services must be purged of all individuals guilty of corruption, favoritism, illegal means of amassing wealth, and negligence. Such people must dismissed. All intelligence services must be placed under one unified command so that it will be possible to remedy the current chaos in these services, as illustrated by the fact that escort services for VIP's and their motorcades are more important than the citizens' security. 5. A media law must be passed, unhindered by democratic formalities, with the aim of stopping some television and radio stations from broadcasting incitements. These media must be deterred and closed down. As for the weepy statements full of political theorizing aimed at linking the church massacre with the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, they are neither useful nor convincing. While it is true that Israel is the first beneficiary of such incidents, it also has well-known agents in the country. This morbid thing must be excised from the national body before the sickness spreads and remedy becomes impossible. Israel, in the final reckoning, does not need to cover up its crime. Just listen to the still-inciteful statements by the Zionist entity's leaders. For example, the so-called man of peace Shim'on Peres refuses to disarm the settlers, wagers on Rabin's downfall, and represents the Zionist army's and Zionist entity's hardline wing. The measures Israel has adopted are limited to the temporary arrest of five settlers. The Hebron massacre is the start of a major series of crimes aimed at expelling the Palestinians from the West Bank and bringing in more Jews from the former Soviet Union and other countries. Recently they informed us that one million Indian Jews might be brought to Palestine. Hence, the peace negotiations, stillborn to begin with, were buried by the Hebron crime. We fear that some of the advocates of partition, federalism, so-called civilized pluralism, and extensive decentralization in Lebanon will return to their schemes, bombing churches today and mosques or other places of worship tomorrow with the help of the Israelis.
