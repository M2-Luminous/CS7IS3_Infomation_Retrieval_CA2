Writer Laments State of Muslims During 'Id al-Adha PUBLISHERS OF BOOK CRITICIZING ISLAM CONDEMNED Salah 'Abd-al-Mu'ti writes in a 300-word report on page 1 about "a new crime committed by the General Book Committee," which has published a book entitled "Toward the Real Islam--Studies in the Koran Bring to Light the True Islam" by Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-'Arusi, a professor at an unspecified university. The book attacks some Islamic rites and rituals and their timing. The writer also makes some "demands" such as "unifying prayer times, the world over, for all Muslims, throughout the year." The writer claims his motive for writing the book was that "it became evident that we are remote from Islam while clinging to its facade and have forgotten its essence." The report maintains that the Awqaf Ministry will prepare a book to counter these arguments. SHOP SIGNS MUST BE IN ARABIC A 100-word report by Mustafa 'Alam-al-Din on page 2 says that Cairo Governor 'Umar 'Abd-al-Akhar has demanded strict measures against shop-owners who use foreign languages in their shop signs. He threatened to withdraw the licenses of those who violate this law. "The language of the Koran, the Arabic language which is this country's national language, should be respected," the report says. GRAND IMAM TO INAUGURATE ROUND OF LECTURES FOR IMAMS On page 2 'AQIDATI carries another unattributed 100-word report that on 17 May Grand Imam of al-Azhar Jad-al-Haq 'Ali Jad-al-Haq will inaugurate "the 25th round for imams and preachers of the Islamic world organized by the General Secretariat of the al-Azhar Higher Council for the Call." The report lists the countries participating as well as the speakers and lecturers. REASONS FOR, OPTIONS OF REPEATED PILGRIMAGE VIEWED Page 3 of 'AQIDATI features an opinion survey by Musa Hal and Mahmud 'Ushub polling ordinary citizens, imams, and men of religion on the issue of the fairness of performing the pilgrimage more than once in a lifetime. Islamic shari'ah stipulates that pilgrimage once in a lifetime is enough, but many citizens travel every year. They have turned pilgrimage into what travel agents are calling "touristic pilgrimages." The issue here is that the Islamic Conference Organization has set quotas on the number of pilgrims that various countries can send, giving well-to-do pilgrims an edge over the poor. Among other men of religion, the survey poses this question to the mufti of Egypt, Dr. Muhammad Sayyid Tantawi, who maintains that "those capable of performing the pilgrimage every year should give an opportunity to those who have never done so in their life." He believes there is nothing in the shari'ah that can prevent the issuance of a law on this matter. Other men of religion agree with the mufti's opinion and claim that instead of performing the pilgrimage a second time, people should donate food and money to the poor. To conclude, the survey interviews a psychiatrist who analyzes the reasons why people perform the pilgrimage over and over again, including such things as habit, religious overstatement, and tourism. WRITER ASSAILS MUFTI OVER COURT CASE In his 400-word column on page 6 entitled "With All Frankness," Basyuni al-Halawani maintains that the "Court ruling the mufti of the republic, Dr. Muhammad Sayyid Tantawi, secured to imprison Dr. Sha'ban Isma'il, Dr. 'Ali al-Salus, and their colleague 'Ali Faruq, is not a victory for the mufti in this case against those who do not agree with his opinion and oppose some of his fatwas and teachings. The real arena for settling such a matter is the arena of the intellect, opinion, and counteropinion, not in court where only the guilty and deviant normally go." Al-Halawani stresses that he does not defend one side against the other, but says he is sad at the state of affairs our wise men have reached. He reminds the mufti that "Islam set the ideal principles and bases for dialogue and allowed each individual to express his opinion and ideas in a way that does not abuse others." The writer concludes that some ulema tend to forget these basic Islamic principles, thus losing the people's confidence in them. PREACHER RECOUNTS INCIDENT OF CHALLENGING EXTREMISTS A 200-word unattributed report on page 7 cites a sermon by a preacher in which he tells a story that happened to him 20 years ago when he challenged the ideology of the Repudiation and Renunciation Group as a student in his village in al-Sharqiyah. Three bearded men with a great deal of money settled in his village, bought many houses and shops, and claimed that true Muslims do not need to work since God provides for all their needs. At first they had a great following, but he managed to expose them by watching them for 24 hours. He found out that truckloads of various supplies were being delivered to them at 0300 in the morning. He informed the residents of the village who kicked them out of their village. SATELLITE DISHES: MORAL OR IMMORAL? In a 3,000-word report on page 8 prepared by Musa Hal, questions from citizens on various religious issues are answered. One query comes from a young girl in al-Daqahliyah Governorate on whether the large-scale use of satellite dishes is moral or not. This is answered by Shaykh 'Abd-al-'Athim al-Humayli, member of al-Azhar's Fatwa Committee, who is flattered by the young lady's concern about such a matter. He ascertains that the same law that applies to other media applies to the dish. In other words, the use of the dish in itself is not bad, but if the programs it brings to the viewer are immoral, "then the Muslim state is reponsible for putting an end to this." He says: "The West has directed these dishes at us; they are dishes for hunger and starvation. There is evil in them. This goes against our religion because religion wants mankind to improve themselves and elevate their feelings and conscientiousness." ISLAMIC IFTA' COUNCIL: IMAMS FOR OR AGAINST? Jamal Salim's 2,000-word report on page 10 feels the pulse of various imams and muftis on the establishment of a higher council for ifta' [legal jurisdiction] in the Islamic world. He cites various religious leaders from Macedonia, Bosnia, Belgrade, Singapore, and elsewhere, all of whom support the establishment of such a council. "Dr. Muhammad Sayyid Tantawi, the mufti of Egypt, also supports the establishment of such a council for muftis. He said he will work with all his might to establish it" the writer maintains. Al-Azhar University President Dr. 'Abd-al-Fattah al-Shaykh has a different opinion on the matter, though. He believes that "al-Azhar's Islamic Research Center could serve instead of such a council, if everyone adheres to its fatwas." THE KORAN AT THE WHITE HOUSE A 100-word report on page 20 cites a report in the French magazine JEUNE AFRIQUE that President Bill Clinton discovered in September that there is no copy of the Koran in the White House. He was preparing a speech to be delivered at the signing ceremony of the peace agreement between the Palestinians and the Israelis. One of his aides drew his attention to the fact that he had used quotes from the Bible and the Torah, but not the Koran. The magazine claims "Clinton used a copy of the Koran from one of the libraries in Washington." WRITER CONDEMNS YEMENI WAR In a 200-word column on page 20, 'Adil Dayf wonders in whose interest the internecine fighting in Yemen is taking place. He stresses that the sole beneficiaries are "the foreigners, of course." The Yemeni people are the losers, as is the Islamic world and nation. Dayf says: "We call on the sons of the nation to set aside their marginal differences and concentrate their efforts on catching up with progress while adhering to their religion, which condemns all forms of violence and destruction, and always calls for forgiveness." SAUDI PREACHER INTERVIEWED On page 20 'AQIDATI carries an interview by Mustafa Yasin and Tariq 'Abdallah with Dr. Mana' Khalil al-Qattan, a Saudi Islamic preacher, in which he discusses attacks by Westerners and the West's hostility, which are the two most dangerous things for Islam now. He also stresses that all Islamic resources should be unified to serve contemporary matters. COPTS CONGRATULATE MUSLIMS ON 'ID AL-ADHA A 400-word article on page 23 by Mamduh Bishri carries congratulations to the Muslims on 'Id al-Adha from the Copts of Egypt. The column notes that both religions stress love for our fellow man. WRITER LAMENTS STATE OF MUSLIMS DURING 'ID AL-'ADHA In his last-page 500-word column entitled "A Call to Common Sense", al-Sayyid 'Abd-al-Ra'uf wishes he could have congratulated the Muslim world on 'Id al-Adha with an open heart and great hope for the future. He says he hoped the 'Id would have come after the Muslims had succeeded in saving their brothers in Bosnia, started developing Somalia, helped the Muslim minorities around the world, and had a greater say in the new world order. "In fact, we were surprised that the government crisis in `united' Yemen turned into a civil war", he laments.
