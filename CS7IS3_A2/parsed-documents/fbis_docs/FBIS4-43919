However, it is already clear that, in view of the two potential dates for entering the third stage of the Economic and Monetary Union [EMU], the later date of 1999 seems more realistic, Bundesbank Vice President Johann Wilhelm Gaddum said at the Konrad Adenauer Foundation in New York. The monetary side of the Maastricht Treaty is an absolutely solid basis for a lasting and stability-oriented monetary policy in a monetary union. If one takes into account that a European central bank can influence exchange rate policy far more than any central bank at the moment, some public expressions of dissatisfaction with the Maastricht Treaty are more difficult to understand. At the moment there is no reason to doubt that the antiinflation consensus of the member states will be consolidated. Gaddum stressed that the economic advantages of monetary union are not exhausted with eliminating exchange rate risks and avoiding transaction costs. Of far greater importance is the promotion of economic cooperation, which emanates from the contents of the Maastricht Treaty and the anticipation of its introduction. In making an economic evaluation of the European integration project, one must not overlook that the only alternative, namely staying at the current status quo, would certainly not be without problems and tension. The globalization and professionalization of the money and capital markets will continue to pose considerable problems and demands for the central banks. A purely national orientation cannot necessarily be seen as a viable strategy for the future, Gaddum said.
