We insist on the steadiness of the march to peace and salvation. The attempts to set us on a backward course will not succeed. The catastrophe which occurred inside the Sayyidat al-Najat Church in the Kasrawan area this morning is a naked crime that will not succeed in diverting the attention of world public opinion. One crime does not offset another crime. We address the whole world and say that the all Lebanese rally around their state and the march to peace. They are unanimous in refusing to return to the imposed and tendentious war. We condemn this concocted incident. We have asked the security authorities and all concerned security, judiciary, and military officials to do their utmost to reveal the circumstances of the abominable incident and to announce the results of the investigations to the Lebanese people. We call for the meting out of the harshest punishment to the instigators, culprits, and accomplices and for severing every hand which tries to jeopardize security and the march of peace. Several attempts have surfaced in the past weeks to deflect our march from its course and to induce friction among our citizens. However, the state is standing firmly and steadily. It has proved its ability to frustrate these attempts and obstruct their aims. The Lebanese people's cohesion and their rallying around their state are stronger than all these attempts. May God have mercy on the innocent victims and may he heal the injured. What happened is yet another reason for all of us--officials and citizens--to cooperate to prevent the tendentious aggressors from toying with the unity of this homeland and its foundations. Long live Lebanese unity. Long live Lebanon.
