The former parliament "White House" was allocated for government use following the bloody October event last year. Yeltsin's order was announced by the presidential press service department in the wake of much criticism of the construction plan which was also one of the reasons why Yegor Gaydar, one of the government's senior officials, resigned on January 16.
