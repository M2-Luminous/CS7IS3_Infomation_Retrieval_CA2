"That is how things go in the army and in the police. A new boss, a new team," he says. Since he retired in January 1994, he has been working for the Institute of Economy in Belgrade as a scientific adviser for military and strategic studies and research. He had for years taught military strategy at the War School. He came to the Institute from the Strategy Division of the Federal Defense Ministry, where he was division head. At the beginning of 1993, he was a member of Cosic's team at the Geneva negotiations. "I would like this interview to reflect my attitude that this is an historic chance for Serbia. What we did not succeed in achieving in 1918, we can achieve now. The price may be higher, but it should be paid. I visited Krajina, I visited every part of the front, I went to Bosnia, I spoke with people, and I really convinced myself that this is a historic struggle for the survival of the Serbian nation. If this chance is missed, we shall never have it again." We then went back to the analysis of the present situation: "If we were to look just at Gorazde, it could not be said that it is a town of big strategic importance. At the moment, however, there are approximately 70,000 people there, maybe more. From the point of view of the constitution of a Muslim state in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is being supported by a new Turkish expansion toward the Balkans, toward "the belly of Europe," Gorazde is of exceptional importance. It is one of the most important points because it is a natural connection between Sandzak and Bosnia. [Relic] You are speaking about its importance for the Muslims. What about the Serbs? [Radinovic] It is important for us that the Muslims do not achieve their goal -- that is, that we cut the so-called green transversal. What is important for us is that the Yugoslav border toward the former Bosnia-Herzegovina be as safe as possible, and it will be safer if this part is in Serbian hands. [Reljic] The Western press wrote that Gorazde, an island in the Serbian territory, would have fallen anyway, so they found it senseless to insist on a military solution. [Radinovic] I can tell you that I never thought the original Serbian idea was to occupy Gorazde. On the contrary: The Serbs in the republic of Srpska of Bosnia-Herzegovina accepted that Gorazde should remain a UN protected area. The Serbs were, however, provoked by the Muslim offensive, supported by the international community and the announced military assistance, first of all by the United States. [Reljic] Do the United States and Europe have a clear strategy for Bosnia or are they adapting themselves to changes? [Radinovic] The rest of Yugoslavia was of strategic interest for neither the United States nor Europe. As a powerful state in the Balkans, Yugoslavia prevented the infiltration of new centers of power -- Germany, on the one hand, and Turkey, on the other. It was only a matter of time when it would come to a breakup of Yugoslavia. It can be said that they mostly did not have a clearly defined military and political strategy. I would say that their wish was to reshape the territory. The present crisis shows that Europe is not capable of controlling a situation on its territory. [Reljic] Are you speaking about U.S. strategy? [Radinovic] Yes. [Reljic] What can the unfolding of events tell us about the U.S. strategy? There is the impression that NATO -- where the United States is the decisionmaker -- is behaving like the Yugoslav People's Army during the breakup of Yugoslavia. Politicians are in two minds and the army makes a funny impression. [Radinovic] First of all, NATO wants to obtain a new legitimacy, which can be achieved if there are crises that cannot be solved without its participation. In the former Yugoslavia, however, NATO seems to be losing what it has gained so far, because it took part of one side in a civil war. This could be damaging not only for NATO but also for the United Nations. They have underestimated the civil war in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina. [Reljic] Has their strategic interest been seriously affected? [Radinovic] I would not say that this will affect their strategic interest, but they will have to adapt their behavior to the situation. First of all, they have decided to be the only judge, forgetting that Russia also has its legitimate right to require that the Yugoslav crisis be solved with its participation. There are historical, cultural, and other connections between Serbia and Russia, so even Russia is obliged to protect Serbian interests, at least to the extent to which the West and Islamic countries have been protecting the Croats and the Muslims. Apart from that, if Russia allows the Balkan crisis to be solved without its participation, it will give up its historic idea that Russia is and should be a big power, which started with Petar the Great and has lasted until the present day. [Reljic] Apart from this emotional aspect and the opposition to the United States, does Russia have a concrete interest here? [Radinovic] A minimum interest, which is the maximum needed in the present situation. I think that Russian interests are legitimate. [Reljic] Why does it seem now that Karadzic is insisting on the plan made by the European Union? Is this only tactics or is this map also what the Serbs want? [Radinovic] There are both elements in his behavior. I think it is politically wise and strategically favorable to find "cracks" in the clash of interests of superpowers. The European Union is trying to establish its strategic identity in Yugoslavia, but this seems to be a very difficult task. It is not homogeneous itself. It is dominated by Germany. Its strategic interest is to get access to the Adriatic and put Central Europe under control, which it seems to have achieved by the secession of Croatia and Slovenia, but I think this is only one of the German illusions. I wrote for a German newspaper that the present Croatia is rather a burden for Germany than a partner that could contribute to the materialization of German interests. It would be more productive for Germany if it tried to articulate its interests in the Balkans by reestablishing its relations with Serbia as the most powerful factor in the Balkans and a link with Asia. [Reljic] This sounds logical, but why has no one entered an alliance with Serbia yet? [Radinovic] Out of political prejudices, I think. Serbia's politics have been declared imperial because Serbia allegedly wants to create a Greater Serbia. Even if all the Serbian countries were united, this would not be a large state that could inspire fear in someone. There is no imperial behavior in the Serbian tradition. The achievement of the Serbian national interest is even inhibited by the fact that there is no imperial consciousness in Serbs. I think the European Union has realized this now and that Serbia will be respected in future. [Reljic] At the beginning of 1993, you worked on the elaboration of the Geneva maps. What has changed in Bosnia since that time? [Radinovic] These were great moments for the Yugoslav delegation and the delegation of the republic of Srpska, who tried to achieve national and political independence for the Serbian nation in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina. All international powers, on the other hand, tried to prevent this by splitting the ethnic Serbian territory into unconnected enclaves. There were very many controversial points: the right Una River bank, Posavina, northeast Herzegovina, Podrinje, Kupres, the Dubrovnik hinterland.... Unfortunately, these areas are still stumbling blocks in the partition issue. As far as intentions are concerned, very little has changed, but as far as facts are concerned, very much has changed. First of all, all these games and calculations have been eliminated because of the Serbian victory. The keys are: the military success, a consistent policy made by the republic of Srpska, and a fervent support from Serbia. [Reljic] Does this mean the situation is more favorable now than at the beginning of 1993? [Radinovic] Yes, I think it is. [Reljic] How big is the danger that everything is returned to a more difficult position by an inconsiderate action? [Radinovic] There is the risk of returning everything to the beginning. International powers are trying everything but, in the end, they will have to accept the real situation -- first of all, because this situation shows what has always belonged to the ethnic Serbian territory. [Reljic] This can be criticized since some of the towns were not predominantly Serbian before the war, such as Brcko, Zvornik.... [Radinovic] One thing has to be clear. A state cannot exist if certain conditions are not met, and one of them is the territorial connection between areas populated by a Serbian majority. It is certain that injustice will be done to some areas in the final partition, but this can be balanced by an exchange of territories. [Reljic] How would you assess the strategic stability of newly established states in the former Yugoslavia: Croatia, the republic of Srpska, the republic of Serbian Krajina, and the still undefined Muslim territory? [Radinovic] The strategic position of Croatia was very unfavorable before the war, too. This is a very elongated state; if we measured it, it would be more than 1,000 km long. Its depth does not exceed 10 km in places. Such states can hardly survive even if they had very amicable neighbors. The republic of Serbian Krajina is elongated and thus unfavorable, too. If you bear in mind though that Baranja, eastern Slavonija, and western Srem are adjacent to Serbia, the territory looks much better. [Reljic] What about the republic of Srpska with its "Maslenica" at Brcko? [Radinovic] This is the weakest strategic point the republic of Srpska has. This even more, since the newly established federation -- which I think can hardly survive -- threatens to cut the republic of Srpska into two parts. [Reljic] Is the Muslim-Croatian federation a good solution from a strategical point of view? [Radinovic] Several interests overlapped here. First of all, Croatia had to be saved from sanctions because of its direct involvement in the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Apart from that, Croatian military defeats in Central Bosnia had to be covered up. Everyone knows that regular Croatian units occupied a part of the republic of Srpska between Trebinje and Dubrovnik, that they are situated in central Bosnia and in western Herzegovina. Apart from that, the anti-Serbian coalition had to be strengthened. This was partially accomplished. Besides, the establishment of a pure Muslim state in Bosnia-Herzegovina had to be prevented. The completely wrong Croatian policy toward Bosnia-Herzegovina had to be improved. The weakest point in the Croatian political strategy is that it agreed to partition Bosnia-Herzegovina, because they practically gave up their old dream -- from Starcevic [19th century Croatian intellectual] through Pavelic [fascist leader of World War II Independent State of Croatia] to [Croatian President] Tudjman -- that Croatia should reach the Drina and the Danube. The creation of the Croatian-Muslim federation has a political and strategic function because it will give Croatia the necessary depth of the territory. [Reljic] Why did the Muslims accept this link with Croatia? [Radinovic] The United States exerted pressure on the Muslims. The federation is not favorable for the Muslims, since they had almost won the war in Central Bosnia before they entered the federation. I think it is a mistake that they agreed to it. I do not expect that this federation will hold for a long time, especially not the confederation between this federation and Croatia. I think this is favorable for Serbia, because our right to establish an independent Serbian state in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina and its merger with other Serbian countries will become legitimate in this way. [Reljic] Can Croatia correct the border through the use of force, even though several of its military actions against the republic of Srpska were futile? [Radinovic] Croatia is not able to correct the borders with military means. Their constant threats are used only to make an impression on the domestic political scene. Even the most superficial analysis can prove they are not able to do it. It is only 6 km from the foremost Serbian positions to the Slovene border, toward Metlika. In certain places along the communication line between Karlovac and the Rijeka front, Serbian positions lie only two km from the road. The road can be hit even from 60-caliber mortars. This means that in case of a military escalation, the Serbs can eliminate the Karlovac-Rijeka communication line very quickly. Apart from that, the distance between the foremost Serbian positions and the seaside lies between 6 and 10 km, which is within the range of all usual weapons. In other words, the Serbs can place all Dalmatian towns, including Split, under artillery fire. Split has not been attacked so far because it was estimated that this should not be done. Let me summarize: We can attack Split, Sibenik, Zadar, Karlovac, the oil industry in Sisak, Zagreb, Vinkovci, Slavonski Brod, Osijek.... The most dangerous thing for them is that the Serbs have weapons that enable them to destroy Zagreb and the whole infrastructure in the area of the Croatian capital. The republic of Serbian Krajina has powerful weapons for the so-called revenge strategy, which can carry out very successful operations and strikes against those facilities and targets the destruction of which Croatia cannot allow. This is an insoluble problem for them. [Reljic] Such a state is the factor of permanent instability in the whole region. [Radinovic] Croatia is in this sense the source of permanent instability. This is their problem, however. The only possibility is to solve the question of Croat-Serbian relations to the satisfaction of both so that Croats cease to consider Serbs a disturbing factor within their state and in the Balkans in general. [Reljic] It is evident that the creation of small states results in uncontrollable conditions, under which wars can break out at any moment, because "a drunkard can go from one border to the next" -- at Maslenica, for example. [Radinovic] I think it was the interest of international powers to create satellite states in the territory of the former Yugoslavia. I do not think that anything can be changed now. The only state that can exist is the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. [Reljic] Yugoslavia has Kosovo, however! [Radinovic] I am not emotional, although emotions cannot be excluded when speaking about Kosovo. Kosovo is the historical center of the Serbian state. It is not the center of the Serbian state any longer, because the center moved northwards. All political parties and politicians have to treat Kosovo as an integral part of Serbia if they want to have any kind of support by the people. I do not want to say that Kosovo is not a Serbian problem; it is one of the points at which the political stability can be seriously affected. I would say that Kosovo is one of the points at which the independence of our state can be attacked by weapons. [Reljic] What do you think about the comparison between the republic of Serbian Krajina and Kosovo? [Radinovic] These are two completely different matters. Kosovo has always been an integral part of the Serbian state, and Krajina was not an integral part of Croatia until the first Yugoslav state was established. [Reljic] You are speaking about historical rights, but when national states come into existence, there is the right of the stronger over the weaker in a certain territory. [Radinovic] Kosovo cannot be regarded as an isolated entity. Serbia is stronger than Kosovo Albanians. Kosovo is Serbian territory. It is out of the question that Kosovo is a part of Serbia. I am convinced that no one even thinks of leading such conversations. [Reljic] What do you think about "Partnership for Peace?" The countries around Serbia have already applied for membership in that alliance. Russia will also apply for it. [Radinovic] Even if we wanted to apply, we would not be accepted now, but I do not think we should enter this alliance. [Reljic] Not even after Russia? [Radinovic] Not even after Russia. [Reljic] Should we be against the world again? [Radinovic] There is no reason for the Serbs to take to the market everything they succeeded in retaining though their history -- true self-confidence. This does not mean that we should remain isolated. Isolation, which I fervently oppose, is one thing and servility is another. "Partnership for Peace" is actually a cheap phrase -- a more elaborate concept for the transfer of the sovereignty of single states to international powers. This is practically silent occupation. [Reljic] Do you think that Russia has not realized this? [Radinovic] This is another name for a new world order under U.S. domination. We should look for allies among nations that are spiritually close to us. It is clear who they are. [Reljic] Who? [Radinovic] Primarily Greece, Russia, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Romania. [Reljic] Greece is a NATO member, though. Why do you think it would not betray us if it needed it? [Radinovic] I do not agree with it. Greeks would never betray us, but they can never defend us to the extent they would like to because they must not forget their interests. I refuse this theory. [Reljic] They have had their interests in mind all the time, and Serbia served them more or less only as a good argument. Russia, too. [Radinovic] Every state cares for its own interests; Greece and Russia, but also Serbia and Yugoslavia, because interests are eternal and all other things are transitory. It has been proven, however, that there are real values -- ethic, spiritual and civilization closeness. They are relevant even in political alliances. I support the theory that contacts should be sought with those states and nations that want us.
