Yi gave a briefing on the "recent North Korean situation and inter-Korean relations" at a meeting of the Advisory Council on Democratic and Peaceful Unification, saying that Pyongyang will eventually change its attitude because it has no good reason to delay settlement of the nuclear problem. The newly appointed minister said, "Respecting the principle that the unification policy should maintain coherence, the government will adjust its direction according to changes in the situation as well as continue to study detailed ways to push ahead with this policy." He said the Seoul government will deal separately with the nuclear and humanitarian issues. "The government's decision to bring in North Koreans who escaped from the Siberian logging camps was made from a humanitarian point of view," Yi pointed out. He clarified that the government will emphasize its unification policy in settling the North Korean dispute. "Unless the deadlock on the nuclear issue is broken, the government will stick to its policy of linking the North Korean nuclear problem to inter-Korean economic cooperation," he said. Seoul will continue to maintain the principles of inter-Korean relations -- settlement between the countries concerned, settlement between the governments, productive dialogue and implementation of agreements -- in pushing ahead with South-North dialogue, he added.
