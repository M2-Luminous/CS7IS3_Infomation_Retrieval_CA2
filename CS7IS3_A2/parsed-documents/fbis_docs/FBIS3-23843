A drop in production volume in 1993 was noted at enterprises with all forms of ownership and in all sectors. The most complicated situation over the course of the year persisted in the light, chemical and fuel sectors, where the decline amounted to 31-37 percent. The production of cotton cloth was curtailed by half, of footwear by 51 percent, of linen cloth by 29 percent and of knitted wear by 34 percent. Of the sectors of the machine-building complex, the greatest lag behind the 1992 level was noted in the machine-tool and instrument industy --by 32.9 percent. There is a complicated situation in the military-industrial complex, in which every fifth oblast enterprise is engaged. The state indebtedness for goods produced here exceeds 35 billion rubles [R]. The average wage at these types of enterprises is 15-20 percent lower than that for the machine-building industry on the whole. There was a sharp increase in lost work time in connection with the protracted production stoppages. Their percentage increased from 8 percent in the first quarter to 17 percent in the fourth quarter. The overall losses of work time for the oblast last year amounted to 5.5 million man-days. The payment indebtedness for the oblast's enterprises on 1 December amounted to R249.8 billion.
