Subbotina: "Moskompriroda Is Watching Attentively"] [Text] Moskompriroda [Moscow Committee on Environmental Protection and Natural Resources] specialists have prepared a review of the environmental protection activities of enterprises and other facilities. The review was compiled from the results of state oversight activities in 1993. MOSKOVSKAYA PRAVDA found it expedient to publish a selective rendition of this work. Of course, many facts registered by Moskompriroda are alarming and a cause for health concerns. All of us would rather see a smog-free capital city; the reality today, however, is that Moscow is an industrial giant saturated to capacity with industrial and automotive transportation enterprises, warehouse zones, and transportation arteries. There are 62 large industrial zones on city territory inside the beltway. Automobiles are the main contributors to environmental pollution. The number of cars in Moscow is growing annually; 200,000 cars were added in 1993. As of 1 January last year there were more than 1 million cars in the city. The increasing number of cars is a direct route to increased discharge of harmful substances into the atmosphere. The finding of Moskompriroda specialists is that environmental pollution in Moscow remains high. What We Breath In 1993 the Moscow State Inspection for Protection of the Atmosphere conducted 1,120 checks at industrial and automotive transportation enterprises in the city. It uncovered 10,166 violations. Industry and power generation discharged 230,718 tonnes of pollutants. Of this discharge, 90 percent comprise solid substances and nitrogen, carbons, and hydrocarbon oxides. Analysis of the state of atmospheric air shows that the higher than average level of pollution is created by discharges of nitrogen, ammonia, benzene, phenol, and hydrocarbon dioxides. Motor vehicles are serious air polluters. Moskompriroda conducted inspections of automotive transportation enterprises; twice--in May and September--it conducted Operation Clean Air. It inspected 520 enterprises, including the AMO ZIL [Imeni Lenina Auto Works] and AZLK plant [Imeni Leninskogo Komsomola Auto Works]. It registered 856 violations. Thousands of cars were checked by instruments, and one out of five did not meet standards. More than 71,000 cars were checked for exhaust toxicity in the course of Operation Clean Air. The number of cars that did not meet state standards amounted to 14.7 percent. This is unquestionably a large number, although we can console ourselves with the fact that in 1992 the same indicator measured 17.7 percent. To a large extent the reduction has been achieved as a result of automotive enterprises beginning to actively equip themselves with gas analysis apparatus. The total discharge of pollutants into the atmosphere in 1993 (industry and automotive transport) amounted to more than 1 million tonnes. A special issue are foundries within city limits. On 1 February 1990, a decision was adopted on 56 priority steps aimed at reducing the discharge of hazardous substances from foundries at the city's 53 enterprises. As of 1 January of this year, 53 points of the program have been implemented; it includes reconstruction and liquidation of foundries, construction of gas scrubbers, and reduction of the production volume by reducing deliveries to other regions. Two points have not been implemented: the metal household goods plant No. 6 has not been shut down (Southwestern district) and the foundry of the Stekloagregat plant (Southern district) has not undergone reconstruction. By now foundry discharges into the atmosphere have been cut by 9,924 tonnes, which is 83 percent of that envisaged in the full program. The Water We Drink In 1993 the Moscow City Inspection for the Protection of Water Resources conducted 1,029 checks at 947 facilities. Among them are 456 industrial and automotive transportation enterprises, Mosvodokanal, and Mosvodostok. It was established that the city's aeration stations, which dump insufficiently purified waste into the Moscow River, and dumping from construction sites and residential areas remain the main sources of pollution of Moscow reservoirs. Moskompriroda inspectors uncovered 396 violations of water protection legislation. The violators were fined a total of 18,935 million rubles [R]. The inspectors found that of 252 operating industrial waste purification systems, almost half (!) were ineffective or out of order. In 1992, 60 percent of systems were noted as out of order. Overall, the situation remains unsatisfactory. It is good to see that 84 of the total number of inspected enterprises have 149 circulating water cycle system functioning, and 19 enterprises have 24 systems using recycled water. Among the violators of water protection legislation were the NPO [scientific-industrial association] Kauchuk, the First Watch Factory, the AP [joint-stock enterprise[ Meridian, the oil and lubricant plant, the Dynamo plant, the Danilovo cab manufacturing plant, and others. Overall there has been a reduction in the discharge of metals, petroleum products, and suspended particles, which is a result of cutbacks in production as well as of water-purification systems being installed at industrial facilities. Analysis of aeration stations' operations for past year leads to the following conclusions: The Kuryanov, Lyubertsy, and Zelenograd stations and the Lyublino shop for comprehensive water purification dump liquid waste that does not meet standard requirements, which pollutes rivers. The reasons for unsatisfactory operations of the stations is delay in bringing on line reserve capacities and overload of currently operating capacities. A serious strain on the environment comes from Galvanic production, which essentially dumps heavy metal salts. The Government of Moscow's program, which envisages liquidation and reconstruction of galvanic production, is being implemented too slowly. More dirt is brought by snow, which is dumped into the Moscow River--snow carries into the water petroleum products, chlorides, and suspended particles. The city's main river is still not in good health. The segments of the Moscow River within the city limits that are in the worst shape are still the sites where waste water is being dumped from city aeration stations. In 1993, 11 tributaries of the Moscow River were checked. The negative effect of 10 of them is negligible; only Yauza has a perceptible role in pollution of the Moscow River. The most polluted rivers are Yauza, Filka, Presnya, and Kotlovka, where specific pollution is detected: petroleum products--from 3 to 94 (!) MAL [maximum allowable level]; and heavy metal salts, especially copper, iron, and zinc--up to 37 MAL. The Soil We Walk On As of 1 January 1994 there were 102 unauthorized dump sites in Moscow with a total area of 280 hectares and consisting mostly of solid household and industrial waste and construction trash. The largest dump sites are located at Verkhniye Polya Street (30 hectares), Brateyevo (15 hectares), and Anreyevskiy Ravine (10 hectares). Over the past year 17 dump sites with a total area of 17 hectares have been removed. Moskompriroda has registered a multitude of violations with respect to land use: unauthorized seizure of land; unauthorized construction; failure to fulfill obligations to conduct an environmental impact study; violations of environmental requirements in storing industrial and household waste. The legality of construction of 63 parking lots and garages was checked. The greatest number of violations were registered in the Southwestern (12), Southern (9), and Northeastern (5) districts. The action with respect to violations included 60 removal orders, 25 decrees on suspension of work, and 101 protocols on initiation of administrative court proceedings in an amount of R18 million. Over the past year measures of economic coercion in an amount of R134 million were taken against violators of environmental protection legislation. Damage compensation fines amounted to R120 million.
