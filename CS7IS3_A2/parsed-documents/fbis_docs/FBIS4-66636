New Delhi and Washington appear to be heading for yet another round of acrimonious exchange with the Clinton administration's reported move to deliver 71 F-16 fighter planes to Pakistan. It is as yet unclear whether the administration is considering an unconditional delivery of the planes or whether, it plans to obtain specific, nuclear non-proliferation-related assurances from Islamabad prior to any delivery. The possibility of a qualitative shift in the weapons balance in South Asia came into sharp focus when the South Dakota Republican Senator, Mr. Larry Pressler, disclosed that the US defence department was keen on completing the sale deed of the combat aircrafts to Pakistan. Further corroboration of the F-16 transfer was provided on the very next day by Ms. Robin Raphel, the assistant secretary of state for South Asia. During a testimony to the house foreign affairs sub-committee on Asia and the Pacific, Ms. Raphel said that the aircrafts in question had already been sold to Pakistan; it was now just a matter of delivery. She said that certain aspects of amendment which applied to the transfer of the fighter planes, could still be used as a "leverage" to persuade Pakistan to cap its nuclear programme. This unfolding episode forcefully reinforces yet again, the perception of an unabated deterioration in Indo-US relations. This was reflected in a March 9 New Delhi-datelined dispatch in THE NEW YORK TIMES. The report, "US Remarks Over Kashmir Anger Indians" said that for now, the Indian government's unhappiness with the Clinton administration "seem minimal, although the Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, has shelved plans to visit Washington soon." Speaking to THE TIMES OF INDIA, Dr. Sumit Ganguly, a researcher at the Woodrow Wilson Centre observed that the Indo-US relations under the Clinton administration had suffered enormously "because of a number of careless, thoughtless, and tactless statements" and gestures by administration officials. These included some routine letters from the White House over which there was no supervision and "a couple of singularly tactless statements" by Ms. Raphel. In contrast to popular perception in India, Washington was not obsessed with Kashmir, Dr. Ganguly noted, pointing out that the secretary of state, Mr. Warren Christopher, did not even mention Kashmir in any of his prepared testimonies. The administration was concerned about nuclear non-proliferation, but without devoting the same intensity of attention to India-Pakistan, as to Iran, Iraq and North Korea. Fourteen months into the Clinton regime, the damage to Indo-US relations appears unabated with the White House continuing to issue auto-signed letters to reply to anti-Indian Congressmen who repeatedly refer to the Indian state of Punjab, as "Punjab, Khalistan." American scholars and administration officials, however, have termed the Indian protests as an "over-reaction" to minor issues and gestures by politicians towards their constituents. Some analysts, however, point to the Clinton administration's bankruptcy on foreign policy issues, with recent US diplomatic conflicts even with such allies as Japan, France and Britain. By the same token, these analysts say that if India wants to be taken seriously by the US in its foreign policy considerations, tangible actions showing displeasure with the US would have to be seriously considered. "The US will not take India's position on Kashmir seriously unless New Delhi demonstrates that it means business and that it is prepared to put an end to international terrorism by undertaking a hot pursuit of terrorists directly into Pakistan," a Washington-based Indian-American analyst said. He added that such a legitimate move aimed at eliminating terrorist training camps in Pakistan "would ring the right belles at the situation room in the White House." The Clinton administration's latest act of insensitivity towards India, is the administration's reported attempt to proceed with the sale of F-16 combat aircrafts to Pakistan. It is not difficult to visualise the enormous damage that such a decision would do, if carried through without meaningful and verifiable nuclear-related assurances from Islamabad. Mr. Selig Harrison, a foreign policy expert at the Carnegie Endowment was aghast when informed of the F-16 delivery proposal. The US policy of delivery arms to Pakistan seemed to resemble the motions of a revolving door, he said, with successive administrations, appeasing Islamabad with military aid, only to withdraw it later. The decision to deliver F-16s to Pakistan "couldn't have come at a worst time in Indo-US relations," said Mr. Harrison in an interview with THE TIMES OF INDIA. He pointed out that the rhetorical exchange between New Delhi and Washington had "already given the impression of a US tilt towards Pakistan." Mr. Michael Krepon, another analyst at the Henry L. Stimson Centre said it was probable that the US would demand specific nuclear-related steps from Pakistan before delivering the F-16s. "My reading is that there is some sentiment to waive Pressler but only if Pakistan takes verifiable and concrete steps that are in support of US non-proliferation policies," Mr. Krepon told THE TIMES OF INDIA. "This administration came in on a platform that focussed far more upon American domestic revival further than any grand promises of dramatic changes in foreign policy," Dr. Ganguly said. "Foreign policy has not been the principle concern of this administration when it came and it has not been since the past year in office." The priorities were unlikely to change significantly, Dr. Ganguly said, as President Clinton remained focussed on the domestic economy and other national issues such as health care reforms, job retraining and social welfare.
