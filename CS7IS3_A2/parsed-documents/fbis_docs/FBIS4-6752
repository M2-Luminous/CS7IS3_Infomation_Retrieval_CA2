FBIS4-6752 "dreas078_d_94023" FBIS-EAS-94-078 Daily Report 22 Apr 1994 South Korea Papers React to Kim Il-song's Interview Papers React to Kim Il-song's Interview SK2104144594 SK2104144594 BFN [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of editorials and articles published in Seoul vernacular dailies on 21 April on the reportedly pacifying gesture by North Korean President Kim Il-song during his recent interview with William Taylor, vice president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, CSIS, and other Western media, such as CNN, THE WASHINGTON TIMES, and Japanese NHK Television. The conservative CHOSON ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled "From the Sea of Fire to Fishing." The editorial begins: "Until recently, U.S. media was uproarious in reporting that a war would break out on the Korean peninsula at any time. Now, a person called vice president of the U.S. CSIS, who interviewed Kim Il-song, states that he can confirm Kim's pacifying attitude. Noting this rapidly fluctuating scene, we are led to believe that Kim Il-song's game with the South, the United States, and the media is working. Uproarious commotions occurred in Western media concerning `war clouds on the Korean peninsula' in reaction to `the sea of fire' remark. Several days later, when Kim Il-song said: `I wish to visit the United States to fish and hunt,' a U.S. figure said there is no war danger. Kim is certainly toying with our side. As revealed in Kim Il-song's meeting with Western figures, he is informed on the nuclear issue, he is resolved not to ultimately abandon the nuclear program while continuing to deny possessing nuclear weapons, and he will keep trying to win a package solution using the nuclear card." The editorial concludes: "We should solidify our security posture and maintain a firm ROK-U.S. cooperative alliance, rather than readily reacting to the North's game, which does not display any honesty. We should not hastily be tempted to meetings or talks with the North." The conservative CHOSON ILBO carries on page 5 a 1,300-word article by reporter An Hui-chang entitled: "Kim Il-song's Pacifying Scheme -- Well-Planned Propaganda Offensive Aimed at Deranging the South." The article notes that "The `smile operation' that North Korean President Kim Il-song himself is undertaking must have been well-planned." The article then notes: "For the show, North Korea displayed a `dovish gesture' to the world through an actor called Kim Il-song. The show is also aimed at deranging the South. North Korea had to stage a show like this because it is thoroughly isolated from the world opinion owing to its incomplete compliance with the ad hoc inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA. Furthermore, the recently reported issue of North Korean loggers and escapees from the North brought to light the North Korean human rights issue, a disgrace to North Korea." The article concludes: "The true North Korean intent behind the pacifying show by Kim Il-song will be revealed in the near future." CHOSON ILBO carries on page 5 a 1,000-word article by Kim Chol entitled: "The ROK and the United States Taken by Surprise." The article notes that "Using a Western broadcast covering the news connected with the tension on the Korean peninsula and his 82d birthday, North Korean President Kim Il-song took the United States and the ROK by surprise. Kim tried to replace his image of a hooligan with an image of a neighborly grandfather, a good citizen one can meet anywhere, and a friendly figure for the American people." The article notes that Kim Il-song's pacifying gesture is likely to confuse ROK's North Korean policy and inspire the reunification advocates who are not aware of the true nature of the North Korean rulers. The article then notes North Korea has succeeded in enhancing its position, as was expected, in using the nuclear card in view of the present stage of development. The article notes: "Kim Il-song's nuclear strategy consists of two stages. One is to improve relations with the United States by using the nuclear issue as a weapon for the North Korean system, which is left as a solitary island in the post-cold war era." The article continues: "The second stage of Kim Il-song's strategy is to force the U.S. Forces out of the ROK, ultimately through the improvement of relations with the United States." The moderate TONG-A ILBO carries on page 3 an article by Pak Che-kyun entitled: "Kim Il-song's Remarks on His Readiness To Abolish the Radiochemical Laboratory." The article notes Kim Il-song's remarks in a written interview with Western media that he is prepared to abolish the radiochemical laboratory, provided that the United States assists North Korea to install light-water reactors. The article notes the complexity involved in assisting North Korea to install light-water reactors because it would mean the United States has to spend $1 to 2 billion per reactor, not to mention the 10 years required for the construction of the reactor. The article notes: "U.S. assistance to North Korea for the light-water reactor means the improvement of relations between the United States and North Korea, which will probably lead to the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries." The editorial concludes: "It is not likely that the ROK and the United States will accede to President Kim's proposal at this stage, which President Kim will no doubt be aware of. Therefore, while unwilling at heart to abolish the radiochemical laboratory, he is urging the United States to improve its relations with North Korea, using the light-water reactor card, stressing that North Korea has no intention of developing nuclear weapons, according to an analysis of relevant government officials." The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN carries on page 3 a 900-word article by Kim Pong-son entitled: "The Government's View on Kim Il-song's Remark Hinting of Abolishing the Radiochemical Laboratory." Reporting that the ROK Government reaction was mixed on his remark, the article notes those who have an upbeat view hold that "such a remark is an indirect expression of change in its previous stance that `North Korean-U.S. talks are a prerequisite for additional inspections,'" whereas those with a negative view maintain "his remark clearly shows that North Korea intends to earn more time by adding conditions regarding light-water reactors." The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO carries on page 3 a 700-word article by Kim Yong-ha. Noting the huge differences in their capacity to extract plutonium from light-water reactors and graphite reactors, the article notes "if North Korea's intention to install light-water reactors is true, it can be interpreted as an intention to suspend its nuclear development." The article concludes: "The clearest sign that can be seen from President Kim Il-song's remark is that `North Korea's nuclear card' is becoming ineffective. Hence North Korea's gesture implies that North Korea, being driven into a corner, seeks an exit that serves its interests." The moderate HANGUK ILBO carries on page 5 an 800-word article by Washington-based correspondent Yi Sang-sok entitled: "Kim Il-song's Pacifying Remarks." Enumerating on North Korea leadership's moderate tone, the article writes: "With this pacifying attitude, North Korea aims to earn the time necessary for nuclear development, to disintegrate the ROK-U.S. cooperative system, and to deepen the confrontation between ROK hardliners and moderates." The article continues that Kim Il-song "in effect asked the world to take him at his word that he had no nuclear ambitions, giving no hint of welcoming IAEA inspections." Noting that the North Korean nuclear issue is back to the point it had started, the article analyzes "in view of this, there is a dominant feeling around U.S. political circles that the United States should not be entangled in President Kim Il-song's pacifying attitude and that it should firmly push ahead with its previous scenario of imposing pressure if North Korea fails to meet the early-May deadline." The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN carries on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled: "We Should Not Get Dazzled by a Peace Offensive." Referring to U.S. and Japanese media welcoming Kim Il-song's remarks for their moderate tone, the editorial questions: "How can we believe that he is telling the truth? What we need now is his remark that North Korea will unconditionally accept overall inspections and carrying it into practice. To one's great regret, he has not uttered a word on this even though he has made countless flowery remarks." Denouncing North Korea's invariable communist-type disguised tactics, the editorial holds that "regardless of such a peace offensive, the deployment of Patriot missiles and the Team Spirit exercise should not be suspended. The UN Security Council should adopt sanctions against North Korea unless it accepts IAEA inspections. What is more, we should show more positive interest in the human rights condition in North Korea to make North Korea acknowledge the necessity of accepting nuclear inspections and holding inter-Korean talks." Recalling the recent student demonstrations opposing the deployment of Patriots, the editorial warns that "the people and public sentiment should not be deceived by North Korea's peace offensive." The article concludes that "in this perspective, the members of the National Federation of General Student Councils should remember that they are playing into North Korea's hands."
