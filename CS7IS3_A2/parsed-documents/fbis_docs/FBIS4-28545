The committee on foreign exchange and other [as received] also proposed a revision in Japan's statistics on international balance of payments, mainly switching to yen-denominated figures from the current U.S. dollar base. The statistics include politically sensitive current account figures used to measure trade imbalances. The proposals in the annual report cited criticism at home and abroad over the tight market rules in Japan, an increasing role overseas of advanced financial derivatives and spreading moves by Japanese companies to enter other Asian nations. "The annual report focused on Asia this year...especially with boosting direct investment by Japanese manufacturers and increasing competition with Hong Kong and Singapore financial markets," said Tomomitsu Oba, head of the committee's special group that compiled the report. Speaking at a news conference after a panel meeting, Oba added that revising the balance of payment statistics is another key part of the report, noting, "all major nations offer them only in their own currencies." A Finance Ministry official told the same news meeting that the ministry wants to revise the figures by the end of fiscal 1997. The panel said in the report, "further deregulatory steps are needed in our financial markets" to meet fund demand at home and from abroad through diversified fund-raising means. It particularly expressed "full expectations" on commissions and taxes. On financial derivatives such as options and swaps, the panel wants the government to "prepare acceptable products in our financial markets while ensuring transparency and fairness of transactions." Strict rules over issuing bonds and stocks prevail in Japan despite a global trend for deregulation, and obtaining permission is especially difficult for financial derivatives that are becoming the mainstay in deregulated markets. Japanese banks and securities firms are, in fact, increasingly moving to set up subsidiaries specializing in derivatives in Hong Kong and other Asian nations where regulations are far looser. Focusing on such moves by financial institutions as well as by manufacturers to enter other Asian nations, the panel said it "expects our financial markets...to take a mutual complementary role with the Asian markets." The report noted that fund demand is on a sharp rise in tandem with soaring entries by Japanese companies into the fast growing Asian economies since the late 1980s to cope with the yen's rise. "But smooth procurement of long-term funds is still difficult there, excluding Hong Kong and Singapore," the panel said, calling for improvement of Japan's markets as a fund-raising vehicle for other Asian nations. Meanwhile, the forum also suggested that some rules are needed for financial derivatives as the report mentioned only "acceptable products" and called for "transparency and fairness." This apparently reflected heightening international concerns led by the United States that advanced, off-the-book derivatives may lead to unnecessary market volatility. The panel said preparation of statistics for grasping the conditions is "not catching up" with the quick development of derivatives. Along with such advanced financial transactions, service trade is also "diversifying and increasing" to make data currently included in the international balance of payments insufficient, the report said. Against this backdrop, the panel called on the Finance Ministry to revamp the balance of payments statistics to improve service trade and investment data in line with a manual prepared last year by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
