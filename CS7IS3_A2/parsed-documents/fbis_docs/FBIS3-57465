"It needs to be emphasized that the Russians have chosen democracy," Aho said. He said becoming a member in the Council of Europe was an important step in the process of democratization. Therefore, Russia and the other countries that have expressed the wish to join the CE should be accepted as quickly as possible, the Finnish leader said. When asked by the head of the Estonian delegation to the meeting, Tunne Kelam, if Russia should become a CE member even before it has withdrawn its troops from Estonia and Latvia, Aho said he favored the pullout of Russian troops, but added that Russia had to be accepted into the European body in any case. Finland on Wednesday was the only country in the Strasbourg meeting to give its unconditional support to granting Russia a full member status. Russian officials have already made a number of statements hailing Finland.
