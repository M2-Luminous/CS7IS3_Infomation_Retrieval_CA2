"At the time when the regime is talking about negotiations...we see an increase of assassinations of innocent citizens in all parts of the country in order to drive fear and terror among the people," said a FIS statement faxed to IRNA from Germany. "The criminal cowardly act which was carried out by the suppressive forces against the leader, mujahid and martyr Sayf al-Islam Djaafar and some of his helpers, the best of mujahideen heroes, expresses the real intention of the regime which is imposed on the people by fire and sword," said the statement issued by the Executive Committee of FIS in Europe. "Let the regime and its helpers know that whenever a leader falls other will take his place on the same path till god grants us victory," said the statement in Arabic. The Algerian regime this week said its forces had killed Djaafar El Afghani and several other members of his group. "There is no solution to the political dilemma in Algeria except by total compliance with the will of the people to create a just Islamic state which will deliver the people from tyranny, oppression and corruption and return to them their freedom and respect," it underlined.
