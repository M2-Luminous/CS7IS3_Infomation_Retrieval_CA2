Samsung is the first Korean semiconductor firm to build an overseas production plant. Under an agreement on capital ties, Samsung and TI will invest a total of $50 million to expand a TI plant in Porto, northern Portugal, according to the company. At the plant, TI has been producing low value-added nonmemory chips. Samsung and TI will equip the plant with advanced semiconductor production facilities. Samsung will concentrate on 4M and 16M DRAM memory chips for sale in European countries, while TI will produce high value-added logic chips, according to the company. The plant will begin operations in the second half of this year. With the facilities, Samsung will be able to expand semiconductor exports to European countries without being embroiled in trade disputes, a company spokesman said. Samsung and TI reached the agreement on the joint-venture plant last December and have been waiting for the go-ahead from the Portuguese Government. The two obtained approval recently. The agreement basically concerns capital ties for the plant and hence does not involve technological or business cooperation. But the two intend to increase their ties in the future, according to a company spokesman. Last November, Samsung signed an accord on technological cooperation with Micron Technology of the United States for the development of the next-generation memory chips. Taken together, the two agreements laid the foundation for closer cooperation between the United States and Korea in the field of semiconductors, the company said.
