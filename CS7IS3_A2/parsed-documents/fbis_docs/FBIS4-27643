FBIS4-27643 "dreas107_j_94009" FBIS-EAS-94-107 Daily Report 25 Apr 1994 Indonesia * Call for Bids on Power Plants Repeated * Call for Bids on Power Plants Repeated 94SE0121B Jakarta KOMPAS in Indonesian 25 Apr 94 pp 1, 18 94SE0121B Jakarta KOMPAS Indonesian CSO [Text] Jakarta, KOMPAS--The government will reconsider the prices of the PLTGU's [gas-steam electric power plants] at Muara Tawar in West Java, Tambak Lorok in Central Java, and Pasuruan in East Java. This will be done through a "repeat order." The prices bid for Muara Tawar by ABB [expansion unknown] in partnership with Marubeni of Japan, for Tambak Lorok by Sumitomo of Japan and General Electric of the United States, and for Pasuruan by Mitsubishi of Japan and Siemens, which will have a total of 2,342 MW [megawatts], were considered by the government to be quite high and thus require reconsideration. Minister of Mining and Energy I.B. Sudjana said this Saturday, 23 April, at the Department of Mining and Energy after inaugurating the Board of Commissioners of Aneka Tambang and the Boards of Commissioners and Directors of PT [Limited Company] Tambang Timah. "The bids offered by the three contractors were quite high. For that reason, the government needs to reconsider them," Sudjana said. For the readers information, the high prices were actually reduced by the contractors at the end of February after receiving instructions from President Suharto. The bid price of the three PLTGU's, which have a total capacity of 2,342 MW, was reduced from $2.147 billion to $1.769 billion. This approaches the PLN price for the Tanjungpriok PLTGU. The total price reduction by the three consortia was $378.15 million, or about 801.678 billion rupiah. Sudjana said that although there is to be a reconsideration, as of now he cannot set an ideal price for the three PLTGU's. At present, the final price for the construction of the Tanjungpriok PLTGU is still being used as a reference for setting a price for the projects. The government must decide an ideal price for the three PLTGU's after calculating operational and technical aspects and the prices of components involved in each project. Coordinating Minister of Economics, Finance, and Development Supervision In view of these considerations, the press asked if a new contractor is possible, in addition to the three contractors decided by the government through the "repeat order." "I do not know and cannot yet say," Sudjana replied. The minister of mining and energy said that the decision on who is qualified to get the work is up to Saleh Afiff, coordinating minister of economics, finance, and development supervision. The project is funded by foreign loans connected with the Foreign Commercial Loan Team (PKLN), which is under the coordination of the coordinating minister of economics, finance, and development supervision. "Everything is up to him. If the coordinating minister deems another new contractor is needed as compensation for the length of time in bringing the project to realization, that is up to him. He has the authority to do that," Sudjana said. When mention was made of losses incurred by the PLN because of the repeated postponement of a government decision on the winning tender, Sudjana admitted that the PLN has suffered losses. The losses have not been very big, however, and have been limited to loss of time rather than material losses. "There have not been great losses of time, however. I am sure that if we look at the program for the three projects, all that remains to be done is to proceed with them. The sites are ready and do not need to be prepared. If everything is ready, that will save time in catching up. All that will be needed is assembly, and that will not take long compared with the initial process, from site preparation to project construction," Sudjana asserted. Some time ago, Uno Bintang Sudibyo, chairman of the Electric Power Studies Program of the University of Indonesia, said that comprehensive comparison studies should be conducted before setting a price for the three projects. Whether a project is cheap or expensive cannot be determined merely by comparing the total price of the project with other projects built previously but must take into consideration the details of components that make up each project. He said that setting a project price based on each kilowatt of electricity from a PLTGU that is to be built must be done through a comprehensive comparison study. Primarily, comparison must be made with similar projects in other places or other countries, possibly in Thailand, for example. As an example, he said the international standard price for the capital cost of a PLTGU project of three times 600 MW is $700 per kilowatt. "Thus, the PLN may set a price of $800 per kilowatt, as long as it conducts very detailed research and make comparisons with other countries with lower prices before setting a price," he asserted.
