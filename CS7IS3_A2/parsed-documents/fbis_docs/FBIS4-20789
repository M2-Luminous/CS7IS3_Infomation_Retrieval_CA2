The Lok Sabha Speaker, Mr. Shivraj Patil, today directed the Government to make a statement as an agitated Opposition voiced fears that several lakh workers would lose jobs as the crisis-ridden National Textiles Corporation Mills [NTC] were on the verge of closure. Raising the matter during zero hour in the Lok Sabha, Mr. Ram Naik (BJP) (Bharatiya Janata Party) said 11 NTC mills closed down yesterday in Bombay as power supply was disconnected for non-payment of bills. The plight of the NTC workers in West Bengal was highlighted by Mr. Sudarshan Roy Chaudhary, CPI(M) (Communist Party of India-Marxist). He contended that about 1.60 lakh workers in the State would stop getting their salaries from April one as the NTC Mills would receive Rs. 10 [rupees] lakhs from the Centre as against an expenditure of Rs. 30 crores. Mr. Harin Pathak, a BJP member for Gujarat, said 1.5 lakh employees in the powerloom and handloom sectors had gone on strike protesting against a 10 per cent increase in excise duty on cotton and polyester yarn.
