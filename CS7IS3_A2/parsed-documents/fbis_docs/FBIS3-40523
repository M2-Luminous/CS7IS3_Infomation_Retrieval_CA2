However, because national defense is very important to the country, I consented because of the benefits of having a connection to the technology through my work. Examining recent economic trends, a little anxiety is apparent. The media has complacently offered discussions on the widespread stagnation in consumption and uneven distribution of money following the collapse of the inflated economy, the unbalance between supply and demand by excess equipment, or the absence of required purchases. However, the clear-cut reason is simply that the economy has not recovered. I feel that the positive aspects must be stressed and lead in that direction. I still clearly remember that a few years ago the media primarily tended to discount the importance of manufacturing industries. As a result, a large number of university students studying science and technology looked for jobs at securities companies, banks, and distribution companies. At the time, university professors frowned upon this. In a country like Japan that is populous but poor in natural resources, manufacturing industries are usually very active. It is important for them to form the basis for expanding the country's economy and enrich the citizens' lives. Technology is usually important in stimulating manufacturing industries. The direct connection to development technology, production technology, and management technology will become increasingly important and an injection of human resources may be needed. In addition, society will probably need to be educated. The most important element is for technical workers to endeavor to keep their places of activity accessible, this is directed in particular at new technical workers. Based on the conditions in product output to the conditons in market input, positioning the origin of ideas on the development of civilian goods in what is normally called the ``market,'' undertaking the preparation of technology seeds, realizing key technologies, and surveying market needs, and product planning are continuing. Since market needs in the defense industry are often shrouded by secrecy, manufacturers find it difficult to understand all of the needs beforehand. Because extra time is needed during development and hasty conclusions lead to the inevitable fear of inefficiencies, trying to conduct a few more discussions among the concerned parties is needed. Recently, the fundamental and honest view is to return to the origin. Education is influenced by the ebb and flow of the country and technology supports this. As a technologist, I would like to fundamentally and honestly return to the correct origin and , without being boastful, to cope with these circumstances. To solidly maintain the nation's security in the future, I would like to work hard and to guide technology studies.
