Investigators are examining this possibility as they evaluate specific evidence and information. These people previously stayed in a European capital and were expelled for their participation in terrorist acts. According to evidence and information passed on to the Cypriot authorities, these people acted on the instructions of the Turkish secret service. As part of the investigation, police today searched houses of foreigners in Nicosia. Furthermore, police are examining yellow, left-hand drive Mercedes cars to see whether one is the automobile driven by a foreigner who was asking for information on Thoukidhidhou Street, where Yeoryiadhis' family lives. According to evidence and eyewitness descriptions, police are searching for a man between 30 and 35 years old who is apparently the perpetrator of the cold-blooded murder.
