This is borne out by the mail addressed to Valeriy Zorkin, Gennadiy Zyuganov, Mikhail Lapshin, Aleksandr Rutskoy, Sergey Glazyev, and the other cofounders. They receive more than 500 individual and collective letters every day. The call to unite patriotic forces has already been supported in official statements by more than 6,000 labor collectives, villagers, students, and even groups of senior pupils. They are all prepared actively to promote the movement's noble aims and to set up organizing subdivisions in the provinces. The ideas of accord and of strengthening the Russian State are becoming a consolidating factor for people of not only different ages but also professions and political orientations, even including voters who recently supported "Russia's Choice." The largest number of proposals to set up "Accord for Russia" organizing groups has come from Altay and Krasnoyarsk Krays and Volgograd, Leningrad, Moscow, Nizhniy Novgorod, Novosibirsk, Samara, Saratov, Smolensk, and Chelyabinsk Oblasts. The movement's ideas have also been supported in the Russian Federation republics. The influential public organization "Citizens of Mordovia for Social Justice, Legality, and Economic Stability" plans to examine the question of joining the movement at its next congress.
