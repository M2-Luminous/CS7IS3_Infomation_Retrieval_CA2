He cracked down on "some monopolies" within the media, saying that their presence "is not in line with democracy or freedom." The chief of state made these remarks during an address on 14 April at the industrial complex of the city of Pilar, Buenos Aires Province, where he dedicated the new printing works of the Agrupacion de Diarios del Interior S.A. Menem recalled the policy that the government has implemented since it came to power to deregulate the media that is in the hands of the state, and to achieve "an atmosphere of freedom so that the community can quickly receive basically sound and true information." He said: "Regrettably, some old monopolies still exist. I hope that as we advance in this transformation process these monopolies will adjust to the reality of the country, continent, and the World." Menem maintained that "freedom of the press is a dogma within the framework of judicial order that is contained in the national and provincial Constitutions." He then lamented that the people of the interior "are outshined by the Federal Capital because only events that occur exclusively in the Federal Capital are published, but at times as a consideration there will be some piece of news on events in the interior; if it is bad news, all the better." "We want federalism to become a reality within the sphere of information and communication, and this is something that we are still lacking," he added. He acknowledged that "there are other deficiencies," such as newsprint, although he believes that "there will be no lack of opportunities to acquire manufacturing plants" for this raw material "with this type of grouping and with enough capital." Menem also defended the fact that "the media -- newspapers and magazines -- must have the possibility of purchasing on equal conditions paper for their publications." "This is one of the basic facts of freedom of the press. If the media in the interior have to purchase raw material at a higher price in order to go to press, this is evidently a violation of freedom of the press and communication." He demanded "clear rules of the game if we want to reaffirm this life style that we Argentines have chosen: Democracy and freedom, and the dissemination of this freedom through the media."
