FBIS4-54558 "dreeu085_k_94005" FBIS-EEU-94-085 Daily Report 20 Apr 1994 CROATIA New Party of `HDZ Malcontents' Examined New Party of `HDZ Malcontents' Examined AU0205091594 Rijeka NOVI LIST in Serbo-Croatian 20 Apr 94 p 5 AU0205091594 Rijeka NOVI LIST Serbo-Croatian BFN [Article by Sanja Modric: "The Manolic-Mesic Parliamentary Storm"] [Text] The steering committee of the new party, the Croatian Independent Democrats [HND], the founding of which was announced by Josip Manolic about a month ago, after he had been relieved of all his duties in the HDZ [Croatian Democratic Community], will today be presented to the public at the news conference that will be held at the European Center in Zagreb. The fax sent to the editorial offices of the Croatian papers yesterday around noon, containing information about the event, finally eliminated the doubts about whether Manolic would persist in founding the party of HDZ malcontents, and dispelled speculations according to which Stipe Mesic, the number one Parliament man, had withdrawn and gone back to the party in power. Namely, today's news conference will be held by Josip Manolic and Stipe Mesic, presidents of the two chambers of the Croatian parliament. It is therefore evident that Mesic has not "calmed down" after the mild, but indicative, reprimand issued to him at the Club of HDZ Representatives on 7 April by Dr. Franjo Tudjman, president of the party and president of the state, himself. The high officials of the party in power who, after this event, claimed publicly and privately that Mesic would undoubtedly stay in the party, interpreting Mesic's fiercely critical interviews as harmless scenes caused by "Stipica's ruffled temper," were not right either. (Another) precedent has thus emerged in Croatia: Two key parliament men, both founders of the party in power, are leaving their political nest and becoming part of the opposition. Whether President Tudjman's threat that "this state," headed by him, will not remain "politically and legally helpless" against the dissident Manolic will be actualized, and who else it could include, is yet to be seen. However, it is already clear that Manolic is neither alone, nor has he agreed to the role of the defeated, which he has too readily been offered by the HDZ center. Trying to find out which people would appear before the reporters at the European Center on behalf of the HND, we phoned the party center in Nova Ves 23a, which is temporarily in the offices of Azur. It is interesting that the owner of the company is Josip Zebic, an HDZ member known to the public for having been the first president of the committee for renaming the Zagreb streets and squares. The HND Founding Assembly by 1 May? We talked to Darko Hrastovec, who introduced himself as one of the founders of the new party. He said that the "independent democrats" consist of a "wide circle of people," but he would name only Perica Juric, a HDZ representative, and father Tomislav Pavao Duka, who has recently left the party in power and become an independent representative. Hrastovec also told us that they would present the HND aims and program today. He announced that the founding assembly of the HND was "probably going to be held by 1 May." The party will then file a registration request to the Ministry of Public Administration of the Republic of Croatia. Unless someone comes first, the "independent democrats" will have the registration number 65. Namely, there are at present 64 political parties on the ministry's list, and it is difficult to remember even the names of some of them. The registration of Manolic and Mesic's party will be conducted in compliance with the new Law on Political Parties, which came into effect in late August last year, and which made the conditions for founding a party twice as strict as before. According to the former law, 50 people were necessary to found a party, and now it takes 100. They have to be "persons of age and fit for work," citizens of the Republic of Croatia. Attorney Slobodan Budak explained to us that, in compliance with the constitutional right to free political association, it is not necessary to file a registration request to the Ministry of Public Administration, but rather an application. The state body cannot refuse registration of a party if the associated holders of the same political views meet several basic formal conditions. The application must be filed with the ministry up to 15 days after the founding assembly of the new party takes place, the name of the party must be different from the registered names, and the documentation must contain the minutes from the founding assembly, a statute, a program, and the list of the founders' names, with the evidence that they are Croatian citizens. The ministry has the obligation to deliver the ruling up to 30 days after the application has been sent, and the party has the obligation to publish their program in one ofthe daily papers or in NARODNE NOVINE. Any party whose program "instigates or calls to violent endangering of the democratic constitutional system, independence, integrality, or territorial integrity of the Republic of Croatia" will be denied registration. The Overture to Preterm Elections? One of the questions provoked by the news of the founding of the new party is whether this act will deepen and prolong the parliamentary crisis in Croatia, and if Manolic and Mesic's departure from the HDZ will actually leads to early elections. The answer will emerge when all the names that the "M and M" are counting on are "presented" to the public. Namely, if six "turncoats" from the Chamber of Counties, members of the party in power, and 16 of them from the Chamber of Representatives join the HND, the HDZ loses the majority in the parliament. Naturally, it would take absolute cooperation of the entire opposition, which, as we have learned, is not too united, to achieve such parliamentary balance. Namely, there have been announcements that, in case the least favorable version of the development of events occurs, the HDZ could procure a coalition with the Croatian Peasants Party [HSS] and thus keep the parliament majority. Some opposition leaders believe that Drago Stipac [HSS president] would agree to this, although there are many HSS members who would oppose this fusion. The representatives of the Serbian National Party, who, according to some interpretations, will be "cooperative" with the party in power because they have received a great amount of money to finance the activities of the Serbian association Prosvjeta, have recently stated that "the coalition with the HDZ is out of the question." Other opposition parties have also decidedly declined any possibility of forming a coalition with the HDZ. After certain papers have already stated who some of Manolic's sympathizers from the Club of HDZ Representatives are, and after some of them immediately distanced themselves publicly from "flirting" with the new party, it would be unrewarding to present the names to the public. However, very soon they will be known. Some claim that the secret followers of Manolic and Mesic will find it easier to decide to make public appearances in their new roles as soon as the new party is registered and thus becomes a valid political subject in parliament. Many thus believe that there are many surprises in store regarding the transfer from the HDZ to the HND. Many have connected the forecasts concerning the success or failure of the new party with the support the founders have managed to "win" in the influential international circles, which is still completely unknown here. In the lobbies there has been talk that Manolic has sent his recently published reply to Tudjman to many foreign addresses, allegedly adding a special "annex" with explanations. For the time being it is impossible to check whether these are only rumors, and there is no information about what the response to this mail has been. At any rate, the "tempest in the teapot," which is how President Tudjman called the effects of Manolic's disobedience, has undoubtedly turned out to be a real, big storm. Will it be overcome by democratic or "political and legal" means?
