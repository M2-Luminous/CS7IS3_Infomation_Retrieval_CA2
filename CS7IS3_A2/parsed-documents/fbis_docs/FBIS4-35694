A Syrian official has told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: We are explaining to everyone that peace depends above all on full and comprehensive withdrawal and that Israel's phased security agreements are nothing more than misleading ploys and ways of circumventing the Security Council resolutions. The official added: Israel has dithered and procrastinated with all the Arab parties and requested peace treaties, normalization of relations, and opening of borders under the pretext of building up trust but refused to withdraw from the occupied territories or to commit itself to such withdrawal. The Syrian official said that what Israel wanted was not a genuine Palestinian autonomy or authority but a group that obeys its orders, carries out its instructions, and participates in repressing the Palestinian people in the same way that the mercenaries of Antoine Lahd (South Lebanese Army) act against the Lebanese people and their towns and villages. Referring to the Lebanese front, the Syrian official said that Israel threatened to use force if the Lebanese Army tried advance to the front lines, foiled every initiative by the Lebanese Government for the implementation of Security Council resolution 425, continuously committed aggression against the south, carried out terrorist operations deep into Lebanese territory, and abducted Lebanese citizens from their homes as it did with Shaykh Mustafa al-Dirani on the pretext that he belonged to the Lebanese resistance. He added that Syria would not have been safe from Israeli aggressions had it been weak and vulnerable. In conclusion, the Syrian official said: Israel wants feeble agreements that cannot survive and last but Syria does not accept that kind of logic.
