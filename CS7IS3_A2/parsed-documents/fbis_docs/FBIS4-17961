A number of barriers blocking the progress toward agreement have been removed, said the deputy head of the Russian Government. He added however that a meeting between him and Leon Brittan, deputy chairman of the European Commission, would be necessary to reach a final agreement on questions of principle. Among other things, they will discuss trade in enriched uranium. Russia has proposed compromise solutions, which will have to be developed into approved texts. If this is achieved, then the agreement could be initialled while Greece is still chairing the EC -- that is, before the end of June -- and it could be signed when Germany takes over the chairmanship. Aleksandr Shokhin, the official head of the Russian delegation at the talks in Brussels, was delayed in the United States by the funeral of Richard Nixon, so that his stay in the "capital of Europe" has been curtailed to just one night. His meeting with Leon Brittan will take place in Moscow where the latter is going on 1 May. [passage omitted] As it deals with global issues, Russia is striving to build relations on a partnership basis; it does not merely ask for help but insists that there should be universal rules, beneficial both to her and to other countries, said Deputy Prime Minister A. Shokhin. "This will be the leitmotiv in our contacts both with the G-7 and with international financial organizations -- not aid in exchange for reforms but creating general mechanisms of interaction between partners," Aleksandr Shokhin stressed.
