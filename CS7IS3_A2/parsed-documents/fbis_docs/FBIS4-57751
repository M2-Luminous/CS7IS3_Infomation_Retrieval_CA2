FBIS4-57751 "drlat100_b_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-100 Daily Report 23 May 1994 Dominican Republic Electoral Board Chief on Possible Runoff Electoral Board Chief on Possible Runoff PA2305211094 Madrid EFE in Spanish 1912 GMT 23 May 94 PA2305211094 Madrid EFE Spanish BFN [Text] Santo Domingo, 23 May (EFE) -- The holding of a runoff election in the Dominican Republic is possible if the opposition Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD) demands it, Manuel Garcia Lizardo, president of the Central Electoral Board (JCE), said today. Nevertheless, the official explained that this proposal has not been presented to the JCE. Last night, President Joaquin Balaguer's primary opposition in the elections, PRD presidential candidate Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, highlighted the need for "a runoff election" as the "most honorable solution" to the Dominican Republic political crisis. According to Pena Gomez, "in all of the world's democratic nations, when the results of a general election are uncertain, a runoff election is held." Garcia Lizado, meanwhile, rejected a PRD request to match the electoral list with the list of voters delivered to each voting table. Faced with the JCE president's refusal, PRD representative Leonor Sanchez Baret responded that her party would not participate in the revision of 9,528 vote tally sheets if the JCE does not first verify the voters lists. The PRD demanded the JCE revise the tally sheets and compare the electoral tables' voters lists with the tribunal's list of voters, given the alleged manipulation or "displacement" [dislocamiento] of names and identification card numbers in favor of Balaguer's ruling party, the Social Christian Reformist Party. In addition, Pena Gomez made accusations of discrepancies between the data issued by the JCE in its bulletins and the information contained on the computer disks given to the parties. The PRD has been making accusations of fraud ever since the 16 May elections, claiming the "displacement" of voters lists, from which allegedly more than 200,000 PRD supporters and their allies of the so called "Santo Domingo Agreement" were excluded. On Thursday, the JCE stopped the election vote count given the PRD and the international observers' demands and pressures. To conclude the vote count, 2.23 percent of the 9,528 electoral tables distributed in Dominican territory still have to be counted. The JCE will also have to review more than 100 "challenged" and annulled votes before issuing the final results of the general elections.
