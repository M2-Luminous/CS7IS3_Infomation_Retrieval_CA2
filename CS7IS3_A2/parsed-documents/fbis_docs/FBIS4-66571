FBIS4-66571 "jpnea021___94002" JPRS-NEA-94-021 JPRS Near East & South Asia 6 April 1994 NEAR EAST ALGERIA FIS Agreement To End `Terrorism' Denied FIS Agreement To End `Terrorism' Denied 94AF0174B Algiers EL WATAN in French 6 Apr 94 p 3 94AF0174B Algiers EL WATAN French CSO [Article by S.B.: "FIS Leaders Deny Pledge To End Terrorism"] [Text] Yesterday Mr. Boukhamkham and Mr. Djeddi, the two FIS [Islamic Salvation Front] leaders freed on 23 February, broke the public silence that they have maintained since then except at certain mosques where, by some accounts, they have preached virulent sermons critical of the regime. Their statement, which came as no surprise to political observers, was clearly triggered by the recent communique from the Algerian presidency accusing leaders of the dissolved FIS of failing to honor commitments they had made to President Liamine Zeroual during a meeting at Blida that was kept secret until only a few days ago. The "internal wing of the FIS" felt obliged to react to the presidential communique, which had put it in an embarrassing position, undercutting its public posture. The regime seems unconcerned about reactions from the armed groups or from FIS spokesmen overseas. What it was watching for was a reaction from the FIS leaders with whom official contacts had been held; thus this communique from two FIS leaders who were "graduates" of Blida was important because it constituted a first response to the authorities' overtures. The freed FIS leaders--acting, it must be assumed, at the behest of their leaders, Abassi Madani and Ali Benhadj--took pains in the communique they sent to AFP yesterday to deny the assertions in the presidency communique. The statement by the FIS leaders leads one to conclude either that the presidency omitted significant details from its description of the meeting between the incarcerated FIS leaders and Mr. Zeroual (who at the time was defense minister for the HCE [Higher State Council]), or that Boukhamkham and Djeddi are deliberately lying in a bid to regain lost ground with the general public, by turning the authorities' own arguments against them: specifically, by alleging that it was the presidency that failed to meet its commitments. First of all, concerning the supposed promise by the incarcerated FIS leaders to issue an appeal to end the violence, as the presidency has asserted: The FIS communique denies making such an offer and maintains that the detained FIS leaders "rejected as premature and ineffective the proposal made by the defense minister, General Liamine Zeroual, for the FIS to urge the people to remain calm and law abiding." Serious Accusations What is important about the statement is not whether the defense minister or FIS leaders were telling the truth--someday the history will come out, perhaps sooner than one might think, since some sources say that recordings were made of the meetings with the FIS--but rather the fact that the FIS admits it is behind the terrorist acts. By denying they had pledged to stop terrorism, the FIS leaders implicitly admitted that they have the capacity to do so--or at least that they feel they do--and claimed credit for the acts of violence. The communique initialed by the two freed FIS leaders says that the only commitment made by their leaders in detention was to "seek a solution that is just and in accordance with the shari'ah, in order to put an end to political and social injustice and spare future generations from sanguinary conflict." It is easy to see, if this statement is analyzed closely, that FIS leaders see a commitment to help restore civil peace as but the final stage of a process that should begin with resolution of the political question, among other things by rehabilitation of the dissolved party and release of all incarcerated FIS leaders. The explicit reference to the shari'ah is a way for FIS leaders to reaffirm their commitment to a vision of society that they have always promoted and that they are not prepared to negotiate away, even from behind prison bars. The FIS communique spells out three conditions for "a political solution to the political crisis and insecurity racking the country." First, "the unconditional release of FIS leaders, because imprisonment is a constraint, and when a man is under constraint he cannot be responsible;" second, "access to full and complete information on the general situation in the country in all its political, economic, social, and security aspects, so it will be possible to design an adequate solution, in accordance with the shari'ah, that will save the country and the people;" and finally, "permission to remain in direct contact and consult widely with the other leaders, since we are all members of one group and cannot make decisions without consulting with our brothers." Observers will have noted that the internal political wing of the FIS has softened its earlier demands: At one time, it demanded nothing less than to come to power via a return to the electoral process and the status quo ante of 26 December 1992. The three conditions posed by the two FIS leaders, with the concurrence of their incarcerated chiefs, mark a significant break with both the intransigence of the armed groups--who respect nothing but brute force--and the increasingly strident extremism of the party leaders in exile. Readers are reminded of the six "commandments" of Rabah Kebir, who demanded not only the release of the FIS leaders and all the imprisoned party militants, but also trials for the country's current leaders and the holding of a dialogue in a neutral country. The question thus arises: Which of the groups has legitimacy--the armed groups, the FIS's internal political wing, or the leadership in exile? The FIS communique also informs us that Mr. Zeroual promised incarcerated FIS leaders the unconditional release of four of the seven leaders held at Blida, the transfer to house arrest of Abassi Madani and Ali Benhadj, and closing of the "security centers" in the south before the end of the month of Ramadhan. Not only were these promises not kept, the communique says, but--an even more serious accusation--also some detainees freed from the camps in the south were killed almost as soon as they returned to their homes. We must certainly expect that within the next few hours the presidency will respond to the allegations in the FIS communique.
