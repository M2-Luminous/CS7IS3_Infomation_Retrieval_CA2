The negotiations--already deadlocked--have become a casualty of the Sino-British fall-out over political reform. "What would help us a great deal is to be in a situation in which we didn't feel as though we're playing darts blindfold in the dark, hoping to hit the bull's-eye," he said. "What would be a help would be if the Chinese side gave precisely what funding arrangements they would regard as acceptable. "These funds would help in the future of the Special Administrative Region (SAR) government the community here in Hong Kong and for the railway and the airport itself." Patten voiced concern that the airport negotiations were becoming bogged down by obscure political bickering and he again urged the Chinese to return to the negotiating table. "We could rapidly resolve all that I would have hoped in the airport committee if the will was there." It is now unlikely the airport project will be completed by mid- 1997, but rather months after the transfer of sovereignty. "Instead of offering one another advice across the airwaves, we should actually do what people in Hongkong would like us to do which is to resolve these questions around the table," he said.
