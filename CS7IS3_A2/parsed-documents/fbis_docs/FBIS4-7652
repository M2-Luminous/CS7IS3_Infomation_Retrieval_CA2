FBIS4-7652 "dreeu064__a94007" FBIS-EEU-94-064-A Daily Report 1 Apr 1994 ANNEX Bulgaria Suggests Early Elections in Nov Suggests Early Elections in Nov AU0104161594 Sofia BTA in English 1517 GMT 1 Apr 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU0104161594 Sofia BTA English BFN [Text] Sofia, April 1 (BTA) -- President Zhelyu Zhelev suggested that the political forces sign an agreement scheduling elections for November at a meeting today with representatives of the New Union for Democracy (NSD) and the Alliance for Democracy (SD). Both groups consist of MP's who split off from the Union of Democratic Forces (SDS). It would be inappropriate to set a time limit for the elections, Khristo Ivanov MP [member of parliament] of NSD told the press after the meeting. According to him, parliament should first pass the minimum of laws essential to the reform. The representatives of NSD and SD told the president that his idea of a government supported by the SDS, the ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights and Freedoms and NSD would be almost impracticable. This depends above all on the SDS which is not ripe for this move yet, said Ivan Pushkarov MP of the SD. Besides, the SDS leadership has confirmed its decision not to take part in a new government elected by the present parliament. The MP's of the NSD suggested that Lyuben Berov's government be given one more chance. The prime minister should spell out his plans for raising the cabinet's efficiency and for structural changes. The alternative would be to re-launch the procedure of giving each parliamentary force a mandate to form a government and when it is our turn, we will propose an all-NSD government, Khristo Ivanov said. According to NSD, the Union of Democratic Forces would refuse to enter a coalition government and the NSD would not like to form a coalition with the other parliamentary groups. The participants in the meeting told the press to expect further talks with the president. Speaking to BTA about reports in today's press that President Zhelev offered the premiership to SDS floor leader Stefan Savov, the President's Press Office said it would make no comment on misinformers' reports.
