Guangdong has also seen its electric power output leaping to first place in the whole country this year. Since 1991 the provincial government has allocated about six million yuan a year to help provide and rebuild electric power facilities in remote rural areas. During the past few years Guangdong has actively absorbed foreign investment and raised funds through different channels to develop its power industry. The total installed capacity had reached ten million kw by the end of 1992, and an increase of about 3 million kw to 4 million kw is expected this year.
