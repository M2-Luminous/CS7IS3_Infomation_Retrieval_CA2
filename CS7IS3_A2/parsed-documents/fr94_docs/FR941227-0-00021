FR941227-0-00021 FR941227-0-00005 Organizations whose proposals were not selected for funding in 1993 and organizations submitting new proposals are not immediately affected by this action because they will not receive funding in this fiscal year. Also, these organizations will have the opportunity to comment on the interim rule because their comments will be considered before any truly new money could be distributed in the fiscal year 1996. Only $3,000,000 was appropriated for this program for the fiscal year 1994, and $2,995,000 for the fiscal year 1995. The same amount may not be appropriated in subsequent years. However, it is the Agency's expectation that funds will be appropriated for this program either as a separate item or as part of the general appropriations for the Agency in the future years. Therefore, the interim rule establishes guidelines for administering the program for future years. Program Description 1. The regulation being developed embodies the content of the original notice, published on July 2, 1993. The interested parties are fully aware of the procedures and standards intended for this program. 2. The program's objective is to reverse, through the use of the Outreach Training and Technical Assistance Program, the decline of socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers across the United States. •This outcome will be reached by encouraging and assisting socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers to own and operate their own farms, participate in agricultural programs, and become an integral part of the agricultural community. •The recipients of these grants will provide services to socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers and small farmers through outreach training and technical assistance in farm and ranch management, recordkeeping, marketing techniques and in testing innovative solutions to existing or anticipated issues or problems they may encounter. Under the interim rule, CFSA will solicit proposals, and five-year plans to be funded on a competitive basis. The solicitation is encouraged from community-based organizations, 1890 Land Grant colleges, including Tuskegee University, Indian Tribal Community Colleges and Alaska Native cooperative colleges, Hispanic serving post-secondary educational institutions, and other post-secondary educational institutions with demonstrated experience in providing agriculture education or other agricultural related services to socially disadvantaged family farmers and ranchers in their region. The proposals will be evaluated by a panel of Agency technical experts to determine which proposals are most meritorious. The panel of Agency technical experts are necessary to evaluate what is expected to be a variety of very technical proposals. The evaluation panel will make recommendations to the appropriate Agency official to be forwarded to the Agency Head, who will consult with, if necessary, the Secretary of USDA before a final decision on awarding the grants or cooperative agreements is made. To assure a consistency in the evaluation process the interim rule establishes a set of evaluation criteria to assure the proposal is consistent with the intent of the program and is worth the funds that are to be spent on the project. The accounting for the funds awarded for the cooperative or other agreement will be subject to the normal rules for such agreements within USDA as given in part 3016 of this title. The proposed application format is used to assure that sufficient information is obtained to complete an agreement as given in part 3016 of this title. In addition, the application format is similar to that used by other USDA Agencies for their competitive grants programs. List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 1943 Credit, Loan Programs_Agriculture.
