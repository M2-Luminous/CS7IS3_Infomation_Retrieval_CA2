FR940512-2-00101 FR940512-2-00055 23. A Plan will be allowed to discontinue its Account on 15 days' notice at any time, effective as of the last trading day of the month, except on the Scheduled Account Termination Date or a Scheduled Account Distribution Date. 4 On discontinuance, the market value of the Account will be distributed to the Plan, subject to a ``Discontinuance Charge''. Like the Book Value Assurance Charge (see rep. 16, above), the Discontinuance Charge will be equal to a specified percentage of the Adjusted Book Value of the Account determined by agreement between Hartford Life and the Plan and specified in the Synthetic GIC, but will not be greater than the excess of the market value of the Account over the Adjusted Book Value on the date of discontinuance nor less than zero. 4 Hartford Life determined not to provide for discontinuance of its Synthetic GIC as of a Scheduled Account Distribution Date for administrative reasons. If discontinuance were permitted as of Scheduled Account Distribution Dates, it would be necessary to allocate the assets liquidated on that date between the assets supporting the Scheduled Account Distribution, with respect to which the Plan would be entitled to Adjusted Book Value, and other assets, as to which the Plan would be entitled to fair market value. Hartford Life concluded that this would be unduly burdensome. Allowing the Plan to discontinue the Synthetic GIC on Scheduled Account Distribution Dates seems unnecessary, since the Synthetic GIC can be discontinued at the end of the previous month or at the end of the following month if appropriate. Accordingly, a Plan will be free to give notice of discontinuance of the arrangement and realize its investment return from its Account (subject to the Discontinuance Charge) at any time up to 45 days before the Scheduled Account Termination Date. For example, if the Plan determines that the return generated by HIMCO's investment management net of the Discontinuance Charge is more valuable than Hartford Life's guarantee, the Plan will be able to realize that return through the discontinuance provision. 24. Under its Synthetic GICs, Hartford Life will be entitled to a quarterly fee based on a percentage of the average Adjusted Book Value of the assets in the Account for the current quarter. This percentage will be established by agreement with each Plan and will be specified in writing. Out of its quarterly fee, Hartford Life will pay HIMCO a quarterly management fee which will also be specified in writing. No separate fee will be paid directly to HIMCO. HIMCO will have the right to withdraw from the Account certain expenses incurred directly in the investment management of the Account. Any such expenses withdrawn directly from the Account by HIMCO are not subtracted from the adjusted book value of the Account. 25. Hartford Life will keep full and complete records and books of account reflecting all transactions of each Plan's Account and will make them available on an annual basis for audit by independent certified public accountants selected by and responsible to the Plan. Hartford Life will also furnish annual reports of the operations of the Account containing a list of the investments of the Account to an independent fiduciary of the Plan. 26. To summarize, the applicants represent that the Synthetic GIC is fundamentally a guaranteed investment contract. A Plan will place specified assets in the Account, and on the Scheduled Account Distribution Dates and the Scheduled Account Termination Date, Hartford Life will repay the Plan its principal plus interest at a guaranteed rate, in exchange for the asset value of the Account (in cash or in kind). Thus, the fundamental nature of the Synthetic GIC is equivalent to that of the conventional GICs which have funded employee benefit plans for many years. With the Synthetic GIC, the Plan is afforded a higher degree of security because the assets underlying the Synthetic GIC will be held in a custodial bank account owned by the Plan and will not become part of the insurance company's assets. In addition, the Synthetic GIC will offer the Plan a limited opportunity to realize a return in excess of the Guaranteed Rate of Interest. This will occur if the market value of the Account on the Scheduled Account Termination Date exceeds the sum of the Adjusted Book Value of the Account and the Book Value Assurance Charge. The Plan will also have the option of discontinuing the arrangement if it believes that the market value of the assets in the Account (less the Discontinuance Charge) is more valuable than Hartford Life's guarantee. The applicants represent that it is not very likely that such an excess return will occur, because the assets in the Account will be managed with the intention of achieving the guaranteed return. In this regard, the applicants represent that on the Scheduled Account Termination Date, the assets will consist primarily of fixed-income securities at or near maturity with predictable values. Nevertheless, the Plan enjoys downside protection through Hartford Life's guarantee, and also has an opportunity to realize a return in excess of the Guaranteed Rate of Return. 27. In summary, the applicants represent that the proposed transactions will satisfy the criteria contained in section 408(a) of the Act for the following reasons: (a) the decision to enter into a Synthetic GIC will be made on behalf of a Plan by a fiduciary of the Plan who is independent of Hartford Life and HIMCO, after receipt of full and detailed disclosure of all material features of the contract, including all applicable fees and charges; (b) the guaranteed return to the Plan cannot be modified by the proposed transactions; (c) all fees and charges imposed under the Synthetic GIC will be reasonable; (d) each Synthetic GIC will specifically provide for determinations of the market value of the securities by an objective means of valuation; (e) Hartford Life will maintain books and records of all transactions which will be subject to annual audit by independent certified public accountants selected by and responsible solely to the Plan; and (f) the Synthetic GIC will be offered only in principal amounts of $50 million or more, so that the Plan fiduciaries can be expected to be knowledgeable, sophisticated professional asset managers.
