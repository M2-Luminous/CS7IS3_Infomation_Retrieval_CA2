FR941103-0-00023 FR941103-0-00005 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 71 [Docket No. 27297; Amendment No. 71&hyph;25] Amendment to the South Florida Low Offshore Airspace Area AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Technical amendment. SUMMARY: This action amends the description of the South Florida Low airspace area to exclude the airspace within the Grand Bahama terminal control area (TCA) and the Nassau TCA. At the present time, the South Florida Low airspace area is correctly depicted on aeronautical charts as excluding the airspace of the underlying Grand Bahama and Nassau TCAs. However, the current airspace description of this airspace area is erroneous in that it inadvertently includes the Grand Bahamas and the Nassau TCAs as part of the South Florida Low airspace area. This action corrects this error. EFFECTIVE DATE: November 3, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Reginald C. Matthews, ATP&hyph;230, Air Traffic Rules Branch, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20591, telephone (202) 267&hyph;8783. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The Offshore Airspace Reconfiguration Final Rule published March 2, 1993 (58 FR 12128), amended the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR), in pertinent part, by designating additional control areas as offshore airspace areas or en route domestic airspace areas. The offshore areas were divided into high and low areas and an effort was made to establish a uniform floor of controlled airspace for certain air traffic operations. Through that rule, the South Florida control area was revised and redesignated as the South Florida Low offshore airspace area. The rule also extended the airspace of the South Florida Low airspace area from 2,700 feet mean sea level (MSL) up to, but not including, 18,000 feet MSL. The lateral boundaries of the South Florida Low were further revised, by amendment (58 FR 33907; June 22, 1993), to extend from latitude 28 ○00 ’00 ’ ’ North to latitude 34 ○00 ’00 ’ ’ North. However, both amendments to the South Florida Low airspace area inadvertently included the underlying airspace within the Grand Bahama TCA and the Nassau TCA, both of which have airspace segments extending above 2,700 feet MSL. The South Florida Low is correctly depicted on aeronautical charts as excluding the airspace of the underlying TCAs. However, the airspace description does not reflect this exclusion as was intended.
