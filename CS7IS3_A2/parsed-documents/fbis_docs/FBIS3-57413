"An economic coup is taking place in the country", Fedorov said in a statement on Wednesday. "Boris Nikolayevich, we pin all our hopes on you. The question is not in Fedorov, the question concerns the fate of the country which is being determined in these days, in these hours. I hope that nobody has illusions that economy can be separated from politics", Fedorov said addressing the president. The new government is now dominated by "red industrialists" who doom the country to an inevitable collapse and the people to decreasing living standards, Fedorov warned. "All this contradicts many official government documents for which I voted and for which a fought with former Supreme Soviet the dreams of which are now being implemented. All this contradicts the course of the president confirmed only several days ago", Fedorov said. Fedorov denied claims that his resignation was prompted by personal ambitions and dislike of Central bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko and deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Zaveryukha. "My position has nothing in common with personal reasons", he said and explained that he resigned because "it is inadmissible that people who had inflicted colossal economic and political damage to the state, who are resolute and open opponents of the course of reforms, keep their positions in the government". "I cannot agree with the turn in the policy which has been publicly formulated by the prime minister of late and which is being implemented", he added. This policy consists, according to Fedorov, in backtracking from anti-inflation work, in increasing money printing and in the fact that the government is dominated by "a lifeless and incompetent ideology". Fedorov said that the government is now raising the inflation rate planned for the end of 1994 to 8-9 per cent compared to the earlier target of 3-5 per cent. "This means that instead of the annual inflation rate of 80 per cent we are being offered at least 300 per cent. The gap is too big. Moreover, it will be several times bigger in reality", Fedorov warned. "The Ukranization has crossed the Russian border", Fedorov said, referring to the deep economic crisis and skyrocketing inflation in Ukraine. There is no alternative to the policy of reform and "we shall soon see that in reality", he added. Sidetracking from the course of financial stabilisation will boost inflation, decrease real incomes of the population, collapse the exchange rate of the rouble to 10,000 at the end of the year, devaluate savings, restore shortages of goods, trigger exodus of capital to the West, isolate Russia from world markets, according to Fedorov. "At the same time there will be no rise in production, no investments, no solution of unemployment problem. This is a way to a deadend at the expense of the people", Fedorov said predicting that the threat of a social upheaval becomes a reality. However, it is not yet late to stop backtracking from reforms, Fedorov said and urged the president to do that.
