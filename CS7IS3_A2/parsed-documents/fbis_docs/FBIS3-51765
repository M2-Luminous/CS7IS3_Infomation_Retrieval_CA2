In an exclusive interview with PRENSA LATINA, Juan Contino, the first secretary of the national UJC said there are new paths toward knowledge opening up for the world's younger generations, especially young people in Latin America, the Caribbean, Europe, and the socialist countries (China, Vietnam, and North Korea). The youth leader welcomed the international demonstrations of solidarity and support received from all corners of the world, particularly those from people speaking out against the U.S. blockade of the island at public forums, even within the United States itself. He said that many young friends of Cuba are launching an offensive to disseminate information all over the world regarding the democratic system on the island and its respect for human rights in an effort to counter the smear campaigns promoted by the enemies of the revolution. He noted there has been a recent increase in examples of solidarity toward the Caribbean country's people in the form of events, demonstrations, and other means of dissemination, as well as in the form of assorted donations, particularly to contribute to the education effort. Contino, who is also a member of the Central Committee, highlighted the fact that 334 youngsters belonging to 15 international labor brigades visited the island in 1993. These individuals paid their own way and worked in the fields at the Paraiso Youth Camp in Havana Province, just outside this capital city. Contino said activities similar to those carried out on the island to commemorate and support the Cuban sociopolitical system are currently being organized in 15 nations on the occasion of the 35th anniversary of the triumph of the revolution headed by Fidel Castro. These activities have been blessed "by Cuba forever." He said that groups of youth leaders are going to various parts of the world and will participate in festivities in countries such as Colombia, Mexico, Brazil, Spain, France, Italy, Portugal, and Vietnam, among others. The 33-year-old economist, who has seven years of experience as a youth leader, expressed his gratitude to youth and student organizations, associations, and entities from throughout the world for making it possible for the UJC to expand its contacts and exchange programs abroad during the current difficult situation. Contino said the 550,000 UJC militants who represent Cuba's 3.1 million young people are making efforts to deserve the esteem of friends from other countries and are giving foremost attention to their work in the edification of the Cuban socialist system. The UJC is a selective organization that embodies the vanguard of the Cuban youth sector and has affiliates in all sectors of the island's social and economic life. The roots of this organization are in the country's secondary schools and universities. The UJC was founded on 4 April 1961. Hundreds of thousands of Cubans have been members of it -- in particular, many current leaders of the Communist Party of Cuba. According to Contino, the UJC views itself as the party's best quarry for talent -- one that shapes people who continue the tradition.
