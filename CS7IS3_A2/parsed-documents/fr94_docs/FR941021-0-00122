FR941021-0-00122 FR941021-0-00020 (8) Unless described in the application and funded in the approved awards, the subaward, transfer or contracting out of any work under an award. This provision does not apply to the purchase of supplies, material, equipment or general support services. (d) No other prior approval requirements for specific items may be imposed unless a deviation has been approved in accordance with ยง600.4. (e) Except for requirements listed in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(4) of this section, program regulations may waive cost-related and administrative prior written approvals required by this Subpart and its Appendices. Such waivers may include authorizing recipients to do any one or more of the following. (1) Incur pre-award costs 90 calendar days prior to award without prior approval or more than 90 calendar days with the prior approval of DOE. All pre-award costs are incurred at the recipient's risk (i.e., DOE is under no obligation to reimburse such costs if for any reason the recipient does not receive an award or if the award is less than anticipated and inadequate to cover such costs). (2) Initiate a one-time extension of the expiration date of the final budget period of the project of up to 12 months unless one or more of the following conditions apply. (i) The terms and conditions of award prohibit the extension. (ii) The extension requires additional Federal funds. (iii) The extension involves any change in the approved objectives or scope of the project. (iv) The extension is being exercised merely for the purpose of using unobligated balances. For one-time extensions, the recipient must notify the DOE in writing with the supporting reasons and revised expiration date at least 10 days before the expiration date specified in the award. (3) Carry forward unobligated balances to subsequent funding periods. (4) For awards that support research, unless the terms and conditions of award provide otherwise, the prior approval requirements described in paragraph (e) of this section are automatically waived (i.e., recipients need not obtain such prior approvals) unless one of the conditions included in ยง600.125(e)(2) applies. (5) For continuation awards within a multiple year project in support of research, prior to receipt of continuation funding, preaward expenditures by recipients are not subject to the limitation or approval requirements of ยง600.125(e)(1). Nevertheless, incurrence by the recipient does not impose any obligation on DOE if a continuation award is not subsequently made, or if an award is made for a lesser amount than the recipient expected. (f) Program regulations may restrict the transfer of funds among direct cost categories or programs, functions and activities for awards in which DOE's share of the project exceeds $100,000 and the cumulative amount of such transfers exceeds or is expected to exceed 10 percent of the total budget as last approved by DOE. However, no program regulation shall permit a transfer that would cause any Federal appropriation or part thereof to be used for purposes other than those consistent with the original intent of the appropriation. (g) All other changes to nonconstruction budgets, except for the changes described in paragraph (j) of this section, do not require prior approval. (h) For construction awards, recipients shall request prior written approval promptly from the Contracting Officer for budget revisions whenever paragraph (h) (1), (2) or (3) of this section apply. (1) The revision results from changes in the scope or the objective of the project or program. (2) The need arises for additional Federal funds to complete the project. (3) A revision is desired which involves specific costs for which prior written approval requirements may be imposed consistent with applicable OMB cost principles listed in ยง600.127.
