And of course I find it amusing (to be Minister of Home Affairs) in view of the fact that the former government took away my passport for nine years and I am now in charge of the passports! On the question of immigration: [Buthelezi] The second challenge (to the portfolio) is that it has immigration as one of its segments ... in the past there was discrimination...people from Europe were allowed to come here more easily than black people from other countries. Now already there are Africans from some of the southern African countries or even from central Africa coming in here in the hope of getting a job. How does one deal with that? The handling seems to me to be a very sensitive thing because the needs of South Africans are so vast...charity begins at home, while (at the same time Africans) are our brothers and sisters. Last week I had lunch with bankers from Switzerland, and one said he had never heard so much French spoken in South Africa. That really indicates what is going on now. On his experience with the new Cabinet: [Buthelezi] I find that the cordiality (among) all of us is really quite something because, to be quite honest, I sit there facing some people who have really been vilifying me -- but I have no animosity towards them and we joke. From that point of view I think it is some kind of a miracle, really. On the Reconstruction and Development Programme [RDP]: [Buthelezi] I think it (the RDP) is one of the best (pieces of) writing I have ever seen. On the face of it, it has many platitudes which no one would have any problem about. And also as far as our economic policy is concerned there are many things (in the RDP) which are the same. But my worry is: can one deliver from the point of view of the fiscus? I have expressed this concern in Cabinet, because the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] does not like too much intervention by the State in the economy. But we are doing the best (we can) together, we are co-operating. We'll try to do the best to deliver in terms of it. On the RDP and the Province: [Buthelezi] Responding to the President's speech I did state my own feeling about deliver -- that unless these things are delivered on the ground, and they can only be delivered on the ground by the provinces, (not much will be accomplished). That's why I have been fighting all along for the autonomy of provinces. On the Melamet Commission's recommendations: [Buthelezi] From the point of view of our people, black people, I would say that they (the salaries) are too high. (But) most of the perks are now no longer there. There used to be a lot of perks for other Ministers. On the transfer of land to the Ingonyama Trust: [Buthelezi] The issue that I thought might ruin the Government of National Unity [GNU] was this thing of the Ingonyama Land Trust. But the way it was handled by President Mandela himself, and also by Minister Derek Hanekom and those other colleagues who were in that (Cabinet) committee was such that, really, I was pleasantly surprised. Because it seemed to me that they went out of their way to ensure that it didn't ruin the GNU. On whether IFP structures continue to function: [Buthelezi] There is the issue of local elections, and I don't think we should be caught flat-footed if and when that comes. So, in fact, when I was addressing a victory rally in Umlazi last weekend I stressed that we need to put our structures in order. I was very unhappy with our structures. On mediation: [Buthelezi] Well, there are some very good things in it (the Interim Constitution), but I still say it is a flawed constitution. And I'm still very concerned that the agreement, on the basis of which I went into the election be implemented -- that immediately afterwards there should be international mediation on the issue of the king and the kingdom. One must set that ball rolling because I think that once the Constitutional Assembly starts moving it would be impossible to then have international mediation. We most definitely still want that mediation. I think, for instance, in terms of the RDP, I cannot see that we can deliver on the ground if we are as centrist as the constitution is at present. So, I would really want that changed in the constitution. And I was not quite happy with the way (legislation on the Constitutional Court was (handled). I rally do believe that if we want to deliver, it is really essential (that we have true federalism). And I was very interested in the meeting that Mr Mandela asked me to attend with premiers, because I could see that the very bright people who are premiers all over the place want to get on with the job with the job to deliver. And that means power. It means regional powers. One of them (ANC premiers) even joked with me and said: "Why did you fight this issue alone for so long?" On the election atmosphere: [Buthelezi] In fact, it was a miracle. People queued up together, whether they were ANC, IFP, PAC [Pan Africanist Congress] or anything, and there was no animosity or anyone taunting anyone else. It was extraordinary, and I was pleasantly surprised. On violence levels now: [Buthelezi] Unfortunately, even if the media does not highlight it, there is a lot of political killing going on even ow. In fact, last weekend one of my first cousins was burying his son in Mandeni, and I know of quite a number of people who have died since the election, some of them prominent leaders of the IFP. On what can be done to finally eradicate violence: [Buthelezi] I said (in a recent speech) that it is wonderful we have got our liberation, but I (also) said there is a dark cloud because the state of emergency is still on the KwaZulu/Natal, and I resent that very much because I didn't think that it should have been imposed. On whether he has raised the issue with Mandela: [Buthelezi] Let me share with you an informal conversation we had with him. In Parliament we were standing in the Assembly with some of my colleagues, and he came over to our side. One of our leaders raised this issue, and he (Mandela) said: "No, no, no, that we will discuss with Shenge [Buthelezi's tribal name]." He said it was a matter between us. But, of course, I don't blame President Mandela that he hasn't (yet) done so. He is a very busy person. On his relationship with Mandela: [Buthelezi] President Mandela has always been very affable. I defer to Madiba [Mandela] (because he is older than me). He has said things which have hurt me, but I have never responded in kind because for me, even before he was President, he is still mnewethu [my brother], he is older than me and I respect that. In spite of all those things that have hurt me, when we are together this warmth surfaces. On his relationship with F W de Kerk: [Buthelezi] I wouldn't say that we are close, but I think we behave towards each other like civilized men, if I may put it that way. On the possibility of a future IFP/NP [National Party] alliance: [Buthelezi] Well, I haven't thought of that. The betrayal (by De Klerk and his government) came up on issues like federation. He and his party say they also believe in a federal formula for this country but in terms of delivery, when it came to negotiating with the ANC on a trilateral basis, there was no evidence of that. And that's what, really, brought about the mistrust between us. On pressure on him to enter the election: [Buthelezi] My good friend, Chancellor (Helmut) Kohl invited me to Germany. I have very high regard for Chancellor Kohl, and after I had explained my position, he had no problem. But then when I went to see his Minister of Foreign Affairs who belongs to another party ... it was quite an acrimonious discussion, on the basis that he was now seeing me as the fly in the ointment, as the person who was blocking things from happening. From there I went to Copenhagen, invited by the Foreign Minister there, and it was the same kind of thing. And also my last meeting with the Prime Minister of Britain, (John) Major, wasn't very cordial. I didn't know him as well as Lady Thatcher who really became a friend of mine. But I actually didn't blame them myself. I blame the diplomats as a whole. In fact, the American ambassador went out of his way to write me a very long letter, which personally I wouldn't have thought an ambassador should write. On whether his international relations have improved: [Buthelezi] It is still too early to judge, but there have been a number of ambassadors who have come here paying respects or just coming to see me in my new capacity. On whether foreign pressure influenced him: [Buthelezi] No. In fact, whenever there were those discussions abroad, I always said to them: you don't have to live with it, I have to live with it, which they didn't like very much. I said that whereas I don't question the fact that they have a right to advise and to help and so on, they are not South Africans and in the final analysis I have to live with the results of what they were asking me to do. On when people's standard of living will improve: [Buthelezi] You are asking a very painful question because I don't believe that however much we try -- and it's wrong, perhaps, for me as a Minister to say so -- but I don't think that in terms of the promises of the election and the expectations which have arisen as a result of those promises, that we can deliver in terms of those promises. I hope it doesn't create disillusionment. On the possibility of an election before 1999: [Buthelezi] I have said that people must prepare for an election. If you look in the histories of many countries of majority parties, when they cannot deliver sometimes they call an election before there is too much disillusionment. On the IFP's election performance: [Buthelezi] If you look at the vote I had and, of course, if you look at the malpractices as well which robbed us of many votes, even I was surprised. Not that I didn't know that people supported me. It was not even (only) in the so-called Zulu areas that I got the vote, but in many parts of South Africa. If I had campaigned, It seems that I have a right to say I would have done very well. I don't say I would have been elected as the government, but I would have done far better if I had campaigned. On allegations of tensions within the IFP: [Buthelezi] It was a figment, really, of the imagination. There was no such a thing at all. But I think that there were some Members of Parliament that we had inherited that were keen to maintain their careers, and they were the ones who were feeding this to the press, (probably) to put pressure on me. On criticism of IFP `hardliners': [Buthelezi] Dr (Mario) Ambrosini even now is very close to me, not because he gives me political advice at all, but because of his expertise as an international constitutional lawyer. He is a very clever and competent person in that field. Mr (Walter) Felgate has worked with me for nearly 20 years now. This (criticism) of course was also fed to the press by the government itself. Also, it is a racist idea that if any white person is close to you, then he is your adviser in a sense that he is a guru to you. For an old man like myself who has been in politics for more than 40 years, to say that either Felgate or Ambrosini then became my gurus, really, is laughable to me. On whether pre-election pressure on him took its toll on his health: [Buthelezi] I really don't know. My mother, who died at the age of 84, had a very strong constitution. I only say, perhaps, I must have inherited my mother's constitution. But many people say I am abusing it because of the pace at which I work, and the way I work until late at night. I think that the pressure I was under was such that I even marvel myself when some of the doctors examine me wand say how low my blood pressure is, how normal it is. On people's expectations: [Buthelezi] I can only echo what President Mandela has said. Our people, the South African nation, must really understand that we do mean to deliver -- even those of us who are not members of the ANC. We do mean to co-operate with the ANC in the Government to deliver. But even he, President Mandela, has said that these things can't be delivered instantly. One must warn the nation that in terms of the vast needs, and the extent to which the economy itself was damaged by disinvestment and other things, people should just be a little patient with us. They should not really look to the Government to do it (alone), but to the Government to do it with them. I believe the twin pillars are self-help and self-reliance.
