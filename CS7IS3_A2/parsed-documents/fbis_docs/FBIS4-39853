Practice showed, Nikolayev said, that in the runup to, and during, the negotiations the opposition would try to do a bit of muscle-flexing and put pressure on Dushanbe. In addition, he said, the opposition's negotiating team might fail to control, in full measure, the opposition's field commanders. A third force could instigate fighting and he who paid, Nikolayev said, would want an interest on his investment. Nikolayev withheld his view of the possibility of agreement between the opposition and those who were holding power in Dushanbe. He said, nonetheless, that agreement was possible if both sides came to put the people's interests above their own. Nikolayev admitted that Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan failed to meet, in full measure, their pledge to protect Tajikistan's external border.
