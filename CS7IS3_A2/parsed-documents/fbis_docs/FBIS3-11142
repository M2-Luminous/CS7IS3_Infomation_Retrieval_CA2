Radio Rebelde at 0000 GMT on 16 March reports that (Miguel Marul), president of the Executive Committee of the People's Government in the municipality of the Isle of Youth, has departed for Italy, which maintains close relations with our country and especially with the Isle of Youth. (Marul) said that the objective of his trip is to establish cooperation agreements and relations of friendship with Bologna and Capri. Radio Reloj at 2034 GMT on 16 March reports that protocols have been signed making sister cities of Matanzas and Leon, Spain. Cuba Vision Network at 2320 GMT on 16 March reports that a group of 20 managers and experts from Canadian mining companies has toured geologic and mining areas of Matanzas, Pinar del Rio, Havana, Santiago de Cuba, Holguin, Camaguey, and Villa Clara Provinces looking into investment potential. The tour falls within the activities prior to the annual convention of Canadian prospectors and was organized by the firm (Carib-Gold) and Cuba's (Geominera S.A.). The president of (Carib-Gold) expressed satisfaction with the results of the visit, as well as great optimism, saying in English: "I think it is inevitable we will have more business with Cuba." He added: "Up to now we have had only smaller companies that are willing to take higher risks and invest in Cuba, but I think that this trip is showing there is now an interest from some of the major international mining companies." Six Canadian mining companies are working in Cuba, and another two will begin work in Villa Clara. Radio Rebelde at 0000 GMT on 17 March reports that the Sergio Perez Castillo fertilizer mixer plant in Holguin has been 70-percent repaired with the purpose of recovering the maximum capacity of 500 tons daily. Current investments to recover production in Holguin surpass 700,000 pesos. In the same newscast, Rebelde reports from Camaguey that bad road conditions in the country have prompted national and provincial experts to exchange ideas and experience in the use of alternative materials in repaving and repairing roads. It reported that Cuba has 14,000 km of paved roads, not counting urban and perimeter areas, and that because the distribution of asphalt has been reduced since 1989, Cuban crude oil is being used in the asphalt mixture, with solid experience obtained in Matanzas and Villa Clara. Radio Rebelde adds that Cuba received almost 250,000 tourists last year as a result of Cubanacan operations. This represents almost 40 percent of the foreign tourists visiting the country. These operations have brought some $96 million to the country, although financial contributions by other tourist companies, such as civil aviation, have increased this figure to $700 million. Cubanacan's manager said that tourism activity in 1994 will surely meet Cuba's goal of 30,000 rooms to shelter 1 million tourists, who would leave $1 billion in the country. In the same newscast, Rebelde reports that Chinese Ambassador to Cuba Xu Yicong has delivered a donation of clothing and school supplies for the municipalities of Arroyo Naranjo and Playa. Pedro Chavez, president of the Havana Provincial Assembly, and other local officials were present at the ceremony. The Chinese ambassador said that this donation is a contribution of the embassy personnel to the country's efforts in these difficult times. Radio Progreso at 1200 GMT on 17 March reports that the breakdown of one of the generators of the Carlos Manuel de Cespedes thermoelectric plant in Cienfuegos has caused blackouts in the capital and other parts of the country, including some circuits not usually affected because of the existence of food processing plants or other establishments of priority importance. Extreme efforts are being made in this plant to restore the supply of electricity as soon as possible. In the same newscast, Progreso reports that Sugar Industry Minister Nelson Torres Perez has noted the importance of the current stage for sugar production. Speaking on behalf of the coordination and support group and of the commander in chief, he stressed the crucial need to increase production and to defend efficiency. Progreso adds that workers of the petroleum drilling and extraction company in the municipality of Cardenas in Matanzas have promised to extract approximately 1 million tons of crude oil this year. Engineer Marcos Aguilera, company director, said they intend to produce 230,000 tons by the end of March, which is 28,000 tons more than the current plan. Last year the company produced 815,000 tons of crude, or 158,000 tons more than in 1992. Radio Rebelde at 1000 GMT on 17 March reports that workers of the 1 de Mayo Industrial Gas Plant in Havana are working hard to put the generator back into operation with a greater capacity to stabilize the production of oxygen, nitrogen, argon, and compressed air. The main fractionating line of 550 cubic meters daily broke down at the end of last year. While repairs are under way, workers are performing complete maintenance on the plant. In the same newscast, Rebelde reports that cane cutters from the transport union in Havana Province have reached their objective of cutting 1 million arrobas of cane in tribute to the 116th anniversary of the Baragua protest.
