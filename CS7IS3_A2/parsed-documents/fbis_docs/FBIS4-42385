As DPA learned on Friday [3 June] from well-informed sources, the plutonium arrived in Germany by "a roundabout route." From the Russian capital it was first brought to Hungary and Switzerland. So far, no further details are known. The highly radioactive heavy metal was discovered on 10 May during the search of the apartment of a businessman in Tengen near Konstanz in the course of investigating a case of money laundering. The businessman is in detention pending trial. Experts say that this is the first case of smuggling weapons-grade plutonium that has been uncovered in Germany. [passage omitted]
