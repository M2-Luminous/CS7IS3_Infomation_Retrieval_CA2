Speaking at a news conference today, Ataman expressed Turkey's belief that it is necessary to sign a comprehensive international treaty banning nuclear experiments, which have many environmental, health, and security drawbacks from the viewpoint of the future of humanity. Ataman said: We regret to learn that the PRC has, in the last few days, conducted another nuclear experiment when work on a treaty banning nuclear experiments is gaining momentum and when countries with nuclear capabilities are taking steps to make their unilateral decisions to halt these experiments permanent. Turkey believes in the necessity of signing a comprehensive international treaty -- which will be a significant complementary factor in helping the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty attain its goals -- banning nuclear experiments, which have many environmental, health, and security drawbacks from the viewpoint of the future of humanity. Turkey further notes that it is doing all it can on the issue and finds it beneficial to stress that it is deeply concerned and displeased about any kind of behavior that might endanger the promising work being accomplished on this path.
