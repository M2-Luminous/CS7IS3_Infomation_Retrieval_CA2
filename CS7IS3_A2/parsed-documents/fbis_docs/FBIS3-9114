President Tudjman's letter was published in New York as an official document of the Security Council under S/1994/305. The letter is quoted in its entirety: ``On 31 March 1994 the existing mandate of the UNPROFOR will expire, leaving the Security Council with the option of extending if for an additional period of six months. The Republic of Croatia praises the UN soldiers and civilian personnel for all of the efforts they have made in their difficult mission of peace in Croatia. We are grateful for their devoted humanitarian effort, which has helped many citizens of Croatia, and we deeply regret the casualties which the international forces have suffered in their brave task. "The Republic of Croatia is once again ready to accept prolongation of the UNPROFOR mandate on its territory, considering the pivotal role of UNPROFOR in the overall process. However, in making its final decision regarding the renewal of the UNPROFOR mandate, the Government of Croatia must raise the question of the necessity of improving UNPROFOR's performance. Full implementation of all relevant Security Council resolutions remains the most essential, yet still unfulfilled, task of UNPROFOR. With more than 16,000 UN peace-keeping troops deployed in Croatia, and considering the precise goals inscribed in the Vance plan (S/23280, annex III), it is difficult to accept the inefficiency of UNPROFOR performance in Croatia. The uncooperative and hostile behavior of militant Serbian insurgents in the UN Protected Areas (UNPAs) certainly is a cause of considerable difficulties for UNPROFOR, but they should not be permitted to impede the implementation of any Security Council resolutions. Security Council Resolution No. 871 (1993) of 4 October 1993 remains the foundation for any future UNPROFOR action in Croatia, as well as the overall framework for initiating the process of the peaceful reintegration of the UNPAs into the legal and economic system of the Republic of Croatia. Croatia stresses in particular the importance of paragraphs 4 and 5 of Security Council Resolution No. 871 (1993). "The full normalization of the position of the international community toward the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) must be preconditioned on the sincere cooperation of its government in the full and prompt implementation of the UN peace-keeping plan for the Republic of Croatia. This includes the provisions of the plan concerning the demilitarization of the UNPAs, as well as the recognition of the Republic of Croatia within its internationally recognized borders. In dealing with the question of the UNPAs, the Republic of Croatia would like to recall General Assembly Resolution No. 48/122 of 20 December 1993 entitled `Human Rights and Terrorism.' Actions of the Serbian insurgents in the UNPAs can clearly be characterized as terrorist acts, aimed at the destruction of human rights, threatening the territorial integrity of the Republic of Croatia, destabilizing the legitimately constituted Government of Croatia, undermining a pluralistic civil society and having serious consequences on the economic and social development of Croatia. Therefore, we call upon the Security Council to consider, in its future deliberations on the problems of the UNPAs, the hostile actions of the Serbian insurgents to be acts of terrorism. The Republic of Croatia remains fully committed to the peace process, and it is ready to cooperate with UNPROFOR in the fulfillment of its difficult mandate. "As well as Security Council resolutions, the major guideline in our approach toward the achievement of a peaceful settlement in the Republic of Croatia remains the European Union Action Plan. Croatia is dedicated to remaining an element of stability and security in the region, in close cooperation with the United Nations. At the same time, I must once again emphasize the extreme importance of successful implementation of all the relevant Security Council resolutions for the rapid and peaceful reintegration of the UNPAs into the legal and political system of the Republic of Croatia. This is the only guarantee for peace and stability in the region. In order to facilitate future UNPROFOR performance, and considering the situation on the ground, I am enclosing a series of goals and actions which Croatia considers to be necessary for the success of the renewed UNPROFOR mandate."
