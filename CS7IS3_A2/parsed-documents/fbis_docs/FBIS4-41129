He met there Black Sea Fleet Commander Eduard Baltin, Sevastopol City Council Chairman Viktor Semenov, and some Republican Movement of Crimea activists who are running in the election to the city council of the next convocation. Meeting representatives of the mass media, Serhiy Tsekov stated that "the Supreme Council of Crimea has no problems with the government." At the same time he spoke against the president of Crimea being granted directive powers and against Ilma Umerov, a Crimean Tartar deputy, being appointed to the post of Crimea's social policy minister. Serhiy Tsekov added that the city of Sevastopol should be fully integrated in Crimea and that "if Crimea's authorities fail to achieve this in a civilized manner, a decision will -- in the worst case -- be taken declaring Sevastopol the capital of Crimea." Oleksiy Melnikov, Supreme Council of Crimea deputy chairman, backed that opinion, saying: "If Russia does not need Sevastopol, Crimea does."
