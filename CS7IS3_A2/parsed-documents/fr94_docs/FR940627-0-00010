FR940627-0-00010 FR940627-0-00004 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;CE&hyph;58&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;8952; AD 94&hyph;13&hyph;11] Airworthiness Directives: Piper Aircraft Corporation Models PA34&hyph;200, PA34&hyph;200T, PA34&hyph;220T, PA44&hyph;180, and PA44&hyph;180T Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that applies to certain Piper Aircraft Corporation (Piper) Models PA34&hyph;200, PA34&hyph;200T, PA34&hyph;220T, PA44&hyph;180, and PA44&hyph;180T airplanes. This action requires repetitively inspecting the main landing gear trunnions for cracks, replacing any trunnions found cracked, and eventually replacing these trunnions with improved parts as terminating action for the repetitive inspection requirement. Several reports of the main landing gear trunnions cracking on the affected airplanes prompted this action. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent collapse of the main landing gear caused by cracked trunnions, which could result in airplane damage. DATES: Effective August 12, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of August 12, 1994. ADDRESSES: Service information that applies to this AD may be obtained from the Piper Aircraft Corporation, Customer Services, 2926 Piper Drive, Vero Beach, Florida 32960. This information may also be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Central Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Christina Marsh, Aerospace Engineer, FAA, Atlanta Aircraft Certification Office, 1669 Phoenix Parkway, Suite 210C, Atlanta, Georgia 30349; telephone (404) 991&hyph;2910; facsimile (404) 991&hyph;3606. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an AD that would apply to certain Piper Models PA34&hyph;200, PA34&hyph;200T, PA34&hyph;220T, PA44&hyph;180, and PA44&hyph;180T airplanes was published in the Federal Register on January 12, 1994 (59 FR 1676). The action proposed to require repetitively inspecting the MLG trunnions for cracks, replacing any trunnions found cracked, and eventually replacing these trunnions with improved parts as terminating action for the repetitive inspection requirement. The proposed inspections would be accomplished in accordance with Piper Service Bulletin (SB) No. 787B, dated August 25, 1993. The proposed replacement would be accomplished in accordance with the applicable maintenance manual. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the four comments received. One commenter states that, with the way the compliance of paragraph (b) of the proposal is currently written, airplanes with trunnions that have over 2,000 hours time-in-service (TIS) are grounded. The commenter requests that the FAA give airplane operators in this scenario a grace period. The FAA concurs and has changed the compliance portion of paragraph (b) of the AD to: ``Upon the accumulation of 2,000 hours TIS on a MLG trunnion or within the next 100 hours TIS, whichever occurs later, *␣*␣*''. This change would give 100 hours TIS for compliance to those operators with 1,901 hours TIS or more accumulated on a trunnion as of the effective date of the AD. This same commenter also states that, in paragraph (b)(1) of the proposal, an affected airplane could be grounded if parts were not available after 2,500 hours TIS (2,000 hours TIS replacement compliance and 500 hours TIS for parts unavailability grace period). This commenter recommends that, if parts are unavailable, the FAA allow the owner/operator to inspect the airplane every 100 hours TIS until parts are available and not just for the next 500 hours TIS. The FAA concurs that airplanes would be grounded at 2,500 hours TIS if parts were not available. However, the Piper Aircraft Corporation has assured the FAA that an adequate surplus of parts currently exist for all operators to comply with this action. The AD is unchanged as a result of this comment. One commenter recommends that, instead of mandatory replacement, the FAA mandate the 100-hour TIS repetitive inspections with mandatory replacement of trunnions found cracked. The FAA does not concur. The FAA analyzed information related to MLG trunnion failures from service difficulty reports and manufacturer's warranty claims; and, from this information, the FAA established the mandatory replacement in order to maintain these airplanes at their original type certification level of safety. The AD is unchanged as a result of this comment. Another commenter feels that an eddy current inspection of the MLG trunnions is more reliable than the dye penetrant inspections. This commenter states that, based upon similar MLG trunnion failures in the United Kingdom, the dye penetrant inspection method may not detect a critical crack. The FAA does not concur. Past experience based on FAA reports indicates that dye penetrant inspections are very successful in detecting cracks in the MLG trunnions, and the equipment needed is more readily available and less costly than that for eddy current inspections. The FAA will consider any requests to accomplish an eddy current inspections as an alternative method of compliance to paragraph (a) of the AD under provisions specified in paragraph (d) of the AD. The AD is unchanged as a result of this comment. This same commenter addresses lateral grinding marks found on a significant number of MLG trunnions in the area of the past crack initiation. This commenter recommends blending these marks out to remove any traces of scoring. The FAA concurs, and has added provisions for this requirement to the AD.
