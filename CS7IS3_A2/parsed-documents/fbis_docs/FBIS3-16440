Son Song-pil, DPRK ambassador to Russia, spoke at the new conference. He briefed Pyongyang's position in connection with the North-South talks for the exchange of top-level special envoys. Station reporter (Aleksey Kolony) who attended the news conference reports: The DPRK ambassador quoted a DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman's 13 March statement. The statement indicates that North-South dialogue held to discuss the issue of exchanging top-level special envoys has encountered a serious barrier recently. Ambassador Son continued to say: "As you know, in the DPRK-U.S. contact held recently, an agreement was reached in conducting the four-point joint actions simultaneously. That is to say, the two sides agreed to put the four points into action simultaneously. They are: First, the United States announces the suspension of the Team Spirit joint military exercise. Second, we receive an inspection to ensure the continuity of safeguards. Third, we hold North-South working-level delegates' contact for the exchange of special envoys. Fourth, the DPRK and the United States hold the third round of the DPRK-U.S. talks." Saying that Pyongyang is ready to abide by all problems which have already been agreed upon, the DPRK ambassador briefed on the current situation in North-South dialogue. [Son] "However, the persons in authority of South Korea, unlike the attitude they took in the early days of their assumption of power, opposed the exchange of special envoys simply because we proposed it. They opposed [words indistinct]. However, giving in to our strong demand and the Korean people's pressure calling for holding North-South dialogue, they reluctantly responded to the working-level contact for the exchange of special envoys. Proceeding from our will to create a good atmosphere for the realization of the exchange of special envoys, we proposed the following four demands at the fourth working-level contact: First, the suspension of all large-scale nuclear military exercises. Second, the renouncement of the international alliance system in connection with our so-called nuclear problem. Third, the suspension of the plan to deploy Patriot missiles to South Korea. Fourth, the cancellation of the remarks by the person in authority in South Korea that he cannot shake hands with a counterpart who possesses nuclear weapons. We proposed the above because we believed these issues should be resolved first in order to provide favorable circumstances for the working-level contact on the exchange of special envoys to proceed amid an atmosphere of mutual trust between the North and the South." In conclusion, responding to the station reporter's question about the prospects of the North-South dialogue, DPRK Ambassador Son Song-pil said: "Problems seem complicated. However, they are actually not complicated. Who complicates problems? It is precisely the South Korean authorities and the United States. The pressing issue that should be solved between the DPRK and the United States at present is the nuclear issue. As I said earlier, the South Korean authorities are not in a position to edge themselves into this issue. What the U.S. side needs to do is withdraw U.S. nuclear bases and nuclear weapons from South Korea and renounce its large-scale military and nuclear threats and hostile policy against us. In return for this, we will receive nuclear inspections. Thus, the United States and we should resolve problems, and others should not be involved in this. Therefore, the issue of solving the nuclear issue through a package settlement should be solved first through the talks between the United States and us. If the United States removes its nuclear weapons from South Korea, thereby removing the nuclear threat against us, a package settlement of the nuclear issue will be realized and the basic issues between us and the United States will be eliminated anyway."
