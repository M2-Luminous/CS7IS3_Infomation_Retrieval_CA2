FR941031-2-00098 FR941031-2-00069 Nevertheless, interested parties are requested to submit, as part of their comments on this rule, information on the potential economic impact of the rule. (7) The Department would be in direct violation of the law and regulations if this information were not collected. (8) This data collection is consistent with 5 CFR 1320.6. (9) Efforts to consult with persons outside the agency to obtain their views on data availability, collection and reporting will involve consideration of comments and responses on the interim final regulations published in the Federal Register and the rule-related notice. All comments will be considered in developing final regulations. (10) Documentation is not exempt from disclosure under the FOIA. Public law requires that all attestations be available for public inspection at the Department. (11) Does not involve sensitive questions. (12) Federal Government Cost_$16,162.50. The average Federal Government cost for the year of operation is estimated at $16,162.50 as follows: Estimated Hours Data Entry/Review_.75 hour Process/transmittal_.25 hour Staff Cost Per Attestation _$14.75 Professional (11 level, step 5)_ ␣ 1␣ 1␣ 1␣ $19.10×.50 hr = $9.55 Clerical (5 level, step 5)_ ␣ 1␣ 1␣ 1␣ $10.41×.50 hr = 5.20 n,n,s ␣ ␣ $14.75 Estimated Total Cost _$16,162.50 ␣ 1␣ 1␣ 1␣ Staff $14.75×350 = $5,162.50 Equipment (computer hardware) ␣ 10,000.00 Printing ␣ 1,000.00 n,n,s ␣ ␣ $16,162.50 (13) ETA estimates that approximately 350 attestations per year will be submitted. The public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 3 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing information/data sources, gathering and maintaining information, completing and reviewing the application, and providing the notice of filing. The overall hours needed for each respondent to produce the required information: ␣ 1␣ 1␣ 1␣ 350×.50 hr. (review instructions) = 175.00 350×1 hr. (compile info./file) = 350.00 350×.75 hr. (complete/submit/provide notice) = 262.50 350×.75 hr. (documentation/maintenance) = 262.50 10×.25 hr. (file complaints) = 2.50 n,n,s Total Hours ␣ 1052.50 The estimated time for information collection, processing, review and maintenance is based on the Department's operating experience under the existing program governing attestations under the prevailing practice exception. The estimate is further derived through experience and testing of forms completion and information collection activities. The estimated level of attestations for the year is based upon the Department's operational experience under the existing program governing attestations under the prevailing practice exception. At present the Department has no information basis for projecting employer burden for subsequent years. This is a new program and it is not clear how the following variable will impact program workload: (1) The attestation may be filed for multiple locations in the State of Alaska. Under the existing program governing the performance of longshore work by alien crewmembers under the prevailing practice exception, an attestation must be filed for each port at which an employer intends to utilize alien crewmembers. (14) This is a new data collection request. This data collection will count as a +1,050 hour program change towards ETA's Information Collection Budget. (15) No collection of information will be published for statistical use. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;26994 Filed 10&hyph;28&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4510&hyph;30&hyph;P
