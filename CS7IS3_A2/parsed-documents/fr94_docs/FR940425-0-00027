Background A. General Information At standard temperature and pressure, natural gas is a gas that is lighter than air. 1 When used as a vehicle fuel, natural gas is typically stored on-board a vehicle in cylindrical containers at a pressure of approximately 20,684 kPa pressure (3,000 psi). Natural gas is kept in this compressed state to increase the amount that can be stored on-board the vehicle. This serves, in turn, to increase the vehicle's driving range. Since natural gas is flammable and is stored under high pressure when used as a vehicle fuel, it poses a potential risk to motor vehicle safety. 1 Standard temperature is 0 ○ Celsius or 32 ○ Fahrenheit and standard pressure is 101.4 kiloPascals (kPa) or 14.7 pounds per square inch (psi). Alternative fuel vehicles powered by CNG have not been numerous to date. The number of CNG vehicles in the United States has more than doubled from 10,300 in 1990 to 23,800 at the end of 1992. The number of CNG vehicles is projected to again double to an estimated 50,800 vehicles in 1994. However, Federal legislation, as well as the need to meet environmental and energy security goals, will lead to increased production and use of these vehicles. Among the items of Federal legislation encouraging the use of alternative fuels in general are: (1) The Alternative Motor Fuels Act of 1988, (2) the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, and (3) the Energy Policy Act of 1992. The Alternative Motor Fuels Act of 1988 directs the Department of Energy to conduct demonstration programs to encourage the use of alternative motor fuels, including natural gas. As a further encouragement, this Act also specifies that new passenger automobiles will have their fuel economy calculated according to a special mileage enhancing procedure. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 establish the clean fuel requirements that treat fuel type and content, along with vehicle technology, as a potential source of emission reductions. These Amendments call for programs that will substantially increase the number of low-polluting vehicle/fuel combinations in use. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 directs the Department of Transportation to issue safety standards applicable to vehicle conversions. Executive branch initiatives will also encourage the increased use of alternative fueled vehicles. Executive Order 12844 increased by 50 percent the number of alternative fueled vehicles to be acquired by the Federal Government from 1993 through 1995. (April 21, 1993) In addition, in 1993, the President established the Federal Fleet Conversion Task Force to accelerate the commercialization and market acceptance of alternative fueled vehicles throughout the country. B. Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking On October 12, 1990, NHTSA published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) to explore whether the agency should issue Federal motor vehicle safety standards (FMVSSs) to promote the fuel system integrity of motor vehicles using CNG or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) as a motor fuel. (55 FR 41561) The ANPRM sought comment about the crash integrity of vehicle fuel systems, the integrity of fuel storage containers, and pressure relief for such containers.
