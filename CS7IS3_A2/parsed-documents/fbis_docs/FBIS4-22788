The very fact that it is being held is important for the business and practical scientific contacts of jurists, scientists, economists, and representatives of the organs of state authority and administration and the public. The need for a dialogue on various important problems in creating laws and regulating collaboration in the field of legal information and informatization is obvious. The success of this dialogue gives all of us a chance at a better future. Boris Valentinovich Kiselev, the general designer of Russian Legal Informatization, is our guest at the editorial staff today. Our correspondent Eduard Suvorov has a conversation with him. [Kiselev] The conference is charged with resolving the problem of legal informatization. The need for this is dictated by the qualitative renewal of society and the formation and development of a market economy. Under these conditions, the formation of a unified legal and information space is being advanced to the forefront: for it, and only it, will be able to provide for the dissemination of legal information to all structures of society. [Suvorov] Boris Valentinovich, doesn't it seem to you that it is somewhat late for the creative process of building up legal informatization? [Kiselev] You are right, unfortunately. But this is not a spontaneous reaction to the situation that has taken shape, but objective-oriented and purposeful work that has been carefully reasoned. It should give us confidence in the quality of our knowledge, so that we may have a real opportunity to influence the course of social processes and work for a rapprochement of views and lasting harmony in society. [Suvorov] In the concept of Russia's legal informatization confirmed by the Russian Federation President's edict of 18 June 1993, it states that the state policy of the Russian Federation in shaping and utilizing legal information resources and meeting the country's requirements for social and economic development with these resources is implemented by taking into account the interests of the subjects of the Russian Federation, the trends of international cooperation in legal information science, and the real opportunities for the informatization industry under the conditions of a market economy. Can this be transferred to the CIS? [Kiselev] There is increasing realization that reintegration of the unified economic space is essential. And this gives me the right to speak about taking into account the interests of CIS states in shaping and utilizing legal information resources. Especially as there is a critical shortage of even elementary legal information services today. This has a very harmful effect on the public sense of justice and law and order. And not only in Russia, but throughout the CIS as well. [Suvorov] A natural question: how do we solve this problem? [Kiselev] I think that the legal informatization of society, based on a twofold task--informatization of the legal field, on one hand, and provision for legislative regulation of legal relationships in the field of informatization, on the other hand--will contribute to this to a substantial degree. Legal informatization should be considered the process of creating the best possible conditions to fully meet the legal information requirements of state and public structures, enterprises, organizations, institutions, and citizens based on the efficient organization and use of information resources. The task is extraordinarily complex. After all, to provide for the legal informatization of the Russian Federation alone we will have to build a national legal information system which covers all regions, organs of authority and administration, and law enforcement organs. [Suvorov] But who will be involved in bringing all this about? [Kiselev] The functions of head organization have been entrusted to the "Sistema" Scientific and Technical Center of Legal Information of the Federal Agency for Government Communications and Information. This agency possesses powerful scientific and technical potential, combined with developed telecommunications facilities, and it can provide for the construction of a national system of legal information based on the highest achievements of science and technology and the integration of existing service lines and communications which accompany the different legal information systems. [Suvorov] There is no universal legal information system in Russia yet. Collections and card files of official documents, automated systems, and legal data banks are functioning in the higher organs of state authority and administration of the Russian Federation and the republics within Russia, and in ministries and departments. But they are not linked with each other at all and serve only their own departments. [Kiselev] You are right. Nevertheless, systems which make it possible to store and process individual sections of legal information have already appeared in the programming products market. It is another matter that most of them are the product of enthusiasm by local groups of developers, and they all do not have official status. Moreover, although the laws and formal government documents being adopted are published in the periodical press and in special collections and bulletins, far from all of them are entered into the data bases of the legal packages being sold. Let us point out that normative documents are modified and supplemented periodically in connection with current legislation that is developed, so it is essential that they are always up to date. It is even more complicated to work with departmental documents, the documents of republics in the Russian Federation, and the documents of local organs of state authority and administration. Most of the latter are not even published. But the information which may be accessed through existing information systems is often contradictory and very limited in its variety, quantitative indicators, and forms of presentation. A developed program of specific measures is needed at the federal level of administration; practical realization of the program in combination with the efforts of the republic and regional systems of executive authority will make it possible to accomplish the most important state task of providing legal information support for subjects of the Russian Federation. Such a program is under development. [Suvorov] Boris Valentinovich, it seems to me that these problems are typical not only in the Russian Federation, but in all the CIS member states. Can the forthcoming international conference help in resolving them somehow? [Kiselev] Yes, of course. It has been called upon to work out proposals, and I think it will be able to do so, to reinforce practical cooperation by CIS member states in the field of legal informatization and the creation of a unified economic space. Especially as the development of an effective legal and contracting basis for overall development and expansion of economic relationships among the CIS member states, based on realization of the Agreement on Establishment of an Economic Union, is one of the principal directions and the gaze and thoughts of politicians and jurists are fixed on it. We need to find qualitatively new forms of cooperation in the field of politics, economics, law, the social sphere, and defense in the interests of the historic relationships among the peoples of the CIS states. In addition, it is very important to work out a mechanism for interaction of the states' legislation in effect in conformity with the recommendations being adopted by the Interparliamentary Assembly, for coordination of efforts and close interaction by the parliaments of CIS member states in legislative support for economic reforms, and for a coordinated policy in the international arena. This can by helped by the international conference as well. [Suvorov] Let us return to the subject of building Russia's legal information system, especially as it will probably be serving as a guidepost for the CIS countries. [Kiselev] I have already said that a key role in realizing Russia's legal informatization is being played by the "Sistema" Scientific and Technical Center. As the central hub for the legal information system, it creates, shapes, and maintains the currency of the data bank of legal information, it coordinates the development and introduction of information and telecommunications technologies within the framework of building a system of legal information, and it conducts work related to legal information support for users of the legal information system. The tasks of the "Sistema" NTTs [Scientific and Technical Center] include keeping copies of the standard data banks of legal information up to date, duplicating them for use in regional legal information hubs, and providing for the practical and methodical activity of the developers. We should be concerned with keeping records on and classifying the laws of the Russian Federation, the decrees of the Federal Duma (parliament) of the Russian Federation, the edicts and directives of the Russian Federation President, and decisions by the Council of Ministers and Government of the Russian Federation, the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation, the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation, and the Higher Arbitration Court of the Russian Federation, as well as the legal documents of CIS member states, foreign laws, and other essential information which is used to provide legal information support. In addition, our functions include expert analysis and sampling of hardware and software solutions, taking into account the requirements of world standards, the preparation of practical recommendations on introduction of the latest information technologies, and the application of standardized model solutions and hardware and software. I will say further that the acquisition of legal information directly "from the pen" of legislators, which guarantees its complete reliability and currency, is fundamentally important for the "Sistema" NTTs. [Suvorov] Boris Valentinovich, the effectiveness with which the legal information system functions depends to a substantial degree on the completeness and reliability of information and the regularity with which it is received not only from central, but regional sources. [Kiselev] Exactly! For this reason, it is advisable to resolve this problem from two sides at the same time: from the center and from pivotal regional informatization zones, which are the base centers for regions' legal information and communications systems for the transit movement of data for regional systems. Such regional hubs will be entrusted with the main volume of work in providing legal information for a wide range of customers. [Suvorov] Has an analysis been made of the information surveys and what kind of results have they provided? [Kiselev] Yes, an analysis has been made, making it possible to single out the following types of output flows: inquiries about legislative and normative documents, thematic sets of legislative and normative documents, texts of legislative and nmormative documents, inquiries about cases under consideration, inquiries about citizens' appeals to law enforcement organs, statistical inquiries, inquiries about case proceedings, and so forth. But this analysis enables us to state that each department is provided with information based on its own understanding of what information systems are and what automated data processing systems are, and so forth. Meanwhile, the formation of state information resources in the legal field presupposes orientation toward the creation of a common information space, and consequently, the basis for building up and improving unified information technology in the legal field should be the principle of integrated, coordinated development of all the elements in the system. This will make it possible to effectively resolve the problem of information interaction among state structures, which in turn will provide for increased efficiency and correctness of the decisions made to regulate the various areas of public life. In conclusion, I want to say that we must not be slow to bring order to public relations in the field of legal information and informatization, and that there is a critical need to prepare draft laws making it possible to legally define the affirmation and protection of the right of information ownership, protection of the information itself, and the affirmation of guarantees of the right to information and the protection of citizens' rights. In other words, an open and clear state policy is needed in the field of legal informatization.
