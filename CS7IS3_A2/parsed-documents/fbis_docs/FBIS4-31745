Olach: "The Minorities Will Receive 140 Million for Culture"] [Text] Bratislava -- The Government Council for Ethnic Minorities [RVN] convened yesterday for the first time since the formation of the new government three months ago. It dealt with the financial and organizational provisions for culture and education from the point of view of the ethnic minorities. One result of the meeting was that the ethnic minorities will receive 140 million korunas [Sk] from the state budget this year to promote culture. This is Sk10 million more than last year, while a further Sk10 million has been kept in reserve. The Council supported all the materials submitted, apart from the Organizational Provisions for Ethnic Minority Education, because they contained some imprecise information. The Council also agreed with optional tuition in Czech as of the next school year. According to the Council's chairman, R. Kovac, it has thus met the demands of the Czech minority, which lives mainly in Bratislava, Trencin, and Kosice. The Ruthenian minority is also demanding that tuition in the Ruthenian language and culture be introduced in the schools attended by ethnic Ruthenian children. According to R. Kovac, deputy prime minister and RVN chairman, the Ruthenians and the Romanies have -- apparently --already prepared their languages for codification.
