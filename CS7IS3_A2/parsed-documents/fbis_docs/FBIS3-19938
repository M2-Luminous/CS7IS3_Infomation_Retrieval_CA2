The UN envoy said that although the two sides are very close to an agreement on the confidence-building measures [CBM's], the Turkish side did not consent to the agreement. Stressing the importance of the confidence measures for the two sides, Clark noted that the Greek Cypriot and the Turkish Cypriot sides must reach agreement to implement them. He said: We do not have the Turkish Cypriot side's agreement. Clark insisted that the UN envoys will continue their efforts until the end of the month when UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali will prepare his report to the UNSC [UN Security Council] on the talks. Clark concluded his contacts in Cyprus by meeting President Glavkos Kliridhis shortly after noon. The meeting concluded a short time ago. In a statement in Larnaca after visiting the U.S. frigate USS Taylor, Kliridhis described his meeting with Clark as a clearly typical farewell visit. Kliridhis made it clear that there is no room to maneuver in the proximity talks right now because Denktas refuses to take a position on the UN documents on how to implement the CBM's. He added, however, that nobody knows what might happen before the UN secretary general submits his report. The president stressed: Denktas gives no answers. This is why I made it clear that I will not accept any new UN documents. Shortly before meeting Kliridhis, Clark met the ambassadors of the five UN Security Council permanent members in Nicosia. In a joint statement, the five ambassadors reiterated their position that an agreement must be reached with no delay. The statement read by David Dain, British high commissioner in Nicosia, reiterates the support of the five states for the UN secretary general's efforts.
