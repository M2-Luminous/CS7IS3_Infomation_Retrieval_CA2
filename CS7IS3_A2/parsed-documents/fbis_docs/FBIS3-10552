Once in London, Anzorreguy contacted the British intelligence chiefs. The gesture would have been nothing more than a protocol issue had this not been the first such contact since the South Atlantic War in 1982. The gradual thawing of Argentine-British relations, which was crowned by the resumption of diplomatic relations between the two countries almost four years ago, had not occurred between the two countries' intelligence organizations. Military and police officers, however, did make contact (when charges of alleged executions after the Longdon Hill battle were being investigated), while Argentine and British officers and NCOs who participate in the UN peace forces did fraternize.
