Dubnov; from the "Vesti" newscast] [Text] Representatives of the newly reconstituted Federal Counterintelligence Service held a news conference today at the Foreign Ministry's press center in Moscow. On 5 January 1994, an edict of the Russian president endorsed the service's standing orders which, according to its deputy director Sergey Stepashin, was an expected surprise [as heard] for its members. The new structure is not a copy of the disbanded Security Ministry but makes the service answerable directly to the president, as is the practice in many other countries. Its remit covers such important matters as identification, advance warning, and prevention of subversive and intelligence activities directed against the Russian Federation by foreign special services and organizations; supply of intelligence information on threats to Russia; the fight against terrorism, illegal trading in weapons and narcotic substances, and illegal armed groups; and also counterintelligence support to ensure the security of Russian borders. This is despite the fact that the border troops have reorganized into a separate federal service with ministry status. One thing worth pointing out is that the Federal Counterintelligence Service's manpower has been cut by 46 percent and will total 75,000 persons. The number of administrators has been more than halved. In the new structure, the main emphasis is on strengthening the counterintelligence and the anti-terrorism departments. So, this notorious power structure has undergone yet another overhaul. Time will show how effective this one will be.
