Caceres is the first candidate to officially announce his intention to run for the presidency in next year's presidential and legislative electoral campaign. The former mayor said he has several names to include on his list of congressional candidates and already has the name of two vice presidents who will run on his presidential ticket. He declined, however, to reveal their names. He pointed out that everyone is entitled to become a candidate to govern the country and that he is not concerned about the possibility that President Alberto Fujimori, whom the Constitution allows to be reelected, and former UN Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar might decide to present their candidacies too. Fujimori often has reiterated that he still has not thought about the possibility of running for reelection. Nonetheless, opposition members believe he surely will. Perez de Cuellar, however, has recently said it is still too early to decide on a possible candidacy. Caceres Velasquez was mayor of Arequipa, 1,025 km south of Lima, for two consecutive terms. In the January 1993 municipal elections he was a candidate for mayor of Lima, but another independent candidate -- Ricardo Belmont -- won.
