The national meeting of party cell secretaries, which is being held for the first time in our party's history, will become an important milestone to strengthen and develop our party to become an invincible party by enhancing the function and role of party cells and to further strengthen our socialist position. [applause] I warmly congratulate the delegates to the meeting, as well as all the party cell secretaries of the entire party, who are waging a devoted struggle and are upholding our party's leadership with loyalty, for the strengthening and development of the party and for the victorious advance of the cause of socialism. [applause] Our party is a glorious party which has been brought up with deep historical roots, and it is a chuche revolutionary party that struggles for the cause of independence of the popular masses with the chuche idea as its guiding policy. Our party's founding and strengthening and development is unthinkable without the party cells -- its basic organizations. Because the position and role of the party cells are very important in party building and activities, we have consistently given deep heed to strengthening the basic party organizations, such as the party cells, since the preparations for party founding was made. According to the policy put forth in the historic Karun meeting in 1930, we began the party founding work by forming the basic party organizations first and then expanding and strengthening them. Since its founding, our party has expanded the party ranks with advanced elements of the working popular masses, including workers, farmers, and intellectuals; and formed party cells in all places where there were party members and the masses, such as plants, enterprises, and rural areas. At the same time, we have strengthened the party cells' militant function in conformity with the prevailing demand at every stage of the development of the revolution. Because the party cells were brought up strong and their function and role was enhanced, our party could realize the unity and cohesion of the party ranks based on the chuche idea and be strengthened and develop to be an invincible party in firm unity with the popular masses. [applause] At a time when the historic task of realizing the modeling of the entire society on the chuche idea was put forth as a task of primary importance, our party made a major effort to strengthen the party cells in conformity with the new higher demand of the development of the revolution. After the national training course for party cells was held in 1991 by the initiative of the party Central Committee, a vigorous movement was conducted to create loyal party cells for the entire party membership under the slogan "Let us make all party cells into cells of loyalty," thus enhancing the party cells' militant function and role in an unprecedented manner. Today, the party cells are excellently carrying out their noble mission and task in further strengthening our party to be the chuche revolutionary party and inheriting and developing the chuche revolutionary cause. [applause] The party cell secretaries contributed to the shining successes of our party building and in the development of our revolution with their unheralded efforts and great achievements. The party cell secretaries have waged a devoted struggle for the sake of the party and the revolution with high pride and revolutionary self-awareness as the primary political functionaries of the glorious Workers' Party of Korea [WPK], without seeking honor or reward. The party cell secretaries have revolutionary faith and high loyalty, uphold the party wholeheartedly, look after the political life of the party members and working people with a warm, maternal feeling, and vigorously organize and mobilize the party members and working people to creation and exploits at the head of the struggle for socialist construction. I highly appraise the party cell secretaries for their great contribution to strengthening the party and realizing the party's leadership of the revolution and construction, and give my warm gratitude to the delegates to the meeting and all the party cell secretaries. [applause] The most important revolutionary task for our party and people today is to defend and adhere and add luster to the popular mass-centered socialism of our own style against the challenge of the imperialists and reactionaries. The socialism of our country, which is built by embodying the chuche idea under our party's leadership, is a genuine socialism that conforms to the popular masses' independent aspirations and demands. Whether we can crush the enemy's maneuvers and defend and adhere to the chuche socialist cause and complete this cause to the end depends on how we strengthen the party, the general staff of the revolution, and how we can enhance the party's leadership role. The party cells are the cornerstone upholding our party and a revolutionary guardpost defending our socialism. The party cells are the base for imbuing the party members with the revolution and modeling them into the working class, a base for connecting the party members with the party Central Committee and realizing the relations of kinship between the party and the masses, and a base for organizing and mobilizing the party members and working people to the implementation of the party's line and policy. All the party cells should be strong in order for the party to be strong and in order for the main force of our revolution to have an invincible might. All the party cells should smoothly carry out their function and role in order to give full play to the superiority and vitality of the socialism of our country. In strengthening the party cells is an important guarantee for strengthening the main force of our party and our revolution and firmly adhering and adding luster to our socialism. Our party entrusts the party cell secretaries with the revolution's important guardpost of this magnitude. Our party's trust in and expectations of the party cell secretaries is very great, and the party cell secretaries' mission for the party and the revolution is very heavy. All the party cell secretaries should, with a high sense of responsibility and honor, make their party cells loyal cells that are boundlessly loyal to the party and militant cells that vigorously organize and mobilize the masses into the struggle to defend and adhere and add luster to the socialist cause. [applause] The party cells should, above all, loyally uphold the unitary leadership [yuilchok yongdo] of the party Central Committee. [applause] Ensuring the unitary [yuilsong] leadership within the party is the fundamental principle of the party activity, and loyally upholding the unitary leadership of the party Central Committee is the foremost important duty of the party cells. When all the party cells become loyal cells boundlessly loyal to the leadership of the party Central Committee, they can become invincible ranks in which the entire party membership functions with one mind and will. Today, our party's cause, the chuche revolutionary cause, is being brilliantly inherited and developed under the leadership of Comrade Kim Chong-il who excellently has the traits and natural disposition of a people-oriented leader. [applause] To solve the problem of inheriting our party's leadership smoothly in conformity with the demand of the revolution's development and the aspirations of the popular masses is the most proud success achieved in our party building. This firmly ensures the bright future and brilliant victory of our party and our revolution. [applause] All party cell secretaries should continuously keep up the work of establishing the party's unitary leadership system. Party cells should unconditionally accept and thoroughly implement the party's line, policies, decisions, and directions, and should indoctrinate leader party members and working people to be endlessly loyal to the party's leadership. Party cells should resolutely protect and defend the party Central Committee and struggle against all phenomena that hinder the party's unitary leadership. Party cells should well organize and guide party members' party life [tang saenghwal]. [applause] The party life is an excellent school that raises party members as revolutionaries who are loyal to the party and the revolution. It is the party cells' primary duty to correctly organize and guide the party life of party members. Party cells should strengthen party members' organizational and ideological life to make all party members endlessly loyal to the party and the revolution and to raise them as resolute revolutionaries who can unyieldingly struggle for the victory of the socialist cause under all stormy circumstances. Party cells should enhance party members' organizational concept [chojik kwallyom], establish a self-conscious and revolutionary trait in their party life and make all party members participate in the party life with a sincere attitude in accordance with the standard of party life. Party cells should normally organize and carry on the organizational and ideological party life, such as summing up of the party life and party training [tang haksup], should operate party meetings in orderly fashion at a high political and ideological level, should properly give party assignments to party members, and should actively help them fulfill the assignments. Party cells should correctly organize and guide party members' party life in close connection with the implementation of their revolutionary tasks so party members can always play a leading and exemplary role in implementing revolutionary tasks. Party cells should strengthen work with the masses and firmly unite the broad range of masses around the party. [applause] The work with the masses is the work of remolding and inciting [paltong] people's ideology and is important work to consolidate the party's mass-oriented basis and to strengthen the main forces of the revolution. Party cells should properly work with the masses, indoctrinate the broad range of masses in a revolutionary way, firmly unite them around the party Central Committee, and actively contribute to strengthening the single-hearted unity of the entire society. For the work with the masses, they should give priority to work with the basic masses so they can strengthen the party's class basis and the core forces of the revolution and can make the basic masses resolutely struggle for the party and the revolution, remembering their class status. Party cells should more actively carry out work with the masses in various classes and strata and unite more masses around the party. They should also make all people indubitably trust our party and share their destinies with the party without vacillation in any trial. Party cells should help organizations of the working people, including ones under the League of Socialist Working Youth of Korea, and actively agitate them to vigorously carry out work with the masses in accordance with each unit's characteristic. Party cells should vigorously carry out the three revolutions--ideological, technological, and cultural--to effect constant innovations and upsurges in socialist construction. [applause] The loyalty of the party members and workers to the party and revolution must be demonstrated in the practical struggle for revolution and construction. Workers and farmers who make innovations in production and construction; intellectuals who make valuable contributions to socialist construction with scientific and technological knowledge; People's Army soldiers who stand guard at guardposts to defend the fatherland like fortresses by even risking their young lives: They are people loyal to the party and revolution. Party cells must regard the ideological revolution as their first and foremost revolutionary task and intensify education in the chuche idea among the party members and workers. We must make all party members and workers cherish the chuche idea as their firm faith and think and act as demanded by the chuche idea. We must prevent any alien idea or unsound life-style [isaekchogin sasangina pulgonjonhan saenghwal pungjodo] from infiltrating into ourselves. We must bring all party members and workers to cherish an unfailing loyalty to the party, a staunch revolutionary spirit, an unshakable faith in socialism, ardent patriotism, and noble moral traits. We must also bring into fuller bloom in our society the beautiful communist morality of helping and leading each other forward and sharing weal and woe based on the principle of one for all and all for one. [applause] Party cells must make a great effort to carry out the cultural revolution so that all party members and workers learn hard and strive to steadily improve their cultural and technical standards and enjoy to their hearts' content the socialist cultural life with rich emotional feelings and a high cultural attainment. Party cells must strengthen organizational and political work to ensure that party members and workers accelerate the technical revolution and make innovations in building the socialist economy. Party cells in the industrial sector must positively help our working class, which is in charge of the major sector of the people's economy, fulfill the people's economic plan by the day, by the month, and by the quarter and strengthen the might of the chuche-oriented economy without fail by highly displaying the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and arduous struggle. Party cells in agriculture must lead our farmers to do farming in a scientific and technological manner as demanded by the chuche- oriented farming method with an attitude befitting masters who are responsible for the nation's granaries and, thus, fulfill the high goal of agricultural production set by the party without fail. For the present the party cells in all sectors of the people's economy must effect a fresh, revolutionary advance in building the socialist economy by effectively organizing the party members and workers for the implementation of the party's revolutionary economic strategy. [applause] Party cells in the fields of science, education, literature, arts, public health, publications, and the press must well carry out work with intellectuals to ensure that they, with the honor of and pride in being intellectuals of a chuche Korea, positively contribute to building socialist culture with all of their creative wisdom and talent. Party cells must always pay deep attention to defending the fatherland. Our struggle for socialist construction is waged in the acute confrontation with the enemies. Today, the imperialists and their stooges are intensifying the military threat and provocation maneuvers against our Republic, the fortress of socialism, with each passing day. The party cells should see to it that the party members and working people heighten their revolutionary vigilance to cope with the enemy's aggressive provocation maneuvers, earnestly learn military affairs, and prepare themselves thoroughly in order to firmly defend the country's security and the gains of socialism. The party cells should ensure that the party members and working people give full play to the traditional virtues of Army-people harmony and that the Army and the people are firmly united to firmly defend the socialist fatherland. [applause] First, the party cells should loyally uphold the party Central Committee's unitary leadership. Second, they should bring up all party members to be chuche-type revolutionaries by effective party life organization and guidance. Third, they should carry out the work with the masses well in order to strengthen the relations of kinship between the party and the masses. Fourth, they should vigorously carry out the three revolutions--ideological, technological, and cultural--in order to accelerate socialist construction. Fifth, they should firmly defend the security of the country and the gains of socialism. These are the five-point tasks the party cells should carry out at present. [applause] All the party cell secretaries should firmly keep up the party cells five-point tasks and implement them thoroughly. Whether the party cells can carry out their function and role satisfactorily or not depends on the degree of preparedness and role of the cell secretaries. The party cell secretaries should be boundlessly loyal to the party so that the party cells may become the cells of loyalty. The party cell secretaries should skillfully organize work and push it ahead energetically so that the party cells may become cells with militant strength. The party cell secretaries should become true loyalists boundlessly loyal to the party. [applause] The party cell secretaries should make their loyalty to the party their faith and part of their constitution. The party cell secretaries should bear deep in their hearts the greatness of our party and the justness of the party's cause. They should have firm resolve to share their destiny with the party forever. They should wage an invariable devoted struggle throughout their life, unshaken in the face of any wind, for the sake of the party and for the victory of the party's cause. The party cell secretaries should protect and defend the party politically, ideologically, and with their life with a firm faith that they are happy living or dead as long as they are loyal to our party. Party cell secretaries must become the flag bearers in the revolution and struggle who resolutely defend the party's lines and policies and mobilize the popular masses into implementing these lines and policies. Party cell secretaries must possess high revolutionary spirits and unwavering fidelity to the party's principles and class-oriented principles, carry out all work in ways beneficial to the party and revolution, and vigorously mobilize the popular masses into the struggle to implement the party's policies. Party cell secretaries must take the lead in waging the struggle, overcome difficulties and achieve breakthroughs, and exert influence on popular masses and lead them by exhibiting a good personal example. Party cell secretaries must never compromise with [tahyop] phenomena that are at variance with the party's lines and policies and harm the interests of the party and revolution, but wage a resolute struggle against them. Party cell secretaries must become the people's genuine servants who sincerely serve the people. [applause] Party cell secretaries must become the people's genuine servants who sincerely serve the people. [speaker repeats] Party cell secretaries must have the correct view of the masses that the masters of our country and the masters of revolution and construction are the popular masses, boundlessly love and respect the people, and devotedly wage struggles for the people's benefits and happiness. Party cell secretaries must always listen to the opinions of the people, share joy and sorrow with them, and resolve their difficulties and requests in a timely manner. Party cell secretaries must not misuse their authority, hope for privileges, and entertain worldly desires. Rather, they must always lead frugal and sound lives and be cleanhanded [chongnyom kyonlbaek]. Party cell secretaries must persistently make efforts to improve their political-administrative qualifications. Without endlessly improving their qualifications to comply with the demand of the developing era, party cell secretaries cannot correctly organize and give guidance to the party members' party activities and efficiently organize and mobilize the party members and masses for implementing the party's policies. Party cell secretaries must strongly arm themselves with our party's revolutionary idea, the chuche idea, entirely acquaint themselves with the party's lines and policies and plans, and have a full understanding of the party's work methods. Party cell secretaries must study hard and make persistent efforts to strongly prepare themselves as proficient officials who have high political and theoretical qualifications and administrative experiences. Party organizations of all levels must strongly build the ranks of party cell secretaries and positively help and lead them to ensure that they play their roles satisfactorily. I firmly believe the delegates to the national meeting of party cell secretaries and all the other party cell secretaries of the entire party will uphold the party's leadership, excellently fulfill their duties, and, thus, repay the party's great trust and expectations without fail. [applause] Kim Il-song [long applause] 31 March 1994 [applause]
