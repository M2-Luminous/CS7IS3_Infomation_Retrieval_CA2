The statement said: The Islamic mosques should not be a place of worship for non-Muslims. The mosques to which the proposals refer and that are mentioned in the statement are Islamic mosques built by Muslims. The statement added: The current practices in the mosques are based on the force of the occupation. From the beginning, the SIC has objected to these practices, stressing its adherence to the Muslim holy shrines and mosques.
