As always, when leaders fall, it is amazing what scandals their successors can find to discredit them with. From Blantyre, Willy Zingani telexed this report: The rope is getting tighter and tighter around Dr. Banda's neck. The new UDF government is trying to discover whether the ex-president abused his position to enrich himself. One thing they claim to have discovered is that Dr. Banda received rent from 11 state houses which didn't belong to him. The new minister of information and broadcasting, Brown Mpinganjira, says he has documents proving that 2.5 million pounds was paid in recent years to Dr. Banda as rent for houses belonging to the state. The new state president, Bakili Muluzi, hasn't commented on the matter. It is, therefore, not known whether Dr. Banda will be asked to pay back the money or be taken to court to answer charges. Since Dr. Banda's defeat in 17th May general election, Malawians have been shocked by the news that he had spent 8 million pounds on a new state house in the Malawi capital, Lilongwe. Earlier this week, for the first time, journalists were allowed to enter the palaces to see how Dr. Banda lived. In one room, there were six telephone lines, and all rooms, including the garage, were air conditioned.
