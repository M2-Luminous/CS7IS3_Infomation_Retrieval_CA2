SUMMARY: In response to a petition for reconsideration filed by NorMin Broadcasting Company, this document rescinds the allotment of Channel 234C3 at Staples, Minnesota. The Report and Order in MM Docket No. 93&hyph;219 allotted Channel 234C3 to Staples, Minnesota, and modified the construction permit for Station KSKK(FM), Channel 234A, to specify operation on Channel 234C3. See 58 FR 59375 (1993). NorMin Broadcasting Company has filed an application seeking to take advantage of the Commission's new Rules permitting an upgrade in facilities by the application process rather than the rule making process (BMPH&hyph;931102IE). See FM Channel and Class Modifications by Application, 58 FR 38534, July 19, 1993. With this action, this proceeding is terminated. EFFECTIVE DATE: February 14, 1994.
