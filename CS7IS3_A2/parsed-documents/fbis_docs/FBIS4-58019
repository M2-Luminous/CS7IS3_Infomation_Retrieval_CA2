It was not your first appeal. Do you believe developing conditions can still make a solution based on dialogue a success? [Ait-Ahmed] I believe in Algeria. I do not believe in the inevitability of a national collapse. We have over the past two years been calling for holding a sovereign national conference. [Al-Darwish] Is that what you call a constituent assembly? [Ait-Ahmed] No...a sovereign national conference with the powers to set up institutions and structures for the transitional phase. This conference should comprise the regime, that is the Army, and the political formations representing Algerian society. [Al-Darwish] Including the [Islamic] Salvation Front [FIS]? [Ait-Ahmed] Of course including the FIS. [passage omitted] [Al-Darwish] Am I to understand that you believe the security option has failed completely? [Ait-Ahmed] Completely. I have from the outset said that this option is doomed to failure. I spoke openly about this with Major General Khaled Nezzar following the assassination of President Boudiaf. We stressed the need to open a direct dialogue with all parties. [passage omitted] [Al-Darwish] But are you calling for dialogue with the FIS or with the armed organizations? [Ait-Ahmed] Of course with the FIS. However, we believe that the FIS' commitment to and entry into the dialogue process is bound to influence these organizations. But nothing prevents us from addressing these organizations and their members as Algerians who have adopted a means of expression of which we do not approve and which we reject in the political action domain for the sake of sparing the blood of Algerian men and women. [Al-Darwish] Did you follow the reports of contacts between the regime and FIS leaders? Did these contacts include you? [Ait-Ahmed] Of course, we followed these reports with interest, through the press, rumors, and private channels as well. But we were not consulted, nor did anyone contact us. Nevertheless, we bless these initiatives and hope they are serious. [passage omitted] [Al-Darwish] What about the message you sent to President Zeroual on 9 April? [Ait-Ahmed] Proceeding from my personal and partisan responsibility, I wanted to renew our call for dialogue and to express to the new president our fear of moving toward a worse security situation, especially after the emergence of serious maneuvers and calls in recent weeks. [Al-Darwish] I believe that you are referring to the calls for distributing arms and forming militias. Do you believe that the regime has something to do with these calls? [Ait-Ahmed] The call by some ministers from Redha Malek's government for calling up the reserve and civil defense elements is nothing but a framework for what is called in other cases "militias." In the Algerian political reality it means moving a step closer to all-out civil war. [passage omitted]
