FR940902-1-00050 FR940902-1-00011 On July 15, 1993, the Native American Rights Fund, on behalf of a number of individuals and organizations, submitted a petition to the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture requesting that they include navigable waters within the definition of ``public lands'' as used in implementing Title VIII. This was a request for administrative relief. The Secretaries continue their evaluation of this petition. On March 30, 1994, the U.S. District Court for Alaska issued a decision in the consolidated Katie John, et al. v. the United States, et al. litigation. The court concluded that the Secretaries are entitled to manage fish and wildlife on public lands in Alaska for the purposes of providing the subsistence priority mandated in Title VIII of ANILCA. The court further concluded that, for the purposes of Title VIII, ``public lands'' includes all navigable waterways in Alaska. The court then issued a stay of the decision for 60 days to allow the filing of an appeal and ordered that the stay would remain in effect, pending an appellate decision, if one or more appeals were filed. Because the Federal government has successfully petitioned the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals for permission to appeal from the district court's decision, the stay presently remains in effect. Because the petition for rulemaking is still under consideration by the secretaries and because of the stayed court decision relative to actual Federal jurisdiction, the Board believes that issuing regulations immediately, assuming additional authority or revising existing regulations are not warranted and, in fact, appear to be inappropriate at this time. However, any comments or proposals received will be carefully considered and retained for use when the regulations are revised the next time. Therefore, the existing fish and shellfish regulations were extended (59 FR 32923, dated June 27, 1994) until December 31, 1995, or until the Secretaries direct the revision of the subsistence fish and shellfish regulations based on a revised area of jurisdiction, or until the court directs the preparation of regulations implementing its order. Applicability of Subparts A, B, and C Subparts A, B, and C of the Subsistence Management Regulations for Public Lands in Alaska, 50 CFR 100.1 to 100.24 and 36 CFR 100.1 to 100.24, remain effective and apply to this proposed rule for subpart D. Therefore, all definitions located at 50 CFR 100.4 and 36 CFR 100.4 apply to regulations found in this subpart. The identified sections include definitions for the following terms: Regulatory year which ``means July 1 through June 30''; Federal lands which ``means lands and waters and interests therein title to which is in the United States''; and Public land or public lands which ``means lands situated in Alaska which are Federal lands, except_ (1) land selections of the State of Alaska which have been tentatively approved or validly selected under the Alaska Statehood Act and lands which have been confirmed to, validly selected by, or granted to the Territory of Alaska or the State under any other provision of Federal Law; (2) land selections of a Native Corporation made under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act which have not been conveyed to a Native Corporation, unless any such selection is determined to be invalid or is relinquished; and (3) lands referred to in Section 19(b) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act.''
