Is there ill-will in Congress against the government? [Hargreaves] The decision by Congress not to vote on a provisional measure is sometimes a strategy, sometimes a lack of consensus. But there is no ill-will. A political agreement usually takes its time but Congress has one virtue: It respects every agreement reached. [Franca] In the recent case of the approval of the FSE (Social Emergency Fund), the government had to make an extra effort: The finance minister had to appear on television and almost every minister appeared before Congress. Is it necessary to exert "extra pressure" to get Congress to function? [Hargreaves] No. We work to expedite the agreement, to explain every point as best we can. [Franca] Was the most recent cabinet reform, which took place last week, designed to broaden support in Congress? [Hargreaves] Instead of reform I would rather call it "cabinet change" because the structure was not modified. The appointment of new ministers did not seek to broaden support in Congress. [Franca] What prompted President Itamar Franco to invite General Bayma Dennis to occupy the Transportation Ministry? Why not a politician or an technician in the transportation field? [Hargreaves] The Transportation Ministry, although many may consider it to be so, is not such a technical post. It is more of an administrative post. There will be elections this year and most politicians are running as candidates. Therefore, one cannot chose someone for the Transportation Ministry who will then resign to run for election in a month. As for a technician in this field, no matter how much experience he may have, we would not know how capable he would be of administrating this ministry at this time of budget difficulties with the "difficult" relationship with Congress. We do not deny that the Transportation Ministry is experiencing administrative difficulties. In view of all this, President Itamar Franco decide to chose General Dennis, a military man who enjoys a good relationship with politicians and, on top of that, is a good administrator. [Franca] In view of the "problems" in the Transportation Ministry, was the appointment of Minister Margarida Coimbra, who was a technician, a mistake? [Hargreaves] I would not agree. But I did not belong to the government when she was appointed. [Franca] Does the presence of a considerable number of military men -- on active service or retired -- in the upper and middle echelons of government hint at a possible trend toward the militarization of Itamar Franco's administration? [Hargreaves] Why should all government officials be civilians? Are they not considered equals? That is odd. There is no division. The participation of women and men in the government does not have to conform to a system proportional representation, so why should civilians and military. The question: why military? is always raised. Nobody ever asks: why civilian? [Franca] The Franco administration is civilian and not military. Why then should it insist on that option? [Hargreaves] I can explain that by giving you an example. The Federal Police (whose current director is Colonel Wilson Romao, retired) have always been headed by a member of the Armed Forces -- with the exception of Romeu Tuma and Amaury Galadino. They (the military) have always discharged their duties well. Romao's appointment was made at a time of crisis that called for a speedy reestablishment of discipline, and the military are used to doing just that. [Franca] And how about the Sudene (Northeast Development Superintendency) and the special commission which is investigating irregularities in the executive branch, which are both headed by members of the Armed Forces? [Hargreaves] Let us not close our eyes to the obvious: One must acknowledge that the military are more disciplined and know how to impose discipline. [Franca] Is it easier for Planalto Palace to boss the military around, given the fact that they are more disciplined? [Hargreaves] I would not venture to say that it is possible to put ideas into the heads of the military, I contended that they are more disciplined and can discipline others better than civilians. [Franca] Following your line of thought, if prices were to skyrocket we could find a military man heading the Sunab [National Supply Superintendency] or some other economic department. [Hargreaves] I have no prejudices. [Franca] On the question of government support in Congress, you said the "cabinet reshuffle" did not seek to broaden its support. Does this mean it already has the necessary support? [Hargreaves] I would not say the latest votes reflect the support the government has in Congress. I believe they are related to the government's stance on the subject. This is not the solid support that backs the government. I do not have facts and figures to support this, but we have the backing of congressmen from all parties rather than one party in coalition with the government. [Franca] Given that the government has to work with an unspecified number of congressmen who have the most varied political tendencies, how will negotiations at the Constituent Congress be conducted? [Hargreaves] A Constituent Congress cannot be compared with the ordinary work of Congress. The latter functions in terms of parliamentary support -- government and opposition -- whereas a process involving an amendment to the Constitution has more to do with ideological, programmatic, and even dialectical questions. [Franca] Does the government believe the outcome of the Constituent Congress will measure up to its expectations? [Hargreaves] Yes, it does, it does, (he repeats) it does. The government also believes the outlook can be either good or bad depending on how the vote on political issues goes. If political issues do not fare well, the Constituent Congress may lose all meaning. [Franca] What do you mean by "fare well"? [Hargreaves] That solutions be balanced; vested interests must be left aside or the process will produce negative results. [Franca] What do think about the idea to extend the deadline for ministers and governors to resign from office in order to run for another elective post? [Hargreaves] I would rather not speak about specific projects. [Franca] Three weeks ago, President Itamar Franco stated in Juiz de Fora that "if [Finance Minister] Fernando Henrique [Cardoso] were to run for the presidency he would have the support of the government." Is Planalto Palace endeavoring to turn this hypothesis into reality? [Hargreaves] I cannot answer your question. Planalto Palace's overriding concern at present is the success of the economic plan. If we mix the two, we will give the impression that the economic program is linked to candidacies. They are totally separate.
