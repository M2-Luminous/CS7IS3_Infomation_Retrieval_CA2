This marks the city as one of the hottest attractions in China for thousands of worldwide investors, according to the latest official data. Analysts here attributed the fast expansion of overseas investment in Tianjin to a good environment for cooperation and the local government's policies of opening wider to the outside world. Peter K. Hahnel, German general manager of the Tianjin Henkel Detergent and Cleaning Products Co., Ltd., said that Tianjin has better infrastructural facilities, including transport and telecommunication, compared with other cities across the country. In addition, it has richer water, electricity and raw materials resources. What is more important, he said, is that the city has laid a good foundation for the development of both heavy and light industries. "We can find our best partners here," said Hahnel. The company, a joint venture funded by the German-based Henkel Company, was set up last year. It has an annual production of 92,000 tons of detergent, both for industrial and daily use, with sales of 330 million yuan yearly. He said, "the reason that we could put our new company into operation in a short period of less than six months is mainly because the Tianjin detergent factory had been the biggest and the best manufacturer in north China." "The reason we chose Tianjin to invest in is very simple," Sentaro Negoro, director general manager of the Tianjin (Earth) Chemical Co., Ltd., told XINHUA. "It has a world first-class tin-making manufacturer that enables our products to enter China's market with high quality and low cost," he said. "Earth" is one of the biggest insecticide producers in Japan, employing more than 800 people and registering annual sales of 37 billion yen. It put a total of 830,000 U.S. dollars into the Tianjin venture to develop six kinds of insecticides. While many overseas investors value the industrial bases in the city, other transnational high-tech firms are attracted to the abundance of well-educated workers provided by the numerous institutions of higher learning and research institutes here. After a seven-year investigation throughout China, the U.S. firm Motorola decided to build its company in Tianjin. C. W. Ko, manager of Tianjin Motorola's Human Resource Department, said that the majority of the 1,000 Chinese employees of the firm are graduates from universities and colleges, and many of them have received master's or doctor's degrees. "In Tianjin, we can make contact with all kinds of professional workers our company needs," he said. He said that Tianjin is an old industrial city. The dedication of Tianjin's workers benefits the long-term investment here. Not long ago, after careful scrutiny into the investment environment here, Novo Nordisk, the world's biggest producer of industrial enzymes, invested 250 million U.S. dollars in Tianjin to build a modern biological products plant. Almost all the transnational companies in Tianjin spoke highly of the efforts by the local government to create a good environment for foreign investment. The German Manager Hahnel said the government here knows very well what to do for the foreign investors and how to help them start a business and run it well. An overseas-funded food company said that the government always pays close attention to suggestions and complaints the joint ventures raise, regarding such matters as environmental protection. However, much remains to be done to improve the investment environment in the city. It is not so easy for overseas investors and visitors to find comfortable apartments or office buildings. They often have to wait a long time for accommodations after first arriving. As a result, the city has now stepped up the pace on construction of such buildings. A dozen new buildings are now under construction and expected to be completed in the near future. Some overseas real estate investors have contracted for building luxury hotels here, according to a local official.
