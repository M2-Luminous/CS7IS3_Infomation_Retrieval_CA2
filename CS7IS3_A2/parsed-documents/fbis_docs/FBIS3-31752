V. Stevko, vice president of the Confederation of Trade Unions, said that the KOVO trade union does not feel bound by the agreement because its council placed it under a different obligation. "Unfortunately, at the time of negotiations, when the terms [of the agreement] had already been agreed upon, it is very difficult to speak about new talks," Stevko said, commenting on the decision of the KOVO Council.
