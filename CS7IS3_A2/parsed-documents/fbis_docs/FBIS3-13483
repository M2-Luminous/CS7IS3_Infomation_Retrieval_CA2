In specific terms, it means no slashing of the traditional arms and size of the armed forces themselves. She told the cabinet's defence committee Thursday that the government could not afford to disregard new threats to the security of the country. She was clearly referring to the recent 15 percent increase in the Indian defence budget. The army chief also gave the defence committee details of likely purchase of new arms from China and other friendly countries. It is true that no self-respecting nation can afford to place its security interests in jeopardy, even if it is faced with the most forbidding economic constraints. Unfortunately, the militarisation of the sub-continent is a phenomenon that does not mesh with new realities across the globe. Both India and Pakistan seem to match each other's new acquisition of arms or other military capabilities. This has naturally sent their economies into a tailspin. India owes upwards of $98 billion to foreign creditors; Pakistan, considering the size of its economy, has also amassed a near-impossible figure of $30 billion in foreign debts. There is no knowing exactly how much money is funnelled into defence, but conservative estimates put it, in case of Pakistan, at close to $3 billion; in case of India it could be three times more. These are colossal sums by the third world standards; sums that could have been used for building vital infrastructure, especially that of health and education. The cost of a tank could be used to establish scores of schools in the countryside. Indeed, both nations are dying without having to fight a war. There are few examples of unilateral disarmament in human history; and weaker nations have invariably invited aggression. Unless both India and Pakistan agree to a mutual reduction of arms, peace and prosperity for both will remain an elusive dream. The present high level of military preparedness is bound to push them over the precipice. When we have too many people chasing war against too few working for peace, the road to normalisation must lie through impossible terrain. The international community is now reacting, albeit slowly, to the violation of human rights in Kashmir. Foreign mediation is the only safe bet that can disengage such implacable foes as India and Pakistan. The question is, how long can Pakistan and India go on ignoring the cost to their societies of such immense military expenditure.
