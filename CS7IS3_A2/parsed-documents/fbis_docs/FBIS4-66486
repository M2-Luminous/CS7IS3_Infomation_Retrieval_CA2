FBIS4-66486 "jpjst025__l94003" JPRS-JST-94-025L JPRS Science & Technology Japan 27 April 1994 Advanced Manufacturing Low Cost Desktop Photoforming System Marketed Low Cost Desktop Photoforming System Marketed 94P60231C Tokyo KAGAKU KOGYO NIPPO in Japanese 27 Apr 94 p 3--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 94P60231C Tokyo KAGAKU KOGYO NIPPO Japanese CSO [Text] Denken Engineering has marketed a compact desktop photoforming system, the ``Desk Modeler,'' (trade name) which can create three-dimensional models of three-dimensional shapes simply on an Apple Macintosh computer. The software was developed by Systems Nakashima in collaboration withthe CRC Research Institute. It is a ``three-dimensional copier machine'', according to Hironao Kubo of Systems Nakashima, because the low cost, compact system can produce plastic models from three-dimansional shapes created on the monitor. The system now is able to produce an actual model from shapes created on the Macintosh. Traditionally, only two-dimensional forms could be produced through the use of CAD (computeraided design). The shapes can be easily created using free-form surface modeling software, ``MACSURF.'' Shapes designed by ``MACSURF'' can be produced directly through the photoforming control software, ``Model Bridge.'' Model Bridge was developed especially for this system, and designed for transfer to the ``SLP-4000'' compact photoforming system which produces plastic three-dimensional models. The SLP-4000 was developed by Denken Engineering as a ``desktop size forming machine,'' according to the New Operation Promotion Office Manager Shoji Hiura of Denken Engineering. 600mm[.sup]3[/], the machine is capable of forming objects 200mmxl50mmxl50mm in size. It costs 짜4.98 million. The entire system costs a total of 짜7.68 million, including the SLP-4000 (4.98 million yen), the software MACSURF'(짜1 million), and the software that controls forming (짜1.7 million). The cost of this system is below 1/10 that of a large conventional industrial photoforming system.
