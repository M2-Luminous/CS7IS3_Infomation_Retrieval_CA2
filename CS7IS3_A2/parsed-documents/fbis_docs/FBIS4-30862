It is attended by ministers of foreign affairs from 42 European countries, the United States, and Canada. The Slovak Republic is represented by Minister of Foreign Affairs Eduard Kukan. [passage omitted] In his address, Minister of Foreign Affairs Eduard Kukan noted the political readiness of the Slovak Republic to contribute to the implementation of the Stability Pact by specific steps and by its foreign policy in general. The completion of the transformation of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe is a longer-term process, which can only take place in a peaceful democratic international political environment. The Slovak Republic finds this environment in the European political, economic, and security structures. He stressed that we consider the Stability Pact to be an important contribution to European cooperation that supports a further improvement in international relations, particularly by intensifying and harmonizing cooperation among neighbors. We are confident that the Stability Pact project, which we regard as one of the means of drawing closer toward European Union membership, will contribute to strengthening European security and stability.
