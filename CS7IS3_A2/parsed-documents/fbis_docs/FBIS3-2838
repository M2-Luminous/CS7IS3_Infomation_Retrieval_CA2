These six members were Wan Guoquan, executive vice chairman of the China Democratic League Central Committee and member of its standing committee; Li Gang, vice chairman of the Economic Affairs Committee and member of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC National Committee; Wang Jue, professor of the economics department of the Central Party School; Zhang Jusheng, chairman of the Hefei Meiling Corp. Ltd., (Group); Yan Ruifan, president of the China Guanglian Industrial Corp. Ltd.; and Zhao Changbai, vice chairman of the board of directors of the Shoudou Iron and Steel Company. A ZHONGGUO ZHENGQUAN BAO [China Securities] reporter asked: Some people hold that the stock system is the way to improve large and medium state enterprises, and that listed companies are modern enterprises. What is your comment? Li Gang said: Shortage of capital is one problem facing large and medium state enterprises. So these enterprises can obtain the capital they need through the sale of stocks. Fundamentally speaking, however, these enterprises should become modern enterprises through restructuring and replacing their operating mechanisms. Answering a question raised by a REUTER reporter on his observations about the revitalization of large and medium enterprises, Wan Guoquan said: The key to revitalizing large and medium enterprises lies in clearly defining property rights and responsibilities, separating government from enterprises, and managing these enterprises scientifically. The replacement of operating mechanisms will cause some enterprises certain difficulties, but there should not be any sharp contradictions among government, enterprises, and workers because their interests are fundamentally the same. If everybody strives to surmount difficulties with concerted efforts, certain problems can be resolved. He stressed that large and medium state enterprises were, are, and will remain the mainstays dominating national economic development. A reporter from XIN MIN WAN PAO [New Nation's Evening News] asked: "How are workers' unemployment problems being solved since the Bankruptcy Law was implemented?" Wang Jue said: The government has adopted measures to deal with this problem, such as promoting the development of tertiary industry and speeding up the construction of medium and small cities. As reforms deepen step by step, there will be more and more job opportunities for unemployed workers, and avenues of employment will be broader and broader. Zhang Jesheng, Yan Ruifan, and Zhao Changbai also answered reporters' questions on the competitiveness of large and medium state enterprises after China becomes a GATT member, how state-owned foreign trade enterprises revitalize their operations, and how large and medium enterprises manage their businesses autonomously and accumulate capital.
