In attendance were Comrade Dao Duy Tung, member of the Political Bureau and standing member of the Secretariat of the Party Central Committee; Comrade Nguyen Duc Binh, member of the Political Bureau and secretary of the party Central Committee. Also on hand were comrade members of the party Central Committee: Ha Dang, director of the Ideology and Culture Department; Nguyen Dinh Huong, director of the Internal Political Security Department; Dang Xuan Ky, director of the Institute for Research on Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh Thought; Nguyen Duy Quy, director of the National Center of Social Sciences and Humanities; Le Xuan Tung, deputy secretary of the Hanoi Municipal Party Committee; and many comrade leaders of other departments, ministries, branches, theoretical research organs, newspapers, and magazines.... Comrade Nguyen Phu Trong, TAP CHI CONG SAN editor in chief, reported on the work of the journal in 1993 and its editorial direction in 1994. He stressed: In 1993, TAP CHI CONG SAN made significant progress in the editorial, research, public relations, printing, and distribution areas. Thanks to its attention to research, its linking editorial work with research, and its success in gathering large numbers of contributors, the journal was able to improve the quality of its copy and enhance its theoretical, recapitulative, and militant character. In particular, the journal paid attention to maintaining close contact with life and with burning theoretical and practical issues and propagandized various resolutions of the party Central Committee, the Political Bureau, and the Secretariat, and various major positions and policies of the party and state in a timely, concentrated, and systematic manner. It struggled in defense of Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh thought and in defense of the party's lines and viewpoints, especially in the fight against "peaceful evolution," in the human rights issue, and in the culture, literature and arts, and publication issues. It criticized deviationist perceptions and erroneous viewpoints. The limitations and weaknesses of TAP CHI CONG SAN are: the theoretical quality and scientific content of a number of articles are still poor; some articles still have the look of a specialized report or overemphasize local situations; the general character of its reviews of practice is not yet high enough and the style of writing is obsolete; and some articles are not convincing. Concerning the editorial direction for 1994, the comrade editor in chief announced that the journal will deal more deeply with various theoretical issues of Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh thought and of socialism and the path to socialism in our country. It will attach special importance to reviews of practice and scientific studies and to articles aimed at combating erroneous viewpoints and rectifying erroneous perceptions. In their suggestions, a number of contributors expressed their agreement with and approval of the editorial staff's report and welcomed and applauded the efforts, innovations, and progress of the journal. At the same time, they suggested additional measures aimed at continuing to improve the journal and to improve its quality. A number of comrades stressed that the switch to the market mechanism is both an objective demand and a move that has a direct impact on theoretical research work and on the press and publishing activities. Against this background, TAP CHI CONG SAN has stood firm in its position, has correctly performed its functions, has strictly adhered to its guiding principles, and has satisfactory carried out his task of determining the ideological orientation for all society. At the same time, it has striven to stay in contact with daily life and to touch upon not a few prominent, thorny issues. The journal has overcome the challenge and has recorded remarkable achievements. Its rich content and diversified, lively form have been reflected in all domains. The economic issue, a key, burning problem of society, has been satisfactorily dealt with. With regard to a number of difficult questions such as nationalities, religion, culture, literature and arts, the journal has also carried many articles containing correct viewpoints and written in an adequate style that are "acceptable" to society and the reader.... TAP CHI CONG SAN has increased its circulation of more than 38,000 copies (early in the year) to more than 42,000 copies (at year's end) and has successfully expanded its network of contributors and readership (particularly in the southern region). This is a fact worth rejoicing over. A number of opinions suggested that TAP CHI CONG SAN should maintain the forms of exchange of views, informal talk, and seminar, especially concerning major, difficult issues, and should bring up different opinions and still controversial views to provide information and data so that the party can study them and plan policies. It can coordinate with various departments, sectors, or localities to organize seminars, thereby bringing theory into contact with vibrant life and, at the same time, enriching theory with the realities of life. With a friendly and serious work style, TAP CHI CONG SAN was, is, and will be the rallying point of scientists, theoreticians, and activists, and will become an important bridge between science and life, between scientists and the public at large. The journal's appeal lies primarily in the quality of its copy. In the past, readers might come to TAP CHI CONG SAN simply because they needed or had to understand the party's policies and lines. Today, in the information age, readers come to the journal with much more diversified, variegated needs and aspirations. In particular, they want to find correct answers for and solutions to the bustling, complex life of today. Many contributors expressed their belief that, as a theoretical and political organs of the party Central Committee and with its substantial experience and its strong contingent of contributors, TAP CHI CONG SAN will certainly continue to advance to satisfactorily fulfill the tasks entrusted to it, thereby living up to its readers' confidence. After listening to the aforementioned opinions, Comrade Dao Duy Tung made a statement. With his familiar composed, friendly manner and his simple, incisive way of expression, he said: "A former cadre of TAP CHI CONG SAN who had worked for it for 17 years, from 1965 to 1982 [Footnote: Comrade Dao Duy Tung was editor in chief of TAP CHI CONG SAN from 1965 to 1982 -- (P.V.)], today I am very happy to see the brothers and sisters who work at the journal, and to see the contributors, some of whom have contributed since the years I still worked at the journal." Commending the progress made by TAP CHI CONG SAN last year in the content and quality of its copy, in the intellectual content of the journal, in the renovation of its way of thinking, in the scope of the issues dealt with, and in the educational standard of its writers, Comrade Dao Duy Tung clearly pointed out: TAP CHI CONG SAN has paid attention to linking theory with life and has consciously explained and answered the problems posed by life. Although the quality of its answers is still debatable, the journal has made efforts in this respect, and this is the right direction to follow. The comrade stressed: "Obviously, TAP CHI CONG SAN has made progress in all its content, its form, and its contingent of contributors." Pointing to the weak aspects of the journal, Comrade Dao Duy Tung made suggestions concerning some issues: In its capacity as the theoretical and political organ of the party Central Committee, how many articles of good quality and significant scope has TAP CHI CONG SAN produced by itself, articles that are considered interesting by many people? Has the journal delved deeply into the reality of renovation--from the micro to the macro level--in order to present concrete models in various domains (especially the economic domain) of the path of socialist construction in our country? Has it carried highly scientific and convincing articles to contribute to heightening the confidence of cadres and party members in the path they have chosen, and to overcome the vacillation among a component of cadres and party members in the face of the collapse of the socialist system in the Soviet Union and East European countries? How many articles has it featured that have the effect of guiding various echelons and sectors in correctly implementing the party's common line, and of promptly rectifying the manifestations of deviationism? Everyday, every hour, the opposition forces, using many means, are constantly striking at the ideological base of the party and at the party itself. Have the articles on this issue launched timely and effective counterattacks? With regard to the editorial orientation and tasks of TAP CHI CONG SAN in the coming years, Comrade Dao Duy Tung clearly pointed out: 1. The journal should assert, clarify, and help develop Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh thought. This is an important and pressing task. At present, the Council for the Guidance of the Compilation of the Textbooks of the Scientific Studies of Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh Thought is holding discussions to clarify a number of major theoretical issues such as: the role of Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh thought; observations on the character and content of our epoch; the theory of socioeconomic forms; the theory of surplus value; the theory of the historical position of the working class; and many other concrete issues. The general issue is that we must be able to determine what universal principles of Marxism-Leninism as a revolutionary and scientific doctrine were correct in the past and are still correct at present; what theses conformed to historical conditions in the past but are no longer appropriate now; and what theses were already inappropriate even during the lifetime of Marx and Lenin, including the ones that had been criticized by Marx and Lenin themselves. We must consider what contributions our party has made to the development of Marxism-Leninism in the process of leading the revolution. This is an opportunity for TAP CHI CONG SAN to make important contributions to and to work together with the council to clarify theoretical issues. The journal should establish close relations with the council to secure more favorable conditions for its editorial work. 2. TAP CHI CONG SAN should actively participate in the research on and compilation of articles aimed at providing a scientific basis for the decisions of the Seventh and Eighth Party Central Committee Plenums and the eighth party congress. The Seventh Party Central Committee Plenum will discuss the industrialization issue, science and technology, and development of the working class. The Eighth Party Central Committee Plenum will discuss the rule-of-law state issue, social sciences and the humanities, and some theoretical issues. The journal should closely monitor the requirements and themes being prepared for submission to these plenums in order to formulate appropriate editorial programs. 3. The journal should closely follow the implementation of the seventh party congress Resolution, the Resolution of the party conference of delegates, and the various party Central Committee resolutions. It should grasp important socioeconomic issues in order to write articles to affirm what is proceeding in the right direction and what is deviating from it. With regard to the economy, the journal should carry articles on economic structure, economic sectors, the market mechanism, especially the issue of state-run businesses, the forms of cooperatives in several sectors, private businesses, pricing, banking, money, accumulation, consumption.... Concerning society, the journal should pay attention to the questions of employment, social justice, elimination of hunger and reduction of poverty, division between the rich and the poor.... Special importance should be attached to articles reviewing models, in particular the models of production centers (such as tea, sugarcane, mulberry and silkworm, coffee, rubber production centers...); attention should be focused on models of state-operate businesses and of distribution and circulation in the new conditions; on models of agricultural cooperatives to be built along the line of bringing into full play the strengths of cooperative member households while consolidating and increasing the strength of the collective of cooperative members.... 4. TAP CHI CONG SAN should delve more deeply into the issues of national culture and characteristics and fine national traditions. It should exploit the achievements of our forefathers, not only in the domain of fighting against aggressors but also in other fields such as philosophy, history, science, literature and arts, religion, law, language... 5. TAP CHI CONG SAN has carried, at an early date, articles dealing with the issue of opposing "peaceful evolution" (issue No. 1-1993). But now it should delve more deeply into this matter because this struggle is taking place everyday, every hour, in many fairly virulent forms. 6. Concerning the party, articles in TAP CHI CONG SAN should clearly show that party building is the key task. There are many subjects, but in the immediate future importance should be attached to the question of heightening the vanguard character and raising the party's standards and intellect. The journal should carry articles written in an attractive, persuasive manner to contribute to developing the quality of cadres and party members, upholding the revolutionary ideal, promoting a healthy way of living, and overcoming the manifestations of vacillation and opportunism. In particular the journal must struggle against corruption, smuggling, and wasteful expenditures. In the current complicated situation, TAP CHI CONG SAN should feature convincing articles to struggle against and refute allegations against the party (allegations aimed at opposing the party's ideological system, the party's line, and party organizations; and at enticing, winning over, and corrupting party cadres...). The journal must attach special importance to the subjects concerning the cadre issue in order to gradually improve the quality of our contingent of cadres. Comrade Dao Duy Tung concluded: "In short, we must firmly grasp opportunities, bring into play our advantages, and prevent and overcome dangers in order to achieve at all costs the objectives set by the seventh party congress, not only for up to 1995 but also for up to 2000." On behalf of the editorial staff and the contingent of contributors, Comrade Nguyen Phu Trong sincerely thanked Comrade Dao Duy Tung and promised the party Central Committee that they will satisfactorily carry out the tasks of the journal.
