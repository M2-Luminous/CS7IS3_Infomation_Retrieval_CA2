In initial statements to the media in Montevideo, Foreign Minister Robaina said he told President Lacalle of Cuba's efforts to spur economic openness. The Cuban foreign minister reaffirmed that Cuba prefers investments from Latin American countries but welcomes investments from any country. According to Roberto Robaina, foreign investors find tourism, oil, nickel, citrus, and general agriculture the most attractive areas for investment. Foreign Minister Robaina will conclude his official visit to Uruguay on 6 April, when he will travel to Argentina, Ecuador, Peru, and Paraguay. The visit to Paraguay is unofficial because Cuba does not have diplomatic relations with that country.
