Lobacheva, expert, under the rubric "Light Industry": "Survival Strategy"] [Text] The shortage of raw materials and the enormous debt of customers to textile industry enterprises have brought this sector of the economy to the verge of collapse. In the opinion of experts, the existence of domestic light industry depends largely on the strategy which the sectors' leaders adopt: to focus the main efforts on getting state subsidies or on raising the efficiency of their own production by mobilizing internal resources. But it is not easy to do this when we consider that on the world market domestic output is not very competitive and demand within the country has sharply declined. Moreover, the indebtedness of textile industry enterprises' on bank credits today totals 243.6 billion rubles [R], while customer indebtedness to enterprises totals R245.8 billion, which includes overdue debts of R101.4 billion. Textile workers, in turn, owe their suppliers R146.4 billion. In the best years Russia produced 5.8 billion square meters of cotton fabric, 600 million square meters of flax [linen], 522 million of wool, and more than 1 billion of silk. It is estimated that in 1993 2.2 billion square meters of cotton fabric, 330 million square meters of flax, 220 million square meters of wool, and 650 million square meters of silk were produced. In our opinion, the situation will change very little in 1994. The problem of marketing finished output and the higher prices and shortage of raw material will be the main reasons for the crisis in the sector. By the start of the fourth quarter, deliveries of raw materials under intergovernmental agreements were 60-percent fulfilled, while certain agreements were not fulfilled at all, although purchase prices for raw materials are approaching the world level: for wool--80 percent and for cotton--80-100 percent of the price on the foreign market. In 1993 the export of Russian textiles to the European Community [EC] countries was virtually suspended, which was explained formally by the expiration of the 1989 agreement on textile trade between the USSR and the EC. In fact the reason for it was the general economic decline in Western Europe, which was reflected to a greater degree in the textile industry, and that led to termination of textile exports to the EC from third countries. The development of textile exports in 1994 will be complicated by the fact that Russia is intending to sign a treaty on partnership and cooperation with the EC where a special clause stipulates that Russia will commit itself not to exceed established quotas for supplying certain types of textile goods. We have about 30 such categories: from cotton fabrics to output with a higher degree of processing--raincoats and suits. In general, export quotas today suit producers, but textile capacities may grow and it will become necessary to increase our own exports. The tendency of domestic and world prices for output to converge continues, although at the present time this sector still has the largest gap between the levels of domestic and world prices of any sector; on the average prices for Russian output are 12-13 percent of the world prices. The most complicated situation has taken shape in the cotton subsector, which is completely dependent on imported raw materials. Here the decline in production totals 33 percent of the 1992 level. The allocation of R95 billion worth of targeted credit to buy raw cotton, negotiations with Uzbekistan, and the government's decree "On the Purchase of Imported Raw Cotton for State Needs" have not changed the situation in the sector. One of the ways to develop the sector proposed by the Ministry of Economics is technical re-equipping in order to produce competitive output and the involvement of defense enterprises with their technical and intellectual potential within the framework of the conversion program. In October of the fourth quarter, production of cotton yarn grew by 10.8 percent and of cotton fabrics--by 1.3 percent; and it is estimated that at the end of the year, the level of production had reached 82 percent of the 1992 level. In 1994 production volumes in the cotton cloth industry will depend on deliveries and purchases of raw materials, but according to specialists' estimates, no sharp drop in production is expected. Because of the need to buy imported raw materials, prices are expected to rise and approach world prices, while at this time domestic prices are 10-30 percent of world prices. Because of purchasing raw materials at future world prices, the rate at which prices for final output approach world prices will increase. Dynamics of Production of Wool Yarn in Russia Dynamics of Prices for Wool Yarn In 1993 the decline in wool production totaled about 1 percent of the 1992 level. In October 1993, production of virgin wool rose by 10.7 percent and of wool yarn--by 10.3 percent (relative to the January 1993 level, production volumes almost doubled). For wool fabrics, during the year one could trace an absolutely clear pattern of seasonal consumption and shaping of the production program based on specific consumer orders. From January through April, production rose by 11.5 percent, from May through August production dropped by 17 percent, and since September production growth is again apparent. On the whole production in 1993 remained at the 1992 level. Domestic prices for wool, wool yarn, and fabrics on the whole underwent a general uptrend and the index in October was 118, while in November prices rose by 10-20 percent. Domestic prices are 75 percent of world prices for wool, 74 percent for wool yarn, and 13 percent for wool fabrics. In 1994 a fairly stable situation is anticipated in the wool sector's production, since it provides most of the profits and a corresponding share of revenue for the budget in the textile industry structure. The present situation in the flax sector is complicated by the fact that at the end of September 1993, only 42 percent of the volume of flax of the 1992 harvest had been gathered, despite the targeted credits to flax processing plants, hemp mills, and seed growing stations through the overall credit for the agroindustrial complex. Twenty percent of the needed raw materials were bought as imports at enterprises' expense. On 25 August 1993, the government decree "On Development of the Federal Target Program `Rebirth of Russian Flax'" was adopted. In accordance with this program, production of flax-cotton yarn, which has the most profitable and promising export potential, is supposed to be developed. This program envisions terminating import purchases, including imports purchased with state resources. In practice this means accelerated growth in 1994 in prices for linen fabrics (because of greater demand) and production's dependence on world prices for raw materials (short and long flax fiber) as well as our own flax harvest. World prices for flax fiber are on the average 4 U.S. dollars, yarn--up to 18 U.S. dollars, and fabrics--up to 8 U.S. dollars. On the average Russia's domestic prices are 10-40 percent of world prices depending on the raw materials used. In 1994 prices will obviously rise on the average 3- to 3.5-fold, which will make them substantially closer to world prices. In 1993, according to the estimates of ITKOR [Institute of Commodity Movement and Conditions of the Wholesale Market], the level of production of silk fabrics was 88 percent. But 446.011 million linear meters were produced in the first 11 months of 1993 (94 percent of the expected volume). Prices for silk fabrics rose an average of 10-fold, which is explained by both the rise in raw material prices and the sharp rise in prices for energy media. Exports of virgin wool fabrics in 1993 totaled 60 percent of the 1992 level; this is related to higher export tariffs as well as the drop in production volumes. Demand for virgin wool fabrics is largely determined by their high price, and no change in the structure of demand is foreseen in 1994.
