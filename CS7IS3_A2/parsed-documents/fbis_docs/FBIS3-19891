Mr John Major said yesterday that he wants Germany to play "a full part" in next year's VE-Day commemoration which will include a service in St Paul's and the parade through the capital. The Prime Minister's comments reflect his concern to ease German feelings over their exclusion from this summer's D-Day celebrations and he has told Herr Helmut Kohl, the German Chancellor, that it is the 1995 end-of-war services which really count. Herr Kohl is still smarting at his exclusion from plans for Western leaders to mark the 50th anniversary of D-Day with an Allied service of remembrance at Normandy. His efforts to secure a place at the service were roundly rebuffed as other governments protested that D-Day celebrations should be restricted to those countries whose men died trying to liberate Europe and that a German presence would not be fitting. In an effort to salve German pride Mr Major has stressed the importance of the 1995 celebrations to Herr Kohl, saying that would be the right occasion to mark the years of reconciliation and friendship which followed the Nazis' defeat. Yesterday he showed his wish to avoid further offence in a Commons written answer to Sir James Spicer, the Tory MP for Dorset West. He said the commemoration in Britain on May 7, 1995, "will be the occasion to celebrate the 50 years of peace and reconciliation we have enjoyed since 1945." Mr Major said: "During that time we have developed extremely close relations with our allies and partners in Germany. We very much hope Germany will play a full part and be represented at a high level in the 1995 commemorations." He went on to list the main events in the commemoration as a parade in central London, a service in St Paul's and a lunch or dinner for the heads of government who attend. Downing Street sources said that the plans were still at an early stage and refused to rule out the possibility of German troops or even ex-servicemen taking part in the parade . Inviting members of the present German armed forces could be considered a suitable alternative and far less controversial than allowing German veterans to join the parade. MPs would argue that such men would represent the new Germany with which Britain is a close ally rather than the old enemy. The proposals provoked a mixed reaction among Tory MPs, particularly those who served with the Armed Forces. Sir James, a retired major who served in the Royal Fusiliers and the Paras, backed the decision. "We want to see a coming together and a remembrance of the past in order to avoid it ever happening again," he said. But Sir Teddy Taylor, the Tory MP for Southend East, said: "There are still many people in Britain who have suffered severe loss of their loved ones -- fathers, sons, brothers and sisters -- and we should remember their tragedy first."
