The total tonnage built in the year was 1.3 million. Wang Rongsheng, president of the China State Shipbuilding Corporation, in giving these figures said that half of the ships built last year were exported. China's annual ship-building capacity is expected to be doubled by the turn of the century, he added. The industry will seize every opportunity to quicken the pace of international cooperation and to promote ship-building to take part in competition in the market, in order to meet an increasing need for ships worldwide, he said. Wang said that key projects for the five major shipyards' expansion, including the Jiangnan and Guangzhou Shipyards, will be completed this year. He added that a 200,000-dwt [deadweight tons] dock at the Dalian Shipyard and several other 100,000 dwt docks or piers will also start construction in the new year. He also said that China's efforts in the ship industry have been focused for the past 15 years on the import of advanced technology, the expansion of ship-producing capacity, and the export of more ships. He said that the orders which China has received for new ships now ranked among the biggest in the world.
