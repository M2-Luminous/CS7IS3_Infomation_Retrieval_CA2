The minister is currently in Juanchaco inspecting the controversial projects with some congressmen. [Begin recording] [Vergara] How do you feel about the upcoming political trial against you and the president? [Pardo] I have absolutely no doubts; no legal or political doubts. There is nothing dishonorable about this, nothing I would term as a mistake. Our actions have always been based on a legal interpretation that we consider correct, and also on factors of convenience that we consider important. [Vergara] Did the president know about this agreement? It has been said that he did not know about it; that his signature appears on the document but that he knew nothing about it. [Pardo] The president is aware of how these agreements are established. He is aware of how military cooperation procedures are handled. The president was not consulted about the content of this memorandum of understanding because that would have been a deviation from normal procedures. This is directly under the jurisdiction of the Defense Ministry. [end recording] [Vergara] Minister Pardo and the congressional Foreign Relations Committee are inspecting Juanchaco to determine what projects are actually taking place in that region.
