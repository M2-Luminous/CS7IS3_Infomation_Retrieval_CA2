Talking to newsmen, Shakhray did not name the dates of the meeting between the leaders of Russia and Chechnya, but noted that such a meeting should be prepared. Taking part in an all-Russia Conference on Federalism and Interethnic Relations, Shakhray emphasised that relations with Chechnya will be regulated on a negotiatory basis with bodies of power and all political forces, and will include free and fair democratic elections in the republic as a legal way out of the political crisis." Shakhray said that the State Duma had accepted the Russian president's logic and has reproduced it in a resolution. The government has been directed to hold consultations with Chechnya's power bodies and political forces. The object of the consultations will be the draft treaty on the delimitation of subjects of control and authority. The treaty will be signed under the condition that Chechnya holds the elections, the deputy emphasised. There is no other way to "overcome the decision adopted by the Fifth Congress of People's Deputies on the illegality of elections in Chechnya," according to Sergey Shakhray. At the same time, he explained that at the present, no ultimatum is being issued as to when and under what conditions the elections are to be held.
