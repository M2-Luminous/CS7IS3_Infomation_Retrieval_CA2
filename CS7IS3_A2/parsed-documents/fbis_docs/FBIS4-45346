This is compounded by the lack of cooperation among the three levels of government. In the interview with PROCESO, Ruffo also expresses his doubts regarding the Colosio case, and his concern over the murder of the Tijuana municipal police chief, Jose Federico Benitez Lopez, as well as the arrest of Sergio Ortiz Lara, the state's deputy attorney general. As for the drug trafficking problem, the governor claims: "It is a very serious problem. It is dreadful from the standpoint that the criminals' interests should be implicated in police organizations. Where the drug traffic is concerned, enormous sums of money are being transacted. It has been proven on many occasions (because there have been remands, many of them made by Dr. Carpizo) that officials or members of the attorney generals' offices were implicated. I believe this to be the main reason that it has been impossible to put an end to the drug traffic: because this collusion has existed." He adds that, in Baja California, there have been situations wherein doubts existed regarding various officials, as in the specific case of Deputy Attorney General Ortiz Lara. [passage omitted] "After so much comment and speculation, I decided to replace the attorney general (Juan Francisco Franco, who has been cited as a protector of `narcos'). I said to myself, there is no need for me to put up with doubts, when there has been no complicity by my government or, specifically, by me personally. I place no limit on clearing up any doubts concerning my organization; that is my intention. I wish this also held true in the case of the federal organization." [passage omitted] He proposes the formation of joint police forces, consisting of municipal, state, and federal agents, under a common command ("in this case it might be federal, but it does not matter"), with two subcommands, one municipal and another state, that would report to the governor and the mayor. "In this way, all of us would know what was going on everywhere." PROCESO: The current lack of cooperation ultimately benefits the criminal organizations, doesn't it? Ruffo: Yes, because they are organized with just one purpose; in that sense, they are united. We have three levels, and there are some huge gaps between one level and another. [passage omitted] PROCESO: The PGR [Attorney General's Office] has accused state officials and agents of being involved in the drug traffic. What information do you have about federal personnel in the same situation? Ruffo: I have received much information to that effect. The fact is that, for judicial reasons, such information does not constitute evidence. But we all know the story; you reporters know it. However, the problem is to prove it in court. And we have no testimony, because those who would give it die. PROCESO: The finance minister, Pedro Aspe, commented in Washington recently that the drug traffic has permeated all levels of the Mexican security forces. He claimed that, in Tijuana, "the judicial system is so corrupt that, every time a drug trafficker is arrested there, an attempt is made to remand for federal crimes, so as to take the subject to Mexico City, because all the judges in Tijuana have been bought." Is that the way it is? Ruffo: What I am saying isn't much different from Aspe's statement. So, I am particularly concerned, because a town in my state is involved, but.... PROCESO: Is Aspe correct? Ruffo: He is correct to a great extent. And I feel helpless with this responsibility, because organized crime is one thing, and natural crime is something else. It is up to me to investigate the latter, because it belongs to the common jurisdiction; whereas the former comes under the federal jurisdiction. But, if there is no cooperation, it is like climbing stairs with one foot: you go along balanced on one side, and cannot even move, because you will fall. That is why I harbor very great expectations (based on reason, however, because I have often had futile enthusiasm) for the Public Security Coordinating Board that President Salinas has just announced, headed by Farell. I have heard negative comments about Farell, but you must admit that he is a precise, tough, thorough fellow. And this is not a matter of political parties; it is a national public security issue. So, I hope that the bases underlying that cooperation can solve some of what I have described. [passage omitted]
