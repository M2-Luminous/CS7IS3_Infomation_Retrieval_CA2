Bobrakov, under the "Political Prognosis" rubric; place and date not given: "It Isn't All Gloom: Zhirinovskiy Will Not Be President and The Communists Will Not Return to Power"] [Text] At times of trouble people readily turn to all sorts of prophets -- from astrologists to those who read the future from playing cards. Today's guest, Doctor of Historical Sciences Sergey Vladimirovich Volkov, does not resort to supernatural forces. Nevertheless, his predictions are distinguished by their remarkable accuracy. His opinions have usually been at variance with the chorus of commentators and "forecasters" of the most diverse views. Admittedly, his predictions are not widely known because, being "different" from everyone, he appeared most often in small-circulation publications and until recently, like a dissident of the Brezhnev era, he has been published mostly in foreign emigre newspapers. Back in January-February 1991, when everyone began talking about Gorbachev's "coup" (some in exultation, others in panic), he claimed that such a thing was impossible, that the country's disintegration was just a few months away, and that after the transfer of real power by Gorbachev into the hands of the republic authorities he would inevitably become redundant and be dropped. Despite the widespread convictions that "the Army will not let itself and the country be destroyed" he was sure that it could not do anything about it. At the end of 1991, when everyone, including experts from the CIA, was expecting -- some with fear, others with hope -- that a "social explosion" would follow the release of prices, he expressed the conviction that Yeltsin could sleep easy in his bed because the Communists' hopes of coming to power at the head of a "people's uprising" were absolutely groundless. Conversely, at the time of the complete "obedience" of the vice president and the Supreme Soviet, the author of this forecast said that the real danger to the regime could only come from a section of its own structures which would form a compact with the opposition or evolve into national-bolsheviks. [Bobrakov] Nevertheless, Sergey Vladimirovich, why are your forecasts so astonishingly accurate? After all, you predicted the results of the elections to the Federal Assembly with an accuracy of within 5 percent. [Volkov] To assess a specific political situation you simply have to know, first, how in principle people of a certain outlook will behave in situations of a certain type and second, what that given person's outlook is and what that type of situation is. I cannot know a great many specific situations (because I am not one of the "initiated") but if I have at least 60 percent of the significant information for any given situation I can hardly go wrong. You have to know how to compare reliable facts, which by no means everyone can do properly, not even those who possess the full set of information. The most important thing here is not to succumb to emotion or to extrapolate from one's own political preferences, something which more than 90 percent of people who presume to judge events are clearly incapable of doing. [Bobrakov] What role does your profession as an historian play in the way that you view the situation? I have heard, by the way, that you were virtually the youngest ever doctor of historical sciences.... [Volkov] That is probably right. I defended my thesis when I was 34, but I am a historian mainly in terms of my way of thinking. History for me has been a natural pastime since childhood. It contains the key to the understanding of all things. After all, people have not changed in millennia.... But I became a professional historian quite by chance. As a writer once said, "I wrote simply because the sorry times prevented me from acting." [Bobrakov] You correctly predicted the results of the elections to the Federal Assembly. How did you envisage the breakdown of social forces in the country in mid-December? Did any surprises emerge for you in this respect during the voting? [Volkov] It was quite obvious 12-18 months ago that in any even remotely free elections the greatest chance of success would belong to those who are associated with the "third force," that is, neither the "democrats" nor the "Communists." The organizers of the elections did everything possible to prevent the participation in the elections of those parties which could have a real claim to that kind of image. The requirement to collect 100,000 signatures in just two-three weeks was aimed precisely against them because those parties were still very weak organizationally or had only recently been created. Consequently, the only contender for the role of the "purely patriotic" party was the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR] which won the votes of all those who did not want to vote either for the democrats or the Communists. Some people thought that if the patriotic idea seemed to be a base caricature people would not vote for it. These were vain expectations. The very idea is so natural and appealing that they even voted for the caricature. The argument "down with everyone" was fairly widespread. I have always said (including in ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA a year ago) that the patriotic idea would sooner or later prevail, its victory was inevitable because it is at the basis of any normal statehood. And if the present regime cannot identify itself with it, someone else will do so and, furthermore, the best chance will belong to those who are customarily called the "red-browns." What is surprising about that: If you do not want to be patriots yourselves, if you say nothing and prevent the "civilized" patriots from appearing "in public" -- well, that is how you get Zhirinovskiy.... The LDPR's "own" constituency comprises not more than 10 percent and not less than 5 percent, the rest has been handed to it by the authorities. There are no surprises here. The democrats' tactics -- to run in several blocs rather than pooling everything with Gaydar and his "Choice" -- produced the expected success. Had they pooled everything with Gaydar, such a unified bloc would have hardly gained more that 30 percent of the votes; but in the event they gained twice as much because a sufficient number of people were successfully persuaded that the other democratic parties were something different from the extremely unpopular "mainstream" democrats. (One of the most comical results have been the expressions of regrets about the "split" among democrats.) Yeltsin himself is one thing, the "democrats" are something quite different. Yeltsin would win a presidential election right now, because he enjoys the support of about 30 percent of the total population and of about 40-50 percent of those who go to vote. Without Yeltsin, the "democrats" can count on just about 20 percent of the total population and on about one-third of its active section, but when the question of the threat of communist restoration is raised, this number may double because the overwhelming majority of the population are, of course, in principle "in favor of reforms" (but not in favor of "the democrats"). But Zhirinovskiy is also in favor of reforms.... [Bobrakov] What political maneuvers can be expected in the immediate future from the leaders of parties and movements? What will be the final disposition of forces in the new parliament? What will be the future of parliament in general? [Volkov] This is not a very interesting subject to discuss because, under the Constitution which was adopted (thanks, incidentally, to Zhirinovskiy), parliament will hardly mean anything. There will be a lot of noise, there will be merriment, and many are already preparing for some decent amusement. It is obvious that, without the LDPR, the Communists will be unable to block a single decision. As regards the LDPR itself, provided it displays loyalty to Yeltsin (unless he behaves the way the mass media did in the first few days after the elections), Zhirinovskiy is hardly likely to fall out with the president. So far he has been on Yeltsin's side at the most critical times -- on the question of disbanding the Supreme Soviet, on the question of the Constitution -- and people prefer to bashfully "overlook" this. As a matter of fact, Yeltsin gained the most from the election results. Some people were getting ready to write him off and contest the presidential seat, but now it is obvious that they would not get anywhere without him, he remains their sole protection. Of course, not a single democrat would be willing to cooperate with the LDP, but this is what will happen objectively if they want to pursue the reforms and if the reforms are indeed the main issue for them. The Communists will be against, whatever happens. There are virtually no issues on which the democrats could unite with today's Communists against the LDPR. But there is nothing to prevent Zhirinovskiy uniting with the reds. And he will certainly do so if the campaign against the LDPR does not cease. [Bobrakov] How about trying to look a little further into the future? How do you, in general outline, imagine the development of the system of the country's political administration, and the future of Russia as a whole? [Volkov] I am convinced that if Russia remains in existence it will, sooner or later, return to the path of natural development, and that legal continuity as regards historical Russia will be restored. Proper political activity is only just beginning. Genuine figures and parties, unassociated with the Soviet past, are only just emerging. I do not think that they could be "benched" for any length of time in the conditions of a normal democratic process. After the third of fourth election they will succeed in gaining a fitting place in the political spectrum and will determine Russia's state development. They do not even have to win the majority of votes -- if we assume that the "democratic Russians" win 40 percent and the "red-browns" win another 40 percent, the decision in each specific instance will actually depend on the remaining 20 percent. But if this process is thwarted and an "executive authority" remains in power over the next 15-20 years, the return to the natural path of development will be secured by someone from that environment (maybe even faster than through the sequence of parliamentary elections). Because, as a rule, the realization of the need for such a return dawns more quickly on would-be "autocrats" and the victor is the one who manages to effect it earlier and more successfully. At the risk of dissociating myself from the panic chorus, I would dare to assert that Zhirinovskiy will never become president and the LDPR will never gain more than 30-40 percent of the votes, just as the Communists will never regain power peacefully, running under their own name. At present, there are three possible options: 1. The presidential power will learn the lesson it has been taught, it will realize what are the population's more or less true feelings, and it will find it better to evolve in the direction of more appropriately meeting the country's state interests, without letting itself be overtaken by the "patriotic" horse. 2. It will succumb to pressure from the "democratic Russians" and will ostentatiously back the bankrupt "Russia's Choice" as the sole "correct" party, bringing itself face to face with the need to disband parliament again, considerably reducing in the process its chances of enjoying the Army's support in the event of fresh actions by national-bolsheviks. 3. It will let the radical democrats in parliament sort themselves out with the LDPR and the Communists, while it relies on pragmatic-patriotic elements in the government. The third option is most likely to succeed, because at present the government circles contain the largest number of realistic people whose position was also objectively consolidated as a result of the elections, and there has been a significant enhancement of their role as a balancing force.
