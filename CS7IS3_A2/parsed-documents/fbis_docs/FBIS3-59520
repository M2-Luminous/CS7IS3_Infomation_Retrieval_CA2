The preservation and expansion of microelectronics research and production in Germany is thus particularly important, indeed an absolute necessity," stressed Research Minister Dr. Paul Krueger at the laying of the foundation stone for the Fraunhofer Institute of Silicon Technology (ISiT) in Itzehoe. All economic forecasts in the major industrialized regions placed information technology at the top of the market size and growth rate league over the next 30 years, he continued. As a country with few raw material resources of its own, Germany could maintain its position as one of the leading industrialized countries only by virtue of advanced technological achievements. "Our chance lies in investing in our intelligence and creativity," said Dr. Krueger during his speech, which we print below in a slightly abridged form. Our Chances Lie in Research-and-Technology-Led Innovation With the founding of the new Fraunhofer Institute, the Federal Government and the Land of Schleswig-Holstein have decided on an investment in one of the major areas that will safeguard the future of our country: The establishment of the new research institute is a contribution to the preservation of Germany's status as a center of microelectronics research and production. It is an important landmark in the midst of a difficult economic situation. Many general economic factors have contributed to the economic slump that Germany has experienced in 1993, although this slump also reveals structural weaknesses in German economic competitiveness. The Federal Cabinet has adopted the Report on German Economic Competitiveness, which addresses this issue. Companies in Germany have reached the point where they can bear no further costs. The economic framework conditions -- and regulations in particular -- place them at an international disadvantage. Germany is also facing increasing competition from suppliers with more favorable cost structures and from high-tech supplies of better and better quality from Southeast Asia. We must grasp opportunities to improve these framework conditions -- such as rendering work schedules more flexible -- although our chances of achieving a profound change in our locational conditions are limited. As a country with few raw material resources of its own, Germany will therefore be able to maintain its position as a leading industrialized country only by virtue of advanced technological achievements. Our chance lies in investing in our intelligence and creativity. Our opportunities will come from research-and-technology-led innovation. Preserving Germany's Status as a Center of Microelectronics Research and Production The preservation and expansion of microelectronics research and production in Germany is particularly important, indeed an absolute necessity. Microelectronics is an indispensable key technology for major markets. All economic forecasts in the major industrialized regions place information technology at the top of the market size and growth rate league over the next 30 years. Although a semiconductor chip often accounts for only a few percent of the value of an overall system, it acts as a catalyst for development in many areas of technology. In 1990, electronic components worth 3.5 billion German marks [DM] influenced sales worth DM726 billion in the mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, precision mechanics, and office equipment/EDP [electronic data processing] sectors. A few days ago, I presented the results of a comprehensive Delphi survey on science and technology development trends over the coming 30 years. Indeed the survey was carried out by a Fraunhofer institute on behalf of the BMFT [Federal Ministry of Research and Technology]. It points to dynamic growth prospects in microelectronics, although it also reveals that, in the view of the experts interviewed, Germany has fallen considerably behind Japan and the United States in research and development. Ground Lost in Research Is a Cause for Concern Ground lost in research is a cause for concern, as it will lead to loss of ground in tomorrow's markets. Germany and Europe already present competitive weaknesses in microelectronics, as we know. German industry currently accounts for a mere six percent of the world market in information technology goods. Only two-fifths of Western Europe's semiconductor chip requirement can at present be produced in Europe. However, Germany still has a good chance of acquiring a substantial share in the growth of the microelectronics market. To this end Germany's strengths -- such as the microsystems engineering sector -- should be built on. This in turn means that the state, science, and industry must maintain a dialogue on common goals and strategies to ensure that the new technologies will be developed and put jointly into practice. ISiT Expands the Microelectronics Research Infrastructure By funding the ISiT, the Federal Research Ministry is expanding the public microelectronics research infrastructure. The new institute will take its place among the BMFT-funded Max Planck Society institutes, the major research facilities, the Fraunhofer institutes, and the Blue List establishments. The BMFT currently spends nearly 40 percent of its information technology budget on funding nonuniversity research facilities. Microelectronics research capacities in the new federal laender have already received a considerable boost in recent years with the founding of new Blue List institutes and seven Fraunhofer Society institutes or regional branches. One of the BMFT's purposes in funding research facilities is to enhance regional research capabilities. As we all know, research does not take place in a vacuum. It thrives on a multiplicity of contacts and on the exchange of ideas. Links with the local environment are particularly strong, as many studies show. The ISiT will have a considerable impact on industry in Itzehoe and northern Germany and will, I am pleased to say, make a major contribution to growth in this area. The German User Industry Needs Guaranteed Access to Microelectronics The new Fraunhofer Institute forms an integral part of the Federal Ministry of Research and Technology's information technology funding strategy. I am firmly convinced that the ISiT is a viable, pioneering concept. The institute will work at the interface between public research facilities and corporate research, focusing on technologies that integrate not just circuits but whole microsystems with various functions -- mechanical, electrical, optical, or chemical -- into silicon. The user industry in Germany needs guaranteed, timely, and formality-free access to these microelectronic systems. The technical skills required to master the large number of difficult technical processes involved in producing these application-specific components ought to be preserved in Germany. The ISiT provides research capacity primarily for firms that cannot embark on long- term research of their own, nor wish to do so; primarily small and medium-sized enterprises, I imagine. I hope that industry will take up this offer and play an active role in shaping the institute's future program. Great Opportunities for Regional Growth Once the investment phase, funded, in accordance with the successful Fraunhofer Society model, by the federal and land governments, has been concluded, the ISiT will earn its living on the contract research market. The institute's long-term future lies in the entrepreneurial responsibility of the Fraunhofer Society. The success of the ISiT will contribute to the development of a successful microelectronics research scene in Germany, which will enable Germany to claim its share in future markets. As a country with high labor costs, Germany can only safeguard its prosperity if it is at the forefront of international technical development. The production of high-technology goods creates great opportunities for regional growth, which should be exploited. Achieving this goal requires a joint effort in all quarters. It is essential that targets and strategies be established on a joint basis. An unconventional example of how this can succeed has been achieved with the establishment of the ISiT.
