Statistics shows that the provincial discipline inspection commission and supervision department received reports on some 679 corruption cases from the masses in the period between late August and late November last year. Some 84.8 percent of the province's cadres at provincial department or bureau level and some 97 percent of the province's cadres at county or provincial department section level conducted anticorruption self-examination in the same period with the result that some cadres voluntarily handed over credit cards, coupons, and souvenirs given to them as gifts, admitted such past wrongdoings as enjoying above-standard reception and free meals during inspection tours of grass-roots units, accepting special local products given by grass-roots cadres on Lunar New Year Festival, and so on, and put forth measures of straightening out those malpractices. Their correct approach was appreciated by the broad masses of cadres and people. Qinghai's anticorruption success is also proven by the fact that the province has made much headway in investigating and handling corruption cases. According to incomplete statistics, in 1993, discipline inspection and supervision departments in the province placed on file for investigation and prosecution some 514 corruption cases, of which some 402 cases were wound up, with the result that a total of 154 party members who had violated discipline were penalized, of whom 64 were expelled from the party. One was a cadre at provincial department level and 13 were cadres at county or provincial department section level. A total of 59 cadres were disciplined in accordance with the relevant administrative rules, of whom five were cadres at county or provincial department section level. Moreover, the province also investigated and straightened out those malpractices that had caused strong resentment among the masses with the result that some 601 economic entities run by party or government organs at the county level were screened, of which 22 were abolished or ordered to suspend operation, six were ordered to become enterprises, and 11 were ordered to be leased to other units. The provincial authorities are presently studying ways and means of severing ties between those remaining economic entities on the one hand and the party or government organs at county or provincial department section levels on the other.
