Commissions are to check about 250,000 19-year-olds. Doctors say that an increasing number of young men suffer from psychological disorders. [passage omitted] Among those who attend the consciption commissions, less than half, about 120,000, actually reach the Army. The remainder manage to avoid military service thanks to postponements or on medical grounds. [Begin Colonel Kazimierz Cieslik recording, main Military Medical Commission] In the past three years, personality disorders were the main reason for being unfit to undergo military service. Whereas in the 1980's this reason was recorded in 15 percent of cases, the figure has now risen to 27 percent. [end recording] [Correspondent] On the list of ailments, second place belongs to eye defects, and third to bad posture and hearing problems. More than half the conscripts think that their time in the Army is time wasted. They also fear the discipline and harassment from soldiers from earlier conscriptions. [passage omitted] The majority of young men believe that the Polish Army should be a professional army. They think that those serving should be those who want to be in the Army and who are predisposed toward it. But there are not many chances of such an army being created in Poland. [passage omitted] Just a few years ago, basic military service in Poland lasted two years; service in the Navy could be as long as three years. Today military service lasts 18 months. The General Staff has announced that, as early as next year, it might be possible to shorten it to 12 months.
