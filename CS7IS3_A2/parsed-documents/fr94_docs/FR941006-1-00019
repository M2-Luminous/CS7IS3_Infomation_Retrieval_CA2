(a) General Prohibition _A market maker shall not effect a transaction involving a covered security for its own account, directly or indirectly, at a price at which the market maker could execute a customer limit order it is holding without executing the customer limit order at the limit price or a price more favorable to the customer, under the specific terms and conditions by which the order is accepted by the market maker. (b) Exceptions. The prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply to the following customer limit orders: (1) ``all-or-none'' customer limit orders, provided that the number of shares executed by the market maker is less than the number of shares in the customer's all-or-none order; or (2) odd-lot customer limit orders. (c) Definitions. For purposes of this section: (1) The term all-or-none refers to a condition placed upon a customer limit order that instructs the market maker to either execute all of the shares in the order at the specified price or execute none. (2) The term covered security shall mean a NASDAQ security that has been designated a National Market System security pursuant to ยง240.11Aa2&hyph;1. (3) The term customer limit order shall mean an order to buy or sell a security at a specified price or a price more favorable to the customer, that is not for the account of either a broker or dealer; provided, however, that the term customer limit order shall include an order transmitted by a broker or dealer on behalf of a customer. (4) The term market maker shall have the meaning provided in Section 3(a)(38) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(38)). (d) Exemptions. The Commission, upon request or upon its own motion, may exempt, by rule or by order, any market maker or any class of market makers from the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section with respect to any limit order or class of limit orders, either unconditionally or on specified terms and conditions, if the Commission determines that such exemption is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors.
