President Clinton and Rabin urged PLO Executive Committee Chairman Yasir 'Arafat to resume the talks with Israel. In a joint news conference with Rabin at the end of their talks yesterday, Clinton said that he believes that 1994 can still be the year of peace in the Middle East. He added: We are now closer to an agreement than we were a year ago, but further away from a peace agreement than we were a month ago. For his part, Rabin urged 'Arafat to end his boycott of the talks on Palestinian autonomy in occupied Jericho and the Gaza Strip. In a separate development, the spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassy in Cairo has asserted that the U.S. stand on the status of the occupied city of Jerusalem has remained unchanged. In a statement to the Voice of America radio yesterday, the U.S. official denied the statement Israel Radio has attributed to U.S. President Clinton, in which he reportedly said that his country views the unified city of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. She emphasized that no U.S. official has made such a statement.
