FBIS4-32246 "dreeu120_p_94009" FBIS-EEU-94-120 Daily Report 22 Jun 1994 POLAND _O_UD, KLD Unite in Freedom Union _O_UD, KLD Unite in Freedom Union 94P20813A 94P20813A CSO [Editorial Report] The 23-24 April unification congress of the Liberal Democratic Congress (KLD) and the Democratic Union (UD) resulted in the formation of the Freedom Union (Unia Wolnosci or UW). The name, suggested by former Deputy Prime Minister Leszek Balcerowicz and evoking an element of romanticism," a common aspect in Polish culture, was approved by a vote of KLD and UD members present at the unification congress. While the unification resolution itself was supported by an overwhelming majority of the delegates, 130 amendments to the newly adopted party statute were proposed at the congress. Leadership Former UD leader Tadeusz Mazowiecki was elected chairman of the new party according to a precongress arrangement by party leaders. Despite the fact that the KLD's Donald Tusk received 10 votes more than Mazowiecki in the balloting for chairman, Tusk was named to the post of UW deputy chairman, instead. The congress also elected 100 representatives to the party's National Council (Rada Krajowa), with 73 from UD and 27 from the KLD, among them former Privatization Minister Janusz Lewandowski, former Labor Minister Michal Boni, former Prime Ministers Jan Krzysztof Bielecki and Hanna Suchocka, and prominent Sejm Deputies Jacek Merkel and Jacek Taylor. The UW's 11-person presidium includes, in addition to Mazowiecki and Tusk, Wladyslaw Frasyniuk, Hanna Suchocka, Jan Maria Rokita, Bronislaw Komorowski, Bronislaw Geremek, Jan Litynski, Janusz Lewandowski, Pawel Piskorski, and Waldemar Kuczynski--a mix of left, right, and center, "just the way Tadeusz Mazowiecki wanted," according to Dominika Wielowieyska, writing in the 26 April GAZETA WYBORCZA. Former Internal Affairs Minister Komorowski, described in a 4 May RZECZPOSPOLITA interview as a "Christian Democrat ideologue" by fellow UW member Wladyslaw Frasyniuk, was elected UW general secretary. As reported in the 25 April GAZETA WYBORCZA, Mazowiecki and Tusk promised that the new party would have "a clear, distinctive face." UW Profile In the above-mentioned 25 April article, GAZETA WYBORCZA described the new party as center-oriented, "with a slight tilt to the right." Deputy Chairman Tusk emphasized that the party should "steer a center course" and build "a strong, consistent opposition" to the ruling coalition. He noted that "all we have to do is say that we are the opposition that embraces all those who are for freedom and against those seeking to strip us of this freedom, that we are against collective farming and we are for privatization, against socialist Poland and for the Third Republic." Mazowiecki reiterated that only the UW can be an alternative to the ruling coalition "that came to power only by criticizing the governments of the past five years, while the moral right to govern belongs to those who fought for the freedom." The Freedom Union's unification declaration, as reported in the 26 April GAZETA WYBORCZA, strongly criticized the past six months of governing by the leftist coalition, calling it "a lost time for Poland," underscoring the government's "halt of privatization" and "increase of the debt," while it was "simultaneously centralizing power, creating new privileges and alignments, and promoting political criteria in administration. In the economic sphere, the congress assured the continuation of the economic reforms begun by the Mazowiecki government in 1990. According to the 26 April GAZETA WYBORCZA article, the UW is "against raising taxes and limiting competition," supports reprivatization, and maintains that the state should not differentiate economic conditions "based on political pressures and tactical interests." In the 4 May RZECZPOSPOLITA interview, Komorowski said that "there is not much difference" between the UW's program and that of the precongress UD and KLD individual programs because "it originated as a result of many discussions between the two parties." Komorowski added that the "main elements" of the program are "strong support for a free market and democratic reform." "Social Liberal" Faction In a move that clearly revealed the continuing ideological differences within the party, Jacek Kuron, former labor minister in Hanna Suchocka's government and an advocate of social programs for the underprivileged, declined to participate in the elections for the new party leadership, stressing that no party should be composed solely "of friends of the market" (UD) and "friends of the entrepeneurs" (KLD), "with no friends of the people." Kuron said that the new party may still be capable of creating an "ethos of civilization that might yet win the support of other groups and of a broader electorate." He expressed doubts, however, that the liberals (from the KLD) will be able to think in broader terms of "the state." In particular, Kuron opposes curbing the powers of trade unions, saying "demands for decent pay are worth listening to." (GAZETA WYBORCZA 25,26 April) Post-Congress Commentaries Commentaries representing various points of view in major publications assessed the chances of the new party. A commentary in the 30 April POLITYKA by Mariusz Janicki highlighted the congress's usage of "strong anticommunist rhetoric" emphasis on unity, and confidence that "every educated, unprejudiced and non pro-PRL [pre-1989 People's Republic of Poland] person will vote for it." The Freedom Union has, in Janicki's opinion, a chance to be an alternative to the ruling coalition, especialy now when, in Mazowiecki's words, "the governing coalition cannot hide its absurdities, ineptness, and rash decisions." Boguslaw Mazur, writing in the 8 May issue of the Poznan weekly WPROST, a magazine that entertains leftist views, observes that "the Christian-democratic/liberal group has the dominant role in the UW leadership," whereas that faction represented by Frasyniuk and Zofia Kuratowska, more social-democratic in tone, is in the minority. Mazur predicted that the latter faction may yet leave the Union, allowing the center-right group of Jan Maria Rokita, former chief of the Council of Ministers in the Suchocka government, to become the major force. In the 6 May RZECZPOSPOLITA, Jan Szomburg, president of the Gdansk-based Institute of Research on the Market Economy and a KLD activist, cites some of UD and the KLD's past weaknesses, asking why UD, "the strongest intellectual party in the postcommunist world, was unable to communicate the sense of reform to the average voter. Szomburg noted that recent polls show that only 30-40 percent of the people consider themselves advocates of the free market. He questions the UD's "lack of communication, arrogant language, and absence of a clear message" and asks why there was such an expectation on the party's part that society would put its complete trust "in the hands of an elite." Szomburg is also critical of the KLD, calling it "a party that payed more attention to style than to substance, too inclined to political pragmatism that somehow watered down the party's identity." Szomburg added that a proreform program with a clear strategic vision leading to the completion of the economic and political reforms is necessary in order for the Freedom Union to be succesful. Such a vision, according to Szomburg, requires a dose of romanticism," to which Freedom Union "is no stranger." While the UD garnered just under 11 percent of the vote in the September 1993 parliamentary elections, the KLD's 4-percent support left the party under the 5-percent threshold required for parliamentary participation. As reported by WPROST magazine in its 8 May edition, recent polls show that Freedom Union enjoys the support of 22 percent of the electorate, mostly among people between the ages of 20 and 39.
