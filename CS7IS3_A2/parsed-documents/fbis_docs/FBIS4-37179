Our correspondent in Paris, Rula al-Zayn, met al-'Umari and had this conversation with her before she left for the Libyan capital. [Begin recording] [Al-'Umari] Two weeks ago, I received and accepted an invitation after talking to the French lawyer Michel Juber, who advised me to accept the invitation. Mr. al-Qadhdhafi will do his best, he promised me in his recent letters, to look for my husband, who is a Libyan citizen. [Al-Zayn] Have the Egyptian authorities answered your questions on the circumstances of the abduction? [Al-'Umari] The Egyptian authorities initially acknowledged that Mansur was abducted, which is a known fact because he was attending an official conference. Afterward, they never talked about the incident. On the contrary, President Mubarak tried, as they say, to absolve himself of responsibility. From the legal point of view, since he was abducted from Cairo, Egypt is the prime responsible party to me and to the world. I wrote to ministers and French President Mitterrand and received a reply from Foreign minister Alain Juppe. A week ago, I received another message from Alain Juppe and President Clinton. In his message, President Clinton told me that they will not fail to pressure Egypt to discover the obscure facts. [end recording]
