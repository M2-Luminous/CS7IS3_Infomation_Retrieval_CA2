That is why, the Foreign Ministry does not even know what state is the most efficient economic partner for Russia, he added. In the words of Andrey Kozyrev, a single state strategy for Russian entrance to the world market has not been elaborated since the time of Eduard Shevardnadze was Soviet foreign minister. "If we receive a corresponding concept from the minister of foreign economic relations, we could act in the Russian economic interests. Politics always influences the economy," said Kozyrev.
