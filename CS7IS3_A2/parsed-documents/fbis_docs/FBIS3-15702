In an exclusive interview he told Interfax that by using its constitutional right to declare an amnesty the Duma "hit Russian society where it hurts. This will obviously stir up confrontation processes in Russia." In his words, "without legally evaluating the activities of state criminals who were guilty of organizing the shelling of the former Supreme Soviet, the Duma members and some senior officials wanted to be rehabilitated in order to escape responsibility. This action makes more confrontation and destabilization possible with a view to removing the leading political figures, Rutskoy, Khasbulatov and Makashov, with simultaneous threat of retribution if these men stage a comeback." He forecast that "the next step will be an all-out assault on the Presidency. When nearly everybody tries to unseat him, the Russian president will find it hard to stay in power. The scenario of these activities includes neutralizing Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin to be followed by discrediting and removing him from the political scene." The Chechen leader appreciated the stance of former prosecutor general Aleksey Kazannik as that of a "courageous and honest man who cannot trifle with the law even once."
