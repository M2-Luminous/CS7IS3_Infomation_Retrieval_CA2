As of the end of 1993, some 320,000 private security staff were guarding companies and private homes in Japan, reflecting a rising awareness of security and a soaring demand for surveillance, the agency said, while the number of police totaled about 223,000. The agency said the private security boom has been fueled by the spread of the five-day work week, with facilities remaining closed during the weekend, and an increasing number of the elderly feeling uneasy about safety. The number of private security staff first outstripped that of police officers in 1990, when it reached 230,000 guards. Since 1972, the year when a law on private security companies was enacted, the number of firms has increased ninefold to 7,062, with a corresponding jump in staff by 7.8 times to an overall 321,721. The 1993 figures represent a year-on-year increase of 7.4 percent for the number of companies and a 10.4 percent rise in staff. Women made a slight inroad into the male-dominated security business in 1993, boosting their share to 5.9 percent, or 18,880 guards, from 5.2 percent. In 1993, the security business registered a record 1.56 trillion yen in annual turnover, a slight increase over the previous year. The business has also profited from a diversification trend. Private guards nowadays work as bodyguards for politicians and prominent people, direct traffic, monitor festivals and other events or accompany cash deliveries and the transport of hazardous goods. Private guards were involved in more than 200 on-the-spot arrests and joined police investigations into some 170 cases last year, the agency said.
