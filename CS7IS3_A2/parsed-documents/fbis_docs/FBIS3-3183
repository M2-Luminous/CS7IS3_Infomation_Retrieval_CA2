Around the Spring Festival, accompanied by Xie Fei, a member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and secretary of the Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee, and Huang Huahua, deputy secretary of the Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee, Yang Shangkun travelled to Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Guangzhou, and Foshan on an inspection tour, visiting the Shekou Industrial Zone, the Guangzhou Economic and Technological Development Zone, a construction site in western Zhuhai, large state enterprises, and Sino-foreign joint-venture enterprises. During the tour, he listened to reports by local party and government leaders on completed work and the situation and had cordial conversations with cadres and other people. Yang Shangkun praised Guangdong for the changes it had brought about every year, saying that every year sees bigger changes in Guangdong. In the late 1970's, Yang Shangkun held a leading position in Guangdong. He said: "At that time, the central authorities decided to set up special economic zones in Guangdong and introduce special policies to encourage businessmen from many countries to invest in Guangdong or to cooperate with China in economic development, thus effecting an earth-shaking change. Facts have proven that the principle and the policies of reform and opening up are entirely correct." Yang pointed out: "The state will promulgate many major reform measures involving many fields this year. As we are pressed for time and have arduous tasks to attend to, we must take care to study new problems, overcome new difficulties, sum up new experience, and do our work more energetically and in a more prudent and better way." He hoped Guangdong will strive for greater successes in economic development. During the inspection tour, Yang Shangkun especially praised Guangdong for training a large number of competent cadres. He said: "A number of cadres, especially the entrepreneurs I have met here, are very competent and very young, with some of them only a little over 30. This indicates that there is no lack of successors to carry on our cause. They are where our hopes lie." Yang's stay in Guangdong coincided with the tenth founding anniversary of the Guangzhou Economic and Technological Development Zone, so he went there to visit and to listen to a work report. Over the last 10 years, the zone has spent 4.35 billion yuan on capital construction, introduced foreign capital of $790 million, and set up 195 industrial enterprises, whose total output value is 11.5 billion yuan, total export value is $1.17 billion, and profits of 3.2 billion yuan with tax delivered to the state amounting to 900 million yuan. Yang praised the Guangzhou Economic and Technological Development Zone for its high-speed construction. He said that it is necessary to launch more support projects related to water and electricity supplies, transport, and the production of raw and semi-finished materials, adding that in introducing advanced technologies and equipment, efforts should be made to raise the level of localizing imported equipment to build up greater power for sustained economic development. While in Guangzhou, Yang climbed to the 63d story of the Guangdong International Hotel, the tallest building in China, to enjoy a full view of Guangzhou. Catching sight of many tall buildings standing in great numbers and the incessant stream of vehicles in the streets, which shows Guangzhou has initially developed into a modern city, he said happily that the scene on this side was unique. He hoped that Guangzhou would be built into a more beautiful and modern city. During the tour, Yang also visited the Shenzhen Anke Company, the Huawei Company, the Guangzhou Baoyuan Limited Company, the Guangdong Fotao Group, Guangxin Jiangwan Stock marketing department, and other high-tech and financial enterprises and wrote inscriptions of encouragement.
