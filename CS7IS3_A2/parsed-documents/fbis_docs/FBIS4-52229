The ruling amounts to only a legal opinion given to the Government and can be challenged in court. It is a rejection of the claim by the US Government that Universal Insurance (known in Thai as Phaisan) is a Thai company that happens to be 99.84 percent owned by Americans. US Ambassador David Lambertson has repeatedly argued in meetings with Thai ministers that Universal Insurance should be allowed to operate branches. More recently, he has also argued that if Universal is indeed an American concern, then it should be exempt from the restrictions of the 1992 law under special rights granted to Americans through the 1966 Thai-US Amity Treaty. A US official said yesterday the embassy understood from discussions with ministers during the period when the law was being drafted that it would allow rights granted to Americans before the law was enacted to be maintained. The official said that since the embassy had yet to receive the report, there was no official American response. He pointed out, however, that the Government need not abide by the council's interpretation of the law. The council made the determination last month but only notified the Commerce Ministry on Wednesday. It would appear to terminate the company's plan in seeking approval from the ministry to upgrade its 11 representative offices as branches unless the Americans decide to test the ruling in court. According to secretary-general Watthana Ratanawichit, about 70 legal experts of the council in a meeting last month decided that Universal Insurance was an American company because 99.84 percent of its shares are owned by the American International Group, which includes the largest life insurance company in Thailand, American International Assurance (AIA). The council's experts also ruled that Universal was not protected by the 1966 treaty because the 1992 law supersedes the special rights granted to Americans under that treaty. The law requires insurance companies to have foreign shareholdings of no more than 25 percent if they are to be considered Thai with the full rights enjoyed by Thai companies. They reasoned that the treaty's status was inferior to the 1992 law because Parliament's legislation should reign supreme. The Americans have argued that Universal should be treated as a Thai concern because it was set up under full Thai ownership and registered as Thai before it was later taken over by the American International Group (AIG). Local insurance companies, maintained Mr Watthana, are regulated and controlled by the Life Insurance Law and the Non-Life Insurance Law of 1967 -- amended in 1992 with the ministerial regulations setting out the maximum foreign shareholding permitted. The report received by Sanit Worapanya, acting permanent secretary for Commerce, said that if the Government allowed such cases to be protected under one treaty which conflicts with domestic law, it would infringe on the country's sovereignty. Mr Watthana said the only way for the treaty to sustain legality would be for the treaty to have been enacted by Parliament at the same time as the law. He said the decision made over the case was final and the council would not review the case -- even if requested by the ministry. He also predicted that the firm would have only a slim chance of victory in court because 70 legal experts of the country have reached a unanimous opinion. [passage omitted]
