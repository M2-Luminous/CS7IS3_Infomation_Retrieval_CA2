FR940720-0-00047 FR940720-0-00003 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;216&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;8973; AD 94&hyph;15&hyph;02] Airworthiness Directives; McDonnell Douglas Model MD&hyph;11 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment supersedes an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain McDonnell Douglas Model MD&hyph;11 series airplanes, that currently requires inspections to verify the installation of shear pins, shear pin retainers, and shear pin retainer attaching parts in the aft end of the center pylon thrust link, and repair, if necessary. That AD was prompted by a report that both shear pins that attach the aft end of the center engine pylon thrust link to the tail pylon were missing. This amendment adds inspections to verify that the shear pin retainer attaching parts are tightened within specified limits; and adds a terminating modification for those inspections. This amendment also expands the applicability of the rule to include additional airplanes. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent structural damage to the engine mount structure, which could lead to loss of airplane components. DATES: Effective August 19, 1994. The incorporation by reference of McDonnell Douglas Alert Service Bulletin A54&hyph;31, Revision 1, dated June 3, 1993, as listed in the regulations, is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of August 19, 1994. The incorporation by reference of McDonnell Douglas Alert Service Bulletin A54&hyph;31, dated September 17, 1992, as listed in the regulations, was previously approved by the Director of the Federal Register of November 2, 1992 (57 FR 47991, October 21, 1992). ADDRESSES: The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from McDonnell Douglas Corporation, P.O.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) by superseding AD 92&hyph;23&hyph;03, amendment 39&hyph;8403 (57 FR 47991, October 21, 1992), which is applicable to certain McDonnell Douglas Model MD&hyph;11 series airplanes, was published in the Federal Register on March 17, 1994 (59 FR 12558). The action proposed to continue to require repetitive visual inspections to verify the installation of the shear pins, the shear pin retainers, and the shear pin retainer attaching parts in the aft end of the center engine (No. 2) pylon thrust link. It also proposed (1) to add repetitive inspections to verify that the shear pin retainer attaching parts are tightened within specified limits; (2) to delete the previously provided ``optional terminating action'' (which consists of a one-time verification for tightness of the nuts of the four shear pin retainer attaching bolts); and (3) to require eventual replacement of the existing retainer and attaching parts with a new retainer and attaching parts, as terminating action for the currently required repetitive visual inspections and the proposed repetitive verifications of tightness. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received. One commenter supports the proposal. The Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, on behalf of one member operator, and the manufacturer request that the proposed AD be revised to indicate that the 60-day repetitive inspection specified in paragraph (a) and (b) be required only until either the initial verification for tightness (of the shear pin retainer attaching parts), the terminating action, or an FAA-approved repair is accomplished. These commenters state that the FAA already has approved repairs applicable to paragraphs (a) and (b) of the proposal, which have consisted of the installation of new parts. New parts obviously will be tightened upon installation; therefore, reinspection of the tightness of these parts within 60 days appears to be unwarranted. The commenters request that the repetitive interval for the inspection for installation of parts be revised to 18 months in order to be consistent with the recommendations of Phase 2 of the original issue of McDonnell Douglas Alert Service Bulletin A54&hyph;71. The FAA concurs in part with the commenter's request. Upon further consideration of the procedures specified in the referenced service bulletin, the FAA concurs that a 60-day repetitive inspection interval is not necessary in certain situations, explained as follows: Paragraphs (a)(1) and (b)(1)(i) of the final rule apply to situations where the shear pins, shear pin retainers, and shear pin retainer attaching parts have been inspected and found to be installed. The FAA finds that inspections to verify the installation of these parts must be repeated every 60 days, so long as there is no other action accomplished that will ensure the tightness of the attaching parts. These inspections for installation may be terminated, however, when the initial verification for tightness of the shear pin retainer attaching parts is accomplished in 18 months in accordance with paragraph (c) of the rule; or when the terminating modification described in paragraph (d) is installed, if earlier than 18 months.
