FR941220-1-00015 FR941220-1-00005 This airplane model is manufactured in Germany and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the LBA has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the LBA, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop in other Schempp-Hirth Cirrus and Cirrus VTC sailplanes of the same type design, the proposed AD would require modifying the airbrake actuating lever and replacing the airbrake system coupling balls. The proposed actions would be accomplished in accordance with the service information referenced above. The FAA estimates that 21 sailplanes in the U.S. registry would be affected by the proposed AD, that it would take approximately 1 workhour per sailplane to accomplish the proposed action, and that the average labor rate is approximately $60 an hour. Parts cost approximately $25 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,785. This figure is based on the assumption that no affected sailplane owner/operator has accomplished the proposed modification and replacement. The FAA believes that several of the 21 affected sailplane owners/operators have already accomplished the proposed action, which would reduce the FAA's proposed cost impact upon the public. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action has been placed in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES . List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. The Proposed Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. ยง39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding a new AD to read as follows: Schempp-Hirth: Docket No. 94&hyph;CE&hyph;17&hyph;AD. Applicability: Cirrus and Cirrus VTC Sailplanes, certificated in any category. Compliance: Required upon the accumulation of 500 hours time-in-service (TIS) or within the next 20 hours TIS after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs later, unless already accomplished. To prevent airbrake system failure caused by broken coupling balls on the airbrake actuating lever, which, if not detected and corrected, could result in sailplane controllability problems, accomplish the following: (a) Modify the airbrake actuating lever and replace the airbrake system coupling balls (located on the actuating lever) in accordance with Schempp-Hirth Technical Note No. 265&hyph;10, dated November 5, 1992. (b) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with sections 21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. (c) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the initial or repetitive compliance times that provides an equivalent level of safety may be approved by the Manager, Small Airplane Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service, FAA, 1201 Walnut, suite 900, Kansas City, Missouri 64106. The request shall be forwarded through an appropriate FAA Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Small Airplane Directorate. Note: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Small Airplane Directorate. (d) All persons affected by this directive may obtain copies of the document referred to herein upon request to Schempp-Hirth Flugzeubau GmbH, Krebenstr. 25, D&hyph;7312 Kirchheim/Teck, Germany; or may examine this document at the FAA, Central Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106. Issued in Kansas City, Missouri, on December 14, 1994. Barry D. Clements, Manager, Small Airplane Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service.
