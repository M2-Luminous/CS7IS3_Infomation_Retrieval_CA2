The budget plan, endorsed at a cabinet meeting for submission to the Diet in early March, earmarked 73,081.7 billion yen for the year beginning April 1, up a scant 1 percent from the current year's initial budget. This is higher than a 0.2 percent growth in the initial 1993 budget, stemming largely from special accounting techniques such as advanced repayment of loans extended to local governments to boost the budget by some 4,520 billion yen. Without these measures, the overall program could have posted a contraction of some 5 percent, Finance Ministry officials said. More clearly showing the constraints imposed by sluggish tax revenues amid the prolonged economic slump, general operating expenditures, the core of the budget, are limited to 40,854.8 billion yen, up 2.3 percent or the lowest rise since fiscal 1988. But in a bid to shore up the economy, the government maintains a growth rate in public works spending of 4 percent for the third straight year, with a figure of 8,984.6 billion yen, up 4.0 percent, and includes cuts in income tax and other taxes worth 4,377.0 billion yen. As a result, the government is to issue deficit-covering bonds for the first time in five years to raise 3,133.8 billion yen. Among other core outlays, the plan earmarks 4,683.5 billion yen for defense spending, an increase of 0.9 percent which is the lowest in 34 years, and 1,063.4 billion yen for Official Development Assistance (ODA), up 4.8 percent to mark a record low. Outside the general operating expenditures, debt-service costs will shrink 7.0 percent to 14,360.2 billion yen, and tax grants to local governments will contract 18.3 percent to 12,757.8 billion yen. The plan also calls for repayment of 1,544.8 billion yen in funds borrowed from the national debt consolidation fund to cover revenue shortfalls in fiscal 1992. On the revenue side, the government estimates tax revenues will amount to 53,665.0 billion yen, down 12.5 percent, and nontax revenues 5,601.1 billion yen, up 104.8 percent, and that it will get 172.5 billion yen, down 7.5 percent, in proceeds from the sale of shares in the privatized Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. New bond issuances are to rise 67.8 percent to a record 13,643.0 billion yen, including 10,509.2 billion yen in construction bonds, used primarily for public works, and deficit-financing bonds. As a result, the debt dependency rate will rise to 18.7 percent from this year's 11.2 percent, and the outstanding balance of bonds will top 200 trillion yen for the first time to reach some 201 trillion yen, up from 182 trillion yen.
