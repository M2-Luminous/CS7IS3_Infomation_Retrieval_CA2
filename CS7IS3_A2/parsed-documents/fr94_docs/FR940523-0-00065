FR940523-0-00065 FR940523-0-00014 Sections 765.21 (a)&hyph;(c) provide that the Department will conduct a preliminary review of each claim within 60 days of the claim submittal deadline to determine if additional information is necessary. The Department may audit documentation used in support of the claim or request additional information or clarification necessary to verify any information provided by the licensee in a claim for reimbursement. In addition, the Department may request an informal conference with the applicant and, if necessary, with NRC or an Agreement State, to obtain information or clarification concerning any aspect of a claim. While the applicant is not required to provide additional information or clarification requested by the Department, a failure to do so may result in the denial of that portion of the claim for which information is requested. The Department will conduct a final review of all relevant information to make a reimbursement decision. The Department will notify the claimant of its decision regarding a claim within 10 days of completing the final review. Sections 765.21 (f)&hyph;(g) discuss the timing for processing and for payment of reimbursement requests. Reimbursements will be made on a prorated basis if there are insufficient funds available to reimburse all claims in full. Amounts not initially disbursed will be paid on a prorated basis, until satisfied in full, as funds become available. All outstanding, approved claims will be paid on the same prorated basis, regardless of when the claim was submitted or approved. Payments will be provided from the Fund, as required by the Act. Payment or obligation of funds shall be subject to the requirements of the Anti-Deficiency Act (31 U.S.C. 1341) as specified by §765.21(g) of this rule. Following each annual appropriation by Congress, the Department will issue a Federal Register notice informing licensees of the availability of funds for reimbursement and whether the Department anticipates that approved claims for that year may be subject to prorated payment. Section 765.21(h) requires an officer or other authorized official of a licensee to certify the accuracy of a claim for reimbursement, and subjects the individual making the certification to Federal statutes which provide civil and criminal penalties for making false claims. 3. Section 765.22␣Appeals Procedures Section 765.22 requires a licensee to utilize the Department's administrative appeals process (see 10 CFR part 205, subpart H) to appeal any Department determination required by this rule, including decisions that: (1) Determine tailings quantities of dry short tons of byproduct material or the Federal reimbursement ratio; (2) deny, in whole or in part, any claim for reimbursement; or (3) require modification of or reject a plan for subsequent remedial action. Any appeal must be filed with the Department's Office of Hearing and Appeals (hereinafter ``OHA'') within 45 days after the licensee receives notice, actual or constructive, ( i.e. , by a publication in the Federal Register ) of the Department's determination. OHA is a quasi-judicial body that reports to the Secretary of Energy and, except as otherwise provided by law, is responsible for conducting informal adjudicative proceedings of the Department, where there is a provision for separation of function. In connection with these duties, OHA holds hearings, receives evidence, develops a record, and issues a final determination, which is the Department's final decision, subject to review in the federal courts. A licensee must file an appeal in order to exhaust its administrative remedies, and the receipt of an OHA decision is a prerequisite to seeking judicial review of any determination made under this Part. 4. Section 765.23␣Annual Report The Department will prepare an annual report, available to the public, summarizing pertinent information from the preceding year regarding the reimbursement program. The information may include, but not be limited to, individual and aggregate reimbursement claims approved and paid, approval of plans for subsequent remedial action, completion of particular elements of remedial action at active sites, total amounts paid and remaining for reimbursement, and other information. Licensees should be aware that any information submitted in a claim for reimbursement may be subject to public disclosure, through the annual report as well as by specific request, in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and all other applicable requirements. Subpart D_Additional Reimbursement Procedures 1. Section 765.30␣Reimbursement of Costs Incurred in Accordance with a Plan for Subsequent Remedial Action Section 765.30 of Subpart D establishes procedures for reimbursement of costs incurred in accordance with a plan for subsequent remedial action approved by the Department. Reimbursement of costs incurred after December 31, 2002 shall be subject to the submission by the licensee of a plan for subsequent remedial action and approval of the plan by the Department. Each licensee seeking reimbursement of costs of remedial action to be incurred after December 31, 2002 shall submit their plan to the Department for its review and approval at any time between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2001. The plan must include an estimated total cost and schedule for remedial action as well as all applicable requirements of remedial action established by NRC or an Agreement State to be performed after December 31, 2002 at an active uranium or thorium processing site. Each licensee will be required to provide reasonable documentation or other information to support its estimate of costs to be incurred. The Department may approve, approve with modification, or reject any plan submitted by a licensee. At any time following submittal of a plan, the Department may request additional information from the licensee, and may consult with NRC or an Agreement State concerning remaining remedial action requirements contained in the site's approved reclamation plan. If the Department rejects a plan, the licensee may file an appeal pursuant to §765.22 or submit revised plans for review by the Department, until a plan is approved, or until September 30, 2002, whichever occurs first. The Department has established September 30, 2002, as the deadline for submission of any potential revised plans so that the Department will have sufficient time to review the submittals and designate available amounts on deposit in the Fund for reimbursement by December 31, 2002 consistent with section 1001(b)(1)(B)(ii) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 2296a(b)(1)(B)(ii)). A failure by a licensee to receive approval from the Department of a plan for subsequent remedial action prior to December 31, 2002 will preclude that licensee from receiving any reimbursement for costs incurred after that date. Costs incurred in accordance with the requirements of a plan for subsequent remedial action, and approved by the Department, will be reimbursed in an amount equal to the approved cost multiplied by the site's Federal reimbursement ratio, until such time as the Department determines that its obligation under Title X to reimburse the licensee has been satisfied. 2. Section 765.31␣Designation of Funds Available for Subsequent Remedial Action Section 765.31 establishes procedures for reimbursement of costs incurred in accordance with an approved plan(s) for subsequent remedial action.
