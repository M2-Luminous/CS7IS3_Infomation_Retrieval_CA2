Inevitably, this issue will be at the center of the talks that National Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis will have next week in Washington with his U.S. counterpart, William Perry, following a last-minute upgrade of the visit by the United States. He will also meet with State Department officials, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, and National Security Adviser Anthony Lake. It is certain that besides the issues of Aegean and Greek-Albanian relations, the agenda will include the situation in the Balkans. According to initial estimates by government circles, with the State Department statement on the 10-mile airspace the U.S. Government chose to "attack" the substance of the problems in the Aegean, which include the Turkish challenge of Greek airspace since 1974 with systematic infringements and violations by Turkish fighter planes. The point that for the Greek side is not yet "clear" is whether the recent U.S. move is an initiative by that country itself following the refusal of Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias to discuss U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's proposal for disarmament of Greek planes in the Aegean or whether it is a "promotion" of Turkish positions by the U.S. side. Even though the Greek Government's reaction to the American and Turkish sides yesterday was made in low tones, it insisted on Greece's firm position to defend its sovereign rights in the Aegean. [passage omitted] The Greek Foreign Ministry reacted through diplomatic channels with representations from the Greek ambassador in Washington to the State Department and from Ambassador Khristos Zakharakis, Foreign Ministry director general, who called U.S. Ambassador in Athens Thomas Niles into his office. According to information from diplomatic circles, the Greek Government wants to make it clear to the American side that it has no intention of causing an incident with Turkey in the Aegean. On the contrary, it intends to reestablish a low-level bilateral dialogue with Ankara, as it was agreed in principle during the recent meeting between the foreign ministers of the two countries, Papoulias and Hikmet Cetin, on issues that concern both countries but that do not challenge sovereign rights, such as Greek airspace.
