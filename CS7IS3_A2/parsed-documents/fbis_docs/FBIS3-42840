Reports on this matter were presented by Leonid Kravchuk and Minister of Foreign Affairs Anatoliy Zlenko. The president confirmed his prior statement that the Moscow Declaration was now one in a series of documents already adopted by Ukraine on the road to a nonnuclear status, and that it is "a political compromise by the three powers on the fundamental questions of nuclear disarmament." Kravchuk also declared that the declaration also meets the fundamental stipulations of the parliamentary decree. The explanation Leonid Kravchuk gave for the fact itself of the advent of this document was that Ukraine, which had not joined the Nonproliferation Treaty, had found itself at the brink of international isolation. [Passage omitted] In the end, the necessary majority voted in favor of the Supreme Council's decree, consisting of two items. It is stated in the first item that with regard for the measures proposed by Leonid Kravchuk for implementing the parliamentary decree of 18 November of last year, and for the steps taken in response by Russia and the USA, Ukraine was "lifting the stipulating concerning Article 5 of the Protocol to the Strategic Offensive Arms Treaty, signed in Lisbon on 23 May 1992." By the second item the Ukrainian Supreme Council charged the government to exchange certificates of ratification of the START-I treaty and to concurrently begin the work of signing specific agreements on the procedure and conditions of Ukraine's nuclear disarmament, foreseen by other stipulations of the 18 November parliamentary decree. A decision was made not to examine the matter of Ukraine's annexation to the Nonproliferation Treaty as a state not possessing nuclear weapons until special discussion of the text itself of the Nonproliferation Treaty in parliament. It is now becoming obvious that on one hand Ukraine has taken yet another step in the direction of the world community on the road of nuclear disarmament, since it lifted its parliamentary stipulation concerning Article 5 of the Lisbon Protocol, which requires Ukraine's annexation to the Nonproliferation Treaty as a nonnuclear state. As we know, it was stated in that stipulation, dated 18 November of last year and designated as No 3, that "Ukraine does not consider itself to be bound by Article 5 of the Lisbon Protocol." But now this stipulation has been lifted, and Ukraine has declared its readiness to fulfill the Lisbon Protocol. However, on one hand Ukraine is clearly in no hurry to exchange ratification certificates on the START-I treaty, since other stipulations of the said decree, which foresee the signing of a number of international agreements, remain in effect. Among them are agreements on international guarantees of Ukraine's national security, on the conditions of economic, financial, scientific and technical aid in fulfillment of the START-I treaty, on guaranteed servicing of Ukrainian nuclear weapons by Russian specialists, on reexamining the conditions of financing inspection activities foreseen by the said decree, on the possibilities for using missile silos for peaceful purposes, on the conditions of using weapon materials from eliminated nuclear weapons, and on guarantees of compensation for the material value of these components. In addition the stipulations separately require compensation for tactical nuclear weapons, and the signing of a special agreement on the conditions and priority of transfer of nuclear ammunition to Russia and on coordination of the schedule for this transfer. In his concluding remarks Leonid Kravchuk told the deputies that he received a letter from Bill Clinton, who promised to double the amount appropriated for the destruction of Ukrainian missiles. It was announced that a group of experts from the USA, Russia and Ukraine will begin work as early as in February. They will determine the value of the exported tactical nuclear weapons, and the procedure for paying compensation to Ukraine. Valentin Lemesh, chairman of the deputy commission on problems of defense and state security, told reporters: "We have taken one more step, and now let them take a step in our direction, let them give us something else besides talk, and begin appropriating at least some sort of assistance." The official interpretation of the adopted degree has not yet been made public, but it is clear that the decision reached by the deputies will have significance both to the internal political life of Ukraine and to the world community. In its opposition to executive power and the president, by collective effort the parliament took at least three important steps: The image of Leonid Kravchuk as the sole peacemaker and unquestioning proponent of Ukraine's nonnuclear status was severely shaken in the eyes of the Ukrainian public. The Supreme Council confirmed that blame for the current economic situation, which has placed Ukraine on the brink of nationwide catastrophe, lies not only with the parliament but also with the president, and ultimately it "charged" Leonid Kravchuk to do more concretely and more swiftly something he doesn't like very much and doesn't want very much, and namely, to sign international agreements advantageous to the country. And in the international arena, by accepting the Lisbon Protocol the Ukrainian Supreme Council is forcing the world community to choose: Either go on with the policy of pressure on Ukraine and demand its adoption of the Nonproliferation Treaty, or finally start helping Ukraine materially, and offer specific guarantees of security.
