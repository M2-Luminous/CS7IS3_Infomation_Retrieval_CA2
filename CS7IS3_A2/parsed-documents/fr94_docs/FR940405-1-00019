FR940405-1-00019 FR940405-1-00006 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;206&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; de Havilland Model DHC&hyph;8&hyph;100 and DHC&hyph;8&hyph;300 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain de Havilland Model DHC&hyph;8&hyph;100 and DHC&hyph;8&hyph;300 series airplanes. This proposal would require a revision to the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) to advise flight crew members that certain cockpit indications may reveal faulty anti-collision strobe light units, and to provide procedures for subsequent flight crew action. This proposal would also require a modification that eliminates the need for the AFM revision. This proposal is prompted by reports that the function of the proximity switch electronics unit (PSEU) may be adversely effected during operation of the white anti-collision lights. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to ensure correct operation of the PSEU and its associated systems. DATES: Comments must be received by May 31, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;206&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.
