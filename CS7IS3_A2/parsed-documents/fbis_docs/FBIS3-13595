'Arafat also turned down a proposal by Dennis Ross, the U.S. coordinator for the Middle East peace process, for a meeting between Rabin [as received] and PLO Executive Committee member Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas] or another Palestinian official. 'Arafat said the PLO cannot return to the negotiations unless its demands pertaining to international protection and the settlements are met. 'Arafat asked Ross to provide a mechanism to implement the Security Council resolution if it is adopted but Ross told him Israel would never accept anything like that. 'Arafat also requested international forces in Hebron alongside a Palestinian force. He also demanded that the settlements in the city be dismantled. A senior Palestinian source revealed that Ross brought no new U.S. proposals to his two meetings with 'Arafat in Tunis two days ago and that he asked 'Arafat to accept the proposals included in Warren Christopher's message dated last Thursday in which Christopher suggested that the PLO should return to the negotiating table with Israel so that a Security Council resolution could be issued. Ross insisted that 'Arafat should issue a signed acceptance of Christopher's message so that the United States could agree to submit the draft Security Council resolution to a vote and not veto it. 'Arafat turned down this demand, which was viewed as part of the U.S. pressure on the PLO. Christopher suggested in his letter that the negotiations between the PLO and Israel be resumed according to a timetable beginning last Monday [14 March] with a meeting between Abu-'Ala' [Ahmad Quray'], head of the PLO Economic Department, and Uri Savir, director general of the Israeli Foreign Ministry, to be followed by a meeting in Washington between Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas] and Shim'on Peres, and finally a meeting between 'Arafat and Rabin in Cairo. The Palestinian leadership expressed dismay at the threatening content of Christopher's message to 'Arafat, the call to return to the negotiating table in Washington in response to President Clinton's invitation, and Christopher's insistence that the PLO should make a declaration about resuming the negotiations with Israel before a Security Council resolution is adopted. The Palestinian leadership also expressed dismay at Christopher's request to 'Arafat not to make any new demands during the negotiations and not to allow any other party, "meaning Russia," to intervene in the peace process either by making proposals or submitting new initiatives. The Palestinian leadership described the U.S. attitude as "totally biased" toward Israel, even worse than the Israeli attitude. 'Arafat told Ross that the negotiations could not be resumed because of the widespread popular anger in the occupied territories unless a Security Council resolution was adopted providing protection for the Palestinians living under occupation, disarming the settlers, and supplying U.S. and Israeli guarantees for this purpose. The Israeli delegation that met 'Arafat and included Rabin's adviser Jacques Neriya; Uri Savir, the Israeli Foreign Ministry's director general; and Uzi Dayan, director of planning at the Israeli Defense Ministry submitted no new proposals or positions. The delegation members told 'Arafat that they were not authorized to adopt any stance or make any proposal and that their mission was only to listen to him and to the views of the Palestinian leadership on how to resume the peace process. The delegation informed 'Arafat of the Israeli Government's decision to outlaw the extremist Kakh and Kahana Hay movements and to disarm some settlers in settlements where extremists are found. They also informed him of Israel's acceptance of the deployment of unarmed international observers outside Gaza and Jericho and its decision to expedite its withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho. A senior Palestinian source revealed that had it not been for the Hebron massacre, 'Arafat and Rabin would have signed the final agreement on implementing the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles in Cairo on 10 March. The source added that the Cairo and Taba negotiations on the crossing points, the Palestinian police, and the autonomy administration were already over and drafts of the final agreement had been drawn up. The massacre ruined everything and made even the Declaration of Principles subject to total failure.
