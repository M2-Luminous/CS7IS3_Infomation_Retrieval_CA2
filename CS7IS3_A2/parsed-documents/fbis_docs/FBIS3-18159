According to AFTENPOSTEN's information, a growing number of EU countries are beginning to realize that it will be necessary to grant Norway and Finland a transitional period. It has long been known that Germany and Britain have disagreed with the EU Commission's proposal to demand immediate price harmonization. In the internal discussions currently taking place nonstop in the EU in an attempt to reach a common position, other countries have backed the German and British views. "I expect that the EU will offer Norway a transitional period," a well-informed EU source told AFTENPOSTEN. Despite the fact that a transitional period for price harmonization has been the practice in earlier expansions of the EU, this time the Commission has, out of regard for the EU's single internal market, consistently opposed acceptance of gradual harmonization. Norway and Finland -- the two applicant countries with a much high level of prices -- have been just as consistent in their refusal to agree to any other solution. If the EU now gives way to their demands, this would immediately increase the chances of the two sides being able to reach an agreement on agriculture at the weekend. The main reason why the EU is in the process of reversing its position is that it quite simply will too expensive to demand immediate price harmonization. The EU knows that the applicants refuse to cover farmers' loss of income, and calculations indicate that the bill in the first year alone will be between 16 and 20 billion kroner. If the EU were to go along with the Commission's demand and itself pay all or part of the bill, this would mean expenditure that the majority of EU countries have no desire to meet. A gradual harmonization is expected to cost a mere 4 billion kroner in compensation. On the fisheries front too there are signs of hope for Norway on one of its main demands -- that of duty-free access to the EU market for fish and fish products from day one of membership. The mood in the EU points to the possibility that this demand will be met on certain conditions. One such condition is that Norwegian exports should initially be kept at the level they have traditionally had, and that an oversight mechanism is set up so that it will be possible to intervene if the market is flooded with Norwegian fish with major falls in prices as a result. It is being said that Norway is also assumed to be interested in such a solution. The large quota demands from Spain remain the most important problem in the negotiations. Fisheries Minister Jan Henry T. Olsen was in Paris yesterday to discuss the fisheries demands and today meets German Foreign Ministry Under Secretary of State Juergen Trumpf in Brussels. Germany is openly irritated at Spain and is expected to respond sympathetically to Olsen's famous statement to the effect that Norway does not have a single fish to give away. The solution that is now on the cards is that Norway will use the quotas that Spain and other EU countries have been granted under the EEA [European Economic Area] agreement as a means of applying pressure. The Norwegian position is that these quotas will disappear if Norway leaves the EEA to take up EU membership. Spain's demand has its point of departure in the EEA fisheries agreement -- something that Norway deems to be legally untenable.
