It is now certain that pharmaceutical patents, which currently are not recognized in our legislation, will be regulated by law in the future. What is being discussed at this time is the extent of adaptation periods and the way to exploit patents. The long-lasting argument on the issue has acquired international importance in the past few years. The boom in science and technology, the huge amounts used in research and invention -- particularly in developed nations, and the size of the pharmaceutical market have brought the issue to the fore on nations' negotiating agenda. One after another, all developed nations have recognized this right and joined other nations in their demand for recognition from developing nations, which, in general, have tried to maintain permissive policies allowing local companies -- even though this is not the purpose -- to go without paying intellectual rights on inventions and, more generically, everything included under the definition of intellectual property rights. In our country, the central issue is medicinal patents on formulas and fabrication procedures, which often are used without paying royalties. Sometimes the violation involves local production, other times it derives from the importation of medicines from nations that do not recognize those rights, even though this market has become narrower and narrower because of the increasing number of countries that recognize patents rights in their legislation. The Uruguay Round of GATT talks not only commits all parties to recognize patents rights, but also establishes a 20-year period for exploitation starting from the date the application is presented. The study of the case, however, can last several years. The agreement also defines the general basis for exploitation in case the owner does not do it on his own. Among other things it establishes that developing nations will have 10 years to fully adapt and comply. The GATT agreement must be ratified by the legislatures of at least 33 nations before it becomes effective, including the U.S. and Argentine Congresses. It is reasonable, however, to take GATT dispositions as the future international rule. What we are discussing today then is not the legitimacy of patents but the terms for recognition, which constitutes important progress. The draft bill the executive branch sent to Congress three years ago recognizes patents in accordance with the GATT agreement, although proposing firmer terms for negotiating between parties and adaptation periods that are closer to U.S. Government goals. In Washington, meanwhile, the period for conclusion of an administrative investigation that could derive from the application of compensatory rights on Argentine exports for damage against U.S. patent owners, which could be for some $110 million annually, is running out. The problem now is limited to negotiations between the Argentine and U.S. Governments and between the national executive and legislative branches. The most convenient and reasonable thing, considering the ironing out of difficulties carried out by GATT, is to try approving an agreement on pending issues quickly. Formally, Argentina does not have any reason to approve legislation going beyond what has been agreed on at GATT. But there is a reality that must be recognized: the need to insert the country into the world community. Here the recognition of intellectual property rights is a rule of good partnership. The United States, in turn, should take into account that the implementation of commercial sanctions cannot exceed what is established by GATT, and the new World Trade Organization has the authority to mediate between conflicting parties.
