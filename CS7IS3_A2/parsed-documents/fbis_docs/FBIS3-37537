The mission is suggesting the division of authority between Chisinau and Tiraspol along with the preservation of the territorial integrity of Moldova. The Dniester region will be given the right to self-determination, if Moldova wishes to form a single state with Romania. According to a statement of the Dniester leader, circulated today, Smirnov had a meeting with the CSCE mission in Tiraspol and asked its representatives to be mediators and guarantors at talks with the Moldovan leaders on a peaceful settlement of the conflict. The Tiraspol leader told representatives of the European conference that elections to the Moldovan parliament would not be held in the Dniester region, since the problem of granting a special legal status to the region has not yet been settled. However, the authorities will not create obstacles for those who want to take part in the voting on the right-bank part of the Moldovan territory. Smirnov said he was ready to meet Moldovan leaders and hold talks with them on a peaceful settlement of the conflict.
