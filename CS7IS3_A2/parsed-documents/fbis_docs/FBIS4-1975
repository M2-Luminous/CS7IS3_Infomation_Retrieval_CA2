On 14-24 March, Secretary Xie Fei inspected six cities in eastern Guangdong, Huizhou, Shanwei, Jieyang, Shantou, Meizhou, and Heyuan, where he traveled for nearly 2,000 kilometers and visited dozens of units. Despite the fatigue caused by long journeys and bad weather situations like strong storms and heavy rains, Secretary Xie Fei went from one city to another in hopes of seeing more of the local situation and exchanging views with more local cadres and masses. Throughout his inspection, Secretary Xie Fei was primarily concerned with the issue of maintaining stable grain output. He pointed out: In order to stabilize agricultural production, we should first and foremost try to stabilize grain production. Grain is the ultimate concern of the people. Guangdong should make every possible effort to stabilize grain production and put an end to reliance on grain imports from other regions. As long as we follow this correct guiding ideology, implement correct grain production policies, grow good varieties of grain, employ scientific farming methods, and embark on operations of scale, we will be able to raise grain production efficiency and stabilize and increase grain output. When discussing the stabilization of the grain growing area, Secretary Xie Fei urged cadres at all levels in the province to protect arable land, stabilize grain output, and energetically develop a diversified economy. He said: We should strive to build an open and export-oriented agriculture. To this end, on the one hand, we should strive to produce more quality farm products and open up and enter more new markets; on the other hand, we should strive to expand opening up to the outside world and import good varieties of crops, advanced technology, and funds in order to push the province's agricultural production onto a new stage and build genuine high-yield, high-efficiency, and high-quality agriculture across the province. All areas should conscientiously make efforts to identify competitive local products, build competitive local products production bases, conduct operations of scale, and make a success of both post-production processing and intensive processing, thus raising the added value of products as well as agricultural efficiency. As long as we follow this road, the province's agriculture will definitely be able to keep up with the province's rapidly growing secondary and tertiary industries in the years to come. We should see to it that the province's primary, secondary, and tertiary industries develop in a coordinated manner. In developing the rural economy, we should develop not only agriculture and a diversified economy but also township and town enterprises. Wherever he went, Secretary Xie Fei went into the local township and town enterprises. He said: Developing township and town enterprises is an important way of realizing modernization in rural areas, transferring surplus rural labor into secondary and tertiary industries, and bringing prosperity to the peasants. We should attach great importance to the development of township and town enterprises. Secretary Xie Fei asserted: The implementation of a joint-stock cooperative system is a major step forward in the deep-going rural reform and is bound to mobilize the enthusiasm of the various quarters concerned and speed up the development of township and town enterprises.
