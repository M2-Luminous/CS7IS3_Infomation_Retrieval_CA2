In the early years of the founding of the People's Republic of China the government designated 156 key construction projects, 24 of them in Liaoning. At one time 80 percent of the province's industrial production was decided by state mandatory plans. But since 1985 the province has gradually cut the portion of mandatory industrial production, along with the rapid progress of the reform and opening drive nationwide, especially the adoption of a market economy. The industrial production based on mandatory plan was cut to 36 percent in 1992, and further down to 12 percent last year. With the abolition of the mandatory plan for industrial production, the provincial government has to adjust its function from issuing orders to providing services for industrial enterprises. By studying industrial policies and market changes, the government has strengthened macroeconomic control over industrial enterprises. This measure is aimed at pushing enterprises onto the market. This may bring about some difficulties for some of them, but the majority welcome the new move, according to officials with the provincial planning committee.
