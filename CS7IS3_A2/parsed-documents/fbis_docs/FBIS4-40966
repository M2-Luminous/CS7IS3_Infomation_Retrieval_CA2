Baltic Fleet Commander Admiral Vladimir Yegorov Answers KRASNAYA ZVEZDA Correspondent's Questions"] [Text] [Gromak] Vladimir Grigoryevich, the Russian flag was lowered over Liepaja Naval Base on the first day of summer. The last day of summer will also be the last day spent by Russian sailors in any of the Baltic countries. What next? What will the [Baltic] Fleet look like once the force withdrawal process has been completed? [Yegorov] First and foremost -- and this is the main thing -- the Fleet should remain the Fleet, as an integrated operational-strategic formation of the Russian Federation Armed Forces in the Baltic designed to protect the Russian state's interests in the region. Of course, the face of the Fleet will be different from what it was prior to the withdrawal of forces from the Baltic states, where we are leaving behind four basing centers, their airfields, and a large number (from 15 percent to 80 percent in certain cases) of military infrastructure installations -- communications units, ship-repair yards, electronic posts, installations providing navigation and hydrographic support for the safety of shipping in the Baltic, and warehouse installations able to store large quantities of material and technical means. But we have completely withdrawn both warships and auxiliaries, all our aircraft, motor vehicles, technical systems, and stores, and are relocating them on the territory of Kaliningrad and Leningrad Oblasts. The basing conditions will be more cramped, of course, but there will be no other losses. [Gromak] But perhaps there should be further cuts that would make it possible to improve basing conditions? [Yegorov] Apart from Russia, nine other states have access to the Baltic Sea. And each has a navy as a most important component of its armed forces. Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, having gained independence and despite their serious economic difficulties, are also setting up their own navies. And that is entirely natural. Each state in our by no means peaceful age should be prepared to defend its interests not only on land but at sea as well. These include prospecting for oil on the continental shelf, fishery protection, and ensuring the safety of merchant shipping. So Russia too should have a modern navy to safeguard security and protect its own state interests in the Baltic. [Gromak] What will the Baltic Fleet be like? [Yegorov] There will be two naval bases within the Baltic Fleet -- the Baltiysk and Leningrad bases -- one force of major surface combatants, one force each of auxiliaries and search-and-rescue vessels, the Fleet air force, coastal troops, and logistical, technical, and special units. The Baltic squadron of various force organizations and the assault landing ship force will be disbanded. [Gromak] Does this mean that, apart from things being disbanded and cut back, there will also be an expansion via the Leningrad Naval Base? [Yegorov] Essentially the Leningrad Naval Base is already to a considerable extent part of the Fleet and under its operational jurisdiction. Now that Lithuania and Belorussia [Belarus] have become independent states and Kaliningrad Oblast's territorial isolation from other parts of Russia has become a reality, we face the acute issue of the need to have a rear services base to build up stores and prepare reserves on the main territory of Russia. The Leningrad Naval Base will fulfill the role of such a rear services base for the Fleet.
