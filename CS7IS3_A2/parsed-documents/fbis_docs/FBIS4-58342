Radio Dushanbe is carrying more than an hour of traditional Iranian music daily. Tajikistan's television has also carried Iranian programs such as the "Shakh-e Tuba" [the branch of a tree in Paradise], the serial "A'ineh" [mirror], and some Iranian feature films and has included Iranian traditional music in its musical repertoires. The Iranian programs have been warmly received by the Farsi-speaking Tajik television aficionados and audiences, which has resulted in more time being allocated to these programs. The presentation of these Iranian programs by the Tajikistan radio and television stations has drawn the attention of the citizens of this country toward their mother tongue and is gradually familiarizing them with certain expressions in Farsi that were not in vogue in Tajikistan earlier. In the past year, more than 3,400 minutes of programs produced by the Vision of the Islamic Republic of Iran have been disseminated by Tajikistan television.
