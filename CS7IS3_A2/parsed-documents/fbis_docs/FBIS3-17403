Mr Nazarbayev has no need for pockets: when he wants to smoke, an aide scurries forward with a cigarette and a lighter; when it rains, another produces an umbrella; and if he sneezes, a third is ready to produce a handkerchief. The president, with a complete lack of selfconsciousness, has a tendency to begin sentences with the phrase "I always tell my Kazakhs..." The strong hand with which Mr Nazarbayev rules Kazakhstan -- a country the size of western Europe stretched between Russia and China disturbs many western political observers. He sees politically authoritarian and economically free-market south-east Asia, rather than western Europe, as a model for development. Western investors, weary of the anarchy in Russia's economic and political life, do not object. They are delighted to have found a despot with whom they can do business. Kazakhstan has already finalised an oil and a gas deal with two consortia of western multinationals. Russia, which has far greater oil and gas production, has been much less successful in attracting western investment. This contrast gives Mr Nazarbayev the opportunity to observe that "whereas Kazakhstan is a unitary state, in Russia all political power has collapsed, so perhaps it is harder to do business there". He believes that "based on our oil and gas reserves, we can say that in the 21st century Kazakhstan will be the world's main hydrocarbon producer". The businessmen patiently awaiting an audience in the plush lobby of the Hyde Park Hotel during his visit to London this week might not go so far, but they tend to agree that Kazakhstan is a good commercial prospect. While Mr Nazarbayev dreams of his country becoming a central Asian Saudi Arabia -- with a South Korea style government -- he knows Kazakhstan must first overcome formidable hurdles. Chief among them, as for all the former Soviet republics, is the development of a workable relationship with Russia. Kazakhstan is bound to its northern neighbour by ties of blood and miles of pipeline. The blood runs in the veins of the ethnic Russians, who make up more than 35 per cent of Kazakhstan's population. Aware of the potential threat from this Russian population, Mr Nazarbayev is careful on questions of language and culture: both Russian and Kazakh are the official languages of the republic and both Russian and Kazakh holidays are officially celebrated. Despite this sensitivity, unrest among the Russians in Kazakhstan is growing, and is finding encouragement from some quarters in Russia. Russian nationalists -- ranging from Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the neo-fascist leader born in Almaty, the Kazakh capital, to Alexander Solzhenitsyn, the Russian author -- believe the north-eastern corner of Kazakhstan, where Russians form a majority, should be incorporated into the motherland. Some local Russians agree. Mr Zhirinovsky's land claims so riled the normally diplomatic Mr Nazarbayev that he described him as "a little Hitler". Economic bonds with Russia pose a more immediate problem for Mr Nazarbayev. Soviet centralisation means Kazakhstan has no oil refineries, and all its pipelines lead into Russia rather than to the western markets Mr Nazarbayev is wooing. Over the winter, this infrastructure created the paradox of oil-rich Kazakhstan shivering in an energy crisis. As a member of Mr Nazarbayev's delegation bitterly put it: "We walked over billions of barrels of oil and gas, but we nearly froze to death." The shortage was created by the failure of Siberian refineries to stick to an agreement to return refined oil to Kazakhstan. Through control of the pipelines, Russia is also demanding an equity share in the two big ventures Kazakhstan is undertaking to exploit its oil and gas fields. "There are certainly some political overtones here," said Mr Nazarbayev . "These are our growing pains. We are all just beginning to learn to treat one another as fully independent states." These overtones, and Kazakhstan's realisation that Russia has the economic muscle to drive a hard bargain, have provoked an important shift in Mr Nazarbayev's relationship with the Kremlin. In contrast with the leaders of more stridently independent nations, such as Ukraine or the Baltic states, Mr Nazarbayev wanted to preserve the connections between the former Soviet republics when the Union disintegrated in 1991. But his dream of a partnership between equals has been displaced by the reality of Russia's increasingly overt efforts to dominate its neighbours; so the Kazakh leader has begun taking a different tack. The best example is the rouble zone. Last year, Mr Nazarbayev fiercely objected to being forced to drop the rouble by Moscow reformers, who argued the impoverished central Asian republics were dragging Russia into hyperinflation. Having been forced into the cold and survived, Mr Nazarbayev is now scornful of proposals by Moscow's new leadership to recreate the rouble zone. "Having a common currency now that each republic has its own economy, its own budget, its own central bank and its own legislature is just wishful thinking," Mr Nazarbayev said. "What is happening now is that each state is finding its own niche." For Kazakhstan, this entails breaking its dependence on Russia's oil and gas infrastructure. Mr Nazarbayev said he would reject the Russian bid for equity in Kazakhstan's oil and gas fields. But so long as Russia controls the pipelines and the refineries, his words may prove empty. That is why he spoke publicly this week about a hitherto secret project -- Kazakhstan's plan to build a pipeline from Karachaganak, its largest gas field in the north, direct to the west via Turkey. "The pipeline through Turkey is a long-term project but it is definitely one to which we will give the highest priority," Mr Nazarbayev said. The dilemma he and his Kazakhs face is that, bright though their prospects may be, today they must rely on Russia. It will be years before Kazakhstan reaps the benefits of developing its oilfields and building pipelines direct to the west. In the meantime, Mr Nazarbayev, the unchallenged ruler of his own land, will have to bend in his dealings with Russia.
