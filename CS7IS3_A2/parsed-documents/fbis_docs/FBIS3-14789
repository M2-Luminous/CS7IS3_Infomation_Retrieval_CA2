Mr. Galazov once again categorically turned down the proposal of Vasiliy Tarasenko, chairman of the Federation Council committee for federation affairs and regional policy, regarding the introduction of a direct federal rule over the entire zone of the Ossetia-Ingushetia conflict made upon the return of the parliamentary delegation from the Caucasus. North Ossetia assessed this proposal as interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign state while, as Akhsarbek Galazov said, it drew indignation not only from the republic's leaders but also the entire Ossetian people. So categoric a rejection of the parliamentary committee head's proposal is quite explainable because once introduced, federal rule would make it necessary to act on the Russian president's 13 December edict on the return of Ingush refugees to North Ossetia's Prigorodnyy Rayon -- something vigorously opposed, not without success, by the Ossetians, who first ask the Ingush to repent, then demand a moral and political assessment of the last year's armed conflict. Also natural is the fact that Ingushetia leaders have supported the Russian parliamentarians' proposal. The North Ossetia president thinks that the interests of both sides should be considered in resolving such an acute conflict. Forceful interference, even in the form of direct federal rule, would only spark a protracted and bloody war between the Ingush and the Ossetians. Mr. Galazov said yet one more time that the republics would be able to settle the Ingushetia-Ossetia conflict independently, gradually, and peacefully, and resolve the refugee return problem.
