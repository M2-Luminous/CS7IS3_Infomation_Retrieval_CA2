This group, we would remind [readers], was preparing to commit crimes and set fire to businesses throughout the entire month of Ramadan. It was a diabolical operation that was halted by security forces. Now if Djaffar El-Afghani, the presumed head of the GIA [Armed Islamic Group], and five of his other lieutenants have been identified, the others have not, it has been learned from a well-informed source. The same source said that their identification is under way. Let us observe that terrorist groups, to prevent any identification of their members struck down by security forces, use a method that consists of burning or mutilating the bodies.
