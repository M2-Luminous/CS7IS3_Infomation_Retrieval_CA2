The widening of the ban from 10 departments in central Algeria to the whole country follows the killing Wednesday of two political activists. Yahia Bouguettaya, the former mayor of Mohammadia, south-east Algeria, and Mohamed Touali, an activist in Algeria's Ettahadi (Challenge) political party, were assassinated Wednesday. Touali, 32, was kidnapped overnight Tuesday in Constantine, east Algeria, and his body later discovered, the party said. Their deaths bring the number of political assassinations to six since former communist party official Ferhat Chibout was killed on January 27. The latest deaths follow the killing Tuesday in the Casbah district of Algiers of French journalist Olivier Quemeneur and the wounding by gunmen of the cameraman's Australian colleague, Scott Allan White. Armed Islamic groups have waged a war on the regime, targeting foreigners politicians, and intellectuals as part of their campaign, since the cancellation in January 1992 of a general election which the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) was poised to win. The FIS, now outlawed, has blamed alleged government death squads for carrying out some of the killings.
