Earlier, while on a trip to Japan, the traitor Kim Yong-sam had discussed the "joint counteraction" with senior brasshats of Japan over the fictitious "nuclear issue" of the DPRK. The facts prove once again that the Kim Yong-sam group is the enemy of the nation who does not hesitate to bring a nuclear holocaust upon the nation, putting spurs on the establishment of a criminal "international cooperation system" in collusion with outside forces. But their act is as foolish as bumping one's head against a rock. The Kim Yong-sam group which is seeking to prolong its dirty remaining days with the help of outside forces will be punished by the nation. The Japanese reactionaries must stop maneuvering against the DPRK in a conspiracy with the foolish Kim Yong-sam group and act with discretion.
