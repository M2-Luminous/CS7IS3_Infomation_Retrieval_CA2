[Wang Qiren] The Hong Kong Branch of the BOC will issue Hong Kong banknotes in Hong Kong on 2 May this year. This is a major event in the history of the development of the BOC and is also a grand occasion in the issuance of Hong Kong banknotes. The BOC's preparations for its participation in issuing Hong Kong banknotes began in September 1992. It took 20 months to design the banknotes, complete the legal procedures, and print and issue the notes. During this period, the relevant Hong Kong and mainland departments assisted us effectively, and Hong Kong citizens also supported us. This enabled the preparatory work to proceed smoothly. Here, on behalf of the BOC and through your newspaper, I would like to express my sincere thanks to the relevant departments and friends who showed their concern for and supported the BOC's issuance of Hong Kong banknotes in Hong Kong. [RENMIN RIBAO] What are the main characteristics of the Hong Kong banknotes issued by the BOC? [Wang] There are five face values. The design is based on Hong Kong scenery. The obverse is the BOC Building, accompanied by Eastern flowers and plants; the reverse depicts some unique Hong Kong buildings and scenery. With this design, we would like to portray Hong Kong's position as an international monetary, trade, tourist, and shipping center; to display Hong Kong's vigorous economic life and its style and features; and also to express our wish for common development and prosperity between the BOC and Hong Kong. [RENMIN RIBAO] As far as I know, a bank must conform with some strict conditions if it wants to become a note-issuing bank. What conditions and basis does the BOC possess? [Wang] For a long period of time, the BOC Group in Hong Kong has abided by the principle of "basing itself in Hong Kong and serving Hong Kong." It has actively developed its business, loyally served its citizens, and supported local industrial and commercial development, thus enjoying the citizens' trust. In addition, it also has made marked development in all vocational fields. Last year, deposits in the BOC increased by 30 times over 1978 and the loans released increased by 46 times. Its commercial banking business also has developed rapidly. By the end of 1993, BOC assets amounted to 700 billion Hong Kong dollars; it had more than 350 branches on Hong Kong Island, as well as in Kowloon and the New Territories; and their employees numbered 18,000; making it one of the important monetary groups in Hong Kong. In the course of its development and growth, the BOC has regarded performing social duties and supporting public welfare activities as its unshirkable responsibility; has done its best for the steady and healthy development of Hong Kong's banking business; and has taken an active part in all kinds of activities that promote social progress. The BOC has always regarded preserving Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, and maintaining its position as an international monetary center, as being where its fundamental interests lie. We may well say that the BOC's rich financial resources, steady style, and distinguished reputation are the basic conditions that have made us a note-issuing bank. These also serve as the basis for the Hong Kong citizens and people in all circles to trust the BOC to issue banknotes. [RENMIN RIBAO] What was the background for the BOC to participate in issuing banknotes? [Wang] The BOC's participation in issuing Hong Kong banknotes before 1997 is the manifestation of our full confidence in Hong Kong's future. We are happy to see that the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law have resolved Hong Kong's future in a satisfactory way, under the principle of "one country, two systems" and "Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong." In the economic field, China's reform and opening up in the last 15 years have promoted sustained economic growth on the mainland. This has brought about many new development opportunities for Hong Kong's economy and has promoted economic links and cooperative relations between Hong Kong and the mainland. Now the "China factor" has become an important one for Hong Kong's economic development. In the future, China's economy can be expected to maintain rapid growth rates of 8 to 9 percent, and Hong Kong's economy will benefit from this for a long time. This will lay a reliable foundation for Hong Kong's post-1997 prosperity and stability. Under these circumstances, the BOC has participated in issuing Hong Kong banknotes. Together with the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and the Standard Chartered Bank, it will play a positive role in maintaining monetary stability. This also corresponds with the good wishes of people of various circles in Hong Kong. [RENMIN RIBAO] As requested by the existing arrangements, before issuing Hong Kong banknotes, the issuing bank should submit U.S. dollars to the foreign exchange fund to obtain a noninterest liabilities certificate as a preparation for issuing banknotes. This arrangement has made it impossible for the issuing bank to gain any profit from issuing banknotes. This being the case, as a commercial bank, how does the BOC view the significance of its participation in issuing Hong Kong banknotes? [Wang] As you have said, under the existing arrangements, the BOC cannot derive any commercial benefit from issuing banknotes. Instead, it will have to bear the operational cost for issuing banknotes and undertake the risk of foreign exchange losses owing to fluctuations in the Hong Kong dollar. We participate in issuing banknotes out of consideration for the overall situation and with the fundamental target of helping to maintain Hong Kong's monetary stability. In the past, the BOC has played a positive role in cooperating with the Hong Kong Government's monetary management authorities in ensuring the steady operation and healthy development of the monetary system. After becoming a note-issuing bank, the BOC will help strengthen the Hong Kong money market. This will be beneficial to the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong banks and monetary business, to the consolidation and enhancement of Hong Kong's position as an international monetary center, and to a steady transition toward 1997. [RENMIN RIBAO] As a note-issuing bank, will the BOC's relations with other banks in Hong Kong change? [Wang] No. After becoming a note-issuing bank, the BOC will continue in its operations to abide strictly by Hong Kong's monetary laws and will continue to support the position of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and the Standard Chartered Bank as the main issuing banks in Hong Kong. As in the past and at present, we will be willing to engage in fair competition with Hong Kong- and foreign-funded banks in Hong Kong, to develop together, to cooperate with each other, and to create common prosperity. [RENMIN RIBAO] After participating in issuing Hong Kong banknotes, what is your bank's great plan for development? [Wang] The BOC's participation in issuing banknotes means that our social responsibility has become heavier. In the future, our bank will continue to display its strong points, advance with an enterprising spirit, carry out careful operations, and strengthen our service. As always, together with the other two issuing banks, we will make new contributions to the stability and development of the Hong Kong monetary system.
