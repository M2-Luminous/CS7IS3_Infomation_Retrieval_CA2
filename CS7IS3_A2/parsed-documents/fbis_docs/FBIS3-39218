With "Europol" due to be formally opened this Friday [18 February] in The Hague as the prototype of a federal EC police force, a range of secretive Brussels committees is considering how to pool national information on everything from terrorism to traffic offences to divorce settlements. According to a confidential action plan already agreed by the 12 governments, Europol's remit is to expand from monitoring the drugs trade to dealing with illegal immigrants, pollution and traffickers in stolen cars, works of art and nuclear materials. The latest European plans go further still, considering ways of enforcing driving bans and chasing fathers for maintenance payments across the continent. According to a leaked "priority action plan," a working party of interior ministry officials is investigating "harmonising the conditions for combating illegal immigration and illegal employment" -- a reference to the personal identification cards used in most EC countries. British officials acknowledged last night that the discussion was going ahead. But despite recent reports that Mr Major was attracted to the ID scheme, sources said the conclusions would not be binding on British ministers. They said the aim of the discussion was to "share best practice" across the EC. "We'll be looking at those who find carrying ID cards beneficial," said a source. In countries such as Belgium it is an offence punishable by imprisonment not to be carrying an ID card at all times. At the centre of these plans is a "European Information System," due to be running by the end of the year. This potentially vast data bank is the subject of acute controversy, with Denmark leading calls for privacy to be respected. The convention establishing it has yet to be settled. The Government, strongly supported by Germany, sees European-wide co-operation as the best means of tackling cross-frontier crime. The plan's main purpose is to launch a clampdown on criminals, illegal immigrants and bogus asylum-seekers. It envisages a European archive of images of forged documents, a European inventory of terrorist acts, a European data-collection system on criminal methods and new measures against "drugs tourism" and prostitution rings. One group of 12 national experts is even looking at ways of increasing co-operation on government phone-tapping and other forms of "electronic interception." Another group has been charged with finding a way of communicating driving bans to other police forces. It is due to report by June. A group is also looking at ways of extending the Brussels Convention on enforcing court judgments to include "family matters and succession." It would ensure that maintenance awards can be enforced in all 12 EC countries.
