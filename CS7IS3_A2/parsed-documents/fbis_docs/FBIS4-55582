Barjaktarevic: "A Dialogue Only at a Round Table"] [Excerpts] Dr. Ranko Babic, federal deputy in the Chamber of Citizens, has resigned from his post of president of the Serbian Radical Party [SRS] County Committee for Kosovo. He told BORBA that there are indications that Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic will soon visit Kosmet [Kosovo and Metohija]. Why is Dr. Ranko Babic resigning from his function of party head for Kosovo? I have resigned for several reasons. They primarily have to do with considerable professional obligations at the university and in research work. Moreover, there are private reasons involved. There is also disagreement with certain moves within the party, but I do not wish to discuss this in detail, Ranko Babic said curtly. [passage omitted] As a federal deputy, Ranko Babic was ready to talk to BORBA in greater detail about indications of "preparations for Milosevic's visit to Kosmet." This was prompted by President Milosevic's statement in front of the minister of state at the British Foreign Office Douglas Hogg in connection with "giving full political and cultural autonomy to the Albanians," and "We shall have no problems with that." If we are to believe the diplomatic dignity of the British minister of state and our interpretations of Mr. Milosevic's answer, strengthened by the lack of any denial from his office, this statement could mean President Milosevic's full agreement with Douglas Hogg's approach that a maximal political and cultural local autonomy should be created in Kosmet, similar that in the 1974 Constitution. This would mean that Milosevic was denying his own position and closing the circle, but from below with his well-known statement in Kosovo Polje "no one must beat these people." [sentence as published] I wish to believe that the statement "we shall have no problems with that" is the result of a misunderstanding or a breakdown in communications. Otherwise, President Milosevic is attempting a fatal somersault that would be catastrophic for him. In connection to this, we may mention his penchant for inconsistent political acrobatics. On the other hand, however, increased awareness -- even significantly increased awareness -- can be detected in the visit of representatives of the Yugoslav Army and the Federal Defense Ministry, and in the related demonstration maneuvers of the army and police units in Kosovo. Even the elite 63d Airborne Brigade from Nis was brought in and executed a spectacular demonstration maneuver. I believe that this is intended to show the authorities' great interest in the region. There are even indications that President Milosevic is preparing to visit Kosovo and Metohija in the coming period. Looking at this in the context of President Milosevic's earlier statement, we would be very disappointed in him if it turned out that the purpose of demonstrating such great military and policy "interest and allegiance" in and to Kosmet is designed simply to temporarily calm the resident Serbian people and dissuade them from moving out of Kosmet, while somewhere hidden from view, arrangements are being made that would be disastrous for us, says Babic. Are not all these preparations for initiating a dialogue with the Albanians? I would consider it quite abnormal that, in the context of all this, Milosevic's arrival in Kosmet would mean the promotion or the initiation of a process of dialogue with representatives of the ethnic Albanian political organizations, but one that would ultimately lead to an unacceptably oversized autonomy.
