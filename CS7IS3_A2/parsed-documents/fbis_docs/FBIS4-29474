Among the main pillars of the blueprint are: 1) The coalition should abide by agreements and memorandums signed at the time of the inauguration of former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's administration; 2) regarding policies, as a rule, the coalition should carry forward agreements reached at the time of the inauguration of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's administration, which includes the revision and abolition of the consumption tax; and 3) government affairs should be managed by a group of representatives from each party, and final decisions should be made via a meeting of party heads. The party plans to finalize its blueprint after further integrating party members' opinions, but the party is divided over pending policy issues as well as which parties it plans to join in a new coalition alliance. It also places the mass resignation of the incumbent administration as a precondition to its forming a new coalition. Therefore, there is no question that rough sailing will be encountered regarding the SDPJ's finalizing its coalition blueprint and subsequent policy consultations with other parties. In the blueprint, the SDPJ seeks to clarify what caused it to leave the coalition alliance as well as who is to be held responsible. However, the party does not intend to demand the resignation of those held responsible.
