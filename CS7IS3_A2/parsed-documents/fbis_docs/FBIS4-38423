Committee Deputy Chairman Sergey Gryzunov said in an interview with ITAR-TASS later in the day that "the warning was prompted, in part, by the article `World Villainy' containing downright propaganda of war and violence". He said that an application was filed with the Russian prosecutor-general's office on instituting an investigation against the newspaper. The committee also sent warnings to St. Petersburg-based ZA RUSSKOYE DELO and RODNYE PROSTOPY newspapers about their violations of the mass media law. Some of their articles contained calls for overthrowing the present constitutional system by force as well as ideas of racial strife and anti-semitism. The committee intends to review, in the near future, a decision by the former Press and Information Ministry on the registration of the AL-KODS newspaper, which was done with a violation of the mass media law: a foreign subject acted as the publication's founder. Gryzunov also said that he started receiving telephone threats from the so-called Russian patriots.
