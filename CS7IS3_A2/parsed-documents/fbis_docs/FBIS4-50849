This measure has enabled some enterprises to gradually extricate themselves from their longstanding status as subordinates to the government and to maintain and increase the value of most of the state-owned assets. However, in the actual process of operating such a mixed economy, loss of state-owned assets resulting from the establishment of state-owned stocks merely in name exists in some enterprises at varying degrees. Pertinent persons asked: Who should represent the state-owned stocks, which account for 50 percent of the capital stock? Who should protect their interests? The loss of state-owned assets in shareholding enterprises is reflected mainly in the evidently unfair distribution of dividends in addition to the underestimation of the value of state-owned assets in the process of the transformation in line with the shareholding system. For instance, state-owned stocks are excluded in enterprises' distribution of dividends; even if dividends are distributed to state-owned stocks, different rates are applied in violation of the principle of same rights and same profits for same stocks, with the dividends to the stocks owned by individuals and legal persons usually higher than those to state-owned stocks; enterprises seldom open special accounts of the dividends distributed to state-owned stocks or turn the dividends over to the departments in charge of state-owned asset, and most of the dividends are used by enterprises without reimbursement; when distributing stocks, shareholding enterprises apply different measures to state-owned stocks, legal person stocks, and individual stocks, either demanding abandonment of the right of state-owned stocks to be distributed with stocks and transferring the right to individual stock holders, or distributing cash dividends to state-owned stocks and stock dividends to other stock holders according to the face value of the stocks, or even distributing no stocks to state-owned stocks. The above-mentioned situation is common nationwide, but the basic reason for enterprises' practice to disregard the rights and interests of state-owned assets, infringe on state interests, and cause the loss of state-owned assets lies in the stagnation of the reform of the state-owned asset management system. According to the analysis by pertinent persons, the function of ownership of state-owned assets is divided by various departments of the government, which take charge of state-owned assets from different angles, but none of which hold total and ultimate responsibility. This has led to a blend of government functions and asset management function and a blend of government functions and enterprise management, making the government take charge of too much of the things they should not have managed and fail to manage what they should have managed. The direct influence of this problem on the enterprises experimenting with the shareholding system is reflected in the failure in personifying the representatives of the rights to state-owned stocks. In form, representatives of the rights to state-owned stocks are assigned by state-owned bureaus, but the status, responsibility, and rights of these "representatives" have not been personified because the state-owned asset management system and responsibility system have yet to take shape. In some enterprises, the chairmen of the boards of directors are representatives of the state-owned assets, but they often exercise their duties as the chairmen of the boards of directors and forget about their duties as the representatives of the rights to state-owned stocks. Because of this, it is very difficult to appoint and appraise the chairmen and directors of the boards of directors and to fine appropriate persons to hold the responsibility for the management and operation of assets. In addition, there is also the problem that state-owned stocks and other stocks enjoy different rights. Stocks owned by individuals and legal persons are permitted to transfer and trade in the market, but state-owned stocks are not. No doubt, this is an unfair treatment to state-owned assets, and such a treatment is also harmful to maintaining and increasing the value of state-owned assets. Pertinent departments have given the "prescription" to personify the representatives of state-owned stocks as soon as possible and enable state-owned stocks to enjoy the same rights and same profits as other stocks, namely to adjust the relationship within and outside enterprises and establish a brand-new standardized operating mechanism of enterprises. First, we should separate the function of ownership of state-owned assets from the administrative function as soon as possible and establish special organs to operate state-owned assets, which are authorized by the government to serve as representatives of state-owned assets to take charge of the operation, profit-making, and transfer of state-owned assets. Large enterprise groups and extra large enterprises may be directly authorized by the government to manage state-owned assets. Second, we should further improve the internal management system of shareholding enterprises so that their rights and profits will conform to their responsibilities and they are operated in line with the standardized requirements. Decisions should be made in a democratic manner to ensure that they are scientific. Meanwhile, we should step up efforts to draw up necessary laws and regulations on the shareholding system to make it more transparent and to enhance the supervision over it by public opinion.
