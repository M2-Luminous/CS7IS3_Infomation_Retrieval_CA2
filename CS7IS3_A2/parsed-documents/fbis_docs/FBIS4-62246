Here is our correspondent, Igor Kulinichenko, reporting from the site. [Begin recording] [Kulinichenko] The picket near the Supreme Council building is in progress. It is being conducted by representatives of political organizations who came here from the Crimea. I see slogans that read: Get Russian military bases out of our Crimea! Cancel Crimean autonomy -- Threat to Ukrainian statehood! Stop Mafia from seizing power in the Crimea! We protest against sale of Sevastopol, a Ukrainian naval base! Only Ukrainian laws and Constitution should govern the Crimea! Protect Crimean Ukrainians against self-will of Meshkov and his clique! -- and many other slogans. People are really demanding these things. I am going to go over to one of the protesters and ask him to introduce himself. [Vlasenko] My name is Pavlo Vlasenko. I am deputy chairman of the All-Ukrainian Prosvita [Education] Society. [Kulinichenko] First of all, what do you think we should do to make all people in the Crimea, including Crimean Ukrainians, happy about the policies pursued by the Crimean parliament and the government of Yuriy Meshkov? [Vlasenko] It is impossible to make everyone happy. We should do what is warranted by international laws and Ukrainian interests. That is what we should do. The Ukrainian people, who have more rights to this than those who kick up a row. [sentence as heard] We believe that first and foremost, one should bring all of Crimean legislation in line with Ukrainian laws. Second, we believe that the previous Supreme Council made a mistake when it agreed to autonomy in the first place. It should be revoked. Or, if it is not revoked, one should at least introduce presidential rule in the Crimea. Because, given the present situation, the government invited from Moscow by Meshkov is out to completely rob Ukraine, through the Crimea. The methods of governing which they are proposing, such as the watch method and so on, humiliate us as Ukrainian citizens. Do we not have intelligent people? Of course, we do. Why should Moscow rule us? Foreign troops must be withdrawn. We consider Russian troops to be foreign troops in the Crimea. They should be pulled out immediately. The Black Sea Fleet issue must be resolved. We consider Sevastopol a Ukrainian city. We are not the only ones who think so. The principle of inviolability of borders should be preserved and strengthened, first of all, by a decision of the Ukrainian Supreme Council. [end recording]
