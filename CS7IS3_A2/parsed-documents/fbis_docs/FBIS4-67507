[passage omitted] ``We will take it and bury it. If we fail to fulfill the agreements concluded by the government no one will speak to us. We are obliged to take spent nuclear fuel from the Finnish nuclear power station (not waste) until 14 May 1999. The agreement does not stipulate burial, but the USSR pledged to take the fuel and it was up to it what it did with the fuel,'' Mr. Vishnevskiy [Yuriy Vishnevskiy, chairman of the Russian Federation Federal Inspectorate for Nuclear and Radiation Safety] said. Strange as it may seem, the date of expiration of the agreement, as indicated by the Federal Inspectorate chairman, does not coincide with the one announced last year by Finnish Trade and Industry Minister Seppo Kaariainen. According to him, shipments of spent nuclear fuel to Russia would cease in 1996, when the agreement expired. Who is telling the truth? Nonetheless, no agreement has ever committed Russia to taking waste from other countries, according to Viktor Danilov-Danilyan, Russian Federation minister of ecology and natural resources. France and Britain, the main processors of nuclear fuel in Europe, ship all the nuclear waste to the countries that placed the orders for processing, thus creating the waste. But, incredibly, nuclear waste from other countries' fuel is being buried in Russia. Incidentally, some days ago Mr. Danilov-Danilyan handed over an engineering project to his Norwegian colleagues for them to study and finance. A large part of it relates to the construction of a burial site on the Kola Peninsula. ``The burial site is intended primarily for radioactive waste produced in Russia itself, and for the waste that has already accumulated. In particular, on the Kola Peninsula. It is stored in such a way that it can in no way be regarded as satisfactory from the ecological viewpoint,'' the minister told IZVESTIYA. Answering my question about the possibility of importing and burying nuclear waste from other countries in the future, Viktor Ivanovich suddenly stopped choosing his words carefully and ominously stated: ``Who knows?'' The specter of the Atomic Energy Ministry that lay behind this ominous statement manifested itself on television screens at the end of last week in the shape of Georgiy Kaurov, who made the following statement: ``The Greenpeace organization is trying to impose its own, non-Russian viewpoint on us. It is an international viewpoint, that of the mafia that engages in antinuclear lobbying.'' It appears that the officials from the Federal Inspectorate have finally lost touch with reality and are treating everyone as a complete idiot. One of Finland's Swedish-language newspaper, in its 20 April 1994 issue, cites Mikhail Sharov, representative of the ``Mayak'' Production Association, who went to Finland to monitor the loading of the train with spent nuclear fuel. ``In 1993 Finland paid $400 for each kilogram of spent nuclear fuel taken by Russia,'' the representative of the ``Mayak'' Production Association, or Chelyabinsk-65, told Finnish journalists. So the Atomic Energy Ministry received $11.6 million for the latest trainload alone. For similar processing in Britain the Finns would have paid two and one-half times as much, as prices stood two years ago. In addition they would have gotten back all the solid and liquid waste from the processing of their nuclear fuel, including contaminated equipment, instruments, means of personal protection, packaging, special clothing and footwear for workers, and many other almost new items. Incidentally, if the Atomic Energy Minuistry were ever to curb its greed and try to return the nuclear waste, even then some of it would remain in Russia. The nuclear fuel processing technology at the ``Mayak'' Production Associaiton is such that practically all the medium-active liquid waste is still discharged into nearby reservoirs.
