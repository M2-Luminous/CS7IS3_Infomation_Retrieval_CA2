The ECONOMIC DAILY NEWS reported that the commission took General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) regulations into consideration before proposing to lift prohibitions and limitations on foreign investments in the above fields. Under the proposal, the report said, the ban on foreign investment in oil refineries and real estate agencies will be lifted. In addition, restrictions on foreign investment in residential construction, water and electricity supply, and railway transportation will be eased, the report added. Under the proposed changes, however, foreign investment in oil refineries will be limited to a 30 percent stake in the company. The commission officials also said a ban on foreign investment in the railway industry will be lifted sometime in the future. The easing of investment restrictions will be in line with economic liberalization plans and help develop Taiwan into a Asia- Pacific region business operations center, the officials said.
