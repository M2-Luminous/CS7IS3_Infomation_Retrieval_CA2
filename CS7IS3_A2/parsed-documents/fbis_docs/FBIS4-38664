Seimas Chancellor Neris Germanas, Vladas Butenas, member of the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party faction, and faction elder Justinas Karosas spoke at the press conference. The Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party members did not deny the constitutional right to hold referendums but proposed an assessment of the need for them and their cost. In their opinion, the referendums proposed by the opposition on early Seimas elections and savings compensation cannot result in anything positive and will only create confusion in the state. [passage omitted] Justinas Karosas stressed that the 4 million litas cost of one referendum is a large sum for the budget of a poor country. [passage omitted] Vladas Butenas rejected accusations by the opposition about the government crisis. He stated that neither the president, nor the Seimas, nor the government can be accused of inactivity. They are all carrying out constitutional reforms. [passage omitted]
