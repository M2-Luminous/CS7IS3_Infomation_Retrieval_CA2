He said that USC-SSA forces are courageously facing the SNA's antipeace provocations. The spokesman said: We have in principle endeavored and are ready to halt the fighting in which Somali blood is being shed but the SNA leader, Aidid, is adamant. It is therefore right for us to defend our lives, property, principles, and generally the security and unity of the Somali people, the spokesman added, particularly since the SNA forces are planning new attacks in the rest of Mogadishu in the near future. The spokesman termed as far-fetched and untrue reports released by the BBC and those carrying white flags while actually serving Aidid to the effect that peace has been reached and that the fighting has ended. In conclusion, the spokesman explained that the fighting in Mogadishu is not based on clans but is being fought between the USC-SSA and small SNA groups. He pointed out that nobody will gain from resorting to clan loyalties.
