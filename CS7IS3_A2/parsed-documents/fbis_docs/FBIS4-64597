He calls Poul Schluter's decision not to call an election after the Tamil report came out "correct and historically decisive. Otherwise we would have been pariahs in Danish politics for many years." Engell also criticizes Danish politicians for not being competent enough. He is rotund and well liked. His door is "always open." And both friends and foes make use of his availability. "Hans is someone you can rely on." Thursday, 17 February: The Center Democrats (CD) were fighting for the party's life after the Juncker affair. The worst crisis in the party's history was raging. A meeting of the Folketing group and the party's cabinet ministers was scheduled at 1700 hours in a fresh attempt to pick up the pieces. The eight CD members were frustrated and deeply divided. That morning, in the middle of the tumult, CD tax spokesperson Sonja Albrink went to see Conservative leader Hans Engell. She wanted some advice, under pressure as she was from deposed Social Affairs Minister Bente Juncker, who wanted her post as tax spokesperson back. At the same time she inquired about the possibility of switching to the Conservative Party. Engell was interested -- but warned Albrink of the personal costs. Twelve hours later Albrink got her way -- she stayed on as tax spokesperson and remained a CD member. Engell sits at the end of his conference table. Long rows of regimental emblems from most of the world -- from his time as defense minister -- decorate one wall of the office and green plants and bookcases make the office look like a livingroom. "The idea of having just a personal computer, a desk and nothing more -- that isn't really me," says the 45-year-old Engell. He also has all the volumes of the Tamil report -- placed at floor level beside two empty shell cases. Enough powder has been used on that matter. After a good half-year as undisputed political leader of the Conservative Party, Engell has changed his style. Politicians and ministers -- including those from other parties -- often call him up for advice. "My respect for people like Mimi Jakobsen and Marianne Jelved as politicians has not diminished just because we currently find ourselves on opposite sides." It is not just physically that he has become rounder. He has become older, friendlier, and more forthcoming. More avuncular or purely and simply: more like Schluter. And it is quite deliberate. "As minister I dealt with defense and the justice system, and it meant that I often acted in hard political contexts. Many voters perceived this as meaning that I was only interested in squatter demonstrations, refugees, tanks, and prisons. One is often identified with what one works with, and therefore I have made a deliberate effort to show that these are not the only things that interest me." When he pounds on the table at meetings of the party's Folketing group or makes some remark he often hears people say: "Now you sound just like Schluter!" "I am always a little doubtful whether this is unconditional praise or if it contains an element of criticism. I choose to see it as praise." Since the Tamil report dropped on the party like a bomb a little over a year ago, the Conservatives have lived a somewhat retiring existence at Christiansborg [parliament building]. Ever since Engell had to hand over the keys to the Justice Ministry and the two ministerial cars -- Ford Scorpios -- to his Social Democratic successor a little over 13 months ago he has had to approach his job with a certain amount of humility, in his own words. "I think we have now paid the price. People are sick and tired of the Tamil affair, but compared with the other parties it has been expensive for us. After the course of events last January it was proper for the Conservative Party to show a certain degree of humility so we could earn back the central position we had in the 1980's. And now we are back on course," Engell says. At the same time he disputes Liberal chairman Uffe Ellemann-Jensen's well-known criticism of the fact that Poul Schluter did not call an election after Supreme Court Justice Mogens Hornslet issued the Tamil report. "The decision Schluter made was entirely correct and historically decisive for the Conservative Party. If we had chosen to call an election, we would have been pariahs in Danish politics for many years. The other parties would have felt we had taken advantage of the situation to score political points. We thought what stood in the report was totally unfair, but -- as a party based on respect for the courts -- the Conservative Party cannot engage in a confrontation with both the Supreme Court and the political system." Engell's working day is about as long as it was when he was justice minister. It begins at 0800 on the coastal train from Espergaerde in North Zealand when he reads reports and political speeches on his way in to Christiansborg. He is seldom through in the Folketing before 2000 or 2030 at night and most evenings are taken up with meetings around the country. From a job as journalist with BERLINGSKE TIDENDE Hans Engell became press officer for the Conservatives at Christiansborg in 1978. In September 1982 he was asked to come to Prime Minister Schluter's office. He thought an ordinary briefing lay ahead. A short time later he was the country's defense minister -- at age 33. He was part of the inner circle around the party leader during the party's golden years in the 1980's -- until he took over the post himself last year. Today he describes 14 January 1993, when the Tamil report came out and Schluter decided to drop the reins, as the darkest day in his political career. Not so much because of his own political ambitions but his ambitions on behalf of the party. "I was there in the days when everything succeeded. Schluter became prime minister in the Conservative Party's great and stirring period. We had exciting and challenging tasks for 10 years and suddenly we ran into a large roadblock. It distressed me on Schluter's behalf because it was so unfair. He had served Denmark as a wise and capable leader and then it all had to end because of something he basically had nothing to do with. ``In addition, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen succeeded in establishing a majority government with a number of our partners for 10 years. Suddenly they were driving around in ministers' cars. The prospects definitely did not look bright. But it quickly became apparent that the present government was far from invulnerable. And nonsocialist Denmark was not relegated to the sidelines for a long period of time after all,'' Engell asserts. He does not rule out the possibility that the Liberals and Conservatives can form a government again after a September election. "But it will not be easy. Sixteen seats must change hands. But if someone had asked me a year ago, I would have been much more skeptical than I am now." Today the Conservatives are moving up in the polls again -- and Schluter has reestablished himself by beginning a new political life as the party's leading candidate for the European Parliament. Two weeks ago the Conservatives held a European Union (EU) seminar at Christiansborg. Engell gave the political introduction and afterward felt it natural to ask for a few words from the former prime minister, who has represented Denmark at EC summit meetings for 10 years. "No, I don't want to say anything. Things are going well and Hans knows much more about this than I thought he did," Schluter replied. "I have never been sure whether Schluter's subtle remark concealed praise or criticism. But it is typical of him." In daily political work Engell seeks advice from Kaj Ikast, Niels Ahlmann-Ohlsen, Anne Birgitte Lundholt, Per Stig Moller, and Henning Grove, in particular -- as well as the party's organizational chairman, Torben Rechendorff, and secretary general Peter Sterup. Poul Schluter, on the other hand, stays in the background. "It is a big help that I can consult him, but he is not the kind of person who comes running himself. There have been a couple of situations I consulted him on later, and he said that it was perhaps not exactly what he would have done," Engell says with a smile. "Schluter has always been there, you know. If everything went haywire he always had the ultimate responsibility. I have had to get used to the fact that the roles are now different. ``I do not go around thinking of myself as God's gift to the Conservative Party. Schluter has taught me not to be pompous, but to take the work and the responsibility very seriously. I have made this my own style. Personal ambitions must not be decisive for political work. When the ambition of holding high office becomes an overriding motif there is a risk that one's vision will become blurred.'' The unpretentious style is expressed especially in Engell's relations with colleagues and journalists. When Prime Minister Rasmussen recently briefed the political parties on the situation in Bosnia late one evening, Liberal Party chairman Uffe Ellemann-Jensen and group chairman Ivar Hansen quickly left through the famous glass door without a single comment to the few waiting journalists. A little later a relaxed Engell came out and told them what had happened at the meeting. Which, incidentally, had been quite undramatic. [passage omitted] There have been several scratches on the surface of relations with the Liberal Party since Schluter, to Ellemann-Jensen's great rage, decided to resign as prime minister without calling an election. Since then the Liberals have shot up in the polls while the Conservatives have looked on enviously. In contrast to the Liberals, the Conservatives have clearly abandoned aggressive opposition politics. When Henning Dyremose (Conservative) decided to leave his post as political spokesman -- and politics in general -- in August, it was after having pursued a hard unsuccessful campaign against the government and the prime minister on the issue of overcompensation in Tarnby. "We are not elected to the Folketing to sit and look out the window and throw spitballs at Rasmussen. We have a majority government and our opportunities to exert influence have been incredibly limited," Engell says. Then they might just as well throw spitballs -- like the Liberals, we suggest. "The Liberals have also presented a number of political proposals. But I regard it as the Conservatives' job to be critical and constructive. The government has supplied a thin stream of issues, scandals, and cabinet changes. There has been little need for us to fan the flames. Rasmussen himself has had to run around putting out fires from morning till night." Last weekend the Liberals' EU congress approved a program that lies far from the Conservative ideas about Europe. "The Liberals and the Conservatives will manifest themselves differently on individual political issues. The Liberals said yes, we said no to the new elementary education law. The Liberals clearly have a more federal aim in European policy, while we maintain that there must be cooperation between independent autonomous nations. We do not want to make the EU Council of Ministers and Parliament into Europe's government and parliament. We do not want any bicameral system. When we had the negative vote on 2 June it was because we were paying the price for having neglected the debate on Europe for 20 years. We cannot afford to gamble with Denmark's position. Therefore we must assure ourselves of a large and broad political majority when we move ahead in the European process," Engell says. When the Liberals and Conservatives went into the opposition together, they set up a joint coordinating committee to harmonize viewpoints. Even so it is increasingly apparent that the two parties have different views about how Denmark should develop. And when the Liberals presented a proposal last week to lower the tax burden by 10 percent within the next 10 years, it met with deafening silence from the Conservatives. On the other hand the Liberals have not been heard from in connection with the Conservatives' latest initiative, which BERLINGSKE TIDENDE can unveil today. It is based on increasing the influence of the wage-earner funds on Danish economic life. "Many of the Liberal proposals are also solid conservative policies. But we have our own proposals. Like close family members we can naturally have good friendly fights at times -- but we are two completely independent parties and there is a healthy and natural competition between us. The moment we acquire government responsibility we will put the proposals together," Engell says. He has absolutely no wish to speculate about whether a new nonsocialist government will be led by either Ellemann-Jensen or himself. "The crucial thing is that personal issues do not become a problem." Nor has he thought about which ministry post he would like if he does not become prime minister. Although: "Not justice minister, at any rate." Says the former justice minister. He loves to read books. Novels and books about politics and history. When he is through with them they are taken over by his daughters, aged 20 and 22. Recently he read Peter Olesen's books about architecture in Copenhagen. This led to the party becoming the first in this country to formulate its own architectural policy. However he does not intend to compete with Ellemann-Jensen as an angler: "The results one achieves from fishing are often in inverse proportion to the amount of time one spends doing it. And there are other ways of getting fresh air." One of the books Engell has read with less enthusiasm is Liberal Anders Fogh Rasmussen's ideological debate book, Fra socialstat til minimalstat [From Social State to Minimal State]. "There are many interesting ideas in the book. But I think the old parties -- the Social Democrats, the Radicals, the Liberals, and the Conservatives -- have a joint responsibility for the welfare state we have built up since the war. Most of it was carried out with the support of very broad majorities. It would be dishonest and in conflict with conservative thinking if we now wanted a complete break with the social model for which we ourselves have a major responsibility." Despite the different signals from the Liberals and the Conservatives, Engell has no doubt that the two parties combined represent the only alternative to Poul Nyrup Rasmussen. Government cooperation with the Social Democrats or the Social Democrats and the Radical Liberals is "totally precluded," and a government with the Progress Party is "not realistic" either. But if the Liberals, the Conservatives, and the Progress Party should constitute a majority after the election, it should be utilized for such things as amending the tax reform and the labor market reform. But Engell does not consider it very likely that the Radicals, CD, or the Christian People's Party (KrF) will return to the nonsocialist fold after the next election. "The day will come when they turn toward us. But it will take a lot for the middle parties to change sides in the coming election. ``If we are to regain our full strength it will not be by steering a slalom course between changing opinion polls. Even though the present government has tempted us almost beyond endurance for the past year I have tried to refrain from participating in the very personal attacks. I will not seek a short-term gain by criticizing something the government does or says in situations where I am well aware that one cannot demand the impossible,'' Engell says. He attracted attention recently when he praised Prime Minister Rasmussen on his return from Malmo after a meeting with Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt on the Oresund traffic link. "Nothing is so surprising in Danish politics as the government and the opposition praising each other. Naturally it must not go too far.... But there is seldom any reason for that." Although Engell thinks Rasmussen is a weak prime minister in many ways and lacks the ability to distinguish between big and small issues he shows no lack of appreciation for the government leader's openness. "Although he heads a majority government, he is good at orienting other parties on important political questions. He would rather hold too many meetings than too few. And it is very hard for me to be mad at him. He has some basically attractive human traits." He totally disagrees with CD political spokesman and group chairman Peter Duetoft, who strongly criticized the press for overstepping ethical limits in connection with the Juncker affair. "If there is anyone who cannot be blamed it is the media. On the other hand the politicians are much too willing to take a stand. And it is characteristic that every time it is necessary to think in a long-term perspective the politicians ask a panel of experts to look into it. And this kind of review is usually written in sand and quickly obliterated. In that way too much of the discussion that concerns national development is conducted outside the political parties." Is that because the politicians are not capable enough? "Yes! Politicians spend too little time thinking."
