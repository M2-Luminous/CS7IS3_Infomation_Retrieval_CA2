Almighty God has said: Remember, Abraham said: O my Lord! Make this city one of peace and security. [Koranic verse] Mr. Speaker, Honorable Deputies: With the help of God, this country will remain secure because the Almighty has blessed our country with a leadership believing in God and sincere in performing its duty, and because this country has qualified security organs that believe in their duty to protect the homeland and the citizen. We do not brag about that because they are all your sons and brothers, people of this country. However, they deserve admiration, appreciation, and respect. Recently, a group or groups of people have been arrested. They sought to harm this country. They had aims, which included plans to blow up public places. These included the House of Representatives, considering it a state institution. They also planned to blow up places such as cinemas, video shops, and night clubs; assassinate a number of intellectuals and economists in this country; rob banks, considering them usurious establishments; attack police foot patrols and seize their weapons and also attack intelligence men; and attack public places. Four crimes against supermarkets, taxi drivers, and a liquor store were carried out. They also committed crimes in the Rivoli Cinema in Amman and the Salwa Cinema in al-Zarqa', as you heard and as we announced. An explosive charge planted in Zahran Cinema in Amman was defused and did not explode. Yesterday, a group of persons were arrested. They had in their possession two bombs intended to be detonated in Irbid, and another two in al-Salt. This morning we received information that a bomb had been planted in al-Hashimiyah Square [in Amman]. All measures were taken, but the bomb was not found. Last night we received word about a bomb in the al-Nasr Cinema in al-Zarqa' and we investigated that this morning. In fact, brothers, investigations are going on and efforts are continuing. In reply to the brothers' questions, I wanted to clarify these points, and all details will be announced when the investigations are completed. The eyes of your sons, the men of all security organs will remain open, with God's help, to serve this steadfast country. This is what I have, Mr. Speaker, at present. When the investigations are completed, we will announce all dimensions of this issue. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. [Tahir al-Masri] Thank you Mr. Minister, and thank you all for these efforts that, with God's help, will keep this country safe and secure. [end recording]
