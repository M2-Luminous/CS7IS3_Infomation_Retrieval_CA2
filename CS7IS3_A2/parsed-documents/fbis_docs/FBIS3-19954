The Court turned down Air France's claim that the purchase of Dan Air in 1992 should have been investigated by the EU competition authorities. The Court said Dan Air's turnover was not big enough to trigger an anti-trust investigation. The European Commission approved the purchase last year after ruling that the resultant merger would not produce unfair competition for the Belgian airline Sabena.
