In light of that plan, he gave orders to change the security guards in the city of Hebron one week before the massacre. The change involved 20 security chiefs, who were informed of the details of the settlers' scheme to commit the massacre. Our information is that the Israeli security chiefs ordered the Israeli soldiers to intervene should the plan fail or in case the Palestinians resisted the settlers who had been selected to carry out the plan. The name "Operation Theresa" was given to the operation to storm the al-Ibrahimi Mosque and slaughter worshipers inside it. "Theresa" is the name of a leading settler who took part in arranging the massacre together with the chief of staff and three Israeli leaders. Operation Theresa was the literal outcome of the seven agreements Rabin signed with settlers leaders, the agreements which AL-SHA'B publicized a few months back. Information reveals that sophisticated Israeli weapons were handed to the settlers 48 hours before the massacre. The weapons were transported from the United States by the terrorist Zionist groups, who are still in possession of these weapons. [passage omitted]
