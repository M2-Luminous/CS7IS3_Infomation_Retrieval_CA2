Pitha, who handed in his resignation for health reasons yesterday, is also a KDS member. In line with the coalition agreements the post belongs to the party. Pilip is a graduate of the Prague School of Economics (VSE) where he majored in international economics and trade. He then worked at the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences and VSE. After restitution of family property near Tabor, South Bohemia, in the wake of the fall of the communist regime in November 1989, he was placed at the head of a medical equipment factory employing 80 people. Since August 1992 he has held the post of deputy education minister (since February 1993 first deputy). Pilip entered political life after November 1989. Before he had been neither a member nor a candidate for membership of any party. He became a member of the KDS shortly after it was formed in 1990. In December 1993 he was elected the party chairman, replacing Vaclav Benda. Now the government coalition party has 10 out of the total of 200 seats in the parliament. Pilip's wife Lucie was Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, but left the post after her husband became the KDS chairman to avoid a conflict of interests. At present she is an executive director of the Bohemiae Foundation. Pilip knew Pitha before November 1989 from the Independent Intellectuals Group. After Pitha became education minister he offered Pilip a position in a ministerial team in charge of economic and conceptual issues. Pitha was born in 1938. He graduated from the Philosophical Faculty of Prague's Charles University where he studied Czech, general linguistics and history. He also studied mathematical linguistics at the Mathematical-Physical Faculty of Charles University. Privately he studied theology and was regularly ordained priest in the Netherlands in 1969. His main task at the ministry was transformation of education, but his proposals have been criticised by both the coalition parties and the opposition. On March 28, 1994, education trade unions called a protest rally against the proposed changes in the management and funds distribution at schools. Pitha also came to the rally which he commented later: "I do not know what the meeting was about and even after my return from Old Town Square (where it was held) I was no wiser." After a government session yesterday, Premier Vaclav Klaus said that Pitha "has done more than it might seem from the skirmishes in the parliamentary Education Committee or from media reports." He added that with his humane and prudent handling of problems, he will be missed at government sessions. Pitha is the third minister to leave his post early. The other two were Health Minister Petr Lom (Civic Democratic Party, ODS) and Culture Minister Jindrich Kabat (Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party, KDU-CSL). Both of them were strongly criticised for their performance in transforming their respective spheres of social life. The present government emerged from the June 1992 elections.
