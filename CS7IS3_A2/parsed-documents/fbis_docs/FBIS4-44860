Within the coming five years the Federal Ministry of Research will provide about DM100 million for speeding up utilization of the results of gene research. Paul Krueger, Federal Minister of Research, announces that the emphasis in the new research program, "Methods of Decoding and Utilizing Biological Building Charts," is on development of therapies against diseases. This program is designed, above all, to stimulate the use of exceptionally- high-capacity computers and automated techniques in analytical procedures for decoding genes as carriers which carry heredity information and thus the important life's important building blocks. Genome research should help make it increasingly possible to put medicine, the pharmaceutic industry, and agriculture on a new scientific basis. An example of successful genetically engineered production of drugs is the "Factor 8" against hemophilia, which until now had to be isolated from human blood. According to expert estimates, over 4000 diseases at least can be traced to defects in biological building charts. Ernst-Ludwig Winnaker, director of the Genetics Center in Munich, reports that German researchers had played a substantial role in identifying the genetic causes of various diseases such as muscular ones and chorea, also heart and blood circulation diseases, and intestinal cancer. Krueger points out that the U.S., Japanese, British, and French industries are already heavily engaged in this prospective field. This, in the opinion of specialists, requires that the licensing procedure be shortened. Looking at the soon to be amended Genetic Engineering Law, Axel Kleemann of the Pharmaceutic Works in Dresden has pointed out that it is not sufficient to correct the law but also the new rules must be better implemented.
