Azanian Peoples Organisation [Azapo] official Dr Gomolemo Mokae said by telephone: "To the best of our information Azanla was not involved in the placing of the bomb." Azapo is a BCM member and is boycotting the all-race election. Dr Mokae said it was not uncommon for "De Klerk and company" to respond to such activities by condemning not only the white right, but also the black left. He was responding to a caller claiming to be from Azanla and claiming responsibility for the blast. "It is a bogus call initiated by the white regime to try to get rid of the egg on its face." Dr Mokae added although Azapo remained opposed to participating in the election, it believed it was the democratic rights of anyone to take part in the polls.
