The Assembly said any investigation against the deputies should be pursued "without keeping them in detention." The report was prepared by Dutch MP Eric Jurgens. Esat Kiratlioglu, member of the Parliamentarian Assembly's Turkish group said at the COE meeting that Turkey's problem was not with Kurds but with the separatist terrorist organization. He also accused the COE's motion author of not asking for the opinion of Turkish MP's during his recent contacts there, stressing the fact that there are 120 MP's there [not further specified] and some ministers in the Turkish Cabinet are of Kurdish origin. British Member of Parliament Brian Smith gave examples from his country and said that the MP who would defend the IRA could in the same way lose his seat at Parliament. Norwegian MP Johann Berg for his part said European parliamentarians are using every platform to attack Turkey and there are many important errors in Jurgens' report. Swiss parliamentarian Petra Fluckiger called attention to the activities of the terrorist organization in Turkey, stressing the COE should make a very thorough analysis when evaluating the situation. The Turkish parliamentarian group at the COE published a communique in which they strongly criticized and condemned the report, underlining the fact that this decision is of a quality that will encourage terrorism.
