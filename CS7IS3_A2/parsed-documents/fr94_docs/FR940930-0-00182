The clean-fuel vehicle standards and provisions of this subpart are applicable to vehicles used in subpart B of this part (the Clean Fuel Fleet Program) and subpart C of this part (the California Pilot Test Program). 1. Newly designated §88.102&hyph;94 of subpart A is amended by revising the the introductory text and adding the following definitions in alphabetical order to read as follows: §88.102&hyph;94 Definitions. Any terms defined in 40 CFR part 86 and not defined in this part shall have the meaning given them in 40 CFR part 86, subpart A. Adjusted Loaded Vehicle Weight is defined as the numerical average of the vehicle curb weight and the GVWR. Dual Fuel Vehicle (or Engine) means any motor vehicle (or motor vehicle engine) engineered and designed to be operated on two different fuels, but not on a mixture of the fuels. Flexible Fuel Vehicle (or Engine) means any motor vehicle (or motor vehicle engine) engineered and designed to be operated on any mixture of two or more different fuels. * * * * * Non-methane Hydrocarbon Equivalent means the sum of the carbon mass emissions of non-oxygenated non-methane hydrocarbons plus the carbon mass emissions of alcohols, aldehydes, or other organic compounds which are separately measured in accordance with the applicable test procedures of 40 CFR part 86, expressed as gasoline-fueled vehicle non-methane hydrocarbons. In the case of exhaust emissions, the hydrogen-to-carbon ratio of the equivalent hydrocarbon is 1.85:1. In the case of diurnal and hot soak emissions, the hydrogen-to-carbon ratios of the equivalent hydrocarbons are 2.33:1 and 2.2:1 respectively. * * * * * 12. Newly designated §88.103&hyph;94 of subpart A is amended by adding the following abbreviations in alphabetical order to read as follows: §88.103&hyph;94 Abbreviations. * * * * * ALVW_Adjusted Loaded Vehicle Weight . * * * * * HC_Hydrocarbon. * * * * * HDV_Heavy-Duty Vehicle.
