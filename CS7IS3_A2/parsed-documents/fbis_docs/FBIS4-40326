In Mosanu's opinion, the political aim of this decision was to induce more stress into the situation and to rehabilitate the communist occupational regime. The leader of the faction considers that the parliamentary majority "realizes the interests of those who keep an army of occupation on Moldovan territory." Characterizing the political situation in the republic, Mosanu stated that efforts are being made to reannex Moldova to the Russian Empire. "In this context, Parliament's decision yesterday is an attempt to falsify history," said Mosanu.
