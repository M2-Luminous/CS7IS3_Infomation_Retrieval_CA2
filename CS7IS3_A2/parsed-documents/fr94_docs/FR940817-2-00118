Davis Sealed bids will be considered only if received in the Rio Puerco Resource Area Office, 435 Montano Rd., NE., Albuquerque, New Mexico 87107, before 10 a.m. on November 15, 1994, the day of the sale. Oral bids will be accepted commencing at 10:30 a.m., following the opening of all sealed bids, at the same place on the same sale date. Sealed bids of less than the appraised fair market value will be rejected. The apparent highest qualified sealed bid will be publicly declared by the Authorized Officer. The apparent highest qualified sealed bid will then become the starting point for the oral bidding. If no apparent qualified sealed are received, the oral bidding will start at the appraised fair market value. In the absence of oral bids, the apparent highest qualified sealed bid will establish the sale price for that parcel. In the event that two or more sealed bids are received containing valid bids of the same amount for the same parcel, and no higher oral bid is received for that parcel, the determination of which is to be considered the highest designated bid will be by supplemental bidding. In such a case, the high bidders will be allowed to submit oral or sealed bids as designated by the Authorized Officer. After oral bids, if any, are received, the highest qualifying bid, whether sealed or oral, shall be declared by the Authorized Officer. Bidders must be 18 years of age or over and United States citizens, and corporations must be subject to the laws of any State or of the United States. Apparent high bidders must submit proof of these requirements within 15 days after the sale date.
