In a cable he sent to His Excellency Lebanese President Ilyas al-Hirawi, his majesty said the victims fell in the church as a result of a plan by a criminal mentality that is no different in its evil intentions and tendencies than the mentality that planned the massacre at the holy Ibrahimi Mosque. Following is the text of the cable: Your Excellency Brother Lebanese President Ilyas al-Hirawi. May God's peace and mercy be upon you. We received with great sadness and deep sorrow the report on the ugly criminal incident represented by an outrageous attack on peaceful citizens, who were holding Sunday mass at Sayyidat al-Najat church in Zuq Micha'il this morning, and the resulting victims from among the people of sisterly Lebanon. Those victims fell as a result of a plan by a criminal mentality which is no different in its evil intentions and tendencies than the mentality that planned the massacre of the holy Ibrahimi Mosque Friday morning, the victims of which were citizens piously performing the dawn prayers to God almighty. As I express to you my sympathies on behalf of myself and the people and Government of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, I ask God almighty to grant his mercy to the victims' souls. May God help you so that you may continue your benevolent march toward the advancement and progress of your homeland and toward maintaining its security and the future of its generations. May God fortify the victims' grieved families with patience. May God's peace and mercy be upon you. Your Brother King Husayn
