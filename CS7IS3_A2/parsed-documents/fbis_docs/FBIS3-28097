The two countries decided against holding the high-level talks this weekend in Tokyo as originally planned because the prospect of an early breakthrough is dim, the sources said. U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor met Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and International Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai on Wednesday, but the two sides failed to narrow the gap over the U.S. demand that numerial targets be set to measure progress in opening Japanese markets to foreign products. Japanese and U.S. officials are supposed to draw up a progress report on the framework trade talks before Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton meet February 11.
