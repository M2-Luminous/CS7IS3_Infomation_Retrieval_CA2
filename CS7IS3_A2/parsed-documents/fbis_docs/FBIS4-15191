FBIS4-15191 "drsov067_v_94008" FBIS-SOV-94-067 Daily Report 5 Apr 1994 Lithuania Actual Unemployment Said To Exceed Official Data Actual Unemployment Said To Exceed Official Data WS0704075594 Vilnius ELTA in Lithuanian 1037 GMT 5 Apr 94 WS0704075594 Vilnius ELTA Lithuanian BFN [Text] As of 1 April this year, Lithuania had 68,000 job seekers registered. Among them, unemployed people accounted for more than 28,500. Forty-four percent of the unemployed were recorded in big cities, while the remaining quota -- in the province. The rate of unemployment remained unchanged in comparison with last month -- 3.2 percent. Unemployed people included mostly workers and women. There were about 20 people competing for each job vacancy. Specialists from the Lithuanian Labor Exchange claim that the official statistics do not reflect the actual situation on the labor market. According to them, it would be naive to believe in such a low unemployment rate when production turnout has dropped by 60 percent in the country over the past three years, and the previously prosperous enterprises producing machines and electronics have been moribund. For example, the hidden unemployment is masked when thousands of workers go on long unpaid leaves.
