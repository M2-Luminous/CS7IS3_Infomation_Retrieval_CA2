FR941117-2-00042 FR941117-2-00036 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Pursuant to the Federal Advisory Committee Act, Public Law 92&hyph;463, as amended (5 U.S.C. App. 2), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) announce that the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) signed the charter for the following Federal advisory committee: DESIGNATION: Citizens Advisory Committee on Public Health Service Activities and Research at Department of Energy Sites. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: HHS and the Department of Energy (DOE) have two Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) for public health activities and research at DOE sites. One transferred the responsibility for the management and conduct of energy-related analytic epidemiologic research to HHS. HHS has delegated program responsibility to CDC. The Office of Environmental Restoration and Waste Management and the Office on Environment, Safety, and Health within DOE have a separate MOU with ATSDR. This MOU addresses ATSDR public health responsibilities around DOE sites. In addition, ATSDR is required by law (Sections 104, 105, 107, and 120 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act) to conduct public health assessments and where appropriate other health activities (for example, health studies, health surveillance, exposure registries), many of which are conducted at DOE sites. Implementing these MOUs requires significant interaction with communities living in proximity to DOE sites. This charter is in response to the requests by representatives of the communities surrounding DOE sites to provide consensus advice and recommendations on community concerns related to CDC's and ATSDR's activities related to the sites. PURPOSE: The Citizens Advisory Committee on Public Health Service Activities and Research at DOE Sites will provide advice and recommendations to the Director of CDC and the Administrator of ATSDR regarding community, Native American Tribes, and labor concerns pertaining to CDC's and ATSDR's public health activities and research at respective DOE sites. Activities will focus on providing a forum for community, Native American Tribal, and labor interaction and serve as a vehicle for community concern to be expressed as advice and recommendations to CDC and ATSDR. Dated: November 9, 1994. William H. Gimson, Acting Associate Director for Policy Coordination, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
