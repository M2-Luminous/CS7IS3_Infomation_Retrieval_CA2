The conference decided on four central tasks for this year, one of which is the primary task of effectively strengthening the development of agriculture and of focusing on the "two-greening projects." What is meant by "two-greening projects?" The first is the vegetable basket project of concentrating on growing green vegetables in vegetable gardens; the other is the greening project aimed at improving the ecological environment. As the two projects concern the daily life of Shanghai residents and the municipality's ecological construction, great efforts and strong resolve must be made to carry them out successfully. General Secretary Jiang Zemin recently pointed out: Little vegetable baskets have a bearing on the people's daily life, social stability, reform, and development. Anything that concerns the people's basic daily life and vital interests is of utmost importance. From this angle we must understand the importance of stabilizing agriculture and undertaking the vegetable basket project; we must, in the spirit of reform, solve the contradictions and problems we encounter in developing agriculture and carrying out the vegetable basket project. We should apply entirely new ideas to carrying out a new round of high-standard vegetable basket projects for Shanghai in three years, establishing a perfect system of vegetable basket projects, and exploring a new path for undertaking vegetable basket projects for the nineties and for an internationalized metropolis in the next century. In recent years, because of the needs of urban development, vegetable growing and nonstaple food producing bases in the suburban areas have gradually been shifted to outer areas of the suburban areas. Therefore, the vegetable basket project must be steadily advanced in a planned way. It must be stabilized and upgraded in the course of readjustment. The outstanding problem faced now is the short supply of green vegetables during the slack season. In essence, this is due to the lack of agricultural facilities and the low ability to combat natural disasters. From the circumstances of the past few years, we have learned that to develop green vegetable production we should focus on strengthening the construction of production bases and that in strengthening the construction of production bases we should concentrate on the building of large vegetable growing greenhouses. In Shanghai, the supply of green vegetables during the slack season will be guaranteed if vegetables are grown in greenhouses on 25,000 mu of land in its suburban areas. We should be aware that the vegetable basket project involves many sectors, channels, and links in society. Therefore, it needs joint efforts and cooperation from various levels and sectors of society. We should adhere to the principle of invigorating agriculture through the application of science and technology. Departments in charge of science and technology should mobilize and organize technicians to work in the frontline of production. In particular, they should organize forces to concentrate on tackling such problems as developing vegetable and nonstaple food production through intensive, standardized, and modern methods. Education departments should assist the suburban areas in speeding up the training of administrative cadres, technical cadres, and specialized personnel for the "two-greening projects" and in improving the quality of rural workers. An important task in building Shanghai into an internationalized metropolis is to create a good ecological environment. While concentrating on the vegetable basket project, which stresses vegetable production, the masses of cadres and people in the suburban areas should also pay attention to grasping the project of greening the environment. Whether Shanghai can fulfill its greening target for 1994 depends on the efforts of its residents. In the rural areas, it is necessary to develop greening by planting trees around housing areas, villages, and alongside rivers and roads; strengthen the construction of coastal forest belts; and popularize the greening method of planting economic trees in housing gardens. Let us act now and strive to create a beautiful ecological environment in all the suburban areas where "there will be flowers in spring, shade in summer, fruits in autumn, and greenery in winter."
