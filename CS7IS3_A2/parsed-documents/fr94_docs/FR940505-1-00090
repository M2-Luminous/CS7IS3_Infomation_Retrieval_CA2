FR940505-1-00090 FR940505-1-00012 Two years after EPA publishes the VOC limit, all persons are prohibited from applying or storing in the affected area pesticides with VOC contents greater than the VOC limit. EPA believes this is sufficient time for affected applicators to apply existing inventory of high-VOC pesticides or to sell them to persons outside the affected area. Revisions to the VOC limit. EPA may require a producer to reanalyze its pesticides at any time. Based on this or other information, EPA may recalculate the VOC limit at any time. EPA does not anticipate recalculating the VOC limit frequently, as recalculation has significant resource implications for both the Agency and the regulated community. Recalculation may be appropriate, however, if EPA determines that the existing VOC limit is not equitably achieving the targeted emission reductions of 20 to 45 percent. Developments that might justify a recalculation include changes in pesticide use patterns and improved understanding of VOC emissions from pesticides. Alternative ranking scheme. Rather than ranking pesticides simply by VOC content, representatives of DPR and CARB have suggested ranking by VOC emissions. Under the former scheme, as incorporated in this NPRM, application of a high-VOC low-use pesticide (e.g., a pheromone) would be regulated even if it contributed much fewer VOC emissions than unregulated application of a medium-VOC high-use product. Under the latter scheme, pesticides would be ranked and regulated in order of their overall emissions, as determined by VOC content times quantity applied in the base-year(s). While the two ranking systems could provide equivalent emission reductions, EPA believes the simplicity of the former makes it easier to implement and enforce. Once the VOC limit is established, Agency inspectors can simply determine whether pesticides sold and used in the affected area comply with the limit. Under the latter scheme, however, rather than publishing a single limit, EPA would need to publish and regulate a list of all the specific restricted pesticides, which would need to be revised regularly to account for new and reformulated products and for changing use patterns. If, for example, a high-VOC pesticide had low use and low emissions in the base-year but high use and high emissions thereafter, it would need to be added to the list of restricted pesticides. Conversely, pesticides with unusually high use in the base-year might need to be removed from the list of restricted pesticides, adding to the likelihood of inequities and compliance problems. Nevertheless, EPA understands that alternatives to the regulatory structure contained in the proposed FIP rule offer different trade-offs between the various FIP goals (described in section I.B of this NPRM) of reducing emissions, encouraging State action, minimizing federal interference, etc. EPA has attempted to address some of these alternatives in paragraph III.C.4.d(4) of this NPRM. (3) Reporting, recordkeeping and test methods. Proposed ยง52.2960(f) describes the test methods required for determining the VOC content of pesticides. Pesticide producers may use one of two test methods: (i) Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA). This is one of the two test methods described in EPA's alternative control technology document (ACT) for pesticides (``Alternative Control Technology Document; Control of VOC Emissions from the Application of Agricultural Pesticides,'' EPA&hyph;453/R&hyph;92&hyph;011, March 1993, Appendix C). The method is based on the ``American Standard Test Method (ASTM) for Compositional Analysis by Thermogravimetry'' (ASTM E&hyph;1131&hyph;86). (ii) Volatile organics in pesticides (VOP) method. This is the second test method described in EPA's ACT for pesticides. It includes a purge and trap procedure conducted at constant temperature that allows for direct measurement of water content. DPR has investigated various modifications to ASTM E&hyph;1131&hyph;86 for analyzing a wide variety of pesticide formulations. Some of DPR's work is reflected in modifications to the method included in the ACT and in ยง52.2960(f)(1)(i) by reference. DPR's work is ongoing, however, and EPA expects that additional modifications to the method may be determined appropriate. Depending on the timing and scope of such modifications, EPA may address them through the discretion allowed in the proposed rule, by incorporating them into the final FIP rule, or by formally proposing and promulgating subsequent rule modifications. Modifications may include the following:
