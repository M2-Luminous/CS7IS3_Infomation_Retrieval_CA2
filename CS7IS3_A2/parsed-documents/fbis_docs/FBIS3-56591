The statement advises the Saeima to abstain from interstate agreements with Russia if they grant Russia rights to keep any military bases or other property in Latvia. Lawmakers should check whether the Cabinet and lower administrative structures take into account the viewpoint of local governments when carrying out municipal reforms. The local deputies reproached the government for its reluctance to help them take over Russian military property. The government also does not reprimand the local governments that do not perform their duty of property takeover. The government has not adopted any normative acts to regulate the actions by takeover commissions in situations when Russian military persons exert non-violent or armed resistance, or threaten with armed resistance, the local council said. The government has not done anything to prevent plunder and unlawful sale of former military property, the group added. The local deputies are also displeased with the government's reform policies. The reforms primarily target the expansion of Cabinet's powers, thus, nearing Latvia to an authoritarian model of state administration, they said. As reported, the Vidzeme District Council endorsed the Jan. 10 actions by its former Chairman Andrejs Rucs. Rucs acted "correctly and reasonably," when detaining the two Russian generals, it said.
