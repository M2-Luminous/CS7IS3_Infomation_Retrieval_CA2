It is obvious that Boban and Tudjman would like, in a rather masochistic way, to see Croats experiencing something similar to Ahmici and Stupni Dol [sites of massacres of Muslim civilians by Croat forces]. For several days this country's media have been citing a figure of 74 civilians killed in Krizancevo Selo. The West European and other world TV broadcasters who are stationed only a few km from this village have not reported a single line about this case because they have, of course, found nothing to report. Following the lies of the Croatian media, yesterday four European agencies, THE DAILY TELEGRAPH, CNN, the BBC, and REUTERS visited the site; they saw no trace of any massacre. The only thing they witnessed was the fact that the Bosnia-Herzegovina fighters in this area had scored yet another great military victory.
