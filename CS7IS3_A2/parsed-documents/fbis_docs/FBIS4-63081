This Is What Askar Akayev's Staff Has Decided"] [Text] The results of a public opinion poll conducted in Kirgizia [Kyrgyzstan] by Professor K. Isayev, a well-known scientist, if published, could have caused a real sensation. But newspapers that regularly published similar materials did not find space for them this time around. Let us disclose at once the reasons for this carefulness. According to the poll service, Askar Akayev, who has always been unrivalled in popularity ratings, ranked only... seventh! Topping the list is Apas Dzhumagulov, current prime minister, whose view on reform differs fairly significantly from that of the president. Frankly speaking, this is a scandal. The desire of the "ruling circles" to delay the dangerous publication appears entirely natural. Instead, SLOVO KYRGYZSTANA, the government newspaper, has published an article entitled "Who Profits from Populism in Sociology?" Apparently it is not hard to guess what its thrust is. But still, a complete "conspiracy of silence" regarding the poll has never materialized. Opposition newspapers published its results and gave their commentaries. The article "refuting" sociology was followed by a statement from the presidential press service and vehement denunciations in televised addresses. But maybe they should have given a thought to it instead of getting so excited, shouldn't they? After all, a rating, for all its subjectivity, cannot drop by itself. Right on the eve of the poll, the local press carried a report on removing K. Shakirov from the post of finance minister. He gave his relatives huge interest-free loans from the budget. Earlier, the parliament's controlling chamber named dozens of high-ranking officials engaged in tax evasion. Among them there was a brother of the president's chief of staff. People have noticed that blue Volvo cars presented to the president and other republican leaders by the notorious Siabeko firm have disappeared from parking lots outside White House entrances. They have been replaced with black Mercedes. Buses and trolleybuses in the city are running less and less regularly, however. I think it is these incidents, not Professor Isayev's mistakes, that have combined to play a malicious joke on President Akayev's popularity rating.
