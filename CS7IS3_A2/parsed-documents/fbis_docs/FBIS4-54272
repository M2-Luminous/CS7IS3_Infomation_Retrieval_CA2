The ministry did that because, in addition to the fact that the foreign minister himself very much wants to visit the United States at an early stage, the visit would "give the impression to the United States that there are signs of change" in resuming the Japan-U.S. trade framework talks, which is facing difficulties. However, it seems that the MOFA needs some time before reaching a conclusion, partly because the Diet schedule has to be taken into consideration, but also because some officials of the MOFA and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] are of the opinion that the situation is still "premature." Ever since he was inaugurated to the ministerial post on 28 April, Foreign Minister Kakizawa, in interviews and on other occasions, has voiced his strong desire to visit the United States at an early stage, saying: "I need to deal not only with the economic issues but also with North Korea's suspected nuclear arms development. It is also important for me to meet with senior U.S. Government officials soon to establish private and confidence-building relations with them." Keeping in mind the issue of resuming the economic framework talks, an issue pending between Japan and the United States, the MOFA's administrative authorities expressed a negative stance regarding the foreign minister's trip to the United States at an early stage, saying: 1) the two nations are now in a cooling-off period following the breakdown of the framework talks with no prospects of resuming the talks in sight; 2) a visit by the foreign minister will encourage the United States to harbor excessive expectations that Japan may come up with compromises over the points at issue, including "objective criteria"; and 3) such a visit, on the contrary, will have a negative impact on Japan-U.S. relations if it fails to produce results. However, some government officials and public opinion in the United States have begun to turn against the Clinton administration's hard-line policy, designed to urge Japan to compromise while hinting at the possibility of imposing sanctions. For these and other reasons, President Clinton said on 3 May that "the United States will not demand the acceptance of quotas or managed trade." During his telephone conversation with Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata on 9 May, the president urged mutual effort to resume the framework talks. Moreover, U.S. Trade Representative [USTR] Mickey Kantor, who had been leading others in criticizing Japan, on 10 May positively assessed Japan's stance shown during negotiations in individual areas, including the rice, construction, and cellular phone industries. In addition, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher called Foreign Minister Kakizawa on the same day and said that "we will welcome your trip to the United States before the Naples summit." Regarding such a series of movements on the part of the United States, MOFA analyzes that "there is a sign that the United States is softening its stance," according to a Foreign Ministry source. The MOFA thinks that the foreign minister's "trip to the United States before the summit will have its own political significance," according to a senior Foreign Ministry official. However, it is also certain that there still exists a deep-rooted view that "although the atmosphere in the United States is changing, it has not changed its stance (of demanding that Japan set objective criteria)," according to the same senior official. It seems that the MOFA will "seek, while carefully observing how the situation will develop, the possibility of realizing the trip in June," according to a Foreign Ministry source.
