Needless to say, his name was known still from his activities in the previous parliament, yet the image of the State Duma's head seemed to require greater refinement. Actually Rybkin was elected to the post of chairman by the skin of his teeth, polling the minimally required number of votes. Incidentally, the fact that a representative from the agrarian-communist bloc was ultimately elected merely corroborated the expected orientation of the majority in parliament's lower chamber. But Rybkin, who swopped the Communist Party for the agrarians after the October events last year, immediately gave it to understand that he was prepared to relinquish party partialities for the general weal. And the beginning of his career as speaker was marked by a categorical demand made of the government that it should present in five days a programme for overcoming the crisis in the countryside. Moreover, the speaker himself was of the opinion that the beginning of the hard work to observe order in the Duma turned out to be quite expectable: he had imagined it precisely like this and considered the first sittings to be perfectly quiet. MN: But, after all, there were attempts to disturb the normal flow of the session--when Zhirnovsky yelled whatever he wanted from the rostrum or when in the middle of the discussion procedure Nikolai Lysenko decided by all means to speak his mind from the rostrum about the Russian people being oppressed... No doubt, all of this will keep repeating. What are you going to undertake? I.R.: I believe that no one is insured against this. It is desirable that sittings should be presided over in such a way that no such situations should arise in general. MN: But no matter how it may be presided over, if Lysenko again decides to battle his way to the rostum at all costs... I.R.: I know all the civilized norms of cutting this kind of acts short. It so happened that I had occasion to thoroughly study the experience of work at different parliaments existing in the world. It's a different matter that not everything is simple with these norms. Whatever is considered elementary in Britain, Germany or the Netherlands--for instance, the presence of a bailiff in the hall--may be perceived differently in our case... But a certain measure of inuring is already in evidence. If you take the Constitutional Court--its bailiff is a majestic, important-looking and urbane person. And a sturdy guy at that. He comes up and says: "Please, Sir let's leave the rostrum." And leave they do, you know. There are different variants, too: penalties, fines, denial of the right to speak in the Duma for a certain time. Let's wait and see. Evidently, all these norms will have to be introduced gradually, with account to our mentality, not to provoke excessive irritation. I pin great hopes on the Duma's Council, on the leaders of political parties, factions and movements. Much will depend on the microclimate in the factions. Irritation and embitterness are neutralized by trust and respectfulness. MN: And do you believe that Zhirinovsky, for one, will be receptive to respectfulness? I.R.: Well, you know, at the beginning of the sittings we worked for three days on end without days-off. And I must say that Vladimir Zhirinovsky found a common language with Mikhail Poltoranin in situations when nobody even expected this. MN: In what way do you believe does the present parliament differ from the previous one? I.R.: The previous Supreme Soviet was smaller in numbers and therefore more controllable. Our Duma is somewhat more complicated. Putting it bluntly, this is in general a Congress held every day. But everyone understands that this must not be the case. There is a need for an efficient parliament. Therefore, as you have noticed, we reached a consensus quickly enough on how to institutionalize the Duma, organize factions and committees, and hold elections. Thorough work lies ahead, and only in the course of a mere 20 months if we exclude the beginning and the end. The role of factions increases as never before. They must coordinate their interests, and jointly with them--the political parties, organizations, social strata and population groups which they represent. The first week of the work is encouraging. MN: Where do you believe lies the main danger for this parliament? I.R.: There is the danger of repeating the rally-like nature of previous deputy sittings and "littering" legislative work with admixtures of various kinds. Therefore, let's say, we have worked for so long on procedural matters. MN: And are there no external dangers? I.R.: I understand what you are driving at. Let us hope that cooperation between the branches of authority will become closer, I would not even speak about interaction. It has proved dangerous to perceive the division of the authorities as their estrangement from one another. I believe that the October events have inoculated us against this. I have met with Shumeiko, with Vitruk and with the President alike. What kind of dangers can there be? You alone can inflict the greatest harm upon yourself. And if a person is prudent and receptive to someone else's opinion, he can avoid dangers. There is but one danger: if we find no accord, we may lose control over economic processes and hence over political ones. There are organizational difficulties. For instance, the deputies lived during the first week at the Rossiya Hotel. Is it hard to live there? Yes, it is. It's literally a joint of natural kind. People of venerable age--the age of statesmanly maturity--are severed from their families and live in what is in effect a hostel. Two deputies have already had infarctions. And the reason lies solely in their conditions of life. These are people with established habits and with a healthy way of life. One of them, I can tell you, has in general never smoked or drunk. Is there a need to decide the question? Yes, there is. Deputies must be enabled to buy apartments and bring in their families. I am speaking about strictly prosaic things. Because I am convinced: the plan of law-drafting activities will not be implemented unless all these questions have been decided. Is it possible to find a solution? Of course, it is. Jointly with the two other branches of authority. MN: What lessons have you drawn from Ruslan Khasbulatov's experience on the post of speaker? I.R.: Substantial lessons. There are several of them. But since this discussion will be somewhat incorrect, I would not like to enlarge upon it. If Khasbulatov were next to me or in an equal capacity... MN: Have your communist convictions undergone any changes? I.R.: Communist persuasions have undergone cardinal changes all over the world, and especially in our country. Strictly speaking, besides the five communist-oriented parties which refused to take part in the elections, all the others, who are left of the centre, are our Russian left-wing social-democrats. Gennady Zyuganov is being quite correctly persuaded that he is a social-democrat, and he need not find excuses to justify himself in this. We have accepted the diversity of the forms of ownership and management, and their equality before the law. If we happened to do to our country whatever has been done by the social-democrats of Sweden, the socialists of Austria, the socialists of France, and so on, what else could we wish our people and the representatives of our communist-oriented parties? When those dramatic days happened in October, my friends-agrarians, next to whom I had spent the whole of my life, were the first to come to me. After an unhurried, circumstantial conversation we decided to build an electoral association which would include the Agrarian Union, the agrarian trade union, the All-Russia Council of Collective Farms, and the associations of private farmers... A party plus trade unions--this is actually the agrarian variant of Britain's Labour Party. Moreover, it has successfully stood the test of elections. A fully specific, thoroughly political movement--the prototype of a party in the future. The gravest consequences of crises have always been heaped on the countryside. The countryside pays for everything. It does this today as well--in chase of the reform's tempo. Is this justified? They received the crop, delivered it to the state, and for this grain they have not yet received any money since July. The debt runs to 1.5 trillion roubles. Nobody bothers to pay this money. A very formidable phenomenon is emerging in Moscow--rural peddling: person, coming from the village, takes with him as much as he can carry--home-made sausage, lard, butter, honey, and what else, and he begins selling this right at a Metro station. This is a sign of latent civil war, however hard it is to pronounce this. And one more thing. In the 1930s in the family of my grandfather where there were seven children, my grandmother with two children alone happened to survive. And my grandfather himself is lying somewhere near Chita, we still do not know where his grave is. They died on fertile black earth from hunger, cold and disease because an effort was made to impose an idea. It was ruthless, though it was clear that this cut against life. I would greatly resent it if we revived the same in our approaches. I had great liking for Yegor Gaidar's team--young, clever and interesting people. Elegant if you like. But it seems to me that they have been trying to capture our monopolized economy with a head-on attack. Yet what is only possible is dismantling--not destruction. So that, for the same of my grandfather's memory and to prevent the repetition of whatever happened to him, I agreed to run on the general federal ticket of the Agrarian Party of Russia. MN: What changes have taken place in your personal life upon your ascent to the post of speaker? I.R.: None whatsoever besides additional work. My family may possibly have a sense of greater apprehension for me than before. But they don't speak about this. My parents feel keenly for me. I am their firstling, after me there were another four... My father had a series of insults after the October events. Although he is not yet too old a person. MN: In what situations would you consider your stay at the post of speaker to be impossible for you? I.R.: For the time being I see no reasons even to speak on this theme. I am convinced that those who voted against me will become my allies.
