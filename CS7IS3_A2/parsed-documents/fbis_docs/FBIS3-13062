Both, however, have expressed willingness to purchase unspecified quantities of national gas from Iran and try to reschedule Iran's debts to them. The Iranian proposal first came from President Hashemi-Rafsanjani at the beginning of PRC Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen's three-day visit which ended yesterday. Hashemi-Rafsanjani then made the same proposal to Indian Foreign Minister Dinesh Singh, who is currently in Tehran for economic talks. Hashemi-Rafsanjani's plan calls for the creation of an axis through which Iran, Pakistan, India, the PRC, and Japan would form a bloc opposed to U.S. hegemony. The Iranian president told his Chinese and Indian guests that Washington's current "provocations" against Japan on trade matters should persuade Japan to join such a grouping. A senior Pakistani diplomat said yesterday that the Iranian idea is nothing more than "a far from serious illusion." He added that Hashemi-Rafsanjani last year suggested a similar plan when Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto visited Tehran. A Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman said yesterday that his government had not received any Iranian official proposal for the formation of an Asian defense pact. Hashemi-Rafsanjani had hoped to persuade Qichen and Singh to meet with their Iranian counterpart 'Ali Akbar Velayati with a view to issuing a joint statement about the creation of the "new axis," but the two ministers refused to meet with one another. A highly-placed Iranian diplomat said that "the initiative did not evoke the required reactions, but we made good progress on the Kashmir issue." After meeting with Singh, Hashemi-Rafsanjani dropped his traditional calls for the full implementation of the UN resolutions on Kashmir. Intead he supported New Delhi's call for negotiations between India and Pakistan to resolve the issue "in the interest of the people of Kashmir and the entire region." Iran is known to owe the PRC and India $2 billion and hopes the two countries will agree to reschedule the debts along the same lines as the agreement Tehran concluded with Bonn. Iranian and Western diplomatic sources confirmed yesterday that both Qian Qichen and Singh explained to the Iranian leaders that their countries will not cooperate with Iran militarily unless Iran pays what it owes for past arms purchases.
