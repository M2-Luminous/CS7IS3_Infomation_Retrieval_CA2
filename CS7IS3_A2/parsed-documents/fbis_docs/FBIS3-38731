It is "a scandal" that the Croatian Government is not keeping its promise, Kohl said today in an interview with the private television channel SAT.1. This must be met with "the strongest rejection." At the same time, however, the chancellor defended the fact that the German Government had pressed for the speedy recognition of Croatia and Slovenia. Developments in Slovenia are a "success," he said.
