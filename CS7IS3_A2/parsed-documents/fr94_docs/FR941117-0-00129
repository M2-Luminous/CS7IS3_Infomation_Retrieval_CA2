Base transmitter locations must be at least the distance specified in paragraph (e)(2) of this section from the applicable protected TV station locations specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section. This requirement is intended to provide a 40 dB minimum desired to undesired signal strength ratio at the Grade B contour of a co-channel TV station. (1) The protected TV station locations are as follows: ␣ 1Mobile transmitter frequency range 1Protected TV station location 470&hyph;476 MHz Washington, DC 38 ○57 ’17 ’ ’ 77 ○00 ’17 ’ ’. 476&hyph;482 MHz Lancaster, PA 40 ○15 ’45 ’ ’ 76 ○27 ’49 ’ ’. (2) The required minimum distance depends upon the effective radiated power (ERP) of the most powerful mobile transmitter(s) in the system: ␣ 1Mobile unit ERP (watts) 1Minimum distance 2Kilometers 2Miles 60 193 (120) 50 185 (115) 25 177 (110) 10 169 (105) 5 161 (100) (f) Co-channel protection from base transmitters with high antennas. This paragraph applies only to base transmitter locations in the New York-Northeastern New Jersey urban area that utilize an antenna height of more than 152 meters (500 feet) above average terrain. The distance between the location of such a base transmitter and the applicable protected TV station location specified in this paragraph must equal or exceed the sum of the distance from the base transmitter location to the radio horizon in the direction of the specified location and 89 kilometers (55 miles_representing the distance from the main transmitter location of the TV station to its Grade B contour in the direction of the base transmitter). The distance to the radio horizon is calculated as follows: E:GRAPHICSER17NO94.009 where d is the distance to the radio horizon in kilometers h is the height of the antenna center of radiation above ground level in meters
