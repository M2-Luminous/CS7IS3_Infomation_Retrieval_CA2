Secretary Yan Haiwang delivered a speech in which he stated: Over the past year, all localities as well as People's Liberation Army [PLA] units stationed across the province have carried out in a down-to-earth manner activities to build model two-support cities and counties, with the result that Gansu's two-support work has made significant headway. Statistics show that over the past year, more than 400 cadres at the prefectural level and officers at the division level have personally taken part in national defense education and propaganda activities. During the New Year, the Lunar New Year, and the "1 August Army Day" periods, the provincial authorities sent more than 60 delegations to various border areas and grassroots units across the province to extend festival greetings, to express appreciation to officers and soldiers who have been stationed there for many years, and to help officers and soldiers tackle problems concerning war preparations, military training, military maneuvers, and daily life. Secretary Yan Haiwang went on: Over the past year, though lacking in funds, the provincial civil affairs department has managed to allocate some 1.7 million yuan to help demobilized officers and soldiers resolve problems concerning livelihood, housing, and medical care; has accepted and resettled some 540 officers who had been transferred to civilian work; and has secured jobs for more than 100,000 demobilized officers and soldiers. On the other hand, the PLA units stationed in Gansu have dispatched more than 800 "cherish-the-people" and "learn-from-Lei Feng" teams to various localities to provide assistance to local people. Some 0.45 million officers and soldiers and more than 9,900 military vehicles have taken part in the construction of some 130 local projects on different occasions and have helped build more than 200 public utilities. The locally stationed PLA troops also have helped deal with some 190 local emergencies and have provided unreserved disaster relief to the local people, with the result that more than 3,400 lives and large quantities of public goods and materials were saved on some 9,200 occasions. Also attending and speaking at the meeting were Sun Ying, Yang Huaixiao, and Du Hua, as well as some other provincial party, government, and military leaders.
