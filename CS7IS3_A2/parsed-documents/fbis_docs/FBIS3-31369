[passage omitted] A joint news conference was held by the two chiefs of state after the signing of the official Romanian-Croatian documents. The news conference was opened with a statement by President Ion Iliescu, who said that the bilateral relations have already experienced a positive evolution, despite the tensions prevailing in the former Yugoslav space, and that the current talks in Bucharest have shown that there is a real interest in developing these relations, as proven by the agreements and the Romanian-Croatian treaty signed on this occasion. President Ion Iliescu also hailed the agreement on normalizing the Serbian-Croatian relations and the latest developments in Bosnia. He said that a military solution to the conflict has no chance of success. Croatian President Franjo Tudjman said in his statement that his visit to Romania will give an impetus to the economic, political, cultural, and sports cooperation between the two countries and that the treaty signed in Bucharest will lead to a very good development of the Romanian-Croatian relations. Pointing out that Romania is the largest country in the region, the Croatian president said that it can play a major role in solving the conflicts in former Yugoslavia and in the Balkans in general. The guest said that if NATO resorts to air attacks, this might lead to an extension of the conflict. Consequently, negotiations to solve the situation in Bosnia are to be preferred. Both in his introductory statement and in the answers to the questions of the journalists, President Tudjman referred to the Yugoslav crisis, which he characterized as extremely complicated. He described NATO's ultimatum as having a possible positive aspect, but he also expressed doubts over its implementation. The Croatian head of state recalled his country's initial desire to maintain the unity of former Yugoslavia in a federation that can ensure the equal rights of the nations. That wish could not materialize, Mr. Tudjman said, because the proclamation of the independence of Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina was followed by the Serbian aggression against Croatia and Bosnia, with ended in the occupation of a third of Croatia's territory. In this respect, Mr. Franjo Tudjman emphasized the contribution that Romania can make, as element of stability in the area, to resolving the Yugoslav crisis.
