"The resumption of war in Abkhazia will hardly be possible if the Georgian leadership takes a reasonable path," Ardzinba told Interfax and Abkhazian television on Wednesday. He reiterated the Abkhazian leadership's demand that a U.N. peacekeeping force be deployed only along the Inguri River, marking the border between Abkhazia and Georgia. Ardzinba said the leaders of the republics and regions of southern Russia and Abkhazia would be meeting in the Russian city of Krasnodar early next month. He expressed gratitude to the city's administration for organizing the meeting, which he expected to focus, among other things, on the problem of the border between Abkhazia and Russia.
