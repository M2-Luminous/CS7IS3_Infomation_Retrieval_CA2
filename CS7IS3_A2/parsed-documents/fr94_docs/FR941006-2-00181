FR941006-2-00181 FR941006-2-00113 The Institute is particularly interested in funding innovative projects which evaluate the applicability of court-enforced treatment programs to substance abuse-related cases involving juveniles and cases requiring treatment services in addition to substance abuse treatment (e.g., spousal abuse, child abuse, or mental health cases); establish coordinated efforts between local courts and treatment providers for the effective disposition of cases involving substance abuse; or evaluate the effectiveness of various court responses to treating substance abuse. Proposals should demonstrate a direct impact on the ability of State courts to handle cases involving substance abuse fairly and effectively. The Institute will not fund projects focused on developing additional assessment tools, establishing court-enforced treatment programs for adult substance abusers, or providing support for basic court or treatment services. The Institute is currently supporting the presentation of a National Symposium on the Implementation and Operation of Court-Enforced Drug Treatment Programs. In previous funding cycles, the Institute has sponsored a National Conference on Substance Abuse and the Courts, and State efforts to implement the plans developed at that Conference. It has also supported projects to evaluate court-enforced treatment programs initiated by the Dade County, Florida, Pulaski County, Arkansas, and New York City courts, and the effectiveness of other court-based alcohol and drug assessment programs; replicate the Dade County program in non-urban sites; assess the impact of legislation and court decisions dealing with drug-affected infants, and strategies for coping with increasing caseload pressures; develop a benchbook to assist judges in child abuse and neglect cases involving parental substance abuse; test the use of a dual diagnostic treatment model for domestic violence cases in which substance abuse was a factor; and present local and regional educational programs for judges and other court personnel on substance abuse and its treatment. The Institute and the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) also are supporting two technical assistance projects: one by the National Center for State Courts to assist courts in implementing the plans developed at the National Conference; and the other by the American University Court Technical Assistance Project to identify successful drug case management strategies, conduct seminars on drug case management, and develop a guidebook for implementing drug case processing initiatives. In addition, the Institute and the Department of Health and Human Services' Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT) have entered into interagency agreement to conduct regional training programs for State judges and legislators on substance abuse treatment. i. Eliminating Race and Ethnic Bias in the Courts. This category includes State and local court projects to implement the action plans and strategies developed by the teams that participated in the Institute-supported National Conference on Eliminating Race and Ethnic Bias in the Courts, to be held in Albuquerque, New Mexico in March, 1995, and projects designed to assist teams in implementing their plans. A special accelerated cycle has been established for considering such projects. In order to be considered during the special cycle, concept papers proposing implementation projects must be mailed by October 6, 1995. They will be considered by the Institute's Board of Directors at its meeting in November, 1995. Applications based on those concept papers will be considered by the Board at its meeting in March, 1996. j. Assessing the Impact of Health Care-Related Issues on the State Courts. This category includes projects to develop educational curricula and other materials to assist judges in:
