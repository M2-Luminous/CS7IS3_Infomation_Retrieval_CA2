Inasmuch as the institutions of state in the Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY] are responsible for such matters, we, on the basis of the firm positions we have adopted in rejecting the war, and our decision to enter a defensive battle to foil this treacherous attack, declare to our great Yemeni people and to all local, Arab, and international quarters, that the solution to the existing crisis -- which was transformed by the rulers of Sanaa into a destructive war -- can only be achieved through the following: 1. A final ending of the war and the withdrawal of all attacking forces to the positions they occupied prior to 22 May 1990. 2. The immediate beginning of negotiations -- without pre-conditions and under the auspices of the Arab League -- this arising out of a desire to arrive at a peaceful solution within the Arab framework, so that further bloodshed and general destruction can be halted, and to prevent a resumption of fighting, thus guaranteeing peace and stability in Yemen, the Arabian Peninsula, and the Arab world. Our position constitutes proof of our continued responsible, patriotic concern. We have mobilized for the sake of the homeland, and we have made sacrifices along this path. At this moment we continue to pay the price for rejecting the war. We are eager to stop the shedding of Yemeni blood, which is being shed with impunity and unjustly, only to serve the insane purposes of those who began this war.
