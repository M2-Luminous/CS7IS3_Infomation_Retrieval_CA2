The two sides agreed the pact was necessary based on the growing volume of cross-investments, Foreign Ministry officials said. South Korea had invested 112 million U.S. dollars in the British colony as of the end of last June while Hong Kong poured 283 million dollars into Korea. The negotiations have been approved by both China and Britain so that the pact will remain in effect after Hong Kong is returned to China in July 1997, the officials said.
