The world is watching with growing concern the escalating trade confrontation between the United States and Japan. Last Thursday President Bill Clinton dropped a bombshell when he announced that his administration was reviving the Super 301 Trade Sanctions Authority in an effort to force Japan to buy more U.S. goods. The U.S. move follows the failure of Clinton and Japanese Premier Hosokawa at the Washington summit exactly a month ago to resolve the two country's long-standing economic differences. Though it is true that the revival of the Super 301 law does not automatically lead to sanctions, tensions are running high among economic circle that the likelihood of a U.S. imposition of sanctions, however remote it may be, cannot be precluded. And if the Japanese decide to retaliate, there is a possibility of a trade war between the world's two biggest economies. Of course both sides have said that they want to prevent such a war but the way they have been accusing and criticizing each other over trade issues places an element of doubt in the minds of economic analysts around the globe. The key point of dispute between the U.S. and Japan is the latest huge trade surplus of more than 130 billion U.S. dollars. Washington is determined to force a cut in this figure. It has demanded that Tokyo states numerical target in opening up the Japanese markets to more imports. Hosokawa has refused to bow to this demand which he says (?amounts to many strings) and increased U.S. protectionism. While the confrontation between the economic giants continues, there is increasing anxiety among the member nations of GATT over the effect the present squabble will have or prospect for an easing of world trade problem. It took GATT seven long years to conclude the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations last December. But the new outbreak of bilateral trade tension is putting the achievements of the Uruguay Round to detach even before they are fully operational. The round's final accord liberalizing trade in goods and services among 118 countries is due to be formerly signed at the meeting of foreign and trade ministers in Morocco in the middle of next month. The meeting will also discuss the agenda for further efforts to broaden world trade and endorse the conversion on the 45-year-old GATT into a new and more powerful World Trade Organization, WTO. This body is scheduled to be created in the first half of 1995. Under the above scenario, if big powers seek to resolve issues outside the multilateral system by trying to steer straight and not leave market forces to operate, everyone, both developed and developing nations, is bound to suffer. A trade war must be averted at all costs. It is up to the U.S. and Japan to resume negotiations to sort out their differences and arrive at sensible solution.
