According to the Central Bank of Russia's Moscow administration, a total of 9 billion rubles was put up for auction at an annual interest rate of 203 percent, that is 5 percent below the Central Bank rate. However, none of the Moscow banks applied to take part in the auction. It is thought that the reason for this is the extremely tough requirements that auction participants have to meet, and therefore people wanting to buy money were simply afraid of showing "Central Bank operatives" the state of their affairs. At the same time "robust" Moscow establishments which could quite easily have gained access to the auction already have adequate resources. There is no reason for them to acquire credit: An interbank market developed in Moscow long ago, where money can be bought far more cheaply.
