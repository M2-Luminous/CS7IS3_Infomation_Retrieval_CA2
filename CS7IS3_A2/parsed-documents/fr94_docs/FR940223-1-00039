FR940223-1-00039 FR940223-1-00005 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 93&hyph;ANM&hyph;42] Proposed Amendment of Class E Airspace; Portland, OR AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: This notice proposes to amend the Portland, Oregon, Class E airspace. This action is necessary to accommodate a new instrument approach procedure at the Portland International Airport. Airspace reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued use of the term ``transition area,'' replacing it with the designation ``Class E airspace.'' The airspace would be depicted on aeronautical charts for pilot reference. DATES: Comments must be received on or before March 26, 1994. ADDRESSES: Send comments on the proposal in triplicate to: Manager, System Management Branch, ANM&hyph;530, Federal Aviation Administration, Docket No. 93&hyph;ANM&hyph;42, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.

The Proposal The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to amend the Class E airspace at Portland, Oregon, to accommodate a new instrument approach procedure at the Portland, Oregon International Airport. The area would be depicted on aeronautical charts for pilot reference. Airspace reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued use of the term ``transition area,'' replacing it with Class E airspace. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designations for airspace areas extending upward from 700 feet or more above the surface of the earth are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). Class E airspace designations for airspace areas extending upward from the surface of the earth are published in Paragraph 6003 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 17 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designations listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order. The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 71 Airspace, Incorporation by reference, Navigation (air). The Proposed Amendment In consideration of the foregoing, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend 14 CFR part 71 as follows: PART 71_[AMENDED] 1.
