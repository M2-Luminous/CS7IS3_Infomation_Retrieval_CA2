The steps also include a stern order handed down to the proprieters of public service concerns such as public bath houses and restaurants to withdraw their recently raised charges. The measures were adopted at an emergency price-related ministers meeting held at the Kwachon government office under the chair of Deputy Prime Minister Chong Chae-sok. To stabilize the prices of seasoning materials, 3,000 tons of Welsh onions, 5,000 tons of onions and 3,000 tons of garlic will be imported. The meeting decided that if service charges and industrial goods prices would increase or increased fees and prices are not brought down despite Monday's steps, the tax office would absorb all increased amounts as taxes. To ensure rice price stabilization, the meeting decided to auction off 700,000 soks (100,800 tons) of rice held by the National Agricultural Cooperative Federation. If the amount is not enough to check rice price rise, government- held rice will be released limitlessly. Due checks will also be made to keep real estate prices from going up. The price meeting took place after President Kim Yong-sam urged Deputy Premier Chong earlier in the day to take sweeping steps to control price spiral. The attendees included home affairs, finance, agriculture-forestry-fisheries, trade-industry-energy, construction and health-social affairs ministers plus the Seoul mayor and the head of the National Tax Administration.
