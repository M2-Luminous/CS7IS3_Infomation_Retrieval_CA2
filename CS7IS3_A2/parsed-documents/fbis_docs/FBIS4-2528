This was revealed at the national conference on pilot cities carrying out comprehensive reform which opened today here in the capital of north China's Hebei Province. The other 14 cities selected are Changchun, Shenyang, Nanjing, Chengdu, Xian, Chongqing, Ningbo, Anshan, Tangshan, Yantai, Tongling, Changzhou, Quanzhou and Yanji. These 18 cities have better sense of reform, better foundation for economic reform and development, and heavier weight in the overall situation. They were selected to probe for a way of deepening the reform and opening wider to the outside world and sum up experience to pave the way for urban reform throughout the country, sources from the current conference said. During the experiment, however, the central government will not offer any more preferential treatment to the selected cities, the sources said. Instead, the selected cities should completely carry out all the reform measures and the macro-control policies promulgated by the central government. The emphasis of the reform will be put on establishing a modern enterprise system.
