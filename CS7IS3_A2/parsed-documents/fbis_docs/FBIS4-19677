This is because Greek interest has unavoidably focused on Washington's intervention to break Skopje's [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] intransigence. As a result, all other issues that should have been at the top of the agenda in Greek-U.S. summit talks (the Cyprus issue, Greek-Turkish relations, upgrading of Greece's role in the Balkans) are placed below. We can see that the priorities of Athens and Washington in the talks are not completely identical. Regarding the Balkans, the U.S. Government is mainly interested in maintaining stability in the southern region of the peninsula at any cost. This means that the argument that Greece is the most stable and the strongest-- politically and economically--country in the region, has been working against us from the time that we had bilateral problems with our northern "weak, unstable, and insecure" neighbors. It is becoming more difficult to persuade the Americans (as well as West Europe) that Greek reaction against Skopjean provocations or violation of the Greek minority's human rights by Tirana is correct. Equally without impact is the argument that our country is facing mid-level dangers from the stance of our neighbors because our allies and partners are struggling to prevent immediate and destructive developments in the Balkans. Something similar is happening with Washington's current stance toward Turkey. The U.S. Government seems to be concerned about the strengthening of Islamism in our neighboring country, the domestic unrest because of the Kurdish issue, and the possibility of an unexpected and uncontrolled situation that will destabilize Turkey. It is certain that these are the "facts" that mainly formulate the U.S. policy in the Greek-Turkish dispute and the Cyprus issue. Washington accordingly divides its intervention interest in Athens and Ankara for immediate resumption of Greek-Turkish dialogue and the "mutual" concessions that must be made in the Cyprus issue to resume the intercommunal dialogue. All of the above concepts certainly do not aim to preordain a failure of the Greek-U.S. talks. They aim at exactly the opposite: to make the political leadership the general public understand all of the parameters that will formulate the "outcome" and the "significance" of the summit meeting in Washington. Because, most probably, nothing will be judged at the Clinton-Papandreou talks that will be irrevocably against or permanently for our national interests....
