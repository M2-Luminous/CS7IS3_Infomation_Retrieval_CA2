FR940503-0-00056 FR940503-0-00014 POSTAL SERVICE 39 CFR Part 265 Release of Information AGENCY: Postal Service. ACTION: Interim rule. SUMMARY: This interim rule amends the Postal Service regulation which prohibits the disclosure to the public of information contained in Postal Service Form 1583, ``Application for Delivery of Mail Through Agent.'' The amendment will authorize the disclosure of information from Form 1583 for the purpose of identifying addresses as Commercial Mail Receiving Agencies. The intended affect of this amendment is to provide an effective tool in combating credit card fraud and other types of consumer fraud. DATES: This interim rule will become effective June 2, 1994. Comments are invited and must be received on or before June 17, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments may be mailed to Records Office, United States Postal Service, 475 L'Enfant Plaza, SW., room 8831, Washington, DC 20260&hyph;5240, or delivered to the above address between 8:15 a.m. and 4:45 p.m., Monday through Friday. Comments received may be inspected during the above hours in room 8831. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Betty Sheriff, Records Office, (202) 268&hyph;2924. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Commercial Mail Receiving Agencies (CMRAs) are private entities which receive mail on behalf of other persons. Both CMRAs and their customers are required to sign Postal Service Form 1583, ``Application for Delivery of Mail Through Agent,'' a copy of which is filed with the postmaster responsible for the delivery address. Under 39 CFR 265.6(d)(10), the disclosure to the public of any information contained in Form 1583 has been prohibited. The Postal Service, primarily through its law enforcement branch, the Postal Inspection Service, has been working with the credit card industry to prevent credit card fraud. One form of credit card fraud consists of submitting an application for a credit card under a fictitious name. Perpetrators of this type of fraud may use an address provided by a CMRA, which often appears to be a typical residential or business address, as a means of avoiding detection. Credit card companies have asked the Postal Service to help them detect such fraud by identifying CMRA addresses, and the Postal Service has concluded that the identification of CMRA addresses would be an effective tool in combating credit card fraud and other types of consumer fraud.
