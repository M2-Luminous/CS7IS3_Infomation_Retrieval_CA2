Aleksander Kwasniewski made assurances Friday [25 March] that Dariusz Rosati continues to be the joint candidate of the prime minister and the Polish Peasant Party [PSL]-SLD coalition, which is waiting for the president to change his decision. But Andrzej Drzycimski, Lech Walesa's spokesman, ruled out such a possibility. Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak did not speak out on the issue. The course of events may suggest that President Lech Walesa may not have been the only one to have doubts about Rosati's candidacy. That proposition could have been supported by statements coming from the PSL, by Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak's procrastination in his decision, and also by changes implemented in the Finance Ministry's leadership. So the president could have just willingly implemented a decision that the PSL coalition members were in an awkward position to implement. There has been a silent accord emerging for some time between the president and Waldemar Pawlak. I think both of them are equally interested in the SLD, and Aleksander Kwasniewski personally, not gaining too strong a position. The SLD is aware of the danger of close cooperation between the PSL and the president. That proposition may be supported by statements made by [former Finance Minister] Marek Borowski concerning the president's unreasonable powers and also by an evening session of the SLD Parliamentary Club during which there was unequivocal talk of the possibility of the parliament confronting the president. It was as if the essence of the president's decision was ignored. One can have doubts about whether it is a good situation where a deputy prime minister for economic affairs and the man responsible for the state's finances will be testifying in front of a court of law in the future in what is obviously a scandal, regardless of his status when in front of the court. First responses by the SLD leader indicate that he and his party intend to persist with their candidacy. On the other hand, the prime minister's restraint may suggest that the current state of "suspension of things" is to his liking. But will that not lead to instability in the coalition's situation? The question as to who would gain more out of a possible confrontation is open, even though there are many signs today that the SLD's position would deteriorate as a result of such a confrontation. There are no volunteers willing to form a coalition with the SLD. The Democratic Union [UD], which could possibly be considered, but with a whole list of reservations, is bound not to take such a step after it merges with the Liberal-Democratic Congress. The PSL's position seems much more comfortable. Neither UD nor the Union of Labor nor the presidential Non-Party Bloc in Support of Reforms (under certain terms, of course) rule out by definition cooperation with Pawlak. The impact of the current crisis on the situation within the SLD could also be interesting. Aleksander Kwasniewski's position within the party may be substantially weakened as a result of the recent coalition crises. He may be the recipient of a majority of accusations by his colleagues from the party concerning lack of efficiency, going along with the PSL, excessive self-confidence, and too unequivocal and perhaps not always mature opinions expressed. The SLD is not a monolith, and it also has three leaders who sooner or later may start competing with each other. So it is possible that the recent events may be perceived inside the party as mistakes made by a leader whose powers should be slightly curtailed "in the name of the coalition's continued existence."
