The conference, presided over by Comrade Ha Dang, head of the department, was attended by a large number of foreign correspondents. Also present were Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai and the deputy head of the CPV Central Committee's Foreign Relations Department, Pham Van Chuong. Comrade Ha Dang said: This is the first time that a mid-term conference of the Central Committee has been held. The conference is not an exception, as it is organized in accordance with Article 15 of the party statutes passed at the seventh party congress. Apart from other important tasks, the conference will hold a by-election to choose a number of Central Committee members. The number of candidates to be elected in this by-election, as stipulated in the party statutes, must not exceed 10 percent of the total Central Committee members elected at the seventh party congress. A XINHUA correspondent asked what will be the standards for new members elected? Ha Dang said: There are four major standards: Candidates must have good political acumen, working ability, and ethical integrity, and they must also be relatively young -- less than 55 years of age. He went on: [Ha Dang] That is the principle for selection. But there will be some amount of flexibility. A BANGKOK POST correspondent asked: Mr. Department Head, one of the tasks for the period ahead -- as outlined in the political report to be presented at the mid-term party conference -- is to renovate and rectify the party and strengthen the relationship between the party and the people. What will the CPV do to attract the participation of the younger generation, as the majority of youths has never been through war? [Ha Dang] Our party has been associated closely with the people since its founding. This relationship has originated from the fact that all tasks set forth by the party as well as its interests conform to the demands of the nation, for example, fighting for national independence and building socialism to bring about a beautiful life for the people. While implementing these tasks, we have scored countless achievements. Besides these achievements, there are shortcomings. To remain closely attached to the people, it is our immediate duty to unfailingly develop achievements and overcome shortcomings and deficiences. I would like to tell you that the majority of our party members is young. An Australian Television correspondent asked if there would be any Central Committee plenums following this mid-term conference. Also, if the shortcomings to be raised will involve corruption and will have anything to do with the party. [Ha Dang] There will be no Central Committee plenums held [immediately] after the mid-term national party conference. With regard to personnel changes in the Political Bureau, as you know, nothing will be changed, except for the replenishment of a number of members. The party will never change its name. This is because our party and people love the name of the Communist Party. As for the question of corruption, we regard this as a harmful practice. We will resolutely struggle to overcome and eliminate the harmful practice of corruption. Whatever their positions, corrupt officials must be punished in accordance with their offenses. [Correspondent] I am a REUTER correspondent. Mr. Ha Dang, will the events in East Europe and the former Soviet Union cause the CPV to revise its diplomatic and political policies? [Ha Dang] We are firm on Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh thought. We will continue to firmly maintain our course of development along the socialist path. All these things do not contradict our efforts to broaden our international relations and cooperation with many countries, international organizations, and different economic forces. It is the purpose of our renovation process to ensure successful national construction and defense. [passage omitted]
