FR941110-1-00003 FR941110-1-00001 Small agricultural service firms have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those having annual receipts of less than $5,000,000, and small agricultural producers are defined as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000. The majority of handlers and producers of cranberries may be classified as small entities. The Cranberry Marketing Committee (committee), the agency responsible for local administration of the order, met on August 23, 1994, and unanimously recommended modifying the administrative rules in effect under the order concerning delinquent handler assessments. The modification would increase the interest charge from 1 percent to 11/2 percent per month and add a late payment charge of 5 percent on delinquent handler assessments. Under section 929.41 of the order, each person who first handles cranberries is required to pay a pro-rata share of the cost of administering the program. This cost is in the form of a uniform assessment rate applied to each handler's acquisitions. Section 929.41 also provides that if a handler does not pay an assessment within the time prescribed by the committee, the assessment may be subject to an interest or late payment charge, or both. Section 929.152 of the rules and regulations in effect under the order specifies that delinquent assessments be subject to an interest charge of 1 percent per month on any unpaid assessment balance beginning 30 days from the due date prescribed by the committee. The committee currently schedules two assessment payments during the crop year which begins on September 1. Assessments equal to 100 percent of the prior crop year's assessment obligation are due on October 1. If a handler's October 1 payment is not sufficient to meet the current crop year's assessment obligation then a second payment, making up the difference, is required by April 1. If the October 1 payment exceeds the current crop year's assessment obligation then the committee refunds the difference on or before April 15. Assessments are the main source of funds to pay committee expenses. The failure of handlers to pay assessment obligations promptly results in added expense and operational problems for the committee. The committee has frequently encountered difficulty in collecting assessments from some handlers. To attempt to collect, the committee must incur the added expense of sending out additional invoices and contacting each delinquent handler by phone, in person, or by fax. Nonpayment or late payment of assessments hampers the operation of the committee. The authority to levy late payment and interest charges on delinquent assessments was added in 1973 to address the failure of handlers to pay their assessments promptly. Consequently, in 1978 an informal rulemaking change (43 FR 29764, July 11, 1978) was approved which established a one percent interest charge per month to address this problem. However, the current interest charge of one percent per month is not sufficient to induce handlers to comply with the assessment provisions. Competition in the cranberry industry has increased. The number of handlers regulated by the order has increased, and many of these additional handlers have been more reluctant to pay assessments in a timely manner. The increase in charges on delinquent assessments would encourage these handlers to pay their assessments more promptly. Charges would not be imposed until the end of the month if handler assessments are invoiced up to the 15th of the month and would be levied at the end of the following month if the handler assessment is invoiced later than the 15th of the month. Handlers would have ample time to pay their assessments and avoid incurring the additional charges. Any amount paid by the handler would be credited upon receipt in the committee office. These additional charges would apply to any unpaid assessments which become due to the committee after the effective date of this rule change. A 30-day comment period is provided to allow interested persons an opportunity to respond to this proposal. All written comments timely received will be considered before a final determination is made on this matter.
