In an exclusive statement to MENA, al-Tahir said that the holding of 21 experts as hostages reflects the power struggle between the militias of Abdirahman Ali, former President of northern Somalia, and Mohamed Ibrahim Egal, current president of the so-called northern Somalia. Al-Tahir, who is on a visit to Cairo, said that the abduction is also a result of the widespread frustration in Burco and Hargeysa, the two provinces that support secession. The three other provinces are opposed to secession, he stated. The Somali official expressed his hope that the United Kingdom would withhold its support to the secession following this incident and instead help the Somalis emerge united, not divided, from the current crisis. Al-Tahir said that he briefed Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa and Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid on the current developments in the country. Egypt, he added, promised to hold consultations with foreign countries and utilize its friendship with these countries in helping the Somalis face the current crisis.
