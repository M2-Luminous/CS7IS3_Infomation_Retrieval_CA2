Fujii indicated no objections at a regular news conference to including the government's commitment to overhaul the tax system this year in the market measures due this month. He was asked about a suggestion Tuesday by Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura to include the tax reform plan in the "voluntary" market-opening steps to address Japan-U.S. trade disputes. Fujii repeated that the governing coalition has already vowed to enact in this Diet session a permanent tax overhaul that shifts the tax burden away from direct taxes, such as those on income, toward such indirect levies as the consumption tax. Washington has called Japan's fiscal stimulus steps too paltry to boost domestic demand to help curb Japan's trade surplus. U.S. officials fault the one-year nature of the 6 trillion yen in income and resident's tax cuts decided on last month. Fujii refused to comment on reports that the fiscal 1994 budget might be delayed or that his ministry is preparing a provisional budget as opposition lawmakers are blocking the budget debate by wrangling over a questionable loan to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. The finance minister repeatedly stressed that the ministry wants the budget debate and enactment to proceed as quickly as possible but would not offer a time frame. He said quick enactment would be "a plus for real demand" but would not say whether delays would hurt the economy. He repeated that Japan does not plan to offer any new trade measures to the U.S. when Fujii meets U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen this weekend at a conference of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum members. Whether he will meet separately with Bentsen at the Hawaii meeting has not been decided, Fujii said, repeating that the APEC conference is for discussing regional economics and "is not a place for negotiating."
