This can be seen in a letter written by Deputy Minister N. Gulushko of the Russian Ministry of Safety to the Russian Government addressed to then Deputy Prime Minister Chernomyrdin in July 1992. The environmental foundation Bellona was recently given a copy of the letter while on a visit to Moscow. It says in the letter that half of Russia's nuclear power plants have such serious structural faults and such a poorly trained staff that they constitute a large threat. In the letter the Ministry of Safety is focusing in particular on the poor or completely nonexisting safety training of the employees at the nuclear power plants. According to the letter the internal safety training is wretched. Further it has been pointed out that internal unrest resulting from quarrels over wages at the nuclear power plants leads to a further reduction in the level of safety at the plants. The Kola plant is one of the plants that the Ministry of Safety uses as an example of this. Thomas Nilsen from Bellona visited Kola two days ago: ``For the past two weeks there has been renewed unrest at the Kola nuclear power plant. The plant is not paid for the power it delivers to heavy industry. This has resulted in the workers not receiving their pay. When the plant's director protested and threatened to shut down the reactors, he was fired by the Ministry of Nuclear Power, which however quickly withdrew the dismissal when the director was supported by the employees,'' Nilsen says, pointing out that such lasting administrative chaos contributes to reduced safety. ``Unrest concerning wages, etc., comes on top of already poor safety caused by a lack of professional understanding for what they are really doing, a lack of training in safety measures, and also the physical structural faults of the plant. I am convinced that on the day that a real accident happens at the Kola plant, it will be caused by operator error,'' Nilsen says. An inspection team from the International Atomic Energy Association (IAEA) has recently visited the plant, and the leader of the inspection team, the Japanese Van Lee Zong, said to the paper NORDLYS that the near accident during the night of 2 February this year could have been a new Chernobyl catastrophe with a reactor core meltdown. During his visit to Kola, the inspector told local journalists that the reactor core was only seconds away from a meltdown--and not minutes, as the public has been informed. When the hurricane that raged over Kola the night of 1 February caused a break in the power supply to the nuclear power plant, a long time passed before the operators were able to start one of the emergency generators and add cooling water for the two reactors. Without cooling water the reactor core would have suffered a meltdown. Inspector Van Lee Zong from the IAEA says that the near accident in February was caused by operator error. They were faced by a situation they had never been trained to handle, he says. IAEA has previously characterized the Kola plant as one of the 10 worst in the world. Van Lee Zong says, however, that from a purely technical point of view, the plant is not so bad today, among other things because the leadership has carried through some of the proposals for improvement submitted by the IAEA. But the personnel failed, and as Van Lee Zong says: ``I have never heard of such a dramatic episode.'' The near accident in February is the most serious known near accident in any nuclear power plant. On 27 May this year there was also an accident at the Kola plant when a valve in the reactor's cooling cycle broke. The reactors had to be shut down again.
