Speaking on television after polls closed in the second-round voting, Balladur said the French people had "confirmed the results of the first round" in which the two right-wing parties in his coalition won more than 44 percent of the votes. Balladur thanked the French people for their support "all the more because these are difficult times" -- an allusion to a wave of student protests over the past two weeks against his youth employment plan. Conceding that his proposals "are causing concern," Balladur said he would announce an initiative in the next few days "to reestablish dialogue." "It is my responsibility and duty as head of the government," he added, "to respond to this appeal from our young people."
