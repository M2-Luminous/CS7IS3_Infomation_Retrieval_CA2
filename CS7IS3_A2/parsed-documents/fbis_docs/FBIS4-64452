The Christian Democrats, the CDA, received more than 35 percent of the vote in the 1989 general election, but they have now slumped to just over 22 percent. The Social Democrats [PvdA] also lost ground. Their share of the votes fell from 32 percent to 24 percent, but they emerged as the largest party in the new Dutch parliament. The two major opposition parties -- the Conservative Liberal VVD, and the Progressive Liberal D66 -- made significant gains in the elections. Both now have a significant number of seats in parliament. The remaining seats were won by a total of eight smaller parties. The results provide no firm indication of the composition of the new government. It is clear, though, that any new coalition government will need the backing of at least three parties to secure a parliamentary majority.
