Qian Qichen, vice premier of the State Council and concurrently minister of foreign affairs, was invited to answer reporters' questions on the international situation and China's foreign policy. [Begin recording] [Unidentified XINHUA reporter] I am a XINHUA reporter. I wish to ask Minister Qian: In Detroit the day before yesterday, U.S. President Cinton expressed disappointment over the results of Secretary of State Christopher's visit to China. What is your view in this regard? What is your estimation of the possibility of the U.S. granting China most-favored-nation [MFN] treatment? Thanks. [Qian Qichen] Concerning Secretary of State Christopher's visit, I am also somewhat disappointed. Because it could have made more achievements [cheng guo] as was expected. However, now through this visit, we have reached a number of agreements. We have still made some achievements, but the achievements are not as many as expected. Meanwhile, regarding the MFN treatment I think it should be said that if it can be maintained, it will be good news to both China and the United States; otherwise, it will be bad news for both countries. [Unidentified reporter] My question is that following the announcement of the joint communique of the Chinese and French Governments, relations between the two countries have been normalized. Not long ago, the French parliamentary speaker visited China and it was learned that the French premier will visit China next month. I wish to ask Vice Premier Qian what do you think is the outlook for relations between China and France? [Qian Qichen] In the Sino-French Joint Communique on resuming normal relations between the two countries released on 12 January this year, the French Government promised that in the future it will not plan to approve French enterprises' taking part in arming Taiwan. The meaning is quite clear. Later, I made an official visit to France. An important part of which was to make preparations for Premier Balladur's visit to China. Therefore, I am convinced that Premier Balladur's visit to China is a major event in relations between the two countries. It will have an important bearing on promoting bilateral relations, including economic and trade relations. The visit will take place in early April. [An international reporter starts to ask question but is cut off by an unidentified moderator] [end recording] Foreign Minister Qian Qichen also answered reporters' questions on Sino-British Relations and relations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.
