F. Evdokimov, A. S. Ogir, Zh. P. Zhuravlev; UDC 534.8:534.7.4] [Abstract] Discrete mathematical models of hologram descriptions are examined. They are based on phase dependencies of the Frenel integrated transform and use raster representations of holograms and objects in the form of unidimensional hologram projections of acoustic sections of objects. Raster representations allow two dimensional quasi holograms to be processed in a computer by using special unidimensional high-speed procedures, as well as coordinated filtration methods. Ways to form hologram descriptions in the Frenel zone are examined, which is fundamental for modelling acoustic holography problems. Figure 1; references 7.
