N.": "`Aggressive Act' Against Austria"] [Text] Vienna -- Peter Pilz, spokesman of the Greens Federal Executive Committee, said that the credit guarantees for the continuation of the construction of the Czech nuclear power plant Temelin at Austria's border is an "aggressive act against the vital interests of the Austrian people." The Austrian Government has to respond to this "most serious attack on Austria's interests, at least in the past 20 years," with an official protest and by recalling the Austrian ambassador to the United States, Pilz demanded at a news conference yesterday, Tuesday [1 February]. A little later, after the Cabinet meeting, Chancellor Franz Vranitzky (Social Democratic Party of Austria -- SPOe) affirmed his rejection of the nuclear power plant construction, without dealing with Pilz's demand. Vranitzky: "We will not stop our activities." It is intended to offer again conversion to a gas-steam power station to the Czech Republic. He also asked Nationalrat President Heinz Fischer (SPOe) to "contact his U.S. counterpart," the chancellor stated.
