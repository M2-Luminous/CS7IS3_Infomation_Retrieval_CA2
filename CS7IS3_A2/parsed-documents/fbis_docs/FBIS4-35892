During a meeting with the chairman and members of the Executive Bureau of the General Federation of Trade Unions today, Ramadan said the steadfastness of the struggling Iraqi people, their jihad spirit, absolute faith in their just cause, and constant readiness to make sacrifices will fragment the unjust blockade and thwart colonialist-Zionist schemes and their evil objectives. Taha Yasin Ramadan urged direct interaction with the citizens and diagnosing their suffering and ways of remedying it through presenting views and opinions that enhance the steadfastness of the people and their ability to face the unjust blockade and foil the remaining chapters of the colonialist-Zionist conspiracy. He stressed that the brave jihad position of the Iraqi people and their valiant steadfastness in the face of the malicious blockade have removed all the justifications of aggression and contributed to isolating the U.S. position that aims at perpetuating the blockade in order to undermine Iraq's security, sovereignty, and free, independent will.
