"Our target is to produce over 60,000 CPAs in the next six years to bring the total number to some 100,000 by the end of this century," Vice-Minister of Finance Zhang Youcai told the press here today. He said that CPAs will be directly involved in the business accounting of some Chinese firms this year. These firms will be large state enterprises, conglomerates and large shareholding companies. In fact, Zhang said, all business accounting should be verified by CPAs in a market economy. But this cannot be realised at present since China at the moment only has 38,000 people with CPA qualifications. According to Zhang, seven Chinese universities will open specialized courses of study for CPAs for the first time this autumn, with 300 students to be enrolled. The new course of CPA studies will be expanded to more than 20 colleges and universities next year. Apart from university study, the government will set up three CPA training centers -- in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. The centers will begin to operate in two or three years, Zhang said. The Law on Certified Public Accountants which went into effect at the start of this year stipulates that anyone who wants to obtain a CPA qualification must pass the national examinations. China held two such exams in 1991 and 1993. Last year 13 percent of the 2,900 people who sat the exam obtained CPA qualifications. The government will make the exam an annual practice and it will be open to foreigners in addition to people from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, beginning this year. People from overseas with Chinese CPA qualifications will be allowed to form CPA firms on the mainland on a partner basis, according to Zhang.
