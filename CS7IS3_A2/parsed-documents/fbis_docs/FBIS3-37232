The talks with the U.S. President proceeded "in a cordial and friendly atmosphere," the Kazakh leader stressed, expressing satisfaction with the fact that the White House meeting had proved "productive." Nursultan Nazarbayev noted that the Charter of Democratic Partnership signed by the two presidents "marks a qualitatively new stage in our relations, which are now assuming a more comprehensive and long-term character." The document "embraces such areas as politics, economics, military cooperation, science, and technology, ecology, health care, and more." Security guarantees from the United States contained in the Charter, as well as Kazakhstan's participation in the multilateral cooperation in the framework of the Partnership for Peace program adopted by NATO, strengthen our confidence in Kazakhstan's future as a sovereign state, President Nazarbayev stressed. Earlier on Monday Kazakhstan's president met representatives of the U.S. business community. An agreement was signed on the principles of cooperation between the Republic of Kazakhstan, the U.S. Government's Overseas Private Investment Corporation, and the U.S.-Kazakhstan Council for Economic Development.
