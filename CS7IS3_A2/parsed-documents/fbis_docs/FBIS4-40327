They presented the declaration written by 11 deputies of the Socialist Party and Democratic Agrarian Party demanding celebration of the "50th anniversary of Moldova's liberation from the Romanian-fascist occupation" on 27 August. The deputies demanded the day of 27 August be declared a national holiday. The Congress of Intelligentsia chairman Alexandru Mosanu, called the declaration "the beginning of the restoration of the communist regime." According to local observers, authors of this declaration try to give to Moldova's independence day celebrated on 27 August another colour. The Parliament voted to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Moldova's liberation from the fascist occupation on 24 August. The deputies of the Intellectuals and Peasants Parliamentary Faction also opposed the draft law on press. They called it "the most anti-democratic law in any state." Alexandru Mosanu said during the press conference that, if this draft law passes, reporters will have to work under conditions of dictatorship. Valerie Matei stated that "a law on press which admits censorship cannot be democratic." He goaded the reporters at the conference to appeal without delay to international organizations to obstruct the adoption of this law.
