Two tank crewmen were killed and 12 captured, while a southern civilian also died and 10 others were injured, according to an Aden television reporter also at the scene. A T-54 tank was overturned at the entrance to the village of al-Waht, 20 kilometres (12 miles) from Aden. Black smoke emerged from three other tanks outside Waht. Southern soldiers and militiamen, backed by Mil MI-8 helicopters, raked the area with RPG-7 rocket and automatic weapons fire, while northern artillery on the nearby Subbayhah Mountains provided cover for the retreating tanks. Northern forces have opened new fronts in their four-week war to capture Aden, with fierce fighting around villages northwest of the port city, a military spokesman and correspondents said.
