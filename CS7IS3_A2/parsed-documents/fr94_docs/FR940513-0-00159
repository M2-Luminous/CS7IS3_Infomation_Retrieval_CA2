FR940513-0-00159 FR940513-0-00034 2. ``Gray Market'' Problem NEMA and Philips raised concerns about lamps legally produced for export (that do not comply with the EPCA minimum efficiency standards) being illegally imported back into the country (presumably still marked with the manufacturer's identification) for sale in a ``gray'' market by parties other than the manufacturers. 240 NEMA and Philips recommended that, to provide manufacturers with protection against enforcement actions for this domestic re-sale of these products, the Commission require that products that do not comply with the standards that are manufactured for export be marked indelibly with a symbol connoting that the product was produced exclusively for export. 241 240 Philips, G&hyph;5, 4; NEMA (Tr.), 326. 241 Philips suggested an ``X'' etched on the product. Philips, G&hyph;5, 4. There is insufficient evidence on the record for the Commission to determine how serious this problem might be, and to prescribe a labeling or marking requirement. Manufacturers who are concerned about the issue, however, can protect themselves by marking their products in such a way that it is clear that they were manufactured for export. 3. Disclosures on Outer Shipping Containers NEMA, Osram, and Philips recommended that the Commission require disclosure, on the outer shipping cartons of lamp products, of a symbol or statement indicating compliance with the minimum efficiency standards and labeling regulations mandated by EPCA. 242 During the discussion of this proposal at the Workshop, NEMA clarified that its recommendation was for a disclosure on the corrugated carton in which the manufacturer ships the products, and not the larger and sturdier shipping container that would be loaded on a ship and that could contain cartons of lamps on one occasion and cartons of other products on another. 243 While NEMA's and Philip's original proposals appeared to be limited to general service fluorescent lamps and general service incandescent reflector lamps, Osram said that the requirement should apply to ``all [lamp] products covered by the Energy Policy Act.'' 244 Philips and NEMA pointed out that this requirement would facilitate inspection of foreign products by the U.S. Customs Service. 245 The record contains no evidence of opposition to this suggestion. 242 NEMA, G&hyph;3, 27, 32, (Tr.), 327&hyph;28; NEMA's suggestions in the NPR also recommended this requirement (58 FR at 60154); Philips, G&hyph;5, 3; Osram (Tr.), 328. Angelo agreed with this recommendation. Angelo (Tr.), 328. NEMA suggested a symbol, or a statement such as: ``These lamps are tested and labeled in compliance with federal energy efficiency requirements.'' NEMA, G&hyph;3, 27, 32. 243 See Tr., 327&hyph;28. 244 Osram (Tr.), 328. 245 Philips, G&hyph;5, 3; NEMA, G&hyph;3, 27, 32, (Tr.), 327.
