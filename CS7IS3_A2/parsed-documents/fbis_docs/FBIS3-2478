The sixth lecture, entitled: "Mechanisms for Price Formulation," is presented by Luo Zhiling, vice minister of the State Planning Commission. After recalling how the irrational system of state-controlled prices hindered economic growth in the pre-reform years, Luo discusses three issues regarding the establishment of mainly market- based, price-forming mechanisms: 1) A review of the basic situation in price reform over the past 15 years. Luo recalls the following "fundamental" changes in China's price mechanisms as a result of 15 years of reform: The highly centralized system of government-set prices has been dismantled in favor of the market-based formation of most commodity prices through the gradual decentralization of government price-setting power. Market supply and demand is becoming increasingly influential in determining prices, causing the irrational price structure to become rational. A new system for monitoring and controlling prices in keeping with the demands of the socialist market economy has been initiated. 2) The necessity of continuing to deepen price reform. Luo notes that although 15 years of price reform have produced "notable" results, many problems have yet to be solved. One of the problems, he says, is the failure to decontrol prices on a handful of potentially competitive goods and services. Another is the unduly low government-set prices for a few basic products and infrastructure. A third is the lack of effective economic and legal means by which the government regulates and controls market prices. Luo then goes on to outline three main tasks for continuing to deepen price reform, which are: "1. Seizing the opportune moment to decontrol government-set prices on individual commodities and to further expand the scope of market regulation and control. 2. Gradually raising the unduly low prices of a few basic products and infrastructure to enhance the national economy's potential for continued development. 3. Establishing a sound system of price regulation and control by the government, as well as sound laws and regulations concerning prices, in order to regulate the order of market prices." 3) The basic principles for carrying out price reform. In explaining these basic principles, Luo says: "Price reform must promote the development of social productive forces," "the general level of prices should be kept relatively stable," and "the interests of the state, enterprises, and individuals should be taken into account." The lecture concludes at 0640 GMT.
