[passage omitted] On his way to Abidjan, the vice president stopped over at Nairobi airport, where he talked to the press. Answering a question, Dr. Kisekka said African (?strife) originates from the politics of hatred, which he attributed mainly to ignorance. He stressed the need for vigorous sensitization of our people to stop this. He said it is important to cultivate a culture of self-reliance to overcome indebtedness and other developmental problems. On the revival of the East African Community, he said Uganda welcomes the move, realizing the need for a collective economic force in the region. Regretting the collapse of the East African Community in 1977, he pointed out Uganda's historic brotherly ties with Kenya, which witnessed many Kenyans studying in Uganda's educational institutions and cooperation in other fields. On instability characterizing some countries in Africa, he said Uganda had made contributions to the resolution of conflicts and to date it has dispatched more than 700 troops to Liberia on a peacekeeping mission. On the situation at home, he outlined the government's programs which have facilitated a lot of change in the chaos before. He said the country is now preparing for Constituent Assembly elections which will result in the making of a new constitution to form the basis of governance. He said that the government is deliberately encouraging leadership by example, which has resulted in considerable success in some areas.
