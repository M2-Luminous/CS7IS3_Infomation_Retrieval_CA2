Long Live Glavlit?"] [Text] A directive of the President of the Russian Federation has endowed the directors of 38 ministries and departments with the right to decide what is considered a state secret. Only recently, the reserves of Samotlor oil and the building of a road beyond the Urals, the absolute figures for oil extraction, not just as a whole for the country, but even by individual oil fields, information on epidemics and permissible doses of radioactive, laser and super-high-frequency irradiation... were considered state secrets. What newspaperman does not remember the all-powerful Ivan Ivanovich Simdyankin from Agitprop, who alone decided whether the country should be told that a paper machine, let us say, in Kondopoga or Solikamsk had reached its planned capacity? Day after day, journalists had to wage an exhausting struggle with Glavlit [Main Administration To Preserve State Secrets in the Press, of the USSR Council of Ministers], trying to persuade and entreat the censors, trying to prove to them the nonsense of banning the publication of an apparently inoffensive fact. In response, however, they were shown a list of pieces of information which could in no way be reported. Things reached the point of absurdity. For example, you must not write about laying a highway to the electric power plant under construction in Siberia (beyond the Urals, yet!), but just designate the route of the access road and you can easily indicate where it comes from and where it goes -- the censor gave an "O.K." to the publication. To give Glavlit credit -- it was not the one that thought up the list of bans, it merely took pains to adhere to it. The list of state secrets was worked out in the depths of the ministries and departments, and approved by the USSR Council of Ministers. Now there is no USSR Council of Ministers, Glavlit has ended up unwanted, and the newspapers were swamped with facts that had been kept top secret. But somehow no one heard about pernicious journalists divulging any sort of state secrets, doing damage to the country, during the years of this freedom. (Mirzoyanov's convolutions, I am sure, were only of benefit to the country -- well, after all, journalists had nothing at all to do with it!) Just what is a state secret? The federal Law "On the State Secret" said that it is "...information protected by the state in the sphere of its military, foreign policy, economic, intelligence, counter-intelligence and operations-investigation activity, the dissemination of which might be detrimental to the safety of the Russian Federation." Judging by the President's directive, however, this concept is now given a broader interpretation: the safety of the state is identified with the safety of individual departments. Most of the ministers have been endowed with the right to qualify information as a state secret. The heads of the ministries of Justice, Labor, Social Security, Education and Culture and of the committees for Cooperation with CIS States and for Nationality and Regional Policy Affairs constituted an exception. It is completely understandable when the ministries of Defense, Internal Affairs, Economy, Federal Foreign Intelligence and Counter-Intelligence services and the MID [Ministry of Foreign Affairs] possess the right to make information secret. But what sort of state secrets do the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Agriculture, the State Committee for Higher Education and the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources guard? Or will they again conceal from us data on harvests, catastrophes and natural disasters, ecology and demography? We will draw them from broadcasts of the BBC or Radio Freedom. In a word, it is a question of whether society can obtain reliable, objective information -- the right to the freedom to seek, obtain and transmit this information was declared by our Constitution. It must be said that even before the president's directive it was quite difficult to obtain information at the ministries -- the press-services, created, one would think, to help the writing brethren, protected them reliably. These services, however, turned into an impenetrable wall, shutting the officials away from the journalists. The ministerial bureaucrats have now obtained a super-reliable means: consider some sort of data a state secret -- and they are tightly closed to the press. Again the officials will decide what we can know and what we cannot know. Does the departmental right to make information secret not contradict the presidential Edict, which speaks of indispensable informational openness concerning the actions of the authorities? It would seem that the list of state secrets should still pass a qualifying examination by expert scientists, lawyers and journalists. One more thing. Who will see to it that journalists still do not publish facts with the stamp of "top secret"? Will Glavlit rise again?
