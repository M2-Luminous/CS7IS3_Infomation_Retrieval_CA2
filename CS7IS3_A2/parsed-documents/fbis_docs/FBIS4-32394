"The Czech Republic now has practically no air strike force, because the remaining Su-29 planes are not equipped for fighting. These are certainly reasons arousing speculations about whether or not the Czech air force is still capable of any action," Ambroz said. Today's issue of the independent daily MLADA FRONTA DNES wrote that the decision to remove the MiGs had been made "in spite of the fact that these Russian planes are still considered in the world to be one of the best military aircraft." "The Defense Ministry has said officially that it would be uneconomical to keep this kind of fighters, because their operation is too costly, while military experts say that the army wants to get rid of them, because it wants to replace them in the future with fighters bought somewhere else than in Russia," the paper writes. It quotes Defense Minister Antonin Baudys as having said earlier that "the army is not interested in modernizing its equipment by supplies from countries with unstable policy."
