It was exposed in Pusan a few days ago that the puppet police had blacklisted and kept under surveillance several dozen persons of dissident origin who were detained by the puppet authorities on "charges" of involvement in the Kwangju popular uprising and other movements for democracy under the former military dictatorial regimes and are hired at work sites after their release. This proves that the Kim Yong-sam fascist clique continues resorting to the vicious intelligence and surveillance which were employed by the preceding military dictators as a means of maintaining their military fascist regimes, abandoning the "commitments" to "respect of human rights" and "stop to intelligence and surveillance", which he made when he was taking office. This also shows that although the traitor Kim Yong-sam declared he reassessed the Kwangju popular uprising as "a movement for democracy", he still brands participants in the uprising as "mobs" and continuously suppresses them overtly and covertly. The analyst points out: The South Korean students and people are now calling for the overthrow of the Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique and an immediate dismantling of the "Security Planning Board", "secret affairs command", and the puppet police, legacies of the military dictatorial regimes, and other fascist repressive machines. Human rights violation by the "civilian regime" must be discontinued at once and all the repressive tools be dismantled unconditionally as demanded by the South Korean people. If the Kim Yong-sam clique persists in treacheries, ignoring the demands of the popular masses, it will precipitate its own destruction.
