This is the first such statement to have been made by the Mozambican head of state since those Malawian youths allegedly came into Mozambique at the end of last year and since the two governments had met in January and agreed to cooperate to settle the problem. Speaking to Mozambican Television, President Joaquim Chissano had this to say: [Begin Chissano recording] With regard to the use of force by us, everything depends on the outcome of those efforts to settle the problem. If the outcome dictates the need to use force, then it will be the country's duty to defend its territorial integrity. I think, though, that it will not be necessary to go that far. [end recording] There are contradictory reports concerning the alleged entry of armed MYP men into Mozambican territory. Some government sources have already accused the Mozambique National Resistance, Renamo, of giving shelter to those youths. Renamo has, however, challenged the government to tell the United Nations where those men are. Other reports say that those MYP men were placed in Mozambique to be used at a later stage to destabilize Malawi, should the ruling MCP lose. This is the first major incident between the two countries ever since Mozambique threatened to place missiles along the border. The Mozambican Government had said at the time that Malawi was involved in a major Renamo military offensive aimed at creating the so-called Republic of Rombezia. However, the Mozambican Government is also having a bad time of relations with neighboring Zimbabwe. Maputo is annoyed about the fact that the Zimbabwean Government led by Robert Mugabe, who fought his war of independence with the support of the Mozambique Liberation Front, Frelimo, and later helped the Frelimo government in its war against Renamo, should now be giving greater attention to relations with Renamo.
