The U.S. Government has to attain the new round's blanket passage by 15 December under a term of negotiations it gained from the Congress, and so it is arranged that respective countries should show their acceptable conditions in each sector by 15 November. Among conditions are those related to Japan's rice issue, and Prime Minister Hosokawa must decide by that time whether Japan should accept "imposition of custom duties without exception" to replace all other trade barriers. Dark clouds of regional economic blocs are hanging low over the world economy, partly affected by the worldwide recession. Amid such a development, making the new round successful amounts to opening a bright prospect in the world trade. It is undoubtedly Japan that will receive the largest benefits by the success of the new round. Prime Minister Hosokawa should consider it the highest national interest to carve out the future of the world trade by effecting a breakthrough on the rice question. There is no doubt that the rice issue is an extremely difficult question, but it is after all nothing but Japan's domestic problem. It should be defined as a matter of secondary importance, compared with the supreme national interest. Seeing a prospect of hardship in the future of the new round, there was once a move in GATT to grope for a "small package" (small compromise). The move meant to avoid the difficult agricultural issue and settle things on a small scale. However, once such a move began, each country backed down on its concession plan, resulting in a widened move to only make smaller concessions. This resembles the way in which you make caramel candy. In making caramel, you should boil sugared water blended with baking soda, stirring the mixture with a stick. When it swells, the stick should be pulled out instantly and you will see caramel made in a flash. If you clumsily give too many small stirs, nothing will be produced and you will end in seeing only the sugared water remaining there. Sensing that there was such a knack at doing their business, respective countries came to realize that their negotiations would fail once they began moving toward the small package. They have thus generally agreed at present to work out a large package, that is, to produce the largest possible caramel. The agricultural negotiations between the United States and the EC are now facing difficulty. The Miyazawa cabinet appeared to be looking forward to the failure of the U.S.-EC negotiations, with the view that, as a result of the failure, Japan would not be called to task for the new round's collapse and could avoid settlement of the rice issue. However, this was a totally mistaken view. No matter how the U.S.-EC negotiations turn out, Japan should manifest its acceptance of the imposition of custom duties to replace all other trade barriers. This may possibly soften the EC's position and link to successfully reaching a global agreement. Japan receives the highest benefits from free trade, and it should make sacrifices for the new round which perfects free trade rules. Agricultural organizations and rice-related Diet members have made a do-or-die resistance to the imposition of custom duties under the following diagram: the imposition of custom duties = deregulation = the collapse of rice farming. Hikaru Matsunaga, former minister of international trade and industry, once said that "the logic that not even a grain of rice will be imported is not warrantable in the world" (January 1990). Reacting against his remarks, agricultural organizations adopted a resolution to the effect that "we seek his immediate resignation." Since then, the tendency to taboo the rice issue has taken root in the political world, and the issue has not been discussed at all, even in the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries [MAFF]. This is strikingly similar to the condition of Japan during World War II when people who mentioned a cease-fire or the unfavorable progress of war were regarded as traitors. Japan was heading toward a catastrophe because there was no freedom of research and the press, was it not? What prospects do agricultural organizations, the MAFF, and rice-related Diet members have now regarding the rice issue? It is indeed irresponsible for them to only call for stubborn opposition without having any prospect, and it is not an action taken out of real consideration for the future of agriculture. Farm Households Without Successors According to agricultural censuses, of every 14.9 farm households, only one household had a successor (a key male agricultural worker) in 1970; however, in 1991, showing a sharp decrease, one of every 78.7 farm households had its successor. This decrease in the number of households having successors will particularly be sharp in the upcoming five or six years. In those five or six years when people born during the first 10 years of the Showa era are expected to retire, the decrease will be made in geometric progression. The lack of successors are particularly tense among rice farming houses. Miyagi Prefecture, the home of the Sasanishiki rice strain, registered a ratio of one to 154 households in 1991 against the national average successor ratio of one to 78.7 households. When we compare this with the prefecture's 1990 ratio of one to 101.3 households, we will see how sharply the number of the households with successors decreased. Likewise, in Akita Prefecture, the home of the Akitakomachi rice strain, the 1990 ratio of one to 139.2 households changed to a ratio of one to 183.3 in 1991, and in Niigata Prefecture where the Koshihikari strain is produced, the 1990 ratio of one to 153.8 changed to a ratio of one to 251.8 in 1991, both indicating a sharp decrease. If this trend goes unchecked, farmlands will be successively devastated and abandoned across the nation in the upcoming five or six years. Why does rice farming alone lack successors like this while there are enough of them in the domains of flower and plant cultivation, animal husbandry, chicken raising, and the growth of vegetables? The MAFF and agricultural organizations are not analyzing the reason for this and, in the first place, they even do not report to the people on this serious situation. Young people shun rice farming because the rice industry is not profitable. It is said that, of profits accruing from the rice industry, 20 percent come from production, 30 percent from processing, and 50 percent from sales. It is only in this 20 percent sector where farmers are now able to display their creativeness and ingenuity. This is because they are bound hand and foot by the Agricultural Land Act and the Staple Food Control Act. In contrast, agricultural cooperatives control the 30 percent and 50 percent portions, skimming the cream of the top. Should the Staple Food Control Act be repealed, farmers can advance into the 30 percent and the 50 percent sectors. Then their managerial efforts will be rewarded, and they will become able to display their entrepreneurial spirit. Present agricultural cooperatives exist not for the sake of farmers, but for their own benefits, and farmers are just like serfs working at government-run farms. Such being the case, it is natural for young people to shun rice farming. What MAFF Should Do Is... What MAFF should do is think about how to release farmers from such inconveniences and restraints and make them enjoy the profitability of rice farming. It is none other than MAFF bureaucrats that fawn upon agricultural organizations and reckless commando-like rice-related Diet members and drive the rice industry to ruin. Former GATT Director General Dunkel's proposal, which constitutes the base of negotiations in the new round, calls for 1) importing 3-5 percent of minimum consumption requirements, and 2) lowering tariffs by 15 percent in seven years. As things stand now, our country already falls short of rice by 300,000 to 500,000 tons for other purposes [rice for uses as other than principal food] even when there is not a crop failure, and so there will be no problem in accepting the proposal. As for tariff rates, they will be brought up for negotiations after our "acceptance of the imposition of custom duties" to replace all other trade barriers, and even though the imposition of custom duties is realized, foreign rice will not flow in with a rush when initially proposed high tariffs such as a 700 percent rate are approved. Prime Minister Hosokawa, accept the imposition of custom duties to replace all other trade barriers with a firm resolve.
