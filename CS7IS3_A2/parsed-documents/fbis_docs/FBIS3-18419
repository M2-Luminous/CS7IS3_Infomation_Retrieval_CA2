John Major told 1,000 businessmen in New York: "What we are working for is nothing less than the reskilling of Britain for the 21st century." He used a key speech to the British-American Chamber of Commerce to stress that the UK was emerging from recession faster and more strongly than any other leading country in Europe. During the address, the culmination of Mr. Major's three-day trip to the US, he also: - Pledged to go ahead with the "three strand" talks on Northern Ireland, despite the rebuff he has suffered from the Ulster Unionists; - Announced he hoped the GATT world trade deal could be implemented on January 1, 1995 -- six months ahead of the original plan. Mr. Major said: "Britain has changed out of all recognition in the past 15 years and is changing again in the 1990s." He told his audience: "Like you, we have just come through a recession. It was painful, but we have come out stronger than before. ``This past year, Britain's economy has been growing twice as fast as forecast. And this coming year we are again expecting the fastest growth rate among main European countries.'' However, Mr. Major stressed that more change was needed for Britain to sharpen its competitive edge. "That is why we are embarked on a fundamental review of all the factors affecting our ability to succeed in the global marketplace. Competitiveness is the key challenge for the 1990s -- and it is one the British welcome." The Prime Minister pledged: "What we are working for is nothing less than the reskilling of Britain for the 21st century." He said added that it was not just industry that must innovate, but government as well. "The days of monolithic government are over. The governments that will help their countries to be competitive will do less but do it better. All our government departments have been told to roll back the burden of regulation. ``There is one British produce I want to see less of -- our famous red tape.'' Mr. Major said Britain and America were now driving through the historic GATT trade deal. He and President Clinton had agreed they should set an early target for tariff cuts to be implemented -- January 1, 1995 -- but other countries had to be consulted before this could become a reality. Mr. Major also stressed that Britain was the ideal base for operations in Europe, saying: "It is no accident that nearly 40 percent of all U.S. investment in Europe comes to Britain. We intend to keep it that way." He claimed that much of Europe was over-regulated, something which cost jobs and added to the burdens carried by employers. On Bosnia, the Prime Minister said he and President Clinton had agreed that Britain and the U.S. would take joint action to build on the Sarajevo ceasefire. "We are sending a joint British-American planning mission to see how we can help restore public utilities there." He said they both believed in firm action to enforce the no-fly zone and that Britain was supporting the American-led diplomatic initiative to seek agreement between Bosnia's Croats and Muslims. On Northern Ireland, the Prime Minister spoke of the overwhelming support the Downing Street Declaration had received, highlighting the BBC poll showing over 90 percent of people throughout the island of Ireland wanted Sinn Fein to renounce violence. "Yet they continue to hold back from the peace process and perpetuate violence. There have been 17 attacks on the security forces since the declaration." The Prime Minister said he hoped Sinn Fein could yet be persuaded to change. "I believe that strong support for peace coming from America can play a part in this. In the meantime, the British and Irish Governments will continue to work with the constitutional parties for a lasting political settlement."
