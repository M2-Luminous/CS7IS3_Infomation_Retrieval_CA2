Here is our special correspondent Agata Stanekova reporting from Nicosia: [Stanekova] Let us begin with the delegation's visit to Israel, which ended today. Minister of Foreign Affairs Jozef Moravcik, speaking to journalists aboard the plane today, said that pursuing a well-balanced policy in the entire region was an important issue for Slovakia. The visit was meant to send a clear signal, saying that the Slovak Republic wants to continue the process of deepening relations with Israel in every sphere, and we understood the visit as the first stage in realizing this fundamental aim, Jozef Moravcik said. During the flight to Cyprus, I also asked Slovak Minister of Economy Jan Ducky to assess the visit. [Begin Ducky recording] I am convinced, and this view was shared by our Israeli partners, that this was a historic visit because at long last we were able to normalize relations between Israel and Slovakia. This fact is of great importance for entrepreneurs and bankers in both countries because at last we can start working on the basis of direct contacts without middlemen and third parties. This should be reflected in both the extent of our cooperation and its effectiveness. I think the visit was very useful. Participating were not only members of the government delegation but also 15 entrepreneurs from almost all spheres of industry and a strong delegation representing the banking circles, led by National Bank of Slovakia Governor Masar.
