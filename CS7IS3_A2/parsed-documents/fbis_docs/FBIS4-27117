FBIS4-27117 "dreas104_c_94019" FBIS-EAS-94-104 Daily Report 30 May 1994 North Korea U.S. Peacekeeping `Guideline' Denounced U.S. Peacekeeping `Guideline' Denounced SK3005051494 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0503 GMT 30 May 94 SK3005051494 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["`Guideline' for Military Intervention" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, May 30 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN in a by-lined article Sunday says the "UN Peacekeeping Operation [PKO] Guideline" published by the United States some time ago is aimed at going ahead with military intervention and establishing domination and control over the world by using the United Nations, while evading losses in a more cunning way. The article reads in part: The U.S. president retracted the call for founding a "UN standing Army" which he had made during his election campaign, and worked out and published a new policy on the "UN PKO". This is connected with their interests and also with the repeated failures of U.S. Forces- led "UN peacekeeping operations" in recent years. The publication of the new "UN PKO Guideline" by the United States does never mean that it has ruled out military intervention against other countries or abandoned its ambition to establish domination over the world. The U.S. representative at the United Nations told a congressional hearing that the basic purpose of the new policy was to make the UN refrain from operations unacceptable to the United States and help in such operations as the United States wants. By such operations as the United States wants he meant military operations needed for executing their aggressive foreign policies. That is why the United States is committed to keeping its forces as part of UN Forces only in case its forces participating in the "UN peacekeeping operations" shall not be placed under the command of foreign forces but exercise operational command like at the time of the Gulf war or the Korean war. The U.S. decision to drastically cut back its contribution to UN peacekeeping spendings was motivated, in the final analysis, by its scheme to bring the UN under its control through increased financial pressure and commit military aggression and intervention against other countries by abusing the name of the UN, if necessary. The United States must discard the wild ambition to dominate and control other countries with recourse to its policy of "strength".
