He is the fattest deputy of the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet. Smokes a lot. Looks rather gloomy. He used to work in Donetsk as the manager of two right-flank coal mines. He was there for 22 years plus 15 more; therefore, he has the right to tell anyone where to go and how far. He addresses his audience as "Dear Comrades." His political views are in full agreement with his age and position. His arrival in the Cabinet of Ministers was preceded by a powerful wave of rumors. Zvyahilskyy's career in the government was linked to the onset ("he instigated it!") of the miners' strike in the fall of 1993, as well as to its more or less successful ending ("he bought them off, he buttered them up!") The chair of the first deputy prime minister in Kiev, which he occupied after a brief term as mayor of Donetsk, was rumored to have strong legs. It was alleged that certain forces faced the president with a choice: Either Zvyahilskyy gets nearer to power, or else... The next stage, his move into the office of Leonid Kuchma with all his belongings, was described by oral folklore in a style even more picturesque. It seems that Leonid Makarovich summoned Yukhym Leonidovich into his room and said: There is an opinion that you have to work as a Kuchma. But the latter was in no hurry to thank him for the confidence and he answered pensively: "I am rich, you see. My family is well-off; my children, grandchildren, and grandchildren's children will all have enough. But if the people of Ukraine are pleading..." Nobody tried to disprove the rumors because Zvyahilskyy did not grant any interviews or hold any press conferences. Ever. As a matter of principle. (Not quite, however. Quite recently the weekly ROSSIYA prepared a whole package of positively tinted materials in which a conversation with the acting prime minister took central place.) A note of distinction. The Ukrainian press media would normally start to lambaste previous prime ministers somewhere halfway through their fruitful activity. First, there would be voluminous interviews "with hopes for the best," and only by the time of the final curtain would they openly say the same thing about each of them: "What a bastard--he has ruined it all!" The years of training proved useful--they started to strip the acting minister down right away. Democratic publications started to find heaps of documents showing that Yukhym Leonidovich had something to do with some dubious crude oil deals. Using the opposition from the economy reformers' camp as the mouthpiece, the "moderate" were baring the totally unscientific essence of all measures taken by the government. For instance, the closing of the Interbank currency exchange or their stubborn refusal to free fixed dollar rates. The "petty Nazi" publications were insulted by the mere fact of an "alien" appearing at the very height of government power. The upset led them to poetry where Ukraine was up for a rhymed sale to the masons of the world by "Zvyahilskyy Fima, Soros, and Birshteyn." This was why the appearance of Yukhym Zvyahilskyy before the UNIAN information agency, which invited a horde of people with dictaphones and TV cameras for the occasion, became a sensation in itself: "The sphinx" has spoken! It soon became clear that Yukhym Leonidovich was a rather mediocre orator. He was also conspicuously uptight in an environment to which he was unaccustomed and he must have secretly cursed his counselor-aide with his impenetrable smile who had undertaken the task of creating his image. What the hell for, let me ask you? Zvyahilskyy saddled his nose with a helpful pair glasses and, without any emotion, read his introductory statement which anybody else would have read to the accompaniment of a brass band. He was reporting on an elementary plan that was drafted six months before without any creative thought or economic imagination. To stop hyperinflation, to stop the unchecked flow of Ukraine-produced industrial goods out of the republic, to ensure hard currency returns from exports, "to squeeze" due taxes into the budget, to stop the energy crisis, to prevent a food crisis... A hard administrative hand was choking the thin little neck of the market economy. All this meant that nothing good could come out of this. However... Inflation (married name "superhyperinflation") stood at 91 percent last December, but for some reason dropped down to 19.2 percent in January, 12.6 percent in February, and 5.7 percent in March, and showed a further tendency toward decline. These data were provided by the unemotional Ministry of Statistics, which would have been just as happy to please the ex-leaders... The prices of most essential foods have practically not grown in the last six months. (The majority of people who have not gotten any wages since January could not care less, anyway.) But then they did not freeze (people, not prices) in winter as predicted, either at home or at work. Energy sources were somehow obtained. For the same reason, the spring sowing campaign, traditionally run on emotions, has already been competed for all practical purposes, according to Zvyahilskyy. Quietly and without losses. Producers were given direct loans for fuel, spares, and chemicals, contracts were signed for state purchases, the price of bread was set at 1,290,000 karbovantsi per tonne, and so far the villages have managed to survive without upheavals. Zvyahilskyy closed the Interbank currency exchange, sort of outside of the plan but with all his heart. "Nobody will learn now how much currency was sold there in two years and to which enterprises--this is my official statement." The exchange was replaced by the Committee on Tenders, subordinate to the government. Now it is issuing special-purpose and controlled sums and yes, it is doing so according to the managerial principle "I give to whoever I find necessary." It issued 2.9 billion Russian rubles to prepare nuclear power stations for winter, $500,000 to purchase rubber, 1.5 billion rubles to purchase coalmining equipment. The acting prime minister was just as strict with the dollar, showing no reaction to the criticism of progressive economists. The "greenbacks" remained tied down by fixed rates. "They are forgetting that Ukraine imports 69.8 percent of its energy sources. If we free the rates, energy prices will skyrocket, followed by food and rent costs. The people will have no understanding for their government." After that came the news of the season. In the nearest future the government and the National bank of Ukraine will prohibit any circulation of foreign currency on its territory. Like Russia did. This will be the artillery onslaught before the introduction of hryvnya. His glasses were already lying on the side, together with his notes, his image, and the nasty word "macroeconomics." He bluntly refused to talk about his opinion of Kuchma, Kravchuk, or his leanings in the presidential campaign and politics in general. "I am an industrialist." But at the same time he described with gusto his recent meeting with the Crimean prime minister, "Comrade Saburov," which ended constructively for both of them, and he also mentioned his scheduled trip to Simferopol to "Comrade Meshkov." The "political industrialist" seemed to have used the only way to work he really knew, his 37 years of experience managing coal mines. Namely, he did not bother his superiors by worrying about which superstructure, "socialist" or "capitalist," would grow on his basis: The bosses know better. He assigned reliable people to the localities, not necessarily in top positions. He did not criticize the "top brass" (as a blessing, now he has very few of those) and he ignored all criticism from below and from aside. He did not ask for anything, including additional powers, because he knew he himself could get all he needed. It turned out that Ukraine, as one big mine which was well-worked, explosive, and stoked up by strike committees, could still produce coal. It could even rise in its steep downfall. The practical intellect of Zvyahilskyy caught this moment and used it. "The board of honors" did not interest him. The headline of this article is flawed, from a grammatical point of view. According to the rules, it ought to be replaced. In theory, it would be nice and prestigious to have a prime minister with the brains and looks of Lanovyy. With the charm and political instinct of Kuchma. With the progressive tendencies and ability to work of Pynzenyk. This would be an ideal sample! Top quality. Good enough for an exhibition. But this one is good for work...
