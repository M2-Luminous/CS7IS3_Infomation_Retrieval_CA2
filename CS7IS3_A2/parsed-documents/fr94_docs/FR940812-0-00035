No. 16] RIN 0960&hyph;AD81 Supplemental Security Income for the Aged, Blind, and Disabled; Eligibility for Children of Armed Forces Personnel Residing Outside the United States Other Than in Foreign Countries AGENCY: Social Security Administration, HHS. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This final rule reflects the provisions of section 13734 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Public Law (Pub. L.) 103&hyph;66, which amended section 1614(a)(1)(B)(ii) of the Social Security Act (the Act). Effective November 1, 1993, these provisions remove the restriction that children of armed forces personnel stationed in Puerto Rico or the territories or possessions of the United States may not continue to be eligible for supplemental security income (SSI) benefits while living outside the United States. EFFECTIVE DATES: This rule is effective on August 12, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Regarding this Federal Register document_Henry D. Lerner, Legal Assistant, Office of Regulations, Social Security Administration, 6401 Security Boulevard, Baltimore, MD 21235, (410) 965&hyph;1762; regarding eligibility or filing for benefits_our national toll-free number, 1&hyph;800&hyph;772&hyph;1213. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This regulation reflects the provisions of section 13734 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Pub. L. 103&hyph;66, which amended section 1614(a)(1)(B)(ii) of the Act. Effective November 1, 1993, section 1614(a)(1)(B)(ii) provides that SSI benefits may continue to be paid to blind or disabled children who are United States citizens and accompany their military parent(s) to assignments in Puerto Rico or the territories or possessions of the United States, if the children were eligible for SSI benefits for the month before the parent reported for duty overseas. Section 13734 expands coverage to blind or disabled children whose military parents are assigned to permanent duty ashore anywhere outside the United States. Prior legislation (sec. 8009 of Pub. L. 101&hyph;239) and implementing regulations allowed the continuation of SSI payments to children whose parents were stationed in foreign countries as of April 1990, but did not permit the continuation of SSI payments to the children of military parents who were based in Puerto Rico or the United States territories or possessions. We are amending §416.215 to reflect that eligibility for SSI benefits may continue for a child living outside the United States when the child: •Is a citizen of the United States; •Is living with a parent who is a member of the armed forces of the United States assigned to permanent duty ashore outside the United States; and •Was eligible for an SSI benefit (including any federally administered State supplementary payment) for the month before the parent reported for such duty.
