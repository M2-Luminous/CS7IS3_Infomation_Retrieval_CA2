The crackdown, launched in mid-April, was intended to check the flow of illegal CDs and LDs and restore order to China's audio-visual market, which is plagued by piracy and bogus products. The battle is particularly gaining ground in Beijing, Jiangsu and Guangdong provinces, according to Chinese reports. Investigators have found that most Chinese audio-visual publishing houses, record stores, show rooms and night clubs follow the law, while a small portion seek illicit ways to gain quick profits. In Beijing, police launched an attack last week in the entertainment market. They smashed three stores which sell pirated or smuggled goods, confiscated 1,607 LDs and 125 CDs in addition to 1,480 cassettes and tapes, the Beijing Daily reported on Friday. Currently, the city has 120 audio-visual publishing houses, 1,000 record shops, 400 show rooms and 500 night clubs. Meanwhile, in East China's Jiangsu Province, fake discs also have been the main prey of investigators from publication administrations since early this year, the Press and Publication Journal reported on Friday. Their first target was two LD factories in Jiangsu. One of the plants was found violating copyright law and was fined 200,000 yuan ($23,000). To add to the attack, investigators in the provincial capital of Nanjing have conducted six secret checks on the audio-visual market. They confiscated more than 5,000 smuggled and pirated discs. In Suzhou, Yangzhou, Zhenjiang and other cities, the investigators also seized more than 15,000 copies. With the attack, audio-visual markets in the province are taking on a new look, the journal said. Furthermore, the journal added, Guangdong authorities have also targeted CD and LD smugglers during the past two months. In addition to confiscating discs, they also closed down some unlicensed shopping stands. Along with the nationwide attack, research from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences suggested three ways to stem illegal pirating, the BEIJING DAILY reported.
