In anonymous telephone calls to local radio stations, persons who claimed to belong to the "Red Sun" said the attack is to protest the privatization plan implemented by the government of conservative Sixto Duran-Ballen. The attack, with three dynamite charges, downed an energy tower in the outskirts of this city, leaving the Papallacta water processing plant without electricity. This plant provides water to almost half of Quito's 1.5 million inhabitants. On several occasions civilian and military authorities have announced the dismantling of the "Red Sun," which has claimed responsibility for tens of bomb attacks in past years. Until now there have been no victims. "We want to stress that we exist and that we will continue operating clandestinely against the government," one of the alleged terrorists who called the radio stations affirmed.
