In recent years, the All-China Journalists Association [ACJA] also paid close attention to bringing into play its own strong points as a mass organization; opened up various channels; promoted mutual understanding and exchanges and expanded friendship as well as cooperation between Chinese and foreign press circles; studied the experiences in journalist work gained by every other country and used them as a reference; and made great progress. According to a briefing, the ACJA has received a total of 148 delegations of foreign journalists from about 40 countries in the past three years. Meanwhile, it sent 43 press delegations to visit nearly 30 countries. In having their contacts with foreign counterparts closely revolve around two themes, peace and development, these delegations helped all the people of every other country in the world understand China and improved Chinese press circles' understanding of their counterparts in every other country through exchanges between press circles. After China resumed diplomatic ties with Indonesia and normalized its relations with Vietnam, the ACJA organized in a timely manner mutual visits between Chinese journalists and their Indonesian and Vietnamese counterparts. In its capacity as a mass organization, the ACJA carried out numerous contacts with Korean press circles before China established diplomatic relations with the ROK. Chinese and Korean journalists associations sent formal delegations to visit each other in 1993. After the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the drastic changes in East Europe, Chinese press circles established ties or carried out contacts with their counterparts in Russia, Romania, Slovakia, Ukraine, Poland, the Czech Republic, and Albania. It also increased contacts with the U.S. press circles over the past three years. In 1991, it received a delegation of the U.S. press industry association which visited China at its own expense. In 1992 and 1993, China organized four [press] delegations to visit the United States. In compliance with the guidelines of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's instruction -- "In our opening up, we not only must develop international contacts but also must assimilate international experiences," Chinese press delegations paid attention to conducting a survey of the state of foreign press media as well as their experiences to use them as a reference. After they returned home, they wrote summary and brief reports which can be used as valuable reference materials in addition to publishing many articles on what they had seen and heard. As regards the contacts with the Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao regions, which have a blood relationship with the mainland, press circles on both sides closely follow the issue with interest. After the ACJA was entrusted to do so by the party Central Committee and the State Council in 1985 and 1987, respectively, it received Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan journalists who visited the mainland. Under the guidance of the principles "peaceful reunification" and "one country, two systems," it established extensive contacts with press circles in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao and promoted two-way exchanges. The ACJA received a total of more than 1,400 well-known journalists and figures from Taiwan press circles and more than 1,700 well-known journalists and figures from Hong Kong and Macao press circles over the past three years. With the assistance of the ACJA and with its coordination, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao journalists traveled all over the motherland and participated in the report on the sessions of the National People's Congress, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and the 14th National CPC Congress and on other important activities, thereby enabling the people in the Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao regions to have a better understanding of the motherland's reform, opening up, and investment environment as well as of China's 5,000-year-old history and culture.
