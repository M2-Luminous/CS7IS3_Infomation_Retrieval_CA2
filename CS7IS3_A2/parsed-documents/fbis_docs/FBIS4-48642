When Minister without Portfolio Jay Naidoo rose to leave, his colleague, Water and Forestry Minister Kader Asmal, remarked to him: "Our door is always open to you. We will be knocking on your door." The comment speaks volumes about Mr Naidoo's status in the new government and the relationship he will have with his colleagues in the cabinet. Armed with the budget and a red pen, Mr Naidoo has the full backing of President Nelson Mandela to intervene in every area of government. No door will be shut to him and his team operating form the floor above Mr Mandela's office in the Union Buildings. "I may be a minister without portfolio, but it does not mean I do not have a job," Mr Naidoo said this week. His task is to ensure that the ANC's Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) -- a plan to provide millions of jobs, 10 years free education, health care for all, electricity, housing and water on a massive scale -- is implemented. He has to bring together all the various departments into one coherent programme. It is a job that involves "a lot of talking" with ministers, the provincial governments and with civil society. Crucial to the success of his task is to build a partnership between the government, the private sector and the labour movement in a common national endeavour to better the lives of the people, he says. To carry out his task, he will have a transition team in his office and a cabinet sub-committee of ministers crucial to the RDP -- those from labour, trade and industry, finance, housing, transport, telecommunications, provincial affairs, health, education and water -- who will thrash out the programme's priorities before reaching the cabinet. In implementing the RDP, Mr Naidoo is constrained only by four factors: he must maintain a macro-economic balance; retain fiscal discipline; he cannot fuel inflation; and he must be guided by the principle of not raising the level of taxation. He is the minister that will work closet with Finance Minister Derek Keys. His task seems impossible given the constraints and the limited amount of money at his disposal. But Mr Naidoo is contemptuous of scare stories of R80-billion [rand] in addition to budgetary allocations being spent on the RDP by the end of five years, the spectre of a debt-trap and rocketing inflation. "The RDP is not an add-on programme. We are not talking about a new list of demands and adding on (to the Budget)." Instead, he says, each department's budget will be examined to see whether it fits the new priorities. "Finance is not the problem. The government, having resolved (the RDP), made the funds available and set up a plan -- the acid test is getting the plan working on the ground." And Mr Naidoo believes it is nonsense that the government cannot deliver housing, infrastructure and services. "There are communities out there that want the stuff. We have to break through the red tape of bureaucracy, go down and deal directly with the communities," he says. He talks of using the unions, business expertise and other non- governmental oragnisations to do this in the absence of effective delivery mechanisms. "It takes a lot of organisation but it does not come overnight. That is what frustrates me. We can do all of this. There are people on the ground ready to do it. What is stopping us from doing it?" It is all a question of reorientating the government departments towards effective delivery of services, establishing local government structures and being ruthless with a bureaucracy that absorbs more than it delivers, he says. "Part of my work is moving towards greater efficiency. Within five to 10 years, the framework in which the new government can operate will have been achieved and there will be no reason to have an RDP team." There are four sources of funds for the RDP. The first comprises "wedges" from the Budget which will increase each year. One scenario, released by the National Institute for Economic Policy this week, is that R80-billion from the Budget will be spent on the RDP in the next five years. The other sources are: development aid; donations from the private sector; and resources from non governmental organisations. Then there are always the "windfalls" that Mr Naidoo says he will have no reservation about using -- selling off assets like the "macho white glory projects of the past" that are not directly linked to delivering the RDP. He is also confident that with the restoration of services, the rent and services boycotts will come to an end. "Within these constraints, we are going to put forward a realistic plan, and we are confident that we have one. We have worked through mechanisms of harnessing resources, especially with the private sector, organised labour and other stakeholders. We are quite confident that we have drawn them into a real partnership," he says. The first small signs of the RDP will be visible in the Budget that will be presented on June 22. Work has already been done with Mr Keys, former State Expenditure Minister Ami Venter, Deputy Finance Minister Alec Erwin and Mr Naidoo over the past several months on identifying sources of funding in the Budget. They have examined expenditure patterns and carefully gone through the budgets of all the departments, arranging them in the order of priority for the RDP and assessing what could be achieved in this year's Budget. They have taken their red pens and marked areas of saving, and put a line through those projects which are no longer priorities. This money will be spend on RDP priorities in the first year. "We are not so naive as to think that we are going to achieve everything that we talked about in the RDP this year. We have to prioritise, but we have a clear idea of what we can achieve in the first year," he says. They will particularly focus on "kick-starting" the RDP, beginning with very visible programmes that will indicate to the electorate that the new government is different from the old. These priorities are programmes in the areas of education, jobs, health and infrastructure. The plan will be discussed at the cabinet meeting tomorrow. "It is only in the 95/96 Budget that we will begin in a more systematic way to reorganise expenditure along the lines of expanded priorities," Mr Naidoo added. It is the beginning of a reorganisation process that will take at least 10 years to complete. By then, Mr Naidoo says: "The entire Budget will be one of reconstruction and development. That is the ultimate goal. "The government will be the epitome of the RDP, operating under the mandate of the people and serving the people. My job is an interim function -- to get the government to become what it is supposed to be."
