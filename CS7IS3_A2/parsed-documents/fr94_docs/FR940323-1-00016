FR940323-1-00016 FR940323-1-00005 6. Payment Levels Under AFDC OBRA '86 added section 1902(1)(4)(A) to the Act, which provided that a State plan may not elect to cover the optional groups of low-income pregnant women, infants, and children up to age 5 described in section 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(IX) unless the State had in effect AFDC payment levels that were not less than those in effect on April 17, 1986. This provision became effective on April 1, 1987. OBRA '87 amended this provision, changing the date upon which AFDC levels would be measured from April 1 to July 1, 1987. The OBRA '87 amendment was effective on December 22, 1987. Section 302(c) of MCCA eliminated section 1902(1)(4), but placed a comparable provision in a new section 1903(i)(9). This provision states that payment will not be made to a State with respect to amounts for medical assistance for section 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(IX) optional groups if the State has in effect AFDC payment levels that are less than those in effect on July 1, 1987. In addition, section 302(c) established a new, more general maintenance of effort provision in section 1902(c)(1), which states that the Secretary will not approve any Medicaid State plan if the State has in effect AFDC payment levels which are less than those in effect on May 1, 1988. Because section 1116(b) of the Act distinguishes between plans and plan amendments, we interpret this provision literally as prohibiting approval of new State plans but not prohibiting approval of amendments to a State plan. The MCCA provisions were effective on July 1, 1989. There have been some questions raised about how we would determine if the AFDC payment level has been maintained by a State as specified in the law. ``Payment level'' is not an existing term used under AFDC. However, for the purposes of sections 1902(c) and 1903(i)(9), payment levels are the amounts of the payments for basic needs (according to family size) which would be made to families with no income under the approved State AFDC plan. Special needs are not included, as we have concluded, based on a review of statutory history, that Congress intended to include only basic needs. Thus, we propose to find a State has not reduced its payment level if it has not reduced the amount of the AFDC payment for basic needs made to a family with no other income. 7. Application for AFDC Section 4104(e) of OBRA '87 amended section 1902(1)(4) of the Act by adding a new paragraph (C) to specify that a State Medicaid plan may not provide that any of the low-income pregnant women, infants, and children under section 1902(1) must apply for AFDC as a condition of applying for or receiving Medicaid. Section 302(c) of MCCA made further amendments by removing section 1902(1)(4) and adding a comparable provision to section 1902(c)(2) of the Act. Section 1902(c)(2) provides that the Secretary must not approve any State plan for Medicaid if the State requires low-income pregnant women, infants, and children under section 1902(1)(1) to apply for AFDC benefits as a condition of applying for or receiving Medicaid. 8. Need for Regulations The statutory amendments discussed above are effective without regard to whether final regulations to carry them out have been published by the applicable effective dates. However, changes in the Medicaid regulations are necessary to bring the regulations up to date with current statutory requirements. 9. Proposed Regulations We propose to amend the Medicaid regulations under 42 CFR parts 435, 436, 440, and 447 as follows: •Add a new §435.118 to specify the mandatory eligibility groups of pregnant women, infants under age 1, children age 1 up to age 6 with incomes at or below 133 percent of the Federal poverty income guidelines, and children age 6 up to age 19 with incomes at or below 100 percent of the Federal poverty income guidelines. •Add §435.228 to specify the optional eligibility groups of low-income pregnant women and infants (and low-income children in American Samoa and the Northern Mariana Islands) and §436.226 to specify the optional eligibility groups of low-income pregnant women, infants, and children and the conditions under which they may establish eligibility.
