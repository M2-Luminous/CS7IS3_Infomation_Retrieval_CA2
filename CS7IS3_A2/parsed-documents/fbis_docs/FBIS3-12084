"It was particularly aimed at him because of his quality as a natural leader and not just because he is a Sandinist," residents and authorities concurred. The climate in this town has turned violent. "Things have regressed. Mistrust prevails again, and the hopes of any needy persons in the programs Javier was implementing have been dashed," Rosa Benavidez, a town resident, said with a broken voice. Sergeant Major Faustino Herrera Palacios, the officer in charge of the local police, told BARRICADA the case will be transferred today at the latest to the judge who will try the armed chieftains in absentia. A visibly shaken Herrera Palacios went to the place where Barahona had been bound. He found him without eyes and tongue, and with a knife embedded in this chest. According to preliminary investigations, Barahona was viciously killed. "It was a horrendous murder, preceded by a kidnapping. The culprits are Omar [not further identified], Jose Davila Reyes, Estrella [not further identified], and Erasmo Vasquez Salgado," the authorities affirmed. The police said armed men intercepted a bus with passengers between Jinotega and Wiwili, and went straight for Javier Barahona. His brother, Cesar Barahona, got off the bus, but was told to get back on it. These men took Javier Barahona to Aguas Amarillas and killed him near Bola de Cuajada Mountain. "They removed his boots, pants, personal effects, and left him there," Herrera Palacios stated. "At approximately 1800, I heard four shots and told my son: `That sounds bad. They killed Barahona,'" Leonila Castro, a resident of the area where the Sandinist leader was found, stated. In addition, Herrera Palacios said the armed men carried a list of persons with Sandinist affiliation, including persons from Wiwili, adding they know their victims well. This opinion coincides with that of the area residents who said the armed person were tailing Barahona since the previous Sunday. This kind of operation shows these men are the remnants of El Guapote's group because Omar -- a young man who just a few years ago was a child seen on Wiwili's streets -- joined this rebel leader and afterward was a member of the 3-80 Northern Front. When El Chacal [Jose Angel Talavera] began negotiations with the government, he and Chele Gringo [not further identified] were opposed and left to become active in the area around the town. Army troops have been pursuing this group -- estimated at between 15 to 20 men -- since noon Wednesday. They have disbanded, thus hampering their capture. Until yesterday, there had been no contact with them, but "we hope to soon," the military source said.
