Both parties should first lay the groundwork for the resumption of the framework talks through subcabinet-level negotiations, said the official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, who declined to be identified. As one option, the official cited the possibility of sending Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice MITI minister for international affairs, to Washington. But dispatch of cabinet ministers like the foreign minister would not be timely, the MITI official said, noting that sending such high-ranking officials with no specific proposals would further undermine the already-soured trade ties with Washington.
