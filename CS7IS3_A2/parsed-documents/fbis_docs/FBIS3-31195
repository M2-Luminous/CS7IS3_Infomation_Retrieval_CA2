The second place on the list is occupied by Sandor Nagy, president of the National Confederation of Hungarian Trade Unions (MSZOSZ), and the third by former finance minister Laszlo Bekesi, member of Parliament. The list was compiled at the joint session of the party's National Presidium and Board on Saturday [12 February], and will be finalized at a party congress on February 27. Horn told reporters that the top places of the list are occupied by senior party officials and deputies, who were particularly active in the past four years. In a move to open towards society, the list includes plenty of non-party people, for instance political scientists, artists, and clergymen. Addressing the joint session on Saturday, Sandor Nagy announced that the MSZOSZ accepted the MSZP's economic manifesto.
