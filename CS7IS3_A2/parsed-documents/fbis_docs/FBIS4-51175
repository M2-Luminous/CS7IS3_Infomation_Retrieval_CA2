All China's counties will get electricity supplies and over 95 percent of farmers' households are then expected to be supplied with electricity, officials said at a meeting here today of the Rural Electrification Working Conference, jointly sponsored by the State Planning Commission, the State Economic and Trade Commission and the Ministry of Electricity Industry. At the meeting, Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua urged departments of electricity and local governments to cooperate with each other in supplying electricity to the farmers through self-reliance and by exploiting local resources in the poverty-stricken areas so that the local farmers can become prosperous as soon as possible. China's rural electrification process achieved remarkable progress since the 1960s, sources at the meeting said. By the end of 1993, 97 percent of townships, 93 percent of villages and 89 percent of farmers' households had been able to use electricity. Per capita annual electricity consumption for the rural population reached 48 kilowatt-hours in 1993, 7.9 times the figure for 1978. Many large power stations are supplying electricity to the rural areas. Thousands of small thermal or hydro-electric power stations have been built, while wind and solar energy are also being used. However, there are still 28 counties that have virtually no electricity supply. And about 120 million farmers in a dozen provinces and autonomous regions, mostly in western China, are waiting to get electricity. Officials said that these areas, often sparsely populated, are the most difficult to be electrified because they are far from the large regional electricity network, their local economic growth is slow and local finance tight. According to a blueprint on the electrification of China's rural areas in the 1990s which was presented to the meeting by the Ministry of Electricity, most of China's poor villages will be able to use electricity in the coming few years.
