Representatives from the seven coalition parties held tough negotiations throughout the day. A compromise emerged during the talks that revenues from the "national welfare tax" proposed by Hosokawa be solely spent to finance welfare-related expenditures and the rate for the new tax be discussed by parties at a consultative body, coalition sources said. However, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [SDPJ], which threatened to withdraw its six ministers from the cabinet unless its demands for amendments to the new tax are met, urged that discussions on the issue last two years, while the government insisted on one year, the sources said. The Finance Ministry stuck to its demand that the rate for the tax be specified in a tax bill, they said. Hosokawa announced early Thursday morning the creation of the 7 percent "national welfare tax" on goods and services, to be introduced in April 1997, to finance 6 trillion yen in proposed tax cuts in place of the current 3 percent consumption tax.
