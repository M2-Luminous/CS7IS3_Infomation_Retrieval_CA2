FBIS3-25220 "drafr030_e_94005" FBIS-AFR-94-030 Document Type:Daily Report 14 Feb 1994 WEST AFRICA Nigeria Foreign Minister Disputes Cameroon Border Claims AB1102165294 London BBC World Service in English 1515 GMT 11 Feb 94 AB1102165294 London BBC World Service Language: English Article Type:BFN [From the "Focus on Africa" program] [Text] A full-scale confrontation is looming between Nigeria and Cameroon over their long-disputed border region. Trouble blew up last month with claims that Nigerian villagers and fishermen on islands and a peninsula in the region were being harassed and killed by Cameroon gendarmes. Nigerian troops were sent to the area to protect Nigerian nationals, and this week the NIGERIAN NEWS AGENCY claimed that 18,000 Nigerians were fleeing the Bakasi Peninsula after raids by Cameroon gendarmes. The Cameroon external affairs minister denied the charges on this program yesterday, but a visit to Cameroon by Nigeria's foreign minister, Babagana Kingibe, apparently achieved little or nothing. On the line to Abuja, Alice Martin asked Babagana Kingibe if he thought the two countries were on the verge of war: [Begin recording] [Kingibe] No, absolutely not, because it is our determination and we do have the responsibility to ensure safety of lives and property of all Nigerians, wherever they may be, and it is indeed true that, perhaps, these provocations have reached saturation point as regards Nigerians living in the (Atabue) local government area of Cross River State, part of which is on the Bakasi Peninsula. I don't think we are going to tolerate any more harassment of our nationals from whatever quarters. We wouldn't tolerate the harassment of our fishermen and their catch being confiscated at will. But we do not have to go to war in order to guaratee the safety of life and property of Nigerians. We are just going to make jolly sure that it doesn't happen again and it will not happen again! [Martin] And how can you be sure? [Kingibe] There has been a continuing neglect and that neglect will not continue. We'll stop it and we are going to establish our effective presence over there. [Martin] So, you are actually moving in now to the peninsula where Cameroon says it territorial control? [Kingibe] Not that we are moving in. We are there. We have always been there. [Martin] Cameroon says it owns, historically owns that area. [Kingibe] Now, I don't know how anybody can really come and claim a territory that is wholly, entirely Nigerian populated. Really, even from the traditional system of establishing authority, these are Efik-speaking people and Ibibio-speaking people who owe their allegiance to the Oba [title of traditional chief] of Calabar and there all sorts of historical documents to that effect. So, you don't just wake up and make a claim that this is your territory. You must have a basis. [Martin] But the fact is that Cameroon says that the land itself belongs to Cameroon, irrespective of whether Nigerians are living there. [Kingibe] No, the land never belonged to Cameroon. Madam, I don't think that I am comfortable in negotiating with the Cameroonians via the BBC. We are brothers, we are very close brothers and friends and have been able to talk to each other directly and quietly before. [end recording]
