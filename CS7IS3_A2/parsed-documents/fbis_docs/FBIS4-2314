Gu Jinchi, secretary of the provincial party committee, delivered a speech at the plenum, in which he stressed: The more deepening of reform and the more development of the economy, the more we should resolutely oppose corruption. Gu Jinchi said: Party members and cadres at all levels, particularly leading cadres, should appraise the anticorruption work done in the former period by seeking truth from facts and upgrade their understanding on the importance and emergency of successfully conducting anticorruption work. They should also firmly foster the thinking of unremittingly and frequently grasping the work and carry forward the struggle against corruption deeply, protractedly, and effectively. Party committees and governments at all levels should correctly understand and successfully deal with the relationship among reform, development, stability, and anticorruption by proceeding from the whole situation. They should unswervingly implement the principle of taking two-handed approach and being tough with both hands. While successfully grasping the central work of economic construction, it is imperative to do a good job in grasping the anticorruption work. Gu Jinchi pointed out: A good job should be done this year in realistically implementing various tasks for the anticorruption work. Efforts should be made to concentrate on dealing with the deep-rooted problems so as to strive to score greater results in the work. It is necessary to seize the emphasis of having leading cadres perform their official duties honestly and be self-disciplined, to reinforce the dynamics in investigating and handling serious and appalling cases, and to continuously correct the malpractice. Efforts should be made to further perfect the supervisory mechanism and to take radical and stopgap measures concurrently. In his speech Gu Jinchi urged party committees and governments at all levels to realistically enhance their leadership over the anticorruption work. The principal leading comrades of party and government organs should take personal charge of the work. Efforts should be made to establish or improve the responsibility system enforced for the anticorruption work, to enhance the supervisory and inspection work, to further strengthen leadership over the work undertaken by the discipline inspection commission so as to bring its functional role into full play. Attending the plenum were provincial leading personnel, including Wang Huaiyuan, Shang Wen, Chen Suzhi, Xu Wencai, Wen Shizhen, and Zhang Lingyun; as well as veteran leaders from the provincial level organs, including Ge Xifan and Lin Sheng. During the plenum, the participating members approved the resolution on the work report given by the Liaoning Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission at the plenum.
