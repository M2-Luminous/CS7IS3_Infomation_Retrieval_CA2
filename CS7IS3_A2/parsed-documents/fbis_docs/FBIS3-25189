Ngonhamo says that could become a bad precedent for the country's pacification process. [Begin Ngonhamo recording] We are worried about the UN conduct, because the organization is only concerned with the minor issues but ignores major ones. UN partiality is creating difficulties for us. Ever since the UN mission arrived in Mozambique it has never accused the government, except once when Mr. Aldo Ajello said he would draft a document informing the UN Security Council that the government was not complying with the confinement program. That was the only time. This is a very dangerous situation. Personally, I think if one day war breaks out in Mozambique again, the UN elements, notably Mr. Aldo Ajello, will be the guilty party. He is here to assist Mozambicans holding on to peace. Instead of letting people hold onto peace, he encourages them to do otherwise. That is very dangerous for the Mozambican people. I regret this situation. I think the United Nations and Dr. Ajello, in his capacity as chief of the UN Operations in Mozambique, should review their modus operandi. [end recording]
