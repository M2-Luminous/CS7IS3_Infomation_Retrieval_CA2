Basyuni spoke last night before the annual conference of WIZO, the Women's International Zionist Organization, in Tel Aviv. Reporter Dani Gur-Arye was there: [Begin recording] [Gur-Arye] Ambassador Basyuni served as Egypt's military attache in Syria during the 1970's, and he is acquainted personally with President al-Asad. Basyuni says al-Asad is a tough negotiator, but he can be counted on to keep his word in any agreement signed. As an example, Basyuni cites the 1974 disengagement agreement between Israel and Syria: [Basyuni] Since 1974, Syria kept their word, and no one violation of this agreement. What it means? It means if you sign agreement with the Syrians, they will keep it. They keep their words. Maybe they will be very tough in the negotiations, but they will keep their words after the negotiations, after reaching agreement. And, the case with Syria is very clear: If Israel will withdraw full withdrawal from Golan Heights, it will be full peace. [Gur-Arye] Ambassador Basyuni predicts the negotiations between Syria and Israel will be renewed following the summit between President al-Asad and U.S. President Clinton next week in Geneva. He says 1994 will be a year of peace in the Middle East. [end recording]
