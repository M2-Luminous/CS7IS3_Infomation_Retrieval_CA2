A group of four political parties made up of the National Cooperative Action Movement [MKN], the Democratic Movement for the Liberation of Haiti-Democratic Revolutionary Party of Haiti [MODELH-PRDH], the Bel-Air branch of the Movement for the Organization of the Country [MOP], and the Alliance for the Rebirth of Haiti [ARH] have rejected this humiliation that France would like to add to its sadism. France has pointed out that no people still under its hegemony have ever been brought to the brink of extinction because of the overthrow of a government. [passage omitted] Certainly, Haiti has always hailed international aid provided as compensation within the framework of a world economic system biased in favor of the highly industrialized countries. In that regard, these parties recall that, far from making amends for the wrongs done to the race debased by slavery, France has held back the evolution of the Haitian people by requiring a very heavy payment for acknowledging the nation's independence. Nevertheless, the Haitian people have never needed charity from the descendants of the Leclercs and the Rochambeaus [French generals fought by Haitians during the War of Independence] -- conclude these political parties. This press release is signed by Volvick Remy Joseph of MKN, attorney Francois Latortue of MODELH-PRDH, Greger Jean-Louis of the Bel-Air MOP, and Alex Dominique of ARH.
