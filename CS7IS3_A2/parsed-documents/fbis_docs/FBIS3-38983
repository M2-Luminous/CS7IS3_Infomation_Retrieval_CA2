FBIS3-38983 "drweu028__a94021" FBIS-WEU-94-028-A Document Type:Daily Report 10 February 1994 ANNEX Germany Kohl, Ruehe Disagree on Bundeswehr Strength AU0902133694 Hamburg DPA in German 1213 GMT 9 Feb 94--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU0902133694 Hamburg DPA Language: German Article Type:BFN [Text] Bratislava -- The strength of the Bundeswehr will probably be reduced to about 300,000 men over the next few years. DPA learned this today on the sidelines of Defense Minister Volker Ruehe's visit to the Slovak Army in Bratislava. He stressed that, because of the bad financial situation, the strength of the German armed forces can "by no means" be kept at the level of 370,000 men, as agreed between Chancellor Helmut Kohl and the former Soviet State President Mikhail Gorbachev at their meeting in the Caucasus. In the future, the Bundeswehr's personnel might consist of about 200,000 in the army, approximately 80,000 in the air force, and 20,000 in the navy. At the "Munich Conference for Security Policy" last weekend [5-6 February], clear differences of opinion emerged between Kohl and Ruehe over the future strength of the German armed forces. Contrary to his former attitude, Kohl insisted on 370,000 soldiers. This was interpreted as efforts "designed not to lose any votes" in election year, despite the tight financial situation. Ruehe demonstratively refrained from mentioning figures, and he smiled meaningfully at the chancellor's statements. Recently the minister has stressed that he does not think much of the "ongoing speculations about figures." However, when he presented his ideas last week as to how he wants to handle further cuts in the defense budget involving 1.25 billion German marks, he made it clear that the Bundeswehr will not have 370,000 men by the end of this year, as originally planned, but at most about 345,000. Rudolf Scharping, chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], explained in Munich that there are "not really any serious differences" between his party and the government on foreign and security issues. At the SPD congress last autumn, the SPD spoke in favor of a Bundeswehr of 300,000 men.
