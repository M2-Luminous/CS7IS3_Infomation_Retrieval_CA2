During talks with visiting Dutch Foreign Minister P.H. Kooijmans here this morning, Qian said China and the Netherlands differ in their national conditions but they share many common points. Over the past year or more, he said, there had appeared a good momentum of growth in bilateral ties, adding: "We are happy to see that political contacts between the two countries have increased and results of cooperation in economy and trade are remarkable." On bilateral economic relations and trade, Qian noted that the volume of bilateral trade last year amounted to 2.32 billion U.S. dollars. However, he said: "We are not content with the results already achieved. There still exists a big potential in this regard." Qian said that China's economy is developing rapidly in a healthy and sustained way, and more Dutch entrepreneurs are welcome to invest in China. "It is our hope that the Dutch Government will give active support to extending loans," he added. Meanwhile, he said, it will be useful that the Netherlands will raise the competitiveness of its products. On the ties between China and the European Union, Qian said China and the European Union are playing important roles in international affairs, adding that in the fields of economy and trade, they are important partners of cooperation. He stressed the great importance of developing the relations between China and the European Union, saying that such ties are not only beneficial to both, but also to peace, stability and development in the world as a whole. Qian expressed the hope that the Netherlands will make further efforts to this end. Kooijmans said the Netherlands is also satisfied with the rapid development of bilateral relations, economic ties and trade in particular. He told Qian that his current visit to China is aimed at strengthening contacts and cooperation between the two countries. He said the Netherlands was pleased to note the improvement of the relationship between the European Union and China. Kooijmans said the Netherlands, as a member of the European Union, is ready to promote the growth of such ties. At the visitor's request, Qian briefed Kooijmans on his recent visit to South Asian countries. The two foreign ministers also exchanged views on other issues concerning bilateral ties and international issues of common concern, in a sincere and friendly atmosphere. After the talks, Qian gave a luncheon for Kooijmans and his party.
