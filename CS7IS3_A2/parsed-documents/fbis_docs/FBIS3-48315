Dealers expect stocks and market interest rates to tumble, at least initially, in the wake of Friday's crushing defeat for Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's political reform package. Fundamentally, that spells trouble for the yen, but with hopes receding for the preoccupied government to craft speedy economic stimulus measures, fundamentals may take a back seat to international politics, dealers said. That thinking drove the dollar lower in Europe after the reform vote in the House of Councillors, which followed the Tokyo close. It dipped briefly to a one-month low below 110 yen in London, but was bought back afterward on perceptions that it had been oversold and closed at 111.10-20 yen. It later finished in New York at 111.55-65 yen. In Tokyo, the U.S. currency declined 0.45 yen for the week to 111.30 yen, wavering in a range of less than 1 yen as the market awaited the reform vote. The U.S. Government has been withholding high-yen pressure to give the young Hosokawa coalition a chance to cut Japan's trade deficit by expanding domestic demand and thus boosting imports, Tokyo dealers say. With such fiscal hopes on the rocks, they believe, America may pull the monetary lever, talking the yen up to make Japanese imports cheaper in yen terms and putting the heat on Japan's exporters by forcing export prices up in other currency terms. "We have to pay more attention to the politics from now on," said Takao Sako, head of yen trading at the Union Bank of Switzerland. But the result for the currency market will be "very unpredictable," he said. With U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen holding hastily arranged meetings Sunday in Tokyo with Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii and Hosokawa, players wondered if Washington would play the "high-yen card" before February's bilateral summit. Adding to the pressure were Friday's report of a record 120 billion dollar 1993 Japanese trade surplus, stalled bilateral trade talks and President Bill Clinton calling Japan one of "our biggest problems" on trade. Washington "won't allow a weaker yen," said Junichi Kodama, a Chemical Bank vice president and head of corporate foreign exchange sales. He predicted a test of chart-based technical support in the 109 yen range next week with any rebounds curbed at 111 yen. The chance for dollar declines is building, but "we just can't predict," said dealer Yuko Fukakusa at Tokai Bank. Chief dealer Toru Itami at Yasuda Trust and Banking Co. said that after the market's first reaction to sell the dollar, it may recall the apparently steady U.S. recovery as compared with Japan, where the Bank of Japan said Friday that recession continues and "any salient economic recovery is still at a distance."
