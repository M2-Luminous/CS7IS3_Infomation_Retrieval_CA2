How do you envisage this, if you do not intend to use military power? [Zhirinovskiy] Through economy. If the Yugoslav economy had not been destroyed, there would not have been any change of the borders and no new states would have emerged. Peace and calm would have continued to reign in Serbia and all of Yugoslavia. However, the economy was destroyed and we facilitated this by participating in the embargo. The embargo paralyzed every attempt to revive the economy and now a war rages and borders are being reshaped. The same applies to Iraq and Libya. Let us look at Ukraine. It owes us a few zillions. Why should we forget this money? Kiev steals our gas, which is intended for Germany. The Germans are imposing fines on us, and thus we are being hit from both directions. This is economy? This is only friendship that still exists between certain leaders. [Popov] During your visit to Bulgaria you spoke about returning certain territories to Bulgaria. [Zhirinovskiy] Bulgaria could take its territories back. We will not give them to you -- they are not ours. However, if Dobrudzha is Bulgarian, why is it in Romania? And if Thrace is Bulgarian, why is it in Turkey? I mean the return of your own territories, not the conquest of new territories by force. [Popov] How could this happen? [Zhirinovskiy] The Bulgarians alone should resolve this issue. Naturally, through economic means. However, your economy stagnates. Your chemical plants have been closed. Your resorts are empty. The workers of Vorkuta for example, could rest very well there. You owe Russia $70 million. Why do you not allow our workers to rest in Bulgaria in exchange of your debt? Our people will rest and you will pay your debt. [Popov] There was a lot of noise about the political amnesty. The Liberal Democratic Party was one of the parties that initiated this amnesty. [Zhirinovskiy] Our program included an amnesty for all those arrested since 1986, and thus ending the perestroyka. Both sides made mistakes, and now the deputies, the government, and the people forgive. Let all those who are guilty begin by zero. The amnesty could only have a positive effect. Starting from the zero point we will seek ways of joint activity. The people have been freed and this is good. [Popov] Do the former defendants have a political future? [Zhirinovskiy] They should not have a political future. The victims who fell in vain in October, the destroyed families, and the emigrants should remind them of this. Khasbulatov went home. Makashov did the same. Dunayev said that he will devote himself to his wife, children, and motherland. This is good advice for all of them. However, everyone can participate in political life when it is based on the Constitution, i.e. to take part in the elections. Let them compete -- anyone could have a chance if he does not build barricades and does not accumulate weapons. They will begin now, while we already have an advantage. Let them try to reach and surpass us, as it happens in sports. [Popov] People are talking about a crisis in the Liberal Democratic Party. [Zhirinovskiy] This is disinformation. The entire country is in a crisis, and this affects all parties. It is like a car -- it moves, but releases gases and makes noises. The army also is in a crisis, but if necessary it will stop any eventual aggression. [Popov] The budget was discussed recently. Will its adoption help Russia? [Zhirinovskiy] The budget will not help Russia. Only a change of the political leadership will help Russia. In the summer or in the fall we will change the government and will begin a new policy in the country.
