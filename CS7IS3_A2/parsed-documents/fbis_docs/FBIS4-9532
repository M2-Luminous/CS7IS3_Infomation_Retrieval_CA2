"At the moment, 120,000 people are already on strike, and the strategic effect of the strike has been practically achieved," he said today at a news conference in the Gdansk headquarters of Solidarity's National Commission. "I expect that in the first two days there will be a lot of warning, two-hour actions, and some of the plants will begin a continuous strike. There will certainly be more than 100 plants protected by the Solidarity strike fund," he added.
