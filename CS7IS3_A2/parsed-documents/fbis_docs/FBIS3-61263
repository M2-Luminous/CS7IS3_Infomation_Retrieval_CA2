According to the minister, Denmark gives priority to relations with the Baltic States. "We will continue to support Lithuania politically, morally and economically," said the Danish official at a press conference in Vilnius on November 25. The Danes have already rendered assistance to the Lithuanian economy totalling around 20 million Danish krones. This week they brought a package of new projects to Vilnius. Lithuanian Energy Minister Algimantas Stasiukynas called the latest program a new impulse in Denmark's determination to co-operate with Lithuania. The current visit of the Danish Energy Minister is aimed at environmental protection, energy saving and efficiency programs. Lithuania is interested in studying the Danish experience in supplying and saving heating energy. On November 27, Mr. Sjursen visited the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant and the Moletai region, where a boiler-house, using local timber waste, is about to be assembled. The modern boiler-house was donated by the Danish government.
