On that morning, Gao Dezhan, secretary of the municipal party committee, Zheng Zhiying, member of the standing committee of the municipal party committee, and Pan Yiqing, vice chairman of the municipal people's congress standing committee, travelled to a timepiece plant and held a forum with the plant leaders and workers' representatives. Gao Dezhan attentively listened to the enterprise production situation and asked in detail about the income and housing of workers and the educational situation of their children. Affected by some factors, such as the market, this timepiece plant, which was once a major profit and tax delivery plant of the municipality, experienced a slide in economic returns and suffered losses for many years. The enterprise leaders led the workers to deeply carry out reform, worked hard, and enabled the plant to witness an upturn. The average per capita income of workers rose from 2,200 yuan in 1991 to 3,400 yuan in 1993. In the form of chatting domestic trivia, Gao Dezhan held cordial talks with the workers. He said: We are pleased to hear that you have increased your income. The Spring Festival will come soon. The municipal party committee and the municipal government have been concerned about the quality of life of the people throughout the municipality, particularly those enterprises and workers with temporary difficulties. Our purpose of coming here to see you today is to manage this matter of prime importance to you and to let the broad masses of workers across the municipality to have ease of mind and spend the Spring Festival happily. Your plant is an enterprise with difficulties, but it is an enterprise with hopes which will have a favorable turn for the better. From your experience, we have gained this enlightenment: Some enterprises with temporary difficulties may have a turn for the better, and may free themselves from difficulties, and revitalize as long as their higher and lower levels make concerted efforts and unceasingly deepen reform. During this year, all enterprises should regard deepening reform as the main task, do well in all aspects, and enable more enterprises to vitalize and more workers to become prosperous. Gao Dezhan said: Each and every enterprise, unit, and department, and all sectors across the municipalities should consciously submit themselves to and serve the overall situation of the whole party's work. That is to seize the opportunity, deepen reform, expand opening up, promote development, and maintain stability. We must firmly foster the ideology of relying on reform to promote development, correctly handle the relations of reform, development, and stability, promote the practice of doing solid work, speaking the truth, boosting enthusiasm for work, and achieving actual results in an effort to maintain and promote a sustained, speedy, and sound economic development, and social and political stability and unity in our municipality. Gao Dezhan said: Recently, Comrade Jiang Zemin and Li Peng stressed repeatedly: "Things that have a bearing on the people's basic life and immediate interests are major matters of prime importance." Party committees and governments at all levels across the municipality and all working departments should conscientiously implement this directive, attach prime importance to these major matters, pay close attention to solving the issue on the immediate interests of the broad masses of people with a high sense of responsibility and great energy, and allow no carelessness or dereliction of duty of any kind. At present, it is necessary to realistically attend to the work of caring for the well-being and doing practical things for the masses during the Spring Festival period and concentrate energy on managing well all things we should manage. We should give special care to the living of resigned and retired cadres, workers, families of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen, people enjoying government subsidies, urban and rural workers with difficulties, households taking relief, and childless old people and guarantee that no household will have great difficulties in living. Around the Spring Festival period, we should attend to the issue of "nonstaple foods," guarantee market supply, strengthen price management, and stabilize the market prices. Leading cadres at all levels should step up efforts to make this work a success with a sense of great responsibility and initiative. Leaders of departments, localities, units, and enterprises that fail to do this work well should be held responsible for the consequences and called to account if problems arise. Gao Dezhan also went to see Zhang Fenglin, a worker of Tianjin Canvas Plant. Zhang Fenglin has been elected municipal model worker for the third time. Serving as a lathe operator for more than 20 years, he never took sick leave until he sprained his back recently. Gao Dezhan held his hands firmly and said: Our Tianjin's working class has made tremendous contributions to the whole country and Tianjin's development. The party and government will never forget you. The working class is the main force in deepening reform and developing the economy. Model workers are also the same. We should give them greater attention and good care. Gao Dezhan hoped that Zhang Fenglin would feel at ease while taking rest and nourishment to regain his health and wished him a happy Spring Festival. Gao Dezan urged the plant leaders to arrange work for Zhang Fenglin after his recovery and take more care of his quality of life. At 0900 in the morning, Mayor Zhang Lichang and Zhang Guangwen, secretary general of the municipal government, traveled to the municipal woolen sliver plant. As soon as they got out of the car, they went directly to the workshop to visit workers at the forefront of production. Zhang Lichang cordially shook hands and held talks with the workers. He asked in detail about their living conditions, particularly about the issuance of their Spring Festival subsidies. On hearing an affirmative rely, Zhang Lichang was very pleased and smiled. Zhang Lichang also held a forum with the plant workers and directly listened to their opinions about the municipal government. Zhang Lichang said: Our party's fundamental purpose is to serve the people wholeheartedly and the final aim is to improve the living standards of the masses. Leading cadres at all levels should always care for the hardships of the masses and unceasingly enhance awareness in serving the people. In doing our work, we should begin with caring for the living of the masses and end at raising the masses' living standards. All our leading cadres came from the masses. There is no reason for them to forget or cut themselves off from the masses. They should always keep the well-being of the massed in mind, speak for them, and support them. Leading cadres at all levels, particularly enterprise leading cadres, should emancipate the mind, change ideas, expand the degree of reform, do a good job in enterprise grafting, readjustment, and transformation, raise economic efficiency, and improve their living standards. Enterprises running at half capacity or brought to a standstill should use their brain, try by all possible means to find work for their workers, guarantee their basic income, let them feel ease of mind and have enthusiasm for work, and make contributions to promoting Tianjin's development. On hearing that although the woolen sliver plant suffered deficits, its workers still have an unyielding spirit, Zhang Lichang praised them repeatedly and said: The Tianjin people have the spirit of acknowledging their disparities but never admitting that they have been defeated. The people of Tianjin are not stupid and the level of cadres across the board are not low. As long as we mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses, Tianjin will have great hope in development. Zhang Lichang also travelled to home of Xing Songshi, a retired model worker of Dongfeng Building Materials Plant, to give him a salute. He sincerely asked Xing Songshi about his living conditions, income, health, and application for medical expenses after his retirement. He said: Tianjin has a great number of model workers who worked quietly and made contributions at their ordinary posts. Although they have retired, the party and the people will not forget them. Cadres at all levels should show concern for and give them great care. On hearing that Xing Songshi is not in good health, Zhang Lichang said to him with great concern: You should see a doctor quickly and take care of yourself. Executive Vice Mayor Li Shenglin saluted workers at the state-run Tianjin printing and dyeing plant. He said: Developing production, solving the difficulties of workers, improving their living conditions, and raising the living standards are our urgent tasks. We should take advantage of this opportunity to send warmth to all households, further mobilize all workers to follow the path of reform, and urge them to improve themselves with their own efforts. Li Shenglin also visited Ma Fengqian, a worker of quartz watch plant with difficulties.
