Having 1,000 enterprises appraise the work of the government departments at the provincial level, was organized by the provincial industrial and economic federation and the provincial entrepreneurs' association, and was launched according to the decision of the provincial party committee and the provincial government. This is a major move adopted by the provincial party committee and the provincial government to implement the guidelines of the 14th party congress and the third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, to further promote transformation of the functions of government departments, to expedite the implementation of the "enterprise law" and the "regulation on changing the operational mechanism of state-owned enterprises," and to help establish the socialist market economic structure. It is the first time that the province has launched such a provincewide activity of "appraising higher levels by lower levels." When viewed in terms of practical results, this activity is not only completely necessary but also successful. Whether our government departments will successfully transform their functions and style of work depends chiefly on the opinions of enterprises and the reflections of the grass-roots levels. "A house may have a leak in its ceiling, but it is discovered below." The method of organizing enterprises to appraise the work of government departments constitutes a direct and effective supervision of government departments as well as a positive attempt to promote the transform of the superstructure with the voice from the economic base. We should successfully summarize the experiences gained from this activity, carry them forward, and establish systems to ensure that our government departments will be able to listen to, in a timely manner, all the opinions of the grass-roots units and the voice of enterprises and then will, in line with the demand on government functions under the condition of the market economy, continuously improve their work and better meet the requirements of new circumstances and new tasks. Here, I mainly dwell on three views and opinions: 1. Our government departments at the provincial level have made progress in implementing the "enterprise law" and the "regulations," but there are still many problems. The current appraisal of the work of the provincial-level government departments by 1,000 enterprises is, in fact, an inspection over the situation in which the provincial-level government departments have transformed their functions and work style. When viewed from the results of the appraisal, what should be affirmed first is that these departments have scored great achievements in implementing the "enterprise law" and the "regulations" and in transforming their functions and style of work. In order to truly enable enterprises to transform mechanisms, to enter the market, and to become the mainstay of the market economy as demanded by the "enterprise law" and the "regulations," many government departments have positively assigned to enterprises the affairs that should be managed by enterprises and have delegated to enterprises the powers that should be enjoyed by enterprises. For the affairs that should be managed by the government, but were managed in a poor and ineffective manner in the past, government departments are now adopting measures to gradually strengthen management. To expedite the enterprise reform, and, in particular, to help invigorate large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, some government departments have voluntarily gone deep into enterprises to specifically guide and help enterprises deepen their internal reform, seek projects and funds, and solve problems. Some departments that were originally engaged in planned economic work have rapidly transformed themselves into the departments that provide enterprises with the service of information, consultation, technology, development, and marketing, thus creating conditions for enterprises to rapidly transform mechanisms and dovetail themselves with the market. All these cases have proven that the overwhelming majority of our government departments at the provincial level have conformed to the historical trend of reform and have actively keep abreast of the demands of the new situation. In the current appraisal, many enterprises have expressed satisfaction with and highly appraised the work of such comprehensive economic departments as the provincial planning commission, the provincial foreign economic relations and trade commission, and the provincial economic restructuring commission. This is really gratifying. However, the enterprises participating in the current appraisal activity have also generated much criticism and complaints, and some problems revealed by them are very serious. In light of these complaints and problems, what I want to stress on is why enterprises still have so many complaints and why so many problems remain with our provincial-level government departments after the promulgation of the "enterprise law" five years ago and after the issuance of the "regulations" a year or so ago. This merits our conscientious research and ponderation. Of course, it takes time to change government functions, and it also takes time to tackle various sorts of contradictions and problems. We do not expect the government to tackle all sorts of contradictions and problems all at once. The problem at present, however, is that many problems that could be tackled completely have not yet been tackled and many affairs that could be completely handled have not yet been handled. This has affected the reform and development of enterprises so that enterprises can not help but complain about the government. Then, what is the reason for this situation? From an objective analysis, when delegating decision-making powers to some enterprises, we need a process of coordination, and such kind of coordination should be gradually realized through in-depth reform. From a subjective analysis, there are three reasons: First, some comrades have failed to conscientiously study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the decision of establishing a socialist market economic structure, the "enterprise law," and the "regulations." Some comrades have lacked an understanding of new structures and have not been fully prepared ideologically and professionally to orient the work of government departments to the new demands of reform. Second, some comrades have failed to conscientiously implement the idea that "reform is a new revolution," are still accustomed to the past work style of "grabbing power and centralizing power" that was available under the planned economic structure, are still accustomed to considering enterprises the subsidiary body of government departments, and are reluctant to give up the powers in their hands and their vested interests. Third, some government departments have paid attention to professional work but not to the ranks of working personnel, and, as a result, the management is in chaos and many problems have emerged in the ranks of working personnel. Some working personnel are still riding roughshod, extorting money from the people, and using their power to seek personal gain. Facing these problems, all government departments should pay high attention to the criticisms and complaints raised in the current appraisal activity. Although some criticisms and complaints are not completely correct, generally speaking, they are objective, fair, and pertinent. Although some problems have emerged at the grass-roots level, their roots are in the higher levels. Although local governments should assume some responsibilities for problems, the provincial responsible departments also should not shirk their responsibilities onto others. Therefore, all departments should, without exception, pay attention to and do research for the complaints raised in the appraisal and examine and ponder over them one by one. On no account should they remain indifferent towards these complaints. Second, we should adopt measures to firmly grasp rectification and correction. All departments and units should make clear the situations and the reasons for the related problems raised in the appraisal. On this basis, we should formulate feasible measures for solving problems in the right order of importance and urgency in order to straighten them out and correct them. As for the problems that are enterprises complain strongly about,and that should be and can be solved, responsibilities should be assigned to departments concerned to solve them as quickly as possible and yield results in the near future. For the problems that are not raised in the appraisal but actually exist in practical work, voluntary inspection should also be conducted to correct them. Third, we should use rectification and correction to expedite transformation. The current appraisal activity will greatly promote the transformation of functions of all government departments. All departments and units should regard the appraisal as a very good opportunity to transform their functions, should draw inferences about other cases from the problems revealed in the appraisal, should summarize experiences and draw a lesson from these problems, and should strive to take a big step forward in the work of transforming functions. 2. The establishment of a socialist market economic structure urgently requires the transformation of government functions, and that it should be firmly grasped from beginning to end. The "decision on some issues of the establishment of a socialist market economic structure," adopted by the third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, has sketched the basic framework of the socialist market economic structure. The five major pillars of this framework--the modern enterprise system, the nationwide integrated market structure, the perfect macro-economic control system, the rational individual income distribution system, and the multi-layered social security system--are all closely related to the transformation of government functions. If the government refuses to transform its functions, a modern enterprise system cannot be established, a nationwide integrated market structure and a perfect macro-economic control system cannot be formed, a rational income distribution system and social security system cannot be set up in a very good manner, and then we are in no position to establish the socialist market economic structure. Therefore, transforming government functions is not only an important content of the establishment of a socialist market economic structure but also a supporting reform that must be carried out to ensure the success in the package reform. All departments of the government should attach high importance to the transformation of functions and truly handle this issue well in carrying out organizational reform. A major issue of the transformation of government functions is to make clear what should be managed and what should not be managed under the new situation of the socialist market economy and to correctly handle the relationship between the two. The practice in the past several years proves that if government departments fail to delegate to enterprises the powers that originally belong to the government in carrying out the planned economy and that should be delegated to enterprises now, the reform cannot be carried on; and if government functions fail to manage the affairs that they should manage in many fields of the development of the market economy, a confused situation will emerge and losses will be incurred. Therefore, our government departments must make clear what affairs that were managed in the past should, or should no longer be managed under the new structure, and provide ways to successfully manage these affairs. Departments should conduct conscientious investigation and study as well as discussion and analysis by proceeding from helping to invigorate enterprises and facilitating the sound and orderly development of the market economy, and then define the targets of the transformation of functions, the work orientation, and the work priorities for respective departments. This year, the province will carry out organizational reform step by step and spread the reform of the public service system in line with the unified arrangements of the central authorities. This reform will be carried out from higher levels to lower levels, beginning with the provincial-level organizations. All administrative organizations at the provincial level, particularly comprehensive economic organizations, specialized economic organizations, and the organizations supervising the enforcement of economic laws, should make good preparations for successfully fixing the scale, functions, and staff of their organizations in accordance with the "decision" adopted by the third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and with the demands for carrying out the organizational reform of administrative organizations and for implementing the reform of the public service system. 3. We should continue to firmly and thoroughly stop wanton collections of fees, fines, and apportionments, as the major content of the anticorruption campaign. When viewed from the current appraisal, the province as a whole has made progress and yielded results in stopping the "three wanton collections," but these results cannot be overestimated. A host of facts show that the "three wanton collections" still seriously remain in many places, and they have not only seriously disturbed the normal operational sequence of enterprises and hampered reform, opening up, and economic development, but also seriously damaged the image of the party and the government. Therefore, the elimination of "three wanton collections" must be conducted through to the end by regarding it as an important content of the transformation of government functions and the anticorruption campaign. To make the work in this aspect a success, I want to stress on the following points: First, all departments directly under the provincial authorities must assume responsibility for stopping the "three wanton collections" within their own departments. All departments should not only manage their professional work but also manage their ranks of working personnel. And, they should not only eliminate the "three wanton collections" directly occurred in their own departments but also eliminate the "three wanton collections" occurred in other departments and trades in the province as well as at the grass-roots areas. All departments should pay attention to education, training, rectification, and correction to constantly improve the quality of their ranks of working personnel and enhance their expertise of enforcing laws and disciplines. From now on, if the masses at the grass-roots level complain strongly about a department or a trade for its serious wanton collections, the responsible government departments of the provincial level will be held accountable. Second, the inspection of and punishment to the "three wanton collections" should be strengthened in a sustained manner. All departments at all levels should inspect and ferret out the "three wanton collections" in a timely manner. Once a case is discovered, it should be inspected and dealt with immediately. Those which should be returned should be returned, those deserving punishment should be punished, and those deserving disciplinary actions should be given them. The serious cases should be laid bare and dealt with publicly. The responsible persons of enterprises who dare to resist the "three wanton collections" should be encouraged and supported continuously. Third, all measures and stipulations aiming at checking the "three wanton collections" should be assigned to the grass-roots areas. The fees and apportionments that are abolished by the provincial-level government departments and the measures and methods related to this work have already been made public in newspapers. But, it is only the first step. They must be made known to all grass-roots areas and to all related personnel. All departments and units should take advantage of the opportunity provided by the current appraisal to inspect, in the near future, whether the "three wanton collections" are eliminated among grass- roots areas. Once a problem is discovered, it should be tackled immediately in order to strictly prevent and correct the cases of "sticking to one's old way of doing things," "rectifying in the beginning but being confused at the end," and "remaining confused despite repeated rectifications." Fourth, we should continue to carry out the system of "making work procedures and results public so that they are subject to supervision by the masses." All the stipulated reasonable fees and fines should be made public and be subject to supervision by the masses. All departments at all levels should pay attention to the petitions of the masses that reflect the "three wanton collections," and conscientiously examine and deal with them. On the whole, the tasks on eliminating the "three wanton collections" remain very arduous, and the endeavor of eliminating the "three wanton collections" should still be regarded as the emphasis of the anticorruption campaign this year in order to thoroughly tackle problems related to wanton collections. All departments at all levels, particularly law and discipline enforcing departments such as public security, communications, postal and communications, power, industrial and commercial, tax, and public health departments, must strive to make contributions to eliminating the "three wanton collections" in the province and to optimizing the economic environment. The current appraisal of the work of provincial-level government departments by 1,000 enterprises has been conducted in a successful way. It has been proven that in the new historical period and the new situation, such social groups as the industrial and economic federations and associations of various trades have much to do and accomplish in conducting activities around the central task of economic construction. Such social groups that lie between the government and enterprises, serve as a new type of bridge to link the government with enterprises, and thus play the role as the mass groups of enterprises. Therefore, party committees and governments at all levels should attach full importance and give warm support to such newly born groups and pay attention to studying and exploiting their positive role in expediting reform and development. Industrial and economic federations and the associations of various trades should enhance their senses of historical responsibility and mission, make great efforts to make innovations and explorations, continue to summarize experiences, and strive to invigorate the work in all fields.
