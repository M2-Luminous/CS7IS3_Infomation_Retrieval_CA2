FBIS3-46548 "dreas001_d_94014" FBIS-EAS-94-001 Document Type:Daily Report 3 Jan 1994 South Korea Foreign Minister Interviewed on DPRK Issue SK3112085493 Seoul MUNHWA ILBO in Korean 31 Dec 93 p 3 SK3112085493 Seoul MUNHWA ILBO Language: Korean Article Type:BFN [Article by Kim Chae-mok based on interview with Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu by Yi Yong-sik, deputy manager of the political department of MUNWHA ILBO; place and date not given -- first three paragraphs are introductory remarks by reporter Kim] [Text] Regarding the degree of progress made toward the solution of the North Korean nuclear issue, Minister Han said, "While some areas have seen positive results thanks to the time and effort placed on it, a solution has yet to appear." The positive results are that there has been no extreme crisis, that dialogue is continuing, and that clues towards a solution still remain. Regarding the decision on policy over the North Korean nuclear issue, Minister Han said, "The cooperative system between the ROK and the United States is firm." He added, "The U.S. position notified to the North in the 22 December North Korea-U.S. working contact in New York was in fact formulated by us." He said, "At the present stage, the ROK and the United States are pushing ahead with a small package deal so that North Korea will allow ad hoc and ordinary inspections [imsi mit tongsang sachal] by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and participate in inter-Korean dialogue." [Yi Yong-sik] What are the prospects for the third round of high-level talks between North Korea and the United States? [Han Sung-chu] If North Korea allows the IAEA to conduct complete ad hoc and ordinary inspections and the exchange of special envoys between the North and the South to discuss the nuclear issue, the third round of North Korea-U.S. high-level talks will be held. The talks, if held, will be held not in a week or two, but at the earliest, towards the end of January or in early February. [Yi] In the event that the third round of North Korea-U.S. talks are held, what will be the main and auxiliary agenda? [Han] The third round of talks will, first and foremost, focus on completely dissolving suspicion on the North Korean nuclear program. Our position is that once the precondition of resolving the North Korean nuclear issue is met, we can discuss the issues raised by the North side of guaranteeing security and other political and economic issues. [Yi] In connection with the resolving of the North Korean nuclear issue, how can we set a political and technical deadline? [Han] The definition of a deadline can vary depending upon one's perception of the varying degrees to the resolution of the nuclear issue. Since it may be several weeks before the present stalemate connected with the crisis of the IAEA's safeguards continuity is resolved, the deadline may be several weeks from now. Since it may be several months before the suspicion that emerged from the disparity between the North Korean declaration of its nuclear-related facilities and the IAEA's investigation results is dissipated, the deadline may be several months from now. [Yi] North Korea is reported to have called for a package solution which includes the IAEA's inspection of the North Korean nuclear sites and the improvement of North Korea-U.S. relations. What specific demands is North Korea making in connection with the improvement of relations? [Han] In a statement made on 11 November last year, Vice Foreign Minister Kang Sok-chu referred to a package solution in which the two sides would move simultaneously after determining the points of discussion. At the current stage, no concrete details on the method for the package deal have been presented. However, we can easily guess that North Korea is concerned and interested in the issue of guaranteeing security such as the declaration on not waging a preemptive nuclear attack on North Korea and the suspension of the Team Spirit exercise, and political and economic issues such as lifting the designation of North Korea as a terrorist country, dissolving the trade embargo on North Korea, and assisting in the construction of light water reactors. [Yi] There are many figures in the United States who feel the need for the early establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and North Korea.... [Han] It is a well known fact that such figures exist in the United States. Another fact is that voices of the hard line faction are rising with each passing day in the United States. This is an indication that the more North Korea plays for time, the less favorable it will be for North Korea. [Yi] Do you think that diplomatic relations between North Korea and the United States can be attained in the coming year? [Han] The possibility exists. However, it is not very probable. This is because other than the resolution of the nuclear issue, there are many preconditions for the establishment of diplomatic relations between North Korea and the United States. Besides the resolution of the nuclear issue, the United States has deep interest in various conditions such as practical progress in South-North dialogue, the control of exports of large-scale homicidal weapons like missiles, the abandonment of terrorism, the return of remains of U.S. soldiers, and the improvement of human rights conditions. It is clear that the resolution of the nuclear issue will greatly contribute to improving conditions for the establishment of diplomatic relations between North Korea and the United States. [Yi] What is our government's position on the establishment of diplomatic relations between North Korea and the United States? [Han] Drawing a hasty conclusion on whether or when the United States and North Korea will establish diplomatic relations is difficult. However, we have already established diplomatic relations with the old Soviet and normalized diplomatic relations with mainland China. Therefore, opposing the establishment of diplomatic relations between North Korea and the United States even after the resolution of North Korea's nuclear issue is shortsighted. Opposing the establishment of diplomatic relations between North Korea and the United States will not help South-North relations and ultimately, will not be of help on the road to reunification. We are fully prepared to actively assist North Korea in becoming a responsible member of international society, once North Korea's nuclear issue is resolved satisfactorily. [Yi] Is our government making any special preparations regarding the possibility of the establishment of relations between North Korea and the United States? [Han] Preparations are being made from various angles and for various possibilities. However, it is inappropriate to reveal details regarding this right now. [Yi] What are the positions of Japan and China on the establishment of diplomatic relations between North Korea and the United States? [Han] The Japanese Government views the resolution of North Korea's nuclear issue as being important to the resumption and settlement of currently suspended negotiations between Japan and North Korea on diplomatic relations. Therefore, Japan is focusing its attention on how dialogue between North Korea and the United States is progressing. China does not want North Korea to be isolated in international society. Therefore, China welcomes and is assisting North Korea in improving relations with Western countries. [Yi] If North Korea establishes diplomatic relations with the United States, what impact will it have on inter-Korean relations? [Han] The improvement of relations between North Korea and the United States will come about after the resolution of the precondition on the nuclear issue. Therefore, the promotion of North Korea-U.S. relations will naturally lead to improvement in inter-Korean relations. It will activate inter-Korean exchange of people and materials, which had been suspended with the exception of indirect trade. By the time North Korea and the United States establish diplomatic relations, inter-Korean relations may have progressed enough to establish trade missions in Seoul and Pyongyang. In short, progress in inter-Korean relations and the improvement of North Korea-U.S. relations complement one another. [Yi] The establishment of diplomatic relations between North Korea and the United States is likely to have substantial impact on overall order in Northeast Asia, isn't it? [Han] Even if North Korea improves and normalizes its relations with the United States, it will try to restrict opening itself up to the outside world, because it fears that the aftermath of the establishment of diplomatic relations with the United States may endanger the maintenance of its system. Therefore, hardly any substantial change in order in Northeast Asia can be expected in the short run. In the long run, however, it will bring forth very significant change in two aspects. First, the establishment of North Korea-U.S. diplomatic relations will lead to the normalization of North Korea-Japan relations, which will ultimately help North Korea cast aside isolation to participate proudly in the international community. Second, it will contribute to fundamental changes in North Korean society and its overall system of values. [Yi] What direction will diplomatic policy take in the new year? [Han] The five basics of a new diplomacy were established following the inauguration of the civilian government. The five basics are to move into the world, diversify, pluralize, cooperate regionally, and to be futuristic. I believe that the part on "moving into the world," was especially notable in the past year. In a wider sense, prohibiting the spread of large-scale homicidal weapons including North Korea's nuclear issue, our participation in the UN Peacekeeping Operation, and our participation in the free trade system through the settlement of the Uruguay Round makes it possible for us to broaden our world view to move toward internationalization. The new year's policy of a new diplomacy will focus on "pluralism" and "regional cooperation." With the inauguration of the World Trade Organization and the Green Round next year, the issues of environment and development will be prominant and a competition policy will be brought to the fore. Therefore, while maintaining a secure basis, our diplomacy must extend its domain into the fields of economy, communication, environment, and development. In addition, multi-faceted cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region is increasing rapidly. The Asia-Pacific Economy Cooperation summit will be held in Indonesia in November of next year, and sometime in July, the first Asian Regional Forum of the whole Asia and Pacific region including Russia, China, and Vietnam will be held in Bangkok, Thailand.
