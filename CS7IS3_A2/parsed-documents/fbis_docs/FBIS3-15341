For several months the newspapers PAVALSTNIEKS and ATMODA have been printing the names of Russian servicemen, members of their families, and well-known personalities in Latvia. Their addresses, telephone numbers, and information of a personal nature are being published. Included in the lists were Vladimir Steshenko, deputy editor of the Russian-language newspaper SM-SEGODNYA; Fedor Shinkarenko, hero of the Soviet Union who liberated Latvia from fascism; Retired General Ivan Kibal, also a hero of the Soviet Union, and many others. These lists are being published under the caption "Our Land Is Groaning Under Their Boots." The Russian Embassy note stresses that the lists are dominated by Russian citizens whose personal data is being given wide publicity without their knowledge or consent. The information is being published under provocative headlines. The safety of these people is being jeopardized. The embassy considers that such actions by certain Latvian periodicals could lead to unwelcome incidents with unforeseeable consequences. In this event, the note says, the Latvian authorities will have to bear the entire blame. The Russian Federation Embassy expressed the hope that the authorities would take the necessary measures to prevent such a development of events, which could harm Russian-Latvian relations.
