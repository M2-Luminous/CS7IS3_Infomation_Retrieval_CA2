At the annual meeting of the German Society for Military Technology in Bonn, Kinkel said on Wednesday [13 April] that in spite of all weaknesses, the United Nations is the only global instrument of collective security. It has the possibility to legitimize the use of force under international law. The difficulties met by the United Nations, for instance in Somalia, must not discourage the community. The increasing responsibility that Germany faces requires an appropriate German say as permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, Kinkel pointed out. It is important that the resources of the Atlantic Alliance can also be used in overcoming international crises, if other possibilities fail. The Alliance is now adapting the structure of its forces to these new tasks. Klaus Naumann, the Bundeswehr Inspector General, made a statement along the same line. NATO has confirmed its willingness to help with United Nations or CSCE peacekeeping operations. Parts of the military forces and installations of NATO, and this includes the Bundeswehr, must be made available for quick operations to prevent, curb, and to end conflicts. The crisis reaction forces set up by the Bundeswehr must be available quickly and be in a position "to be used also if the outcome is uncertain." Naumann described the overall development of the Bundeswehr in a favorable light. It is not right that the armed forces are not trained properly these days, he said. "There are dark sides, no doubt, but there is also a lot of light," the general said. The soldiers' devotion and willingness to work hard "have increased impressively, and there is a willingness to take risks and to do without amenities -- something that is quite rare in our country," Naumann said.
