Most party members who spoke at the meeting criticized Laar and stated their support for Nugis. The speakers voiced apprehension that, if Pro Patria continues under Laar's leadership, the party may not attain the 5-percent threshold vote at the next parliamentary elections. Nugis, too, was critical about the premier's performance and advised him to resign. Pro Patria convenes in Tallinn June 11 to discuss election of new party chairman and the situation in the government and the ruling coalition. The party council ruled on Monday [23 May] that election of new chairman doesn't automatically imply replacement of premier. Laar, on the other hand, asserted on Friday that he regards Pro Patria congress decisions as binding for himself. "If Pro Patria elects a new chairman I'll resign," he said.
