Testing and Evaluation by Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratories and Use of Equivalent Testing and Evaluation Requirements; Proposed Rule Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 229␣/␣Wednesday, November 30, 1994␣/␣Proposed Rules DEPARTMENT OF LABOR Mine Safety and Health Administration 30 CFR Parts 6, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 26, 27, 29, 33, and 35 RIN 1219&hyph;AA87 Testing and Evaluation by Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratories and Use of Equivalent Testing and Evaluation Requirements AGENCY: Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), Labor. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: This proposed rule would establish new procedures and requirements for testing and evaluation of products MSHA approves for use in underground mines. It would require manufacturers of certain products who seek MSHA approval to use an independent laboratory recognized by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) as a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory (NRTL) to perform the necessary testing and evaluation for approval. The NRTL would conduct the product testing and evaluation currently done by the Agency according to the appropriate MSHA testing and evaluation requirements. The proposed rule would revise MSHA's testing and evaluation responsibilities and allow the Agency to expand its post-approval product audit program and pursue the evaluation of new and safer technology as applied to underground mining products. The proposal would also enable the Agency, upon an applicant's request, to approve products based upon testing and evaluation requirements other than MSHA's, provided that the alternative requirements are equivalent to MSHA's requirements and provide at least the same measure of protection for the miner. The proposed rule would increase the availability of a wider variety of mining products having enhanced safety components by reducing costs and broadening the market for mining equipment. Conforming amendments to some parts of MSHA's approval regulations are also being proposed as part of this rulemaking. DATES: Written comments must be submitted by February 13, 1995. ADDRESSES: Commenters are encouraged to send comments on a computer disk along with the hard copy. Send written comments and computer disks to the Mine Safety and Health Administration, Office of Standards, Regulations, and Variances, Room 631, 4015 Wilson Boulevard, Arlington, Virginia 22203. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Patricia W. Silvey, Director, Office of Standards, Regulations, and Variances, MSHA (703) 235&hyph;1910. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Paperwork Reduction Act This proposal contains information collection requirements in paragraphs (a), (e), and (f) of §6.10. These paperwork requirements have been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. Currently, when manufacturers seek to have MSHA test and evaluate a product they must supply MSHA with the necessary documentation. Under the proposed rule, manufacturers would still need to produce this documentation. Thus, the manufacturers' burden hours related to developing documentation needed to perform tests and evaluations would not change. Under proposed §6.10(a), in order for MSHA to issue an approval to a manufacturer, MSHA would need to review a copy of the NRTL's test and evaluation results along with the NRTL's statement of product compliance with MSHA requirements. MSHA anticipates that most manufacturers would request two copies of the test and evaluation results and statement of product compliance from the NRTL and forward one set to MSHA along with the application for approval of its product. Currently, MSHA spends about 14,750 staff hours testing and evaluating products. The actual duration of the testing and evaluation varies significantly from product to product. MSHA expects that the NRTLs would spend about the same amount of time. Absent an MSHA regulation requiring approval of products for underground mines, MSHA estimates that at least 10 percent of manufacturers would still have their products tested and evaluated by an independent laboratory to make them more acceptable to the mining industry. Thus, MSHA estimates that about 13,275 paperwork burden hours per year would be associated with generating the NRTL test and evaluation records that would be required under the proposed rule. Under proposed §6.10(e), an NRTL would make available for MSHA review internal audits of the NRTL conducted as a part of its internal audit program to assure that the required procedures, controls, and practices are in place. NRTLs recognized by OSHA currently are required to do internal audits and verify that they were done and, as a result, already maintain the necessary records to verify that such audits are performed. Thus, there are no paperwork burden hours associated with §6.10(e).
