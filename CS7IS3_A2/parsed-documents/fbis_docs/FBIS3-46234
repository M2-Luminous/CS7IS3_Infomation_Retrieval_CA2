According to statistics, industrial enterprises at the township level and above throughout the province produced an aggregate industrial output value of more than 7 billion yuan, an increase of 13.4 percent over the previous year. Budgetary industrial enterprises throughout the province produced an aggregate industrial output value of 3.35 billion yuan, an increase of 15.8 percent over the previous year; they earned sales income of 4.6 billion yuan, an increase of 55 percent; and materialized 285 million yuan of profits and taxes, an increase of 24.47 percent. Last year relevant departments and enterprises increased the momentum of reform and promoted development by means of reform. The relevant departments identified more than 500 documents which contradicted the Regulations on the Transformation of State-Owned Enterprises' Operational Mechanisms, and reduced their intervention in enterprises. The province's mandatory plans on industrial products were reduced by 53 percent. According to new demands and changes, the province selected 16 enterprises to contract for investment and output, and 25 enterprises for the trial- implementation of a shareholding system or shareholding cooperative system. More than 60 percent of small, state-cooperative commercial enterprises exercised civilian management under state ownership. Three kinds of reforms in enterprises also switched from a single nature to a comprehensive one, 40 percent of enterprises introduced an all-personnel contract system, 47 enterprises were merged or absorbed, and 4 enterprises were closed because they had suffered serious losses for long periods. These enterprise reforms helped improve economic returns and arrested the decline in their production. By the end of last year, the province registered sustained and healthy development in heavy industrial production; large-scale increases in the electric power, machine building, metallurgical, nonferrous metals, and building materials industries; and a turn for the better in light industry, which has fluctuated in the last few years. Production in the major areas was comparatively balanced.
