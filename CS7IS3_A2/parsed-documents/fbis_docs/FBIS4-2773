Since 1978 these farmer-run township mines have dug 4 billion tons of coal, and Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua praises them for playing an important role in easing the nation's energy shortage. Continuous expansion has turned township mines into a mini- industry employing more than 2 million farmers. Their annual output has risen from 950,000 tons in 1978 to 472 million tons last year, equal to that of key State-governed mines. With their help, China's annual production of coal has increased to 1.18 billion tons, compared with 618 million tons in 1978. But their lack of comprehensive planning and environmental safeguards has created serious pollution and wasted resources. As the mining sector has grown, so have the problems. Latest statistics show that at least 3,700 people were killed in accidents in township mines last year, compared with 1,171 in 1978. Since 1984, 40,000 people have died in mine accidents. In their pursuit of profits, the township mines have shown little concern for the environment and have not made good use of resources. At some places, experts say, for each ton of coal that is mined, 5 more tons of coal that is more difficult to recover are left behind. To ensure that township mines develop in a healthy way, the Ministry of Coal Industry has proposed regulations and laws to administer them more closely. Drafts of the legislation have been submitted to the central government for approval, Business Weekly was told last week. Among other things, the drafts propose that a licensing system be adopted and suggest how to bring order to the mines. They also recommend procedures for reducing fatal accidents. Late last month, the Ministry of Coal Industry organized a four- day conference on the measures that drew officials from the Ministry of Agriculture and leading government officials from 13 provinces and autonomous regions. Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua, who participated, spoke highly of the meeting and said the State Council supports efforts to boost healthy development of township mining. Only one similar conference has ever been organized and that was in 1987, when township coal mining was just gaining momentum. Coal Industry Minister Wang Senhao said the ministry will beef up investment to renovate equipment in township mines. Wang also urged small mines to unite and co-operate within the rules of a market economy. The minister promised help from State scientific research institutes, training centres and technical service enterprises. Wang said the ministry will make comprehensive plans for the industry's long-term development. For instance, a hundred counties with heavy concentrations of township mines will have priority in receiving financial help in the next seven years. In the meantime, the ministry hopes that by 1996 a market- oriented legal system will be adopted to bring order to the industry.
