Billy Graham, on latter's recent visit to North Korea, by An Hui-chang; date and place not given] [Excerpts] Stephen Linton, 44, a professor of Colombia University who recently visited North Korea as an aide and interpreter for Rev. Billy Graham, arrived in the ROK on 6 February. [passage omitted] The following are questions and answers from the interview with Professor Linton: [An Hui-chang] Having seen him up close, how would you say is Kim Il-song's health? [Steve Linton] I cannot say whether he is unhealthy internally, but he appears to be healthy. His hands did not quiver, and he walked fine. His voice was husky like that of a chronic smoker, but his pronunciation was clear. His hearing ability, however, was so poor that even though he was wearing a hearing aid, sometimes someone nearby was asked to repeat in a loud voice what had just been said. [An] People are very interested in the messages exchanged between President Clinton and Kim Il-song. [Linton] We received President Clinton's message from the U.S. Embassy in Beijing before entering North Korea. I cannot provide details of what was in the messages, but I can say that they will help improve the current tense relations between the United States and North Korea. [An] What was discussed at the luncheon between Rev. Graham and Kim Il-song? [Linton] Morality and religion were the main topics. President Kim recalled that he had gone to church with his mother during his childhood and that a pastor had helped him. [An] Many observers note a change in Kim Chong-il's status. What was the atmosphere like in North Korea? [Linton] When I visited North Korea in 1992, President Kim Il-song said: "Kim Chong-il is in charge of administration." During my recent visit, however, I did not hear him mention this. Although President Kim did not mention any details, I came away with the impression that President Kim himself was leading overall state affairs. According to custom, we prepared gifts for both President Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il, while North Korea only presented us with a gift in Kim Il-song's name. [An] Why do you think North Korea invited Reverend Graham to visit? [Linton] Reverend Graham published a book introducing various aspects of North Korea after his first visit in 1992. I believe that after reading the book, the North Korean people appreciated Rev. Graham's attempts not to distort [woegok] the North Korean system. [passage omitted]
