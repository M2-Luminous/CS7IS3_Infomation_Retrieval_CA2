Lebanon determinedly and courageously shoulders the responsibility of resisting and standing fast against the unrestrained Israeli aggression against its land and people. And Lebanon was preparing for national and regional developments, relying in this on its national harmony and full coordination with its Arab brothers, when a scheme feeding off the Israeli source emerged in the homeland to target the country's unity, freedom, and immunity. Some of those offended by the restoration of social peace did not hesitate to get involved in that scheme to realize the enemy's objectives as well as the suspicious ends that started to appear in the form of calls for self-enforced security and for reviewing the state's unity. What happened at the Sayyidat al-Najat Church in Zuq Mikha'il and before that along the al-Balamant road and the central headquarters of the Lebanese Phalangist Party, in addition to the explosive charges that were placed in cultural and educational centers, the assaults on men of religion and religious places, the desecration of graves, the printing and publishing of leaflets that instigate sectarian strife, and the spreading of rumors that incite, all constitute irrefutable evidence that the most sacred foundations of Lebanon's existence are being targeted. Against all this, the Council of Ministers would like to affirm the following: 1. Lebanon will not take a bystander's position on these developments. Since the criminal intentions were uncovered and the terrorist operations emerged, Lebanon has been determined to abort attempts that target its stability and seek to harm its peace and reconstruction march; 2. The Council of Ministers highly appreciates the efforts and sacrifices made by the security forces, including the Army and the internal, public, and state security forces. These efforts have led to uncovering the dimensions of the conspiracy, exposing its planners, and arresting its perpetrators. The Council reaffirms its earlier decisions to entrust the Lebanese Army with the task of deploying over all the Lebanese territories to protect the homeland's unity, the sovereignty of the law, and the society's safety; 3. The Council of Ministers has adopted a set of measures to protect the country, maintain its domestic security, and deter the conspirators regardless of their affiliations. It will not tolerate the view of self-enforced security or the establishment of individual security cantons anywhere in Lebanon; 4. The Council of Ministers calls on the mass media to deal with things responsibly and to continue to contribute to the peace march within the framework of the laws that will be referred to the esteemed Chamber of Deputies to organize audiovisual media and protect public freedoms; 5. The Council of Ministers turns to the international community and the sponsors of the peace conference to draw their attention to the seriousness of the terrorist actions Israel is undertaking against the unity of our homeland and the safety of our people in an attempt to strike at Lebanon's peace and regional peace chances at the same time. The Cabinet confirms that Lebanon, which regained the unity of its institutions and impregnability, and, which valiantly resisted the Israeli aggression, will allow no one to strike at its achievements. The state, which is committed to the constitutional principles and institutions and to the democratic parliamentary system, will continue to relentlessly safeguard and defend everyone's security, freedoms, and rights. Accordingly, the Cabinet has issued a group of resolutions led by Decree No. 4908. President of the Republic, in accordance with the Constitution and the Associations Law issued on 3 August 1909 and its amendments, particularly Article III, and in accordance with (?Notification) No. 178AD dated 10 September 1991 granted on establishing the association called the Lebanese Forces Party in Beirut, and in accordance with the Interior Minister's proposal and following the approval of the Council of Ministers on 23 March 1994, the following is decreed: Article I: Notification No. 178AD dated 10 September 1991 issued for the establishment of the association called the Lebanese Forces Party in Beirut is withdrawn. The association is hereby dissolved. Article II: This decree shall be published, conveyed when necessary, and will go into force when issued. The Cabinet has also adopted a group of measures. Article II of the Amnesty Law issued on 26 August 1991 defined the crimes covered by the Amnesty Law. These include some crimes committed against the state's internal security, political crimes, or so-called general or local political crimes. They also include some crimes stipulated in the Military Penal Law, crimes of possessing and carrying any kind of weapon, and crimes of abduction and confiscation of freedom. The legislator aimed at that time to lay to rest a tragic past that almost wrecked the country and its system. But the legislator cautioned that the criminals who benefited from the amnesty should not return to their habits and should not commit crimes such as those that were included in the amnesty. So the last paragraph of Article II of the law has stipulated the following: Crimes of an excessive and repeated nature or crimes perpetrated after this law is issued [words indistinct]. Article 317 of the Penal Law stipulates that every action, piece of writing, or speech that aims to incite religious or racist discords or to instigate disputes among the various sects and among the nation's members should be punished. Since the country, after 28 March 1991 [as heard], and especially very recently, has been the scene of more crimes against the state's internal security--crimes formerly covered by the general amnesty--or crimes of a similar nature including car bombings, bombings of worshippers, the placing of explosive devices in densely populated areas, including schools, and acts seeking to undermine the state's public order and security, weaken national unity, harm the country's basic interests, and provoke sedition; Since some audio and visual media continue to go to extreme lengths to broadcast news and commentaries likely to provoke sectarian fanaticisms; Since the Weapons and Ammunition Law issued on 12 June 1959 specified a maximum three-year prison sentence for the unlicensed possession and transport of military weapons; And since this penalty is not considered a sufficient deterrent in the current circumstances and conditions, The Cabinet has decided the following: First, the justice minister is requested to draw the attention of the concerned judicial authorities to the aforementioned legal penalties, particularly the last paragraph of Article II of the Amnesty Law issued on 26 March 1991 [as heard] and the second paragraph of Article IV of the same law, and to instruct these authorities when necessary to resume the prosecution of crimes that are no longer covered by the amnesty and those crimes that were perpetrated after 26 March 1991 [as heard]--the crimes that caused the forfeiture of the said amnesty. Second, as of midnight on 23 March, all visual and audio media, except Tele-Liban and Lebanese radio [Beirut Radio Lebanon], are banned from broadcasting news and programs that are directly or indirectly political until the Audiovisual Media Law is passed and goes into force. Tuesday 29 March 1994 has been set as a date for an extraordinary Cabinet session to make a final decision on the Audiovisual Media Bill. Any media station that does not abide by this decision will be prevented from further broadcasting and immediately closed. The Internal Security Forces, assisted by the Army, are instructed to implement this decision against violators. Third, the justice minister, the minister of national defense, and other concerned ministers are requested to submit the necessary bills to enact stiffer penalties on the aforementioned crimes to the point where they become a real deterrent. This will be done to deter those who wish to exploit the country's atmosphere of liberty. The information minister conveyed to the Cabinet a recommendation by the Chamber of Deputies' Finance Committee during its discussion of a bill increasing the capital of the Tele-Liban Company. The recommendation urges the state to own all the shares of this company. The prime minister, who is the proprietor of the private sector's share in this company, showed responsiveness to this recommendation. The Cabinet consequently decided that the state should buy the private sector's share in this company and instructed the information and finance ministers to carry out the necessary legal measures for this purpose.
