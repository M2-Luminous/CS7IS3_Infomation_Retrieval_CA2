"It is regretful that France decided to discontinue arms sales to Taiwan under Beijing's pressure," the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a press statement. Paris and Beijing issued a joint communique Wednesday in which France promised that the 60 Mirage fighter planes it agreed to sell to Taiwan in late 1992 will be its last arms deal with the ROC. In return, Beijing would end its year-long ban on giving lucrative contracts to French companies. A Foreign Ministry spokesman blasted Beijing for repeatedly interfering in Taiwan's defensive arms purchases. "It is unthinkable that Beijing, while expanding its own military muscle and arms exports, has constantly demanded other countries not sell defensive weapons to Taiwan," he noted. The spokesman stressed that the ROC's arms purchases are mainly for defending national security and maintaining peace in the Taiwan Strait. "The joint communique between France and Mainland China will not contribute to the peace in the Asia-Pacific region," he observed. The French Government announced the sale of 60 Mirage fighters to Taiwan shortly after former U.S. President George Bush agreed to sell 150 F-16s to the island in November 1992. In 1991, Taiwan signed a contract with France to purchase 16 Lafayette-class frigates as part of its plan to beef up its naval force. Reports from Paris quoted French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe as saying Wednesday that France will honor its previous arms deals with Taiwan.
