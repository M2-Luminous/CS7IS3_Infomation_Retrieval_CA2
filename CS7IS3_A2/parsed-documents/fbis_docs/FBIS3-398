Speaking at a National Party [NP] meeting in Chatsworth, south of Durban, the NP leader said the party's decision, before the midnight Friday deadline, indicated the "strong possibility" of Inkatha's participation in the elections. However, Mr de Klerk said: "I would have preferred registration full stop with no strings attached". The NP leader was addressing thousands of supporters on the last leg of his two-day election roadshow through Natal.
