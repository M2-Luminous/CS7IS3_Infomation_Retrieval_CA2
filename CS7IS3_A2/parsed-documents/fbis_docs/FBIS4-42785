The Democratic Party of Kurdistan [DPK], which is headed by Mas'ud Barzani, and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK], which is headed by Jalal Talabani, are involved in a serious struggle for power. Ankara has been very worried by the clashes, which began over an insignificant piece of territory and which quickly turned into a war between the two sides. Turkey is worried that the Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] may benefit from the internal clashes in northern Iraq and strengthen its position in the region. Receiving reliable information on the clashes, particularly on whether or not one of the two sides has established superiority, has been difficult. The intelligence reports Ankara has received are not clear. It is difficult to determine which side tells the truth and which side distorts the facts. DPK leader Mas'ud Barzani has held PUK leader Jalal Talabani entirely responsible for the clashes. He has accused Talabani's forces of starting the clashes in order to expand the territory they control. Furthermore, Barzani has claimed that Talabani has cooperated with the PKK and allowed that organization's armed units to join his forces. We conferred with Jalal Talabani in Damascus yesterday morning. His views were different. He said that a personal problem does not exist between him and Mas'ud Barzani and that he frequently confers with him by telephone. Talabani argued that the Islamic Movement of Kurdistan [IMK], which is headed by Ethem Barzani and supported by Iran, is the main problem. Talabani also argued that several DPK units have joined the clashes with the arms they have received from Iran. He asserted: "Iran has interfered. It has armed the IMK groups and sent them to our region through al-Sulaymaniyah. Several DPK groups also have been involved. Mas'ud Barzani has failed to intervene. It may be that he is unable to do so. The matter is an Iranian design." According to Talabani, the situation in al-Sulaymaniyah has been placed under control. Nevertheless, clashes have continued from time to time. In other words, the tension has not been completely defused. Turkey's Mediation Is Essential.... Talabani rejected DPK's allegations that he secretly cooperates with the PKK. He said that he does not need that organization. Talabani asserted: "Most of PKK's militants are in Turkey. The rest were in the camp in Zalakh. Turkish aircraft have intensively bombed it. Only the wounded and sick militants are in that camp now. We have never been involved in secret bargaining talks with the PKK." However, Foreign Ministry officials in Ankara and the intelligence units are skeptical. They have said that Talabani maintains an unreliable policy and supports the PKK from time to time. A Turkish official has asserted: "Compared with the peshmerga forces of the DPK and PUK in northern Iraq, PKK's armed groups are more ambitious and reckless. Consequently, the PKK gains from divisions and clashes." The same official also asserted that the clashes must end in order to prevent the PKK from benefiting from the present situation. Turkey has made an effort during the past week to have Barzani and Talabani hold talks on the situation. The officials of the Internal Affairs Ministry, the intelligence organization, and the Foreign Ministry met several times to consider what Turkey can do. Talabani informed us during our telephone conversation that Turkey must intervene to mediate between the two sides. He said: "Turkey must make its weight felt because Iran's intervention will upset the balances in the region. I am prepared to meet Barzani in any part of Turkey. I am prepared to hold talks with him to end the dispute. I have explained my approach to the Turkish officials. I am waiting for them to respond." The officials maintained their contacts in Ankara the night before last and yesterday. Messages were conveyed to the two leaders. However, a final result was not yet achieved by the time this column was written. The meeting will take place in Turkey. Talabani does not wish to meet Barzani in northern Iraq. He said: "I shall either go to Turkey or remain where I am at the present time." On his part, Mas'ud Barzani prefers to meet Talabani in northern Iraq. He wants only the Turkish officials to attend the summit he will have with Talabani. Furthermore, he wishes to avoid creating uneasiness in Baghdad. That is why he prefers not to involve the Iraqi opposition groups in the matter. Foreign Ministry: Talabani's Supporters Are To Blame for the Incidents Considering the intelligence reports, the Foreign Ministry is convinced that the incidents in northern Iraq were caused by Talabani's supporters. Officials have said: "Nevertheless, we shall approach the two sides and try to convince them to end the fighting." Foreign Ministry officials are convinced that Saddam Husayn stands to gain from the clashes between the two most important groups in northern Iraq and they believe that they have exaggerated the dispute between them. A high-ranking official has explained Ankara's position as follows: 1. We cannot ignore an attempt by Saddam Husayn to suppress the Kurds in northern Iraq yet again. 2. Peace must be established in the region. A cease-fire must be imposed in order to normalize the situation. 3. The problems must be resolved in accordance with the principle of maintaining Iraq's territorial integrity. We cannot condone any activity that may be aimed at the establishment of a Kurdish state in the region. The Foreign Ministry officials' approach on the possibility of establishing a Kurdish state is very clear. They have persistently reiterated that a satisfactory guarantee has been given to Turkey and that the possibility is no longer considered. Ankara is gradually encouraging Talabani and Barzani to reach an agreement with the Baghdad administration. Officials have suggested that the two leaders should hold talks with the Iraqi Administration on all the formulas, including the concept of autonomy for the Kurds. However, a significant distance has not yet been covered in that direction.... Northern Iraq is the number one problem in Turkey's foreign policy. Obviously, any confusion in that region will make Ankara feel uneasy.
