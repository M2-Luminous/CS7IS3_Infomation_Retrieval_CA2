The regulations say that before issuing new shares the adjusted net book price of the enterprise assets should be converted into the original shareholders' interest. If the net book price is not all converted into shares, the remaining net assets price should be regarded as a part of capital surplus rather than being converted into liabilities. In the meantime, the ratio at which enterprise assets are converted into shares and the multiple of assets-turned shares [zhe gu bi lu he zhe gu bei shu 2124 5140 3024 3764 0735 2124 5140 0223 2422], together with the planned program for issuing new shares and the issue price, should be subject to examination. That is to say, the multiple rate of premium at which new shares are issued [xin gu fa xing yi jia bei lu 2450 5140 4099 5887 3300 0116 0223 3764] should not be smaller than the multiple of assets-turned shares; otherwise, the net book price of the enterprise assets of original shareholders will not be fully expressed. The regulations also stressed that the premium at which new shares are issued should be raised as high as possible to fully reflect the value of the original shareholders' interest.
