There is the effect of the burst of the bubble, but the high yen has made a big, direct attack on the major loan clients of long-term credit banks. The will for capital investments in the auto, electronics, and machinery [industries] has withered. There also is intense competition with life insurers and government affiliates on long-term fixed rate loans. For the time being, demand for funds has been limited to non-expansionary short-term funds such as inventory funds or high interest transfer portions. Miscalculation of Second Half Recovery The long-term prime rate, which is the standard for the loan interest rates of long-term credit banks, dropped to the lowest level in the past (4.8 percent) in September. It reflected the recent weak economic trend and further dropped to 4.5 percent in October. However, regardless of this historically low interest, it is the consensus view of the three long-term credit banks that "unfortunately, it has not been linked to increases in loans." Viewed by business sector, long-term credit bank loan growth has continued to be minus since last year and the sluggishness has continued to be less than that for other business sectors such as city banks, regional banks, and trust banks. Generally, in a low interest rate situation like the present, long-term fixed rate borrowing naturally has been desired by corporations, but that is not so. "While stock adjustments are continuing, the interest response has been low." (Takashi Watanabe, chief of Business Development Section, Business Planning No. 2 Department, Nippon Credit Bank) It seems that the loan growth for the three long-term credit banks was much less than initially anticipated for the first half of this year. When all is said and done, the greatest factor has been that the actual state of the economy has been by far worse than forecasted. Amidst this, the fact that "the rapid high yen has withered the corporate investment mind" has had an effect. (Hitoshi Nakamura, councillor, Business Planning Department, Long Term Credit Bank of Japan) The recent high yen has directly attacked the leading industries of Japan such as autos, electronics, and machinery. These can be called the most important clients of long-term credit banks. Although the high yen has not directly made bank earnings a minus, it is not a stranger to long-term credit banks which have business financing as their principle aim. However, the degree of worry is greater for the second half to come rather than the first half which has passed. In the annual plan, the first half had been positioned as a so-to-speak "time for patience" when the demand for funds would not increase. Therefore, the minus level for the growth in loans could be tolerated. However, signs of a recovery in the real economy were seen for the second half and a scenario of "a time to grasp business chances" was painted. However, anxiety has deepened where "there even is apprehension that the bottom will fall out of economy and the future is completely cloudy." Furthermore, although it can be called loan sluggishness in short, the quality has greatly changed. Let's take a bird's eye view of the content of loans from last fiscal year to this fiscal year. In the first half of fiscal 1992, the burst of the bubble was actualized, and the demand for funds related to Tokyo metropolitan area real estate, which had played a major role in new borrowing, stopped. Like city banks, long-term credit banks had the goal of improving the contents of assets and exercised self discipline on real estate related lending. Upon entering the second half, one after the other withdrew from so-called financial engineering such as reducing the finance division centering on trading companies. This appeared in the form that the demand for funds by non-banks stopped in long-term credit banks. Then in the first half of fiscal 1993, with the advance of the high yen and sluggish economy, plant and equipment investment funds for export industries such as auto, electronics, and machinery also just about stopped. The net increase amount in loans for the Long-term Credit Bank of Japan for the second half of fiscal 1992 dropped to one-third of the first half of fiscal 1992, and further fell to half of that in the first half of fiscal 1993. If it continues this way, there is a fear that the net increase in loans for the second half of fiscal 1993 will end up zero. "If the level of 1 dollar equals 105 to 112 yen remains fixed, the demand for funds probably will continue bottoming until the first half of next fiscal year," say the three banks in unison. Shift to Short-Term Borrowing The increase in loans for all three banks has become a minus of about 1 percent over the previous year, but that does not mean that there have been no new loans up to now. Viewing the breakdown of first half loans by long-term credit banks, "the greatest minus factors are the cancellation of hedging loans by trading companies and the withdrawal of funds from non-banks. As opposed to this, it was equity bond redemption funds centering on large firms and plant and equipment funds for some medium and medium to small firms centering on the manufacturing industry that increased as the demand for new borrowing." (Tsutomu Abe, deputy chief, Business Department, Industrial Bank of Japan) However, it seems that the expectations are weak that this portion which increased as new demand in the first half will be firm in the second half and thereafter. That is to say, redemption of equity bonds will peak this year and will decrease as a whole next year and thereafter. It seems that there also are many "who have shifted to procurement by straight bonds." (Watanabe) Moreover, borrowing by medium and medium to small firms, which had been comparatively firm up until now, inevitably will have a minus increase in the second half," like large firms. (Nakamura) At the present time, the balance itself in the case of long-term credit banks has not greatly dropped immediately because there is a demand for conversion of the contract repayment portion. However, there are no prospects for enough new loans to cover the withdrawal portion other than contract repayment created in the process of changing the composition of asset portfolios and it appears that "it inevitably will be a difficult situation for one to two years." (same) The current demand for funds seems to have become limited to non-expansionary short-term funds, which do not make [the banks] very happy, such as inventory funds and transfers for high interest portions. The fact that long-term loans are not increasing is greatly related to the view on interest rates and corporate profits. At the present time, the city bank short-term prime rate has become 3.25 percent and the margin with the long-term prime rate is over 1 percent. In the borrowing of funds which they inherently wanted to be long-term and fixed, there seems to be a tendency in firms which have fund procurement capability to alleviate the recent interest rate burden by immediately rolling over with short-term borrowing. Securing Rather Than Increasing What should they do if loans do not increase? Naturally, the future environment will not be an extension of the past. First of all, above all, "it is necessary to deepen the relationship further with business companies." (Abe) In other words, it will be necessary to cooperate and demonstrate their special character as long-term credit banks by indicating a new vision on changes of the industrial structure which is in upheaval. Amidst this, the loan goals for the second half will not be established that high. "It is presumed that growth will be about the same as the growth of the nominal GNP." (Industrial Bank of Japan) So, it tells the painful feeling that "it is not a time to take chances. Conversely, we must have a constitution to produce earnings even with this much of an increase." Long-term credit banks are procuring funds by bonds, especially 5-year interest bearing bank debentures. For this reason, the ALM must be viewed in a longer range than city banks. At the present time, the high coupon wide of the fall of 1990 still remains and while loans do not increase, this will become a big factor in holding down earnings. It seems that they will be forced to take difficult risk control in the next one to two years.
