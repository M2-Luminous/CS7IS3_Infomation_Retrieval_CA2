Shavdiya; UDC 621.396.621.33] [Abstract] Application of a standard demodulator with a two- beam filter (TBF) at the input, synthesized by a delay line, is examined in this article. Devices with a negative frequency feedback (NFFB) are normally employed as noise immune demodulators of frequency modulated (FM) signals. The examined device is just as effective as the NFFB, but its construction is much simpler. With a particular selection of delay, the noise band of this filter can reduce the noise band at the demodulator input by a factor of two. The phase characteristic of the filter between the AFC zeros is linear. With application of linear pre-distortions, changes introduced by the TBF into differential gain and phase keep them within a norm. A block diagram of the device, is provided and its functioning is discussed. Computations of differential phase and differential gain produced by using the TBF were performed with the assumption that a linear pre-distortion filter of TV signals was used at the transmitter side. Noise immunity of FM TV signals with a TBF at the input was computed and numerical modeling was carried out. Efficiency of employing non-linear pre-distortions is also examined. Theoretical and experimental studies demonstrate that application of the TBF with reception of FM TV signals and employment of non- linear pre-distortions is effective.
