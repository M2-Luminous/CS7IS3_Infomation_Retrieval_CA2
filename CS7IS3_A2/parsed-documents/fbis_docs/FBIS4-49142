FBIS4-49142 "drchi085_w_94019" FBIS-CHI-94-085 Daily Report 27 Apr 1994 HONG KONG & MACAO AFFAIRS Hong Kong Use of Force With Vietnamese Detainees Decried Use of Force With Vietnamese Detainees Decried HK2704075994 Hong Kong EASTERN EXPRESS in English 27 Apr 94 p 3 HK2704075994 Hong Kong EASTERN EXPRESS English BFN [By Susie Weldon and Rachel Clarke in Hanoi] [Text] The Vietnamese consulate-general in Hong Kong says it has received an assurance that Hong Kong will not use force again in transferring Vietnamese detainees. The assurance came after Vietnam issued a formal rebuke over the violent transfer of 1,500 boat people from Whitehead detention centre to High Island on April 7. In Hanoi, the United Nations refugee chief, Sadako Ogata, said forced repatriation of Vietnamese boat people from Hong Kong had been suspended after the raid. The Vietnamese vice-consul, Nguyen Thanh Thuy, said his country had expressed its concern in a diplomatic message delivered on Saturday over the level of force used. "We told them we don't think the use of force to transfer these refugees is necessary," he said. "We think it is better next time to inform the Vietnamese side." Thuy said the Hong Kong government had not formally replied to the rebuke but had "sent a message". "The Hong Kong government told us this would not happen again," and "they would not use force" Thuy said. The Hong Kong government's refugees co-ordinator, Brian Bresnihan, last night refused to comment on any assurance given to Hanoi over the use of force. Nor would he comment on the suspension of forced repatriations. Speaking earlier in the day, Bresnihan said the Government had explained the reasons for the Whitehead raid. "We have had an expression of concern from the Vietnamese government about the use of force in this operation," he said. He said Hong Kong officials were "carefully considering" this message. More than 200 Vietnamese were injured during the raid by 1,200 police and prison guards. The Whitehead raid prompted the Governor to order an independent inquiry after Eastern Express revealed the number of injured was far higher than the single casualty originally claimed by officials. Pam Baker, the chairwoman of Refugee Concern, said Vietnam's rebuke showed how far matters had deteriorated in the camps. "Treatment of the Vietnamese boat people is now so bad that even the country from which they are fleeing is complaining about it," she said. A Security Branch spokeswoman yesterday confirmed it had briefed Vietnamese consular officials on the "events surrounding the Whitehead incident", and the recent appointment of two justices-of the peace to investigate it after receiving the rebuke. The spokeswoman declined to comment on the assurance that force would not be used in future operations, saying: "We can't go into the details of an exchange between the consulate-general and the Security Branch." Security Branch officials would not comment last night on whether they had changed their policy on handling transfers of boat people in the light of the Whitehead violence. In Hanoi, Ogata glossed over criticism of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees' inaction on the day of the Whitehead raid. She refused to speculate on what measures would become necessary once the dwindling supply of volunteers for repatriation dried up. "It will be a very difficult choice for all of us who have given very, very special attention to Vietnamese refugees," she said.
