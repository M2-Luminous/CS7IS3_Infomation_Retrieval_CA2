FR941116-2-00059 FR941116-2-00046 Colorado River Indian Irrigation Project AGENCY: Bureau of Indian Affairs, Department of the Interior. ACTION: Notice of Proposed Rate Increase. SUMMARY: The BIA is proposing to increase the Colorado River Indian Irrigation Project's operation and maintenance assessment rate per assessable acre for the first 5 acre feet of water to $30.00 in 1995, $31.50 in 1996, $33.00 in 1997, $34.50 in 1998, and $36.00 in 1999 and thereafter until further notice. The $3.00 increase to the current rate of $27.00 per acre in 1995 and the $1.50 increase per acre per year for the next four years 1996 through 1999 will offset cost increases for personnel, supplies, materials and services. The charge per acre foot of water in excess of this annual apportionment will be $11.00 per acre foot in 1995, $12.50 per acre foot in 1996, $14.00 per acre foot in 1997, $15.50 per acre foot in 1998, and $17.00 per acre foot in 1999 and thereafter, until further notice. The $3.00 increase to the current rate of $8.00 per acre foot in 1995 and the $1.50 increase per acre foot per year for the next four years 1996 through 1999 will offset cost increases for personnel, supplies, materials and services. The energy costs for pumped water will not be paid by the Project but will be billed directly to those receiving pumped water by the electric utility. DATES: Comments must be submitted on or before December 16, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments on rate changes should be sent to: Assistant Secretary_Indian Affairs, Attention: Branch of Irrigation and Power, MS # 4559&hyph;MIB, Code 210, Bureau of Indian Affairs, 1849 ``C'' Street, NW, Washington, DC, 20240. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Area Director, Phoenix Area Office, Bureau of Indian Affairs, One North First Street, Phoenix, Arizona 85001, telephone number (602) 379&hyph;6600. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The authority to issue this document is vested in the Secretary of the Interior by 5 U.S.C. 301 and the Act of August 14, 1914 (38 Stat. 583, 25 U.S.C. 385) and has been delegated to the Assistant Secretary - Indian Affairs pursuant to Part 209 Departmental Manual Chapter 8.1 A and Memorandum, dated January 25, 1994, from the Chief of Staff, Department of the Interior, to Assistant Secretaries and Heads of Bureaus and Offices. The assessment is based on an estimate of the cost of normal operation and maintenance of the irrigation Project. Normal operation and maintenance is defined as the cost of all activities involved in delivering irrigation water, including the actual costs for labor, materials, equipment, services, energy, equipment replacement and reserves to cover emergency expenses. The Colorado River Indian Tribes (CRIT) and water users were notified of the proposed changes in the operation and maintenance assessment and excess water rates by letter to CRIT dated March 25, 1994, at the March 16, 1994, CRIT Irrigation Committee Meeting, and at the Pink Boll Worm and White Fly Eradication Committee Meeting for Parker Valley growers on March 22, 1994. The current operation and maintenance assessment rate of $27.00 became effective January 1, 1994. Since January 1, 1984, when the operation and maintenance assessment rate was raised to $22.00, there had been no other increases in the assessment rate or the excess water rate. The 1994 increase was not sufficient to offset the accumulated annual cost increases for labor, materials, equipment, energy, and services. Costs have depleted reserves and continue to exceed revenue from current assessments. The basic operation and maintenance assessment for a given year is calculated by using the estimated cost of Project operation for that calendar year divided by the assessable acreage. Basic Assessment The basic assessment rate against the land to which water can be delivered under the Colorado River Indian Irrigation Project, Arizona, for operation and maintenance of the Project is hereby fixed at $30.00 per acre for 1995, $31.50 per acre for 1996, $33.00 per acre for 1997, $34.50 per acre for 1998, and $36.00 per acre for 1999 and thereafter until further notice. The assessment is due whether water is used or not. Payment of this assessment will entitle the water user to up to 5 acre-feet of water per year per assessable acre of land. Excess Water Charge If and when available, water in excess of the basic allotment may be delivered upon written request to the Superintendent by landowners or users at the following rates per acre foot or fraction thereof: $11.00 per acre foot in 1995, $12.50 per acre foot in 1996, $14.00 per acre foot in 1997, $15.50 per acre foot in 1998, and $17.00 per acre foot in 1999 and thereafter until further notice. The excess water charge is payable at the time of written request for such water and must be paid prior to delivery. Pumped Water Energy Charges The energy costs for pumped water will not be paid by the Project but will be billed directly to those receiving pumped water by the electric utility. Effective Period The assessments and water charges above shall become effective for each Calendar Year 1995 through 1999 and thereafter until further notice. Distribution and Apportionment All Project water is considered a common water supply in which all assessable lands of the Project are entitled to share equally. Such water will be distributed to the lands of the Project as equitably as physical conditions permit. Dated: November 7, 1994. Ada E. Deer, Assistant Secretary_Indian Affairs.
