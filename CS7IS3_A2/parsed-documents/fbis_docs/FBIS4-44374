Publishing a report on the commission's findings in Dublin yesterday, Mr Pat Doherty, Sinn Fein vice-president, said: "We will have to take on board the views of people who spoke to us. It has certainly informed our attitude and we would not have involved ourselves in dialogue with so many people if we were to ignore it. It would have an influence on our thinking... as to how we should proceed in the weeks and months ahead." He said Sinn Fein would make a detailed response to the Downing Street declaration before the end of next month probably before the proposed Anglo-Irish summit -- pencilled in for the latter part of the month. A document had already been drafted by the party's national executive, he said, which must be discussed with party members first. "But this will not unduly delay our response," he said. The report published yesterday is a summary of the 280 submissions made to the commission from across Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic during the five hearings. It does not make any specific recommendations, but it does highlight two points which are likely to be central to Sinn Fein's response to the Downing Street declaration, namely the so-called unionist veto and the issue of demilitarisation. The report notes: "A huge range of submissions felt...that the declaration had fudged the issue of self-determination" and says that "the need to remove the veto" should be subject to "further debate and discussion." Mr Doherty insisted that majority consent in Northern Ireland to constitutional change, as embodied in the Downing Street declaration, was distinct from the unionist veto. He added: "The Irish nation is bigger than the unionist population...consent means (unionist) involvement and maybe even more than that, but there cannot be a veto." He said Sinn Fein was also looking for a means to achieve "a total demilitarisation of the conflict" rather than focusing on just one aspect of it, namely the IRA. Sinn Fein thus appears to be moving towards proposing an extended IRA ceasefire, as opposed to the total cessation of violence as demanded by the two governments. This would be in the hope firstly of shifting the political pressure on to the loyalist paramilitaries.
