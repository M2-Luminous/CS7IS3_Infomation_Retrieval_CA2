Individuals who use a telecommunications device for the deaf (TDD) may call the Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) at 1&hyph;800&hyph;877&hyph;8339 between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m., Eastern time, Monday through Friday. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Student Loan Reform Act of 1993, enacted on August 10, 1993, established the Direct Loan Program under the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA). See Subtitle A of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;66). Under the Direct Loan Program, loan capital is provided directly to student and parent borrowers by the Federal Government rather than through private lenders. Background The statute directs the Secretary to exercise his discretion in the selection of schools so that the loans made under the Direct Loan Program will represent 40 percent of the new student loan volume for academic year 1995&hyph;1996, the second year of this program. See section 453(a)(2) of the HEA. The standards for participation in the second year of the Direct Loan Program are issued in this notice in final form. They do not encompass standards, criteria, procedures, and other regulations to implement the Direct Loan Program in the 1995&hyph;1996 and subsequent academic years. Those program regulations will be developed through negotiated rulemaking to the extent practicable. The Secretary expects to publish final program regulations by December 1, 1994. The Secretary anticipates publishing standards for repayment of Direct Loans and standards for Federal Direct Consolidation Loans for the 1994&hyph;1995 academic year by May 1994. In addition, the Secretary anticipates publishing standards and procedures for loan origination for the 1995&hyph;1996 academic year by April 1994. Both sets of standards, which will be published in final form, will be determined with as much input from the higher education community as practicable. A school may participate in both the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program and the Direct Loan Program or only in the Direct Loan Program. A school that is selected to participate in the Direct Loan Program but wishes to withdraw after publication of the rules for loan origination or the other program regulations for the 1995&hyph;1996 academic year will be allowed a reasonable period to do so. I. Eligibility Requirements A. Eligibility for Federal Family Education Loan Program To participate in the Direct Loan Program in the 1995&hyph;1996 academic year, a school must be eligible to participate in the FFEL Program. Among other requirements, a school must have a cohort default rate of less than 25 percent for one of the three most recent fiscal years for which data are available, unless the school is exempt from this requirement under section 435(a)(3)(C) of the HEA. That section provides that until July 1, 1994, (a) Historically Black Colleges and Universities as defined in section 322(2) of the HEA, (b) tribally controlled community colleges within the meaning of section 2(a)(4) of the Tribally Controlled Community College Assistance Act of 1978, and (c) Navajo Community Colleges under the Navajo Community College Act are exempt from the cohort default rate requirement. B. Default Rate Requirement for the Direct Loan Program The Secretary believes that it is not in the best interest of the Direct Loan Program to allow a school to participate in the 1995&hyph;1996 academic year if there is a high probability that the school will lose its statutory eligibility to participate in the Federal student loan programs. Therefore, the Secretary will continue to select schools for the Direct Loan Program that also meet the stricter default rate requirements adopted for that program for the 1994&hyph;1995 academic year. Consequently, in order for a school to participate in the 1995&hyph;1996 academic year, the school must also have a cohort default rate of less than 25 percent in one of the two most recent fiscal years for which data are available at the time of the first selection decision following its application. If a statutory exemption from the three-year default rate requirement in section 435(a) is extended beyond July 1, 1994, the Secretary reserves the right to waive the two-year cohort default rate requirement for any school exempted from the three-year requirement. The Secretary may select a school that is currently exempt from the statutory requirement on a provisional basis pending a decision by the Congress on extending the exemption.
