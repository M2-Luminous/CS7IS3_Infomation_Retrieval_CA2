The creation of this commission is discussed in Article 21 of the draft anti-drug bill on which debate continued yesterday in a full session of the legislature. In the past two years, Nicaragua has been the victim of a strong assault by the drug cartels that want to overrun our territory, taking advantage of the current economic situation to institutionalize the laundering of drug money. Article 23, which was approved yesterday, says, ``The commission's goal is to study the different techniques and methods used to carry out all banking, financial, or related operations that facilitate the legitimization of capital derived from illegal activities.'' According to this bill, banks--private as well as state-owned--must report to the commission any deposit whose total amount surpasses $10,000 in operations conducted by any single client. If a person or institution is being investigated for suspicion of money-laundering, the bill mandates that the individual is not entitled to any banking or fiscal secrecy whatsoever. Banks are obligated to reveal to the respective authorities all bank accounts of individuals being investigated in cases concerning drug-trafficking or the laundering of money or valuable objects. The aforementioned commission will comprise a banking law specialist, an auditor, an expert in marketing, and a member of the National Police Commission on Economic Crimes. The anti-drug bill moved closer to passage yesterday in the wake of a great deal of pressure being exerted by the police and the U.S. Embassy itself, as was disclosed by Congresswoman Doris Tijerino.
