Our colleague Khameneh reports from Pakistan: [Khameneh] As a result of an attack by armed men on a gathering of Shiite Friday worshippers in Pakistan's Punjab Province, at least 20 worshippers were martyred or injured. In the course of the attack, four armed men, who were riding on two motorcycles, threw a grenade at a crowd of worshippers in a mosque in the Mozafargar region and opened fire using Kalashnikovs. As a result, five of the worshippers were killed and at least 15 severely injured. Pakistan's Ja'fari movement issued a statement tonight, condemning this crime and declaring three days of public mourning to honor the memory of those martyred. Allameh Seyyed Sajed Ali Naqavi, the leader of Pakistan's Shiites, also issued a statement severely condemning the savage attack and describing it as an act of terrorism perpetrated by sectarian elements. In the statement, the leader of Pakistan's Ja'fari movement described the Wahhabi association known as the Sahabah Corps as the main element behind fanning sectarian disputes in that country and warned that lack of due care and the lack of a rapid response by the government to the elements behind such crimes may evoke a strong reaction from Pakistan's Shiite community.
