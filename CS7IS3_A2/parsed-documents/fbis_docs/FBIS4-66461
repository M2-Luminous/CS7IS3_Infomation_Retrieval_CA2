After evaluating with a cost-of-ownership (COO) model, which formulated facility investments and cost-effectiveness of their operations into equations, the above conclusion was reached to dispel the prejudice of LSI manufacturers that ``EB direct writers are too expensive to be used in mass production of LSI circuits.'' According to this evaluation, DRAMs and ASICs [application specific ICs] can be manufactured cheaper by hybrid usage of EB direct writers and steppers than using steppers only. The evaluation led to the following conclusions. Hybrid usage of steppers and EB direct writers, which are based on the cell-projection technology, will be more cost effective for the production of memories smaller than 0.25 micron. Also, the cost of masks for steppers will unexpectedly increase for the production of many varieties but small quantities of ASICs smaller than 0.5 micron, and hence EB direct writers will become more cost effective. [Introduction] We have shown that memory chips smaller than 0.25 micron and ASICs smaller than 0.5 micron can be manufactured cheaper by hybrid usage of EB direct writers and steppers than using steppers only. Also, we have confirmed that, to reduce the manufacturing cost of LSI circuits, it is more effective to improve throughput and MTBF [mean time between failure] rather than reducing the price of EB direct writers. These conclusions were obtained[.sup]1[/] through comparisons and evaluations using an American COO model (Footnote 1) based on a cost of ownership concept, which formulates facility investments and cost-effectiveness of operations into equations. Footnote 1. Formulas were mostly based on the COO model used by SEMATECH of the United States, but a model recognized by an academic society was used for portions specific to EB writers. Mostly published data were used in the formulas. We asked for the opinion of domestic manufacturers of LSI circuits and masks other than Hitachi on the data on phase-shift masks, the KrF and ArF excimer technology and on the data specific to EB writers for comparison. First, we briefly outline the COO model and the way EB writers are used. Then, we show that hybrid usage of EB direct writers and steppers are cost effective (a) in the mass production of DRAMs and (b) in the large variety but small quantity production of ASICs. Finally, we describe the effectiveness of mask writers. Discussions Held on a Common Ground A COO model uses equations to evaluate cost-effectiveness based on the expenses of a certain equipment until its useful life is reached. These expenses are calculated from the equipment price, its productivity, reliability and yield. A COO model derives the cost of each wafer manufactured. The purpose of deriving such a COO value is to establish a common ground for discussions between users and manufacturers by unifying the evaluation standards for cost-effectiveness of equipment and materials. The COO value can also be used as a guideline for setting priorities in improving equipment or selecting targets for cost reduction. In the past, there was no unified model and the users and manufacturers of an equipment used different methods to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the equipment. Hence sometimes they failed to obtain an appropriate evaluation depending on what the users wanted. However, the evaluation standards now can be unified by using a COO model and its results, thus opening the opportunity of discussing on a common ground (Footnote 2). Footnote 2. One of the advantages of a COO model is that the model can highlight problems inherent in an equipment or a manufacturing line by changing evaluation parameters. For instance, a model can identify the required balance between the reliability and the price of an equipment, response to manufacturing 8-inch wafers including the effect of the equipment price, the relation between the depreciation of an equipment and investment effectiveness, and the relation between the appropriate number of equipment and the size of clean rooms. Three Ways to Use [EB Writers] The usage of EB writers is divided into three broad categories (Table 1): (1) All layers are directly written by an EB writer; (2) Hybrid usage with steppers (Footnote 3); (3) Used only for making masks. Table 1. Usage of EB writers. The usage of EB writers is divided into three broad categories. The host materials mentioned in the table are those for optical exposure. Usage of EB writers Objects to be Amount to be Methods to written manufactured be compared Mask writer Masks Small amount Reticles Small amount Laser writer Direct All EB Mainly Very small writing [writers] state-of-the-art amount (for devices R&D) Direct Gate arrays Small amount (many Mix-and-match writing, types of host among steppers hybrid materials) usage Advanced Small amount Mix-and-match gate (many types among steppers arrays of host materials) Memory Large amount Steppers, excimers, X-rays In the conventional mix-and-match method (Editor's Footnote 1) among steppers, such as the g-line and i-line, high precision steppers were used for critical layers but low-cost, high-speed equipment were used for noncritical layers. As a result, production cost was reduced. However, when the design rule is shorter than 0.35 micron, difficulties remain in the overlapping precision between steppers and the compensation for distorted images. These difficulties can be solved by using method (2) in which steppers are used for noncritical layers and EB direct writers for critical layers. Editor's Footnote 1: The method to mix-and-match steppers has aggressively been adopted by Hitachi. Few other companies use this method. In deriving a COO value, we have used the COO model developed by SEMATECH of the United States. We have adopted the standard values used by SEMATECH as input data. For fair comparisons, we asked for advice from other LSI and mask manufacturers on input data for steppers, such as phase-shift masks and the KrF and ArF excimer technology. All amounts were expressed in dollars, using an exchange rate of Â¥100 to $1. The obtained results conclude that hybrid usage of EB direct writers, which are based on the cell-projection technology, is cost-effective in manufacturing memory [chips with rules] under 0.25 micron, and EB direct writers are cost-effective in manufacturing ASICs [with rules] under 0.5 micron. The actual calculations of the COO values were carried out for mass production of DRAMs, large variety but small quantity production of ASICs, and for fabrication of masks. Hybrid Usage Is Cost-Effective for DRAMs First of all, our study has clearly indicated that hybrid usage is cost-effective for mass production of DRAMs (Figure 1). The reason for this conclusion is that the price of an EB writer does not change much even when very fine patterns are written, while the price of a stepper rises sharply. Another reason is that the cost of fabricating masks for phase shift masks and KrF excimer masks increases because auxiliary masks are needed. The basic parameters for hybrid usage are listed in Tables 2 and 3. The COO values to manufacture DRAMs with 0.35 micron or smaller [rules] using steppers rapidly increase, and the development cost for steppers will increase to control the rising production cost. In contrast, hybrid usage of EB writer based on the cell-projection technology[.sup]6[/] is somewhat more cost-effective than using only steppers. We assumed in our calculation that optical exposure is possible down to 0.18 micron. In practice, however, [the development of] KrF excimer stepper has not been completed and it is true that the outlook for ArF-based laser technology is uncertain. Figure 1.

A COO value for ASICs varies according to the quantity and type of products, and we have used cases for the production of 50,000 and 1,000 units per months, and 60, 120 and 240 types of products. The basic parameters are the same as those listed in Table 3 for the case of 0.8-0.35 micron. The variation of the COO value according to the type and quantity of products is shown in Figure 2. With steppers, the COO value barely changes even when the production quantity of a given device varies. On the contrary, the type of products affects the COO value very much; when the type of products doubles the COO value also nearly doubles. From the figure, we see that the COO value of an EB writer rises in proportion to the production quantity, but the rise is small. Figure 2. COO values as a function of the product types. Next, we illustrate in Figure 3 what should be the target of an equipment manufacturer in trying to reduce its equipment cost. Even if the equipment cost is reduced, its COO value sharply increases when the throughput and MTBF [mean time between failures] is reduced (Table 4). One cannot develop an equipment without considering its throughput and MTBF. These items are more important than reducing the price of an equipment (Editor's Footnote 2). Editor's Footnote 2: The research arm of Hitachi has requested that the equipment price be under ``Â¥300 million'' in the future. (See a related article in the September 1993 issue of this magazine, pp. 54-59.) Figure 3. COO value will increase if efficiency and the Table 4. Parameters that affect ASIC writing. The same values as in the case of 0.5 micron in Table 3 have been used for parameters not listed in this table.

Our calculation shows that the COO value can be reduced by maintaining the MTBF if the rising equipment price is controlled. The production quantity was assumed to be one wafer per lot, and the equipment price and the MTBF were assumed to rise in fabricating phase-shift masks. On the other hand, we also have studied the case in which the rising price of an EB writer is controlled and a decrease in the MTBF is prevented as part of a company-wide effort (Table 5). The results for different generations of memory chips are illustrated in Figure 4. Table 5. Key parameters in mask fabrication. ``Equipment price 2'' in this table and the second row of the MTBF entry represent trends to serve as goals for an equipment manufacturer. ``[.sup]*1[/]'' indicates that 5-magnification reticles were assumed.

COO values for mask fabrication. Results are In our evaluation, we used 5-magnification reticles, but it becomes difficult to produce two pieces of 256M or 1G [memory chips] with 5-magnification reticles. For this reason, 4-magnification reticles are being considered to prevent a decrease in throughput. In either case, however, the decisive factor in mask fabrication is how to prevent a decrease in throughput. Unified Evaluation Standards for Cost-Effectiveness of Investments and Operations of Equipment The cost of ownership (COO) is a modeling concept for evaluation standards for the cost-effectiveness of facility investments and operations at the management level. SEMATECH of the United States is leading the development of the model. Background and History The COO model originated from Intel Corporation of the United States in mid-eighties.[.sup]2[/] The Intel model was developed to serve as a quantitative evaluation standard for businesses in purchasing equipment. Later, this model was transferred to SEMATECH and has contributed to the construction of a model for the total production system. In 1991, the first article on COO was reported by R. Carnes and M. Su.[.sup]3[/] Their COO analysis software was distributed to more than 600 member companies of SEMATECH. Some LSI manufacturers are already using the model as an effective evaluation means to select equipment manufacturers. In addition, better training methods are being developed to understand the content of the COO model and to eliminate the differences between member companies, while SEMI [Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International] is standardizing the model.[.sup]4[/] Figure A-1. Concept for COO calculation. Input parameters Items listed in Figure A-1 are used in calculating the COO value. The ultimate goal is to form steps shown in Figure A-2 as the total-cost model and incorporate it into the COO analysis. Figure A-2. Total-cost model. The final goal is to form Computational Method of the COO Model Proposed by SEMATECH The cost per wafer, $COO, is calculated from SEMATECH's COO model according to the following equation[.sup]3[/]: EQUATION Here, $F are the fixed costs, which include the cost of acquiring equipment, transportation cost, startup cost, installation cost and facility cost; $V are the variable costs, which include the cost of chemicals, gas, water and electricity, materials cost, labor cost (operating cost, technical fees, etc.), repair cost and the cost of consumables; L is the equipment life (depreciation life, technical life, usage life); TPT is the throughput (wafers/hour); Y(TPT) is the average yield of the equipment that affect throughput (throughput yield); U is the utilization rate (according to the definition E10-92 by SEMI, actual production time/effective time); and $Y are the yield loss costs. This model accepts a wide range of input parameters. The model includes fixed costs ($F), such as the depreciation of the cost of acquiring equipment and facility cost. All depreciation periods are five years. Some of the input parameters are closely tied to production lines which must be clearly separated from the financial parts. Equipment Yield and Yield Loss Costs The yield loss costs caused by defects are related to the average number of defects per wafer, the cost of scrapping defective wafers and the number of defective chips per wafer according to the following equation: $Y=[W(TPT)x$P]+[W(D)x$T], where W(TPT) is the number of defective wafers based on the throughput yield, W(D) is the number of defective wafers based on the defect limiting yield (losses beyond the limits of the defect density), $P is the cost of a wafer at the processing stage, and $T is the cost of test wafers. The value of W(D) in the yield model is determined from the following equation: EQUATION Here, R is the number of wafers inserted per week, D is the physical defect density, L is the equipment life (week), A is the chip size (cm[.sup]2[/]), and P(f) is the loss probability. This probability, P(f), is the fraction of the critical pattern size within a chip area expressed as follows: P(f)=X(m)[.sup]2[/]/[W(W+P)], where X(m) is the minimum defect size, W is the minimum line width of the minimum gap between lines (micron), and P is the pitch (micron). These parameters depend on the process, the device type and the wafer diameter. Production Utilization Rate The COO model is based on the total cost per wafer at the actual production time. In Figure B, we present the guidelines for the equipment status and time for E10-92 at SEMI.[.sup]5[/] According to the figure, the production utilization rate U is given by: U=1-(SM+USM+TEST+TA+STBY)/168, where SM is the scheduled maintenance time (hour/week); USM is the unscheduled maintenance time (hour/week); TEST is the production testing time (hour/week); TA is the total time (hour/week) for temporary assistance, such as an unexpected stopping of equipment that can be recovered in less than six minutes by human intervention; and STBY is the time needed for preparation. The following items are included in the scheduled and unscheduled maintenance time: MTBF which stands for the production time/number of failures; MTTR [maximum time to repair] which stands for the total repair time/number of failures; MTBA [mean time between assistance] which stands for the production time/number of [maintenance] assistance; and MTTA [mean time to accomplish] which stands for the average time for performing assistance. Figure B. Equipment status and time. Throughput is an important component in a COO model. Throughput is affected by the MTBF, MTTR, MTBA, MTTA and the production testing time. For instance, the throughput for and EB [writer] is calculated from the above parameters and the time for job setup, the time for loading and unloading of a wafer, stage transfer time, alignment time and the number of shots. The maintenance cost is small, but plays an important role in the total wafer cost. The costs for which most attention should be paid are unscheduled maintenances, service contracts, spare parts, tests not covered under warranty and labor costs for repairs. References 1.
