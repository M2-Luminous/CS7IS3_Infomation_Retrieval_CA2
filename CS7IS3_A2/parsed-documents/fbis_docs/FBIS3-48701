FBIS3-48701 "dreas018__a94022" FBIS-EAS-94-018-A Document Type:Daily Report 27 January 1994 ANNEX Japan NASDA Prepares for 1 Feb H-II Rocket Launch Two-Hour Launch Window Announced 94P30022A Fukuoka MINAMI NIHON SHIMBUN in Japanese 18 Jan 94 p 20--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 94P30022A Fukuoka MINAMI NIHON SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:CSO [Text] The National Space Development Agency of Japan [NASDA] announced on 17 January that Japan's first domestically produced large rocket will be launched at 0700 on 1 February at the Tanegashima Space Center, located in Tanega-cho. The launch window had been from 0500 to 0900 on 1 February, but was officially set after NASDA observed that the fueling rehearsal held on 14 January was successful. Thus, the window was narrowed by two hours, from 0700 to 0900. The reason given by the Tanegashima Space Center for narrowing the launch window and moving it back two hours from the initial schedule was that "we set it after taking into consideration the ease of the rehearsal operations." A fueling rehearsal in preparation for the launch was held on 23 December 1993, but problems were discovered at eight points, including leaks in the helium [as published] pressure valves on the LE-7 main engine that resulted in insufficient pressure. So parts were replaced and another rehearsal was held on 14 January. There was some trouble with the movable nozzles on the solid rocket boosters during the second rehearsal, but this was not a major problem.
