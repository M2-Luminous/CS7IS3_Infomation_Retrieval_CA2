FR940602-2-00074 FR940602-2-00038 It is further ordered that respondents shall, within sixty (60) days after the date of service of this Order, file with the Commission a report, in writing, setting forth in detail the manner and form in which they have complied with this Order. Analysis of Proposed Consent Order To Aid Public Comment The Federal Trade Commission has accepted for comment three separate proposed consent orders with the following: (1) Doctors Medical Weight Loss Centers, Inc. (``DMWLC''), Doctors Weight Loss Centers, Inc. (``DWLC''), and Joyce A. Schuman (``Schuman''); (2) Quick Weight Loss Centers, Inc., a Georgia corporation (``QWLC&hyph;Ga.''), and Don K. Gearheart (``Gearheart''); and (3) Quick Weight Loss Centers, Inc., a Texas corporation (``QWLC&hyph;Tex.''), Gearheart, and Schuman. Under the direction and control of Gearheart and Schuman, the companies marketed similar low-calorie diet programs through weight loss centers in Florida, Georgia, and Texas, and used substantially similar advertisements and promotional materials to do so. The Commission has placed the proposed orders on the public record for sixty days for comment by interested persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty days, the Commission will again review the three agreements and decide whether it should withdraw from, or make final, any or all of the proposed orders. The Commission's three complaints charge that all of the proposed respondents deceptively promoted the efficacy and price of their diet programs, the rate at which their customers lose weight, and used deceptive monitoring practices. The complaint against QWLC&hyph;Tex., Gearheart, and Schuman also charges that they deceptively promoted the qualifications of, and supervision offered by, their staff. Efficacy The Commission's three complaints first charge that all of the proposed respondents failed to substantiate claims that their customers typically are successful in reaching and maintaining their goal weight. The agreed-to orders seek to address these charges in several ways. First, the proposed orders simply prohibit representations about the success of customers in achieving or maintaining weight loss, unless proposed respondents have and rely upon competent and reliable scientific evidence to substantiate the representations. (¶I.A.) For representations that any weight loss achieved or maintained through weight loss programs is typical or representative of all, or any subset, of customers, the required ``competent and reliable scientific evidence'' must be based upon a sample of (1) all customers who entered the diet programs, where the representation relates to such customers, or (2) all customers who completed a particular phase of a diet program, or the entire program, where the representation relates only to such customers. (¶I.A. (1)) for representations that any weight loss is maintained long-term, the supporting evidence must be based upon the experience of customers who were followed for at least two years after they completed the maintenance phase of the diet programs (or earlier termination, as applicable). (¶I.A. (2)) For representations that any weight loss is maintained permanently, the required evidence must be based upon the experience of customers who were followed for a period of time that is either (1) generally recognized by experts in the field of treating obesity as being of sufficient length to predict that weight loss will be maintained permanently, or (2) demonstrated by competent and reliable survey evidence as being of sufficient length to permit such a prediction. (¶I.A. (3)) The proposed orders also prohibit proposed respondents from representing that customers of any weight loss program have successfully maintained weight loss, unless they also disclose that ``for many dieters, weight loss is temporary'' (¶I.B), as well as the following factual information: (1) The average percentage of weight loss maintained by those customers; (2) the duration over which the weight loss was maintained, measured from the date that customers ended the active weight loss phase of the program; and (3) if the customers referred to are not representative of the general customer population of respondents' programs, either (a) the proportion of the total customer population in respondents' programs that those customers represent, or (b) the statement that proposed respondents make no claim that the results are representative of all participants in their programs. (¶I.C) The proposed orders further prohibit representations, in broadcast advertisements of thirty seconds or less, that participants of any weight loss program have successfully maintained weight loss, unless proposed respondents also:
