FR940804-2-00016 FR940804-2-00007 Period of Investigation The period of investigation (POI) is July 1, 1993, to December 31, 1993. Case History Since the notice of initiation on January 19, 1994 (59 FR 3844, January 27, 1994), the following events have occurred. On February 14, 1994, the International Trade Commission (ITC) issued an affirmative preliminary injury determination (USITC Publication 2734, February 1994). On February 25, 1994 we named Grand Foundry, Limited (Grand Foundry) and Mukand, Limited (Mukand) as respondents in this investigation, and on February 28, 1994, we issued antidumping questionnaires to these companies. These companies accounted for at least 60 percent of the exports of the subject merchandise to the United States during the POI. On February 26, 1994, Isibars, Limited (Isibars), an Indian producer/exporter of subject merchandise which was not selected as a mandatory respondent, requested that it be allowed to participate in the investigation as a voluntary respondent. On March 9, 1994, we sent Isibars a brief questionnaire requesting sales volume and value data and noted that based upon Isibars response we would determine if it was appropriate to issue a complete questionnaire to the company. On March 14, 1994, Isibars submitted its response to this questionnaire. Subsequently, on March 15, the Department issued Isibars a questionnaire, noting its policy with respect to voluntary respondents. On March 28, 1994, Isibars requested via facsimile a 30-day extension in order to respond to the Department's questionnaire. On March 28, 1994, we granted Isibars a partial extension contingent upon receipt of an officially filed extension request. However, because Isibars never submitted such an extension request or a response to any section of our questionnaire, we never deemed it to be a mandatory respondent. On March 4, 1994, Akai Impex Ltd. (Akai), another Indian producer/exporter of subject merchandise, requested that it be allowed to participate in the investigation. Subsequently, on March 7, 1994, we sent Akai a brief questionnaire requesting sales volume and value data and noted that based upon Akai's response we would determine if it was appropriate to issue it a questionnaire. Akai's response to this questionnaire was received on March 14, 1994. Our examination of this response revealed that Akai had not made sales of the subject merchandise to the United States during the POI, and on this basis, we denied its request for voluntary respondent status on March 17, 1994. On March 23, 1994, we received a response to Section A of the Department's questionnaire from Grand Foundry. In that response, respondent reported that it made no sales of export-quality merchandise in the home market during the POI. On April 4, 1994, we received petitioners' comments on Grand Foundry's Section A response. On April 5, 1994, the Department determined that Grand Foundry's third country sales to Germany were the appropriate basis for foreign market value (FMV), pursuant to 19 C.F.R. 353.49. On March 25, 1994, we received comments on the issue of class or kind of merchandise from interested parties, per the Department's invitation for such comments in its notice of initiation. On April 13, 1994, we received rebuttal comments on this issue. On May 11, 1994, we determined that SSB constitutes one class or kind of merchandise. (See May 11, 1994, Decision Memorandum to Barbara Stafford from The Team Re: Class or Kind of Merchandise.) On April 22, 1994, we received a response to Sections B and C of the Department's questionnaire from Grand Foundry. On May 4, 1994, we received petitioners' comments regarding Grand Foundry's responses to Sections B and C. On May 10, 1994, we issued a supplemental questionnaire to Grand Foundry. Grand Foundry submitted its supplemental response on June 20, 1994. Mukand never responded to any section of our antidumping questionnaire. On April 26, 1994 the Department received a request from petitioners to postpone the preliminary determination until July 28, 1994. On May 16, 1994, we published in the Federal Register (59 FR 25447), a notice announcing the postponement of the preliminary determination until not later than July 28, 1994, pursuant to petitioners' request, in accordance with 19 C.F.R. 353.15(c) and (d). On May 25, 1994, petitioners alleged that Grand Foundry sold the subject merchandise in Germany at prices below its cost of production (COP). Respondent rebutted the allegation on June 2, 1994. Petitioners supplemented their original allegation on June 7, 1994. On June 15, 1994, we determined that petitioners' allegation provided a reasonable basis to believe or suspect below cost sales, pursuant to section 353.51(a) of the Department's regulations. Accordingly, we initiated a sales below cost investigation for Grand Foundry on June 15, 1994, and subsequently issued Section D of the Department's questionnaire on June 16. On July 8, 1994, Grand Foundry requested an extension of time until August 1, 1994, to respond to Section D of the questionnaire. The Department granted such an extension on July 12, 1994. Also on July 12, Grand Foundry requested that the Department postpone the final determination until 135 days after the date of publication of the Department's preliminary determination, if that determination is affirmative. Best Information Available In accordance with section 776(c) of the Act, we have determined that the use of best information available (BIA) is appropriate for Mukand. Mukand did not respond to the Department's questionnaire issued on February 28, 1994. Because Mukand failed to answer the Department's questionnaire, we find it has not cooperated in this investigation.
