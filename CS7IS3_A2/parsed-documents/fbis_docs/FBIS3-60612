This strategy is part of the wider national PREPHA (Research and Technology Program for Advanced Hypersonic Propulsion) program. This means that close relations are being maintained with such prestigious institutes as the MAI [Moscow Aviation Institute] or the institutes of the Siberian branch of the Novosibirsk Academy of Sciences (Institute of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics, Thermophysics Institute, and others). In this context and with the support of the DRET [Research, Studies, and Technologies Directorate of the Ministry of Defense], the ONERA has been able to develop a particularly fruitful cooperation with the CIAM [Central Institute of Aircraft Engines Moscow], whose activities are located on two sites: In Moscow, where most of the theoretical and laboratory work is done, and in Turayevo (50 kms from Moscow), where the institute has an impressive complex of industrial testing facilities. Under the leadership of its present director Donat Ogorodnikov, the CIAM, which is specializing in the study and development of aeronautical engines, devotes a substantial amount of its activity to the study of the super-ramjet, and in particular the hydrogen- propulsed super-ramjet. Existing cooperation focuses on two main areas: -- the development of computation codes in aerothermics and in aerothermochemistry; -- the in-flight experimentation of an axisymmetrical super- ramjet. High-Performance Digital Diagrams [subhead] Concerning the development of computation codes, the CIAM is suggesting digital diagrams derived from that of Godunov and which are particularly economical in terms of computation time. Areas of joint activity include a comparative evaluation, based on the computation of a series of test cases, of the CIAM diagrams and those used at the ONERA. When this evaluation is finished, Russian specialists will come to France to help their French colleagues embed CIAM digital diagrams in some of their codes, notably those dealing with supersonic aerothermochemistry. Other than the initial work of selecting and embedding the most appropriate digital diagrams, ongoing research will be continued within the scope of the PREPHA program aimed at defining and validating the models which best represent the physical phenomena governing aerothermics and aerothermochemistry of the super-ramjet. The CIAM and certain Novosibirsk-based institutes will be able to contribute their experiences and their databases in this field, but ways of cooperation on this issue remain to be decided. Although the development of computation codes is a very promising area of cooperation in the medium and long term, in-flight testing of a super-ramjet is, in the short time, the most beneficial. First Test Inconclusive In November 1991, the CIAM conducted an initial in-flight test of a hydrogen axisymmetrical super-ramjet. A stabilized supersonic combustion phase could not be reached during this test because the carrier rocket's trajectory control was insufficient and the hydrogen flow control was set too close to the limits for unpriming [desamorcage]. As a result, the engine operated only a few, very short moments in supersonic mode. During the summer of 1992, ONERA's financial contribution, thanks to support by DRET, enabled the CIAM to start up preparations again for a second experiment, which had been interrupted for lack of funding. A second in-flight test was carried out on 17 November 1992 from a military base located between Priozersk and Baykonur in Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan government officials and scientists attended the testing alongside French and Russian scientists. Second Joint French-Russian Test The design of the axisymmetric super-ramjet tested by the CIAM resembles that of the ESOPE engine tested on the ground by the ONERA at the beginning of the seventies in the S4MA wind tunnel at its Modane Avrieux center in the French Savoy region. The hydrogen combustion, which ignites as soon as the engine reaches Mach 3.5, takes place initially in subsonic mode because of an injection of hydrogen in the zone upstream of the combustion chamber. When the Mach number goes beyond five, the injection is distributed between the upstream and downstream zones of the combustion chamber to stabilize combustion in supersonic mode. This engine and its control system were developed by the CIAM on a special small-sized test bench in its Turayevo center. The mechanical design and manufacture were subsequently handed over to the Soyuz development division located near this center. The engine does not fly autonomously. The combined engine/control system/tank module is tandem-mounted on a rocket, derived from a ground-to-air missile, which ensures its acceleration to up to Mach 5.5. This rocket was modified by the Fakel engineering and design office which perfected the control system in such a way as to ensure a trajectory which is sufficiently close to the nominal trajectory enabling the super-ramjet to perform well. The rules controlling the hydrogen flow injected into the upstream and downstream zones of the combustion chamber are based on controlling the priming of the combustion throat [veine de combustion] (supersonic flow in the whole chamber). These rules were modified for the second flight test to improve the available unpriming margin and to enable the engine withstand a possible incidence intake during the supersonic combustion phase. Encouraging Results The trajectory executed by the rocket during the second experiment was much nearer to the nominal trajectory than in 1991. A tank pressurization problem limited the flow of hydrogen injected, independently of any regulation, as soon as the engine's regenerative cooling system started working at full capacity. However, supersonic combustion could be stabilized for about 15 seconds. Because the engine remains connected to the carrier rocket, it is impossible to obtain a direct measure of the thrust. However, the wide use of pressure and temperature gauges along the length of the engine should enable the fluid dynamics into the engine to be understood better and therefore to facilitate the comprehension of physical phenomena governing the performance of the super-ramjet. In addition, this will also lead to establishing test cases in real, well-documented flight conditions for the development and validation of computation codes. An Operation To Be Continued... Although this second experiment was relatively successful with the stabilization of combustion in supersonic mode during a significant length of time, it should be noted that because of the lack of hydrogen flow this operation was far from nearing the unpriming limits, therefore at a weak thrust. They were also unable to check the efficiency of the hydrogen flow control system, whose technology is somewhat old-fashioned, in regulating the hydrogen flow to avoid unpriming of the combustion throat. Continuing the operation should initially allow the tank pressurization problem to be solved, thus avoiding the engine's operation at nominal capacity and allowing its in-flight control. Next, the engine should be equipped with more finely-tuned instruments, possibly based on Western technology, and the carrier rocket should be developed to enable a maximum Mach flight number to be reached. This should allow us to improve our knowledge of the super-ramjet and the quality of the validation of computation codes. Not Just a First Step It is clear that the super-ramjet of the axisymmetrical type is not the best propulsion technology for a hypersonic vehicle. Indeed, the expanse of wet surfaces, and therefore losses through friction and heat exchange, slightly limits the maximum thrust level. In addition, it is difficult to combine the highly integrated propulsion system needed on hypersonic vehicles with the circular section of each engine module. The current operation, which benefits from the advances being made at the CIAM, should therefore be considered as an initial phase making it possible to: -- acquire expertise in the development and experimentation of a super-ramjet; -- set up a database for the validation of computation codes. The PREPHA program, although it involves the study of large two- dimensional super-ramjets (chamber entrance section: 1 square meter under study, 5 square decimeters in ground testing, to be compared with 1 square decimeter for the CIAM engine) will be the first to benefit from this cooperation. It is above all in the longer term that the evaluation of the working methods and skills of the CIAM in the field of design and testing the super-ramjet will optimize conditions for a cooperation program which aims to experiment the autonomous flight of a super- ramjet whose design is closer to future needs and future applications of hypersonic air-breathing propulsion. The Super-Ramjet The ramjet benefits from natural recompression linked to a slowing down in air intake flow rate. For Mach numbers under 6, it can be interesting to slow the flow down to subsonic level to ensure the best combustion rate without thrust levels being strained by too weak pressure recuperation levels in the air intake. Beyond this limit (about Mach 6), recompression to subsonic flow causes precombustion pressure and temperature losses which do not allow enough energy to be added to the flow and to transform it into thrust through a sonic nozzle. It is therefore preferable to limit recompression to a moderately supersonic Mach number (2 to 4) on condition that the techniques to stablize supersonic combustion flow are functioning. This is super-ramjet mode. Studies carried out over the past few years on the subject of partially air-breathing propulsion systems for space launchers have led French teams to estimate that limiting the air-breathing phase to the Mach-O to Mach-6 level will not improve the overall performance in terms of net mass in orbit in relation to full rocket propulsion: "Air-breating technology, which is heavier, does not pay its way." To develop this field, a super-ramjet is required capable of reaching Mach numbers over 10 and, which is more likely, close to 12. Although subsonic combustion ramjet technology is relatively well mastered in France thanks to a number of exploratory developments and to the development of the ASMP and the (incomplete) ANS [expansions unknown], some research into super-ramjets has been conducted during the sixties and seventies (ESOPE: tests at Mach 6 under forced control [conduite forcee]). This is why PREPHA's main objective is to improve our knowledge and our tools for the design of the super-ramjet, a potential solution for entirely recoverable and reusable launchers in the future.
