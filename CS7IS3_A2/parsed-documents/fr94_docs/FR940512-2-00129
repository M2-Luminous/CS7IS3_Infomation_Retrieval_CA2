FR940512-2-00129 FR940512-2-00065 3. The proposed TS changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed TS changes are administrative in nature, and will only involve revising the frequency for submitting the Semiannual Radioactive Effluent Release Report to the NRC from semiannually to annually as currently stipulated in 10 CFR 50.36a. The specific radiological effluent release information contained in this report will continue to be provided as required. The station radiological effluent releases will continue to be controlled as required by TS, including those requirements specified in the ODCM and PCP. Therefore, the proposed TS changes do not involve a reduction in a margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

South Carolina Electric & Gas Company, South Carolina Public Service Authority, Docket No. 50&hyph;395, Virgil C. Summer Nuclear Station, Unit No. 1, Fairfield County, South Carolina Date of amendment request: February 25, 1994. Description of amendment request: The proposed Technical Specification (TS) changes would permit the submittal of the Radioactive Effluents Release Report on an annual rather than a semiannual basis; allow changes to the Offsite Dose Calculation Manual (ODCM) to be submitted in the Radioactive Effluent Release Report rather than in the monthly operating report; remove the title of Executive Vice President_Operations from the TS; remove the list of audit frequencies from the TS and place them under Quality Systems management; change the title of Associate Manager, Health Physics to Radiation Protection Manager; remove references to specific letters; remove TS 6.4 on training; and correct various typographical errors. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated because the administrative change does not affect plant operations in any manner. 2. The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident than previously evaluated because the proposed change is administrative in nature and no physical alterations of plant configuration or changes to setpoints or operating parameters are proposed. 3. The proposed license amendment does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The change is only administrative. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and based on this review it appears that the standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

South Carolina Electric & Gas Company, South Carolina Public Service Authority, Docket No. 50&hyph;395, Virgil C. Summer Nuclear Station, Unit No. 1, Fairfield County, South Carolina Date of amendment request: March 11, 1994. Description of amendment request: The proposed Technical Specification (TS) changes would delete surveillance requirement 4.8.1.4.a.3, which requires periodic testing of penetration protection fuses, and its associated Basis. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 1. The probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated is not significantly increased. Fuses are simple protection devices and can only degrade by being more resistive which is in the conservative direction. The proper type and size fuse is assured as part of design, procurement, and initial installation. The testing provides no additional assurance of operability. Therefore, the deletion of periodic retesting of these fuses will not increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 2. [The proposed amendment will not] [c]reate the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed. The design of the penetration protection and the installation of the fuses has not changed in any way. Any undetected failure of a fuse would fall under single failure criteria. A current limiting fuse must have high electrical current in order to perform its intended function. Any fuse which has opened the circuit through the penetration would be detected. (This is not a concern of the Technical Specifications.) Therefore, this change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. 3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Deletion of this surveillance requirement will not minimize the intent of this Technical Specification. This TS is to assure continued operability of the containment penetration conductor overcurrent protection which helps to ensure containment integrity. Testing, however, may introduce the potential for damage to the fuses and fuse clips. Therefore, the deletion of this TS requirement will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and based on this review it appears that the standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
