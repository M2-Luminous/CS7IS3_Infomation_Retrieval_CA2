Members suggest that the non-fossil fuel obligation, a 1 billion-pound-a-year levy on consumers' bills intended to fund decommissioning in England and Wales, is little more than a tax on consumers. They say that while Nuclear Electric, the biggest state-owned atomic generator, seems confident that it can meet its obligations, Scottish Nuclear will become technically insolvent in the next financial year without further government intervention. Alan Williams, Labour MP for Swansea West and a member of the committee, said: "The Government is clearly charging a 10 per cent tax on electricity to pay for decommissioning nuclear power stations. It is costing the consumer 1 billion pounds a year. Until 1998, when this levy effectively ends, the consumer will pay this plus 17.5 per cent VAT (value added tax], leading to soaring bills." The committee's report, The Cost of Decommissioning Nuclear Facilities, will increase pressure on the Government to draw up a broad brief for its overdue review of the nuclear industry's future. It will also add to the difficulties Nuclear Electric faces in its efforts to win planning consent to build a pressurised water plant in Suffolk, alongside the Sizewell B plant now nearing completion. The two leading nuclear power companies last night defended themselves vigorously. John Collier, the chairman of Nuclear Electric, said: "We know exactly how to decommission all Nuclear Electric's power stations." The company's total decommissioning liability, in real terms, was 2.7 billion pounds, he said. "We're right on track to meet that bill without any need for subsidy or extension of the levy." Robin Jeffrey, the chief executive of Scottish Nuclear, confirmed that his company would become technically insolvent if it failed to tackle its problems. But he added: "We have every confidence that cost-saving projects, which include the dry storage of spent fuel and a new approach to decommissioning known as Safestore, will ensure that the question of technical insolvency will not arise." The Public Accounts Committee looked at decommissioning costs right across the industry. Its report notes that accounting provisions in the nuclear generating industry rose from 1.1 billion pounds in 1987 to 3.76 billion pounds in 1989. Planned privatisation was subsequently abandoned because investors were worried about the industry's liabilities, including decommissioning. By 1992, the total cost of closing and removing civil nuclear plants and cleaning up associated radioactive contamination was estimated at 18 billion pounds for the four companies--Nuclear Electric, Scottish Nuclear, British Nuclear Fuels and AEA, the former Atomic Energy Authority. The process involves removal of fuel and ancillary plant, followed a century later by dismantling and burial elsewhere of the reactor. MPs are concerned that although Nuclear Electric says it has about 1.5 billion pounds of deposits for decommissioning with the National Loans Fund, some of the provisions have been used to fund construction of Sizewell B. The company insists that revenues from Sizewell will be used to top up the provisions.
