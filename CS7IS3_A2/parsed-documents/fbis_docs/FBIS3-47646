Linda Mottram reports from Canberra that the number of people finding work has also gone up despite a fall in the number of people officially looking for work. [Begin Mottram recording] The December figures just released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics show unemployment fell by 31,000. That means around 937,500 Australians were officially out of work in the month. Most Australian states mirrored the downward trend in unemployment. The figures show 22,000 people nationally found jobs during the month, partly attributable to the usual pre-Christmas increase in available work. But the number of people officially looking for work appears to have dropped -- typically a sign of disillusionment with the continuing poor job outlook. The better overall outlook though continues a steady, if slow, trend of serveral months. Unemployment will be a major policy focus this year with the Keating government preparing a final paper on addressing long-term unemployment. [end recording]
