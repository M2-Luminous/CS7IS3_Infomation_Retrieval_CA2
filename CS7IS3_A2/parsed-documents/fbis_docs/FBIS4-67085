FBIS4-67085 "jptdd020__l94069" JPRS-TDD-94-020-L JPRS Narcotics 7 May 1994 EAST ASIA THAILAND Parliamentarian Faces U.S Charges of Marijuana Smuggling Parliamentarian Faces U.S Charges of Marijuana Smuggling Further on Accused MP's Denial BK0705095494 Bangkok BANGKOK POST in English 7 May 94 p 1 BK0705095494 Bangkok BANGKOK POST English BFN [Text] Chat Thai MP Thanong Siriprichaphong, accused by U.S. antinarcotics authorities of marijuana smuggling, says he is prepared to fly to the United States if necessary to defend himself. After keeping a low profile for a few days, Mr. Thanong resurfaced in Parliament to deny all the charges at a press conference. He offered to resign over drug dealing charges only if these damaged his party and supporters and threatened to sue the press for publicising the accusations lodged against him by the U.S.. Nicknamed "Po Pet," the MP for Nakhon Phanom strongly dismissed the marijuana trafficking allegations made against him by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). Mr. Thanong told almost 100 reporters and photographers he was ready to clear himself of the allegations and said he had never been contacted by the DEA. Nor was he served with an affidavit from the agency. The MP said such accusations were damaging but he was "gentleman enough" not to accuse anyone else. Asked how he felt at being accused of having been involved in the trafficking of 47 tons of marijuana, he said: "Just one gramme of marijuana would hurt me enough." He said he would have his lawyer fly to the U.S. to hear the claims and, if necessary, he would be prepared to defend himself in the U.S.. "I'd rather go and hear the charges myself but they advised I send my lawyer first," he said. He has a life-long visa to enter the U.S. The DEA has accused Mr. Thanong of involvement in the smuggling of 47 tons of marijuana from Thailand to the U.S. in the past 10 years and reported that his house in Los Angeles and a Mercedes Benz worth about 30 million Baht in all had been sequestrated. But Mr. Thanong claimed he had no business in the U.S. and did not own a house in California as alleged. The MP said he had owned a car in the U.S. but sold it. "I didn't own the house or any other assets in the U.S. as reported," he said. He said he had consulted his constituents in Nakhon Phanom and Chat Thai Secretary General Banhan Sinlapa-acha and they all advised against his resigning as an MP. The MP said he needed no parliamentary immunity from arrest on such charges and would resign without hesitation only if there was any serious damage to the House, Chat Thai and Nakhon Phanom people. "If the (Chat Thai) party tells me to make a decision, I'll resign no matter whether or not I was guilty." As for whether the drug charges were a political game, Mr. Thanong said he was "too gentlemanly to comment.'' "I hate to mention any third person unnecessarily. That's another point. I may be seen positively or negatively. But I am what I am." Opposition figures, including Chat Thai Deputy Leader Thawit Klinprathum, have claimed the Thanong issue is a political ploy to discredit Chat Thai by digging up drug claims made against Mr. Thanong last year. Mr. Thanong said he would be ready to testify before the House Committee for Parliamentary Affairs on Tuesday as asked by its chairman. He declined to say if he had any serious conflict with anyone just before the issue was publicised. He said everyone would naturally have some people on their side. The MP said he would consult his lawyer as to whether he could sue newspapers, radio and TV stations which reported the claims. "I think I'm going to take legal action against newspapers, radio and TV. Many times I have been hit by newspapers. I'm definitely going to sue if I can." A few times during the conference Mr. Thanong was sarcastic. Asked if he believed the drug issue was part of a political game, he declined to give a direct answer but said only: "I'm not a reporter." He said the Thai press could jump to conclusions on anything more clearly than the police. "Don't make me act like the Thai press which can make all kinds of judgements," he said. House Speaker Marut Bunnak said Mr. Thanong should be questioned over the claims in Thailand rather than in the U.S.. Mr. Marut said the U.S. should take steps under Thailand's Drugs Suppression and Prevention Bill and international agreements. Mr. Thanong would not be ousted as an MP just because of the claims he said.
