ECOPETROL sources said the sabotage, which caused a moderate fire and spilled an unspecified quantity of crude oil, occurred at Km 150 between Arauquita and La Esmeralda, near the border with Venezuela. According to the report, members of the National Liberation Army detonated three dynamite charges against the pipeline, damaging a sizable portion thereof and forcing suspension of the pumping, a suspension that will continue until it is repaired in a few days. Colombia's oil infrastructure has become one of the Simon Bolivar Guerrilla Coordinating Board's main targets. The guerrilla organization attempts to thwart the participation of multinational enterprises in the export of oil. Authorities of Arauca Department, where the recently discovered Cusiana oil fields are located, mounted a strong security operation to preclude new attacks.
