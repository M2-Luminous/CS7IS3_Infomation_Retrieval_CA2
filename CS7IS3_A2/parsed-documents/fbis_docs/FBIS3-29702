"All the problems and confusion should be referred to the permanent secretary for defence or the defence minister," said Wimon. "I want to know how they interpret the government's policy and whether they can explain it." Wimon, who appeared testy while speaking to reporters at the National Defense Institute, said the army has no knowledge about barter trade. "We know nothing. We don't know what are Thailand's agricultural products. We don't know the prices. We don't know about marketing strategies. Our duty is to defend the country, not to trade," the army chief said. "Soldiers have to abide by orders. For example, if we need 155mm ammunition or artillery shells for target practice, the Defence Ministry can now no longer provide them because it has to follow Cabinet instructions. "I have asked the Defence Ministry how the government policy can be put into practice when we still need to know so much more. First of all, we don't know whether the barter trade should be implemented only in cases of major purchases. The ministry cannot give an answer." Wimon complained that many arms proposals of the army have "bounced back" from the Defence Ministry. "It seems we can't move now. We can move only when the Defence Ministry has clear understanding [of the government's policy]. But what has happened is everything we proposed has bounced back," he said. "We need a system, otherwise in every arms deal we will have to bring with us cattle or pigs." Meanwhile, senior government officials yesterday appeared to soften the food-for-arms policy, saying the military can still make deals to purchase weaponry while the government will negotiate with the supplier to buy Thai commodities. Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri said the military's misunderstanding of the policy had led to the confrontation between the armed forces and the Chuan administration. "It doesn't mean that we take our domestic products and ask foreign suppliers to accept them in exchange for arms," he explained. The government's prime concern is to avoid a trade deficit. Relations between the government and the military floundered when the Cabinet insisted last week that the Air Force must employ a barter system for its planned purchase of six transport planes-- worth more than Bt4 billion -- from Italy. Top brass, including Army Commander-in-Chief Wimon and Supreme Commander ACM Woranat Aphichari held a special meeting to discuss the issue and concluded that the idea is both old-hat and impractical. Prasong said if the armed forces wanted to buy any military equipment they would just have to keep the government informed so that the relevant agencies could try to arrange the sale of Thai commodities to the country in question. "We just want to ensure the country does not acquire a trade deficit. It's not a matter of exchanging rice for arms and the military understood it," he insisted. He said military leaders will accept the government's barter policy "because the military these days is very disciplined and ready to comply with the government policies, better than in the past". [passage omitted] The president of Alenia, the Italian firm marketing the G-222 transport planes sought by the Air Force, met Commerce Minister Uthai Pimchaichon yesterday to discuss the proposed purchase. Deputy Commerce Minister Chaiyot Sasomsap,said the government will not scrap the planned purchase, but is negotiating for Italy to buy Thai farm produce. He said the Defence Ministry will ask Alenia to extend the validity of the quotation, which expires this month.
