Therefore, in the event there is a left-wing turn, the cause of the survival of Hungarians could be endangered, Lajos Fur, elected new chairman of the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] on 19 February, told MAGYAR HIRLAP. He said that he represents the MDF as chairman while he continues to tour the country. He added that, in the event of an unexpected election defeat, it will not be him who will have to draw the conclusions regarding himself. However, the MDF is not expecting this, Fur confirmed. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] It was almost a year ago when, with dramatic words, you resigned from your position as the MDF's administrative chairman and from party politics. What made your relatively quick and spectacular return possible? [Fur] In October 1993, I began to visit the MDF's local organizations throughout the country because I had realized that there was no time to waste. I realized we would have to fight a very hard battle at the next elections if we wanted to achieve good results. In the meantime, the emotions that had been upset in the MDF settled down. We need to be very active because the stakes are very high. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] As the offices of party chairman and managing director are going to coexist, who is it who actually leads the MDF? [Fur] Sandor Lezsak and I do it together. We do not have very different personalities. Lezsak will run the party's affairs, he is the organizing and operational person, and I will represent the party. I will carry on doing what I have already been doing, namely touring the country and talking. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Is the MDF threatened by the same factor that is typical of collective parties? The various tendencies are also represented by other parties that attract the supporters of these ideas with clearer appearance: This can lead to segmentation. [Fur] At the moment in Hungary, all parties are threatened by this, as far as I can judge the parliamentary political forces. However, after the past, very painful and damaging conflicts, now, in these months, the MDF is not threatened by segmentation. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] In a recent interview you mentioned that, in the second round of the 1990 elections, the MDF's success was partly due to the votes gained from the Hungarian Socialist Party's [MSZP] supporters. Do you see any chance that, during the campaign, you will regain the support of some of the socialist sympathizers whose number has significantly increased? [Fur] In the current situation, I doubt that the MDF will be able to do this. In my view, there is no chance of this just now. This base was not actually so big in 1990. Instead, the large mass of people who have not decided whether to vote at all are worth more attention. The MDF will have to win over this group of people. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Much was said about the left wing at your National Meeting. During the MDF's campaign, what arguments will you use to convince the public about the reality of the left-wing danger? [Fur] Three major issues have to be decided and the left- wing's victory would threaten these: The continuation of "clean democracy" might be halted and diverted sideways. It is also possible to create dictatorship from democracy, and not only through a coup. The bourgeois type social order and economic structure could be seriously endangered. I would like to remind people that MSZP Chairman Gyula Horn and Socialist International Chairman Pierre Mauroy clearly said so in their joint statement: They want democratic socialism. I do not at all care what this socialism is described as, whether flourishing, democratic, or existing, it is still the same thing. There are only slight differences but, as far as the essence is concerned, differences do not exist in left-wing thinking. However, in this case, the bourgeois transformation would be diverted. The third and most critical viewpoint is that the left wing, because it makes the social issues absolute, thinks in terms of internationalism, and therefore it disregards national issues, ignores them, and does not see them as important. Consequently, the issue of the survival of Hungarians is at stake. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Do you see any possibility of a coalition or any kind of cooperation with the Hungarian Justice and Life Party [MIEP]? [Fur] At the moment, there is no chance of this at all. In MAGYAR FORUM, we seem to be the main enemy, the MDF is attacked week after week by the MIEP. This being the case, how could we even begin to think about a coalition? [MAGYAR HIRLAP] In the event of an election defeat, what conclusions would you draw in connection with yourself and your office as party chairman? [Fur] Nothing regarding myself, other people will do that for me. From the MDF's point of view, it would mean that it would have to prepare for the next elections and would have to draw conclusions from the work that had negative results. However, I am almost certain that we will not have to face problems like this.
