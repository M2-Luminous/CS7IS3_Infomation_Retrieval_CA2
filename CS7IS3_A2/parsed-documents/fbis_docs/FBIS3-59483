This building is in the center of Karlovac, it is the property of the Serb Orthodox Eparchy, but it is also part of the city. Regardless of who the perpetrator was, which is still not known, this act did not benefit Croatia, quite the contrary. These people are the enemies of our country. Everything happened at a time of intensive talks with local Serbs, during the peace initiative of President Tudjman, on the greatest Catholic holiday, a time for peace, love, unity, and forgiveness. This was an act which deserves condemnation. Tt did not happen when thousands of shells were falling on the city, and it should not have happened now either. We presume that it was a premeditated act intended to destabilize all of us here. I want to stress that it was also an act from which all the citizens want to disassociate themselves. [Peter] After this terrorist act, for which there is no justification, could you tell us what the current mood in Karlovac is? [Jakovcic] Quite a few citizens of Serb nationality left the city, and about 6,000 Serbs live in Karlovac today. They live and work in a normal way, just like all the other citizens. [passage omitted] The burden of Karlovac is about 16,000 exiles, half being from Slunj. Recently, Karlovac citizens have been upset by Muslims who travel every weekend to Cazinska Krajina across the control point in Turanj. UNPROFOR convoys also pass through Karlovac, which upsets the citizens. [passage omitted]
