[passage omitted] In Sarajevo a spokesman for the UN High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) said the convoy should arrive by Tuesday in the town, where things looked somewhat better than expected. "The food situation in Maglaj is not as bad as originally reported, but the destruction is very considerable. There is not a single house without serious damage," spokesman Kris Janowski said at a Sarajevo press briefing. The region's war-weary population had been described in a recent UN report as walking skeletons. But Major Simon Macdowell, UNPROFOR spokesman in Sarajevo, told journalists early indications showed that while the situation was "far from good" it was "not as desperate as perhaps some Bosnian radio reports were making out." "There are no signs of ethnic cleansing in the Maglaj region (which) has suffered worst from shelling and fighting," he said Monday. Janowski said the second run would provide a real test of Serb will to allow humanitarian aid for the 100,000 people living in the Moslem-dominated enclave, but the UNHCR was not expecting any trouble. Trapped civilians have been forced to rely on air drops for aid since ground deliveries were stopped five months ago. Larry Hollingworth, head of UNHCR operations in Bosnia, reported that the airdrops had been successful "and basically kept them alive," said Janowski. Serb forces withdrew Saturday from positions around Maglaj after the UN Security Council ordered them to lift their nine-month siege on March 14. A group of UN peacekeeping soldiers was allowed in on a reconnaissance mission to set up the arrival of Sunday's nine-truck convoy from Zenica, which carried 80 tonnes of food and medical supplies to Maglaj and the nearby besieged town of Tesanj. Several doctors accompanying the convoy evacuated nine people "in serious condition (...) injured during the recent shelling," said Janowski. Macdowell said it was "still too early" to confirm whether rumours of a Bosnian Serb army withdrawal from the region were true. "It is still going to take some time until we have more freedom of movement, to really be able to assess positions around the area," he said. [passage omitted]
