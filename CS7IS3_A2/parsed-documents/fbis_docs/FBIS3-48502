(KOTRA) said Monday. Canada landed a preliminary dumping margin of 45.6 percent on Korean steel plate on Jan. 17 and as a result Tongkuk Steel Mill Co. has to make deposits equal to the amount for its exports to the North American country. On Jan. 6, the Argentine Government said it would slap punitive anti-dumping tariffs on Korean-made men's shirts of under 4.95 U.S. dollars on its market at the free-on-board rate. Mexico recently announced that it will continue investigation of Goldstar Co., Daewoo Electronics Co., Sonil Metal Co., and Hanil Precision Industries Co., which are suspected of exporting at between 5.15 percent and 55.47 percent less than fair prices. Under preliminary dumping findings of between 6.77 percent and 29.16 percent on high-density polyethylene and between 11.24 percent and 17.39 percent on low-density items, the Taipei Government went into final screening of Korean exporters. At complaints by local manufacturers, Australia embarked on a preliminary investigation into Korean and Singaporean PVC (polyvinvyl chloride) homopolymer earlier in the month. Hanyang Chemical Corp., Lucky Corp., Goldenbell Co., and Samsung Chemical Industries Co. are under charges of dumping between 10 percent and 38 percent. The preliminary ruling is due sometime in April. India, Korea's major synthetic resin buyer, is said to be preparing an anti-dumping attack on the Korean export.
