In a year there could be a ban on selling ordinary unleaded gasoline, and only the less environmentally hazardous class 2 variant would be allowed. In a DAGENS NYHETER interview on the connection between the economy and the environment, Bo Lundgren took a generally positive view on stricter economic control in order to reduce the environmental problems. But he clearly stakes out the preconditions. One of the principal demands is that competition must not be distorted, and he uses the environmental classification of unleaded gasoline as an example. "If there were only two producers selling the new environmental class 2, a complete halt would be wrong. In that case it would be better to have a tax refund for it." Waiting for the European Union Today all companies sell environmental class 3 (in principle ordinary unleaded gas). The environmentally better class 2 has been sold only by OK, Uno-X, and Texaco since last year. But now that the other companies are also expected to start selling environmental class 2 as soon as within a year, why then be satisfied with a tax refund? the finance minister reasons. "When there are good alternatives to a product one cannot introduce administrative bans," in Lundgren's opinion. The government does not yet believe it has all the facts in order to submit a proposal for environmental classification of gasoline. The study was ready a year ago, to be sure, but the EU [European Union] must also have time to have its say. "I could very well imagine that Sweden might be a pioneer in environmental classification. It could be implemented at the coming turn of the year," says Bo Lundgren, but points out that the EU must first agree to the Swedish way. Bo Lundgren and the nonsocialist government have been the subject of harsh criticism for not using economic means of control as a way toward a better environment. A toothless surcharge on cadmium in commercial fertilizer and higher taxes on leaded gasoline are more or less all the government has accomplished, environmental researcher and Social Democrat Per Kageson recently wrote in DAGENS NYHETER. "Starting with what we had, we have done a lot," Lundgren counters. Higher Energy Taxes "Look at our reduction of the carbon dioxide tax for industry. Keeping a high energy tax for industry would both create economic problems in Sweden and aggravate the global environment. Our energy tax reform prevents Swedish companies from becoming established abroad." Somewhat surprisingly, Bo Lundgren can very well imagine that the energy taxes on industry might be raised. He can even accept that the distribution is changed so that the households assume a comparatively smaller share of the burden and industry a larger one. But it is not yet time for that, he says. All countries, at least in the EU, must also participate. "If I get the chance, I will work for an orientation toward more environmentally based taxes." Will you push these issues in the EU? "Yes, if I get the opportunity. I think we should have been able to do more with the coordination internationally than we have." So how does one switch taxes from labor to environmentally hazardous activities, for example? The environmental movement demands such a change in taxation and the EU has also begun to discuss it now. "Many overrate the opportunities for lowering taxes on labor. The tax base for work is much broader than the one for the environment," Lundgren says and describes the difficulties created by this imbalance. "A cut in the employer's tax by 5 percent, for example, costs 20 billion kronor. That is a great deal compared with all environmental and energy taxes," the finance minister says and stresses that he is by no means an opponent of this thinking. Here as well Sweden must keep pace with other countries. However, it is probably not primarily the tax on work that will be switched to "green" taxes. "I think one should begin by lowering the value-added tax. The damaging effect of the employer's tax could be tackled in a different way. It is more difficult to do so with the value-added tax." New Study Both the change in taxation and other links between taxes/fees and the environment will be analyzed in a new study. Bo Lundgren therefore prefers to wait with inflexible opinions on what is best. "I have to think about what I am prepared to do in order to have whiter snow at my farm in Scania," he says and remembers that the snow sparkled more in his youth, when the environmental destruction had not progressed so far.
