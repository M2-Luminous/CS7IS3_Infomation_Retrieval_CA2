Relating to the Listing Criteria for Certain Hybrid Securities. September 30, 1994. I. Introduction On February 25, 1994, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') a proposed rule change to establish specific listing criteria for certain hybrid securities. Notice of the proposal appeared in the Federal Register on April 7, 1994. 3 No comment letters were received on the proposed rule change. The CBOE filed Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change on September 28, 1994, 4 and Amendment No. 2 on September 29, 1994. 5 This order approves the CBOE proposal, as amended. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1992). 3 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33843 (March 31, 1994), 59 FR 16666 (April 7, 1994). 4 In Amendment No. 1, the CBOE amends, in several respects, the proposed listing criteria for contingent value rights, equity-linked notes, and paired securities, as described herein, to conform the proposed rule language to the listing criteria for such products previously approved by the Commission for the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'') and/or the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex''). See Letter from Michael Meyer, Schiff Hardin & Waite, to Brad Ritter, Senior Counsel, Office of Market Supervision, Division of Market Regulation, Commission, dated September 27, 1994 (``Amendment No. 1''). 5 In Amendment No. 2, the CBOE proposes to require that the Exchange distribute a circular to the membership providing guidance regarding member firm compliance responsibilities (including suitability recommendations and account approval) when handling transactions in contingent value rights. See Letter from Michael Meyer, Schiff Hardin & Waite, to Brad Ritter, Senior Counsel, Office of Market Supervision, Division of Market Regulation, Commission, dated September 29, 1994 (``Amendment No. 2''). II. Description of the Proposal Pursuant to CBOE Rule 31.5.F, the Exchange may approve for listing securities which can not be readily categorized under the listing criteria for common and preferred stocks, bonds, debentures, warrants, or unit investment trusts. The CBOE is now proposing to: (1) Amend Rule 31.5.F to decrease the minimum aggregate market value of such securities to $4 million; 6 (2) add Rule 31.5.H to provide listing standards for contingent value rights (``CVRs''); (3) add Rule 31.5.I to provide listing standards for equity-linked term notes (``ELNs''); and (4) add Rule 31.5.J to provide listing standards for paired securities. 6 See Amendment No. 1, supra note 4.
