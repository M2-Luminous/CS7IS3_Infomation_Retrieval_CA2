FBIS4-1862 "drchi064__s94003" FBIS-CHI-94-064-S Daily Report 25 Feb 1994 REGIONAL WORK REPORTS Heilongjiang Government Work Report Heilongjiang Government Work Report SK0903030894 Harbin HEILONGJIANG RIBAO in Chinese 25 Feb 94 p 2 SK0903030894 Harbin HEILONGJIANG RIBAO Chinese BFN ["Excerpts" of Heilongjiang provincial government work report delivered by Governor Shao Qihui at the second session of the eighth provincial people's congress on 24 February] [Text]Review of 1993 Work Under the leadership of the provincial party committee, the people of the province thoroughly implemented the guidelines of the 14th national party congress and Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important speeches, further emancipated the mind, had courage in practice, and worked in a down-to-earth manner, with the focus on establishing the socialist market economy system and comprehensively promoting socialist modernization, in the past year. The work tasks for 1993 approved at the first session of the eighth provincial people's congress were by and large accomplished, and great achievements were won in reform and development. The national economy developed in a sustained and stable manner. Despite contradictions in systems and structures, which had yet to be resolved, and the rather serious restrictions imposed by the bottlenecks, such as funds and transportation, we managed to maintain a fairly high growth rate in Heilongjiang's economy thanks to the efforts to rely on reform and opening up, strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control, and overcome numerous difficulties. The gross domestic product totaled 102.8 billion yuan, up 4.9 percent from the preceding year in terms of comparable prices. Industrial production rose steadily, and its economic efficiency improved notably. The annual industrial output value totaled 131.6 billion yuan, up 6.2 percent in terms of comparable prices. Proceeding from strengthening the position of agriculture as the foundation and protecting and boosting peasants' enthusiasm, we made conscientious efforts to correct the irrational burdens (totaling 360 million yuan or 20.8 yuan per capita) on peasants when doing rural work, made active efforts to eliminate "IOUs," increased money, science, and technology input, facilitated the "four aspects of integrated management," and thus promoted rural economic development. Agricultural output value totaled 33 billion yuan, up 2.3 percent. Grain output attained a new height to reach 23.91 million tonnes. Animal husbandry developed in a sustained and balanced manner, and the proportion of its output value to the total agricultural output value rose to about 25 percent. An unprecedented good situation emerged in township enterprises, which registered a growth rate of 53.1 percent, increased their output value to a level that accounted for 60 percent of the agricultural output value, and were becoming the major force of the rural economy. Key construction and technical transformation were accelerated, and investment of the entire society in fixed assets totaled 32.15 billion yuan, up 36.4 percent. Urban and rural markets remained thriving, with the total volume of retail sales increasing by 12.3 percent over the preceding year. Revenues rose steadily, and the financial order improved. We quickened the steps toward the socialist market economy system. Enterprise reform focusing on enforcing the "regulations on transforming the operating mechanism of the enterprises owned by the whole people" and Heilongjiang's "detailed regulations for implementation" made significant headway. Enterprises' decision- making power was implemented gradually, and, in particular, reform of the property right system began to take a big step forward. Especially after the third plenary session of the 14th party Central Committee, we formulated and put into effect a series of major reform measures in line with the guidelines of the "decision" and the national economic work conference, which would notably accelerate our transition from the planned economy system to the socialist market economy system. A good development trend continued in opening to the outside world. Further developing the advantages presented by the opening of border areas, we made active efforts to promote the strategic escalation of opening to the outside world, emphasized the building of the large passageway for international trade, implemented the strategies of winning with quality and diversifying the market, and made persistent efforts to push large and medium-sized enterprises to the major battleground of foreign economic relations and trade. Heilongjiang's total imports and exports came to $3.06 billion, up 6.2 percent from the preceding year. All-round progress was made in various social undertakings. With economic construction as the central link, development of the economy and society was coordinated. Thanks to the profound implementation of the strategic principle of "invigorating the province through science and technology," more sciences and technologies took root in the economy, more scientists and technicians plunged into the main battlefield of economic construction, and more scientific and technological research achievements were translated into practical productive forces. Adhering to the principle of "taking a two-handed approach and being tough with both hands," we went all out to build the socialist spiritual civilization. The cultural front presented a group of fine cultural works that mainly reflected practical lives. Harbin city successfully obtained the right to host the Third Winter Asian Games. Great results were achieved in public health, sports, family planning, press and publication, broadcasting and television, environmental protection, and the work of nationality, civil administration, overseas Chinese affairs, and foreign affairs. Living standards of urban and rural residents continued to improve. Deducting the factors of price rises, the per capita annual income of urban residents available for living expenses increased by 5.2 percent over the previous year, and the per capita net income of rural residents increased by 2.1 percent. Savings deposits of urban and rural residents at the end of 1993 increased by 10.68 billion yuan, up by 22.6 percent. Urban and rural construction was accelerated, and public facilities improved somewhat. The per capita housing area of urban residents was 6.4 square meters, 0.2 square meters more than in the previous year. The per capita housing area of rural residents was 14.53 square meters. Construction of democracy, the legal system, and administrative honesty was strengthened. Governments at all levels conscientiously executed the resolutions of people's congresses and their standing committees, attached full importance on the role of the organizations of Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC], democratic parties, people's groups, and various circles in society in conducting political consultation and democratic supervision, earnestly received the letters and visits from the masses, and handled 178 proposals from people's deputies and 373 motions from the CPPCC organizations. Remarkable improvement was made in drawing up and enforcing administrative laws and in supervising law enforcement. In line with the arrangements of the central authorities and the provincial party committee, we positively and conscientiously launched the anticorruption campaign among government departments. In the past year, many difficulties and problems remained to the province's economic and social lives. Deep-rooted contradictions in systems and structures were not resolved effectively, overall economic efficiency was not good enough, restrictions to economic activities remained very serious, the margin of price hikes was on the high side, the people's living standards improved slowly, the number of enterprises with difficulties increased, some city and county organizations as well as some schools had difficulties in paying wages or salaries, and there unstable factors in society increased relatively. Principles and Objectives for 1994's Provincial Economic and Social Development The principles for the 1994 work of the province are: Under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, we should profoundly implement the guidelines of the 14th party congress and the third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, accelerate the building of the socialist market economic structure and the modernization drive, vigorously readjust economic structure and improve economic efficiency, safeguard political stability, and promote the all-round progress of society. In line with this principle, the province's major targets for economic and social development in 1994 are as follows: The gross domestic product will show a 6 percent increase over 1993. The total industrial output value will show an about 5 percent increase over 1993. The total agricultural output value will show an about 4 percent increase over 1993. The investment made in the fixed assets of society as a whole will show a 20 percent increase over 1993. The increased scale of social retail prices will be controlled at about 10 percent. The rate of natural population growth will be controlled under 12 per 1,000. In order to totally overfulfill the tasks and targets of economic and social development in 1994, we must pay attention to grasping the following points in ideology and work: First, in developing the economy, we must proceed from the province's reality. Comrade Deng Xiaoping stressed: "Development represents an essential criterion" and "the final resolution of problems should also depend on economic development." Particularly, in view of the province, we must make efforts to bring about a change to the slow development and to strive to achieve a faster growth. We will face many favorable conditions for accelerating development in 1994. However, we should also fully note that if we fail to fundamentally deal with the systematic and structural contradictions, such as the long-standing adversity cropping up in the structure of industries focused on basic production and natural resources, the large amount of losses of economic results caused by the systems of highly mandatory plans and the tortuous changes of prices, the high demands of investments, the high cost of production, the weak capability of self accumulation, and the low level of inputs, as well as the restriction imposed on by the bottleneck of funds and transportation, will continue to adversely affect the province's economic development. Based on stabilizing the increase at present, we can only exploit strong points and avoid shortcomings; readjust the structure; and gradually provide conditions for achieving fast development in the coming few years. Second, the way and hope to dealing with the problems cropping up in the province's economic development lie on deepening the reform. The state has issued major and important measures this year for the fields of finance and taxes, banking, planning, investment, foreign trade, and the reform of state-owned enterprises. We should organize the departments concerned to carefully enforce them. According to the target of establishing the systems of socialist market economy, many reform measures are beginning to be enforced this year. As soon as these measures begin, we should do a good job in grasping the direction and concentrate our efforts on formulating new systems and mechanism. Efforts should be made to enhance the follow-up analysis over the reform progress and to discover or resolve the prominent problems cropping up along the advancing road. A good job should be done in conducting the harmony, coordination, and improvement of reforms. In making arrangements for the economic work, we should create a more relaxed environment for reforms so as to ensure their smoother progress. Third, safeguarding and maintaining social stability represents an overriding task. Without a stable social environment, we are in no position to do everything. Localities and departments whose stability situation is more serious should spend some time and concentrate their efforts on vigorously grasping the work of safeguarding stability as well as sacrifice a little the development rate and adequately slow down the pace of reforms. Fourth, we should uphold the principle of "building the two civilizations simultaneously and scoring achievements in both of them." We should constantly grasp material civilization on one hand and spiritual civilization on the other, grasp economic construction on one hand and struggle against corruptions on the other, and grasp construction on one hand and legal systems on the other. Develop Rural Economy in an All-Round Manner, With the Focus on Increasing Peasants' Income Maintaining the stability and development of the rural economy constitutes an important foundation for ensuring Heilongjiang's economic and social stability, and agriculture should be put unfailingly in the first place of economic work. We should deepen the rural reform. The original farmland contracts should be extended another 30 years without change when they expire. Paid transfer of land use right according to the law should be permitted, and the optimal-scale operation based on household contracted operation should be developed. Rural socialized service system should be improved continuously. We should accelerate rural market construction and guide peasants to enter the field of commodity distribution. In line with state arrangements, we should continue to maintain the contracted grain purchasing quota and properly raise the grain purchasing price when new grain begins to be marketed this year. We should establish the grain risk fund and further improve the grain reserve and marketing systems. Guided by the market, we should lead peasants to adjust the production setup and product mix of their own accord so that agriculture will develop along the direction of high yields, good quality, and high efficiency. The areas planted to different crops should be properly arranged, and the emphasis should be on development of the advantageous strains needed by the market and the products of high commercial rate and capable of earning plenty of foreign exchange. We should intensify construction of capital farmland water conservancy facilities and do a good job in afforestation. To facilitate sustained and stable agricultural development, we should continue to increase financial allocations, credit, and peasants' investment to agriculture. We should carry out the "leap-over project" of township enterprises. The output value of Heilongjiang's township enterprises should reach 50 billion yuan this year, up more than 50 percent from last year. The cooperative shareholding system should become the major way of township enterprises' reform and development, and cooperative shareholding enterprises established with the funds pooled by peasants, who either participate in their management or not, should be greatly developed. Township enterprises should do a good job in cooperation with coastal areas, scientific research units, colleges and universities, and large enterprises. We should strive to increase the investment in township enterprises and, by pooling funds, inviting investment, and increasing bank loans, increase the investment to 2 billion yuan this year. We should give particular attention to the construction of small township industrial zones and develop the large areas with the concentration of these zones. We should coordinate the construction of these small zones with the construction of small cities and towns. Experiment should be conducted with the reform of the household registration system in small cities and towns, and peasants should be encouraged to invest in establishing enterprises in the small industrial zones. We should do a better job in building the bank of township enterprises' projects, actively bring in and train personnel, disseminate new technology, develop new products, and guide township enterprises to increase the scale and raise the level. We should replenish and strengthen city, county, and township leadership force in charge of township enterprises and organize the departments, enterprises, and institutions at and above the county level and some units directly under the central and provincial authorities to support and help township enterprises. We should strive to attain one year ahead of schedule the target of doubling the output value of township enterprises. We should make unremitting efforts to reduce the burdens on peasants. Fees and charges collected from peasants should be put under strict control in line with relevant laws and regulations of the state and the province. Departments directly under the province and governments at and below the city or prefectural level have no authority to stipulate the items of fees and charges to be collected from peasants. We should strengthen management of collective finance and keep the percentage of township unified accumulation and village retention within 5 percent of local peasants' net annual income of the previous year. Combine Reform With Renovation, and Successfully Run State-Owned Enterprises, With Large and Medium-sized Enterprises as the Mainstay Heilongjiang is a province with more large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, and thus it must regard the successful operation of state-owned enterprises, with large and medium-sized ones as the mainstay, as the most important task of deepening reform and accelerating development. To successfully run state-owned enterprises, with large and medium-sized ones as the mainstay, the most essential work is to deepen reform, accelerate renovation, and organically combine the two. Enterprise reform should be pressed forward positively and steadily in line with the decision adopted by the third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee on transforming the operational mechanisms of enterprises and establishing the modern enterprise system. At present, we should continue to conscientiously implement the "enterprise law," the "corporate law," the "regulations," and the "detailed rules" in order to truly delegate various decision-making powers to enterprises. We should rapidly establish the modern enterprise system, with emphasis on reforming the property rights of state-owned enterprises. Within this year, we should choose 50 enterprises of different trades to try out the modern enterprise system and then the system should be spread to all fields to accumulate experiences. On the basis of standardizing existing shareholding enterprises, with emphasis on establishing the corporate system, we should make great efforts to explore the organizational forms concerning the property composition of state-owned enterprises, should vigorously develop the limited liability corporations whose shares are purchased by legal entities, and should spread in a planned manner the experiments for establishing the limited corporations wholly owned by the state. The 150 state-owned enterprises that have conditions, large and medium-sized industrial enterprises in particular, should be rebuilt or be newly built into limited-liability corporations. Some large and medium-sized enterprises that are of no hope to halt deficits should be chosen to try out the bankruptcy system according to law. In the course of consolidating and perfecting existing enterprise groups, by combining the voluntary participation of enterprises with the guidance of government, we should again organize several enterprise groups of different categories that have industrial or product advantages, with key enterprises as the head. Through such major forms as the shareholding cooperative system, the management based on leasing, and the selling of property rights, we should make great efforts to completely fulfill the task of reforming property rights of small state-owned enterprises in this and the next years. To ensure the success in reforming the system concerning the property right of enterprises and to effect an innovation of the enterprise system, we must make an inventory of and check the stockpiles and capital of enterprises, actually reduce the burdens of enterprises, and accelerate the establishment of the social security system. Technological transformation is as important as enterprise reform, and they complement each other. So far as Heilongjiang, in which enterprises are seriously aging, is concerned, it is an urgent task to energetically promote the technological transformation of enterprises. Currently, fund shortage is the key problem hampering the technological transformation of enterprises. We must seek the way out by deepening reform and expanding the scale of opening up. With the key technological transformation projects as the backer, we should spread the shareholding system and collect funds from enterprise workers and staff members and the from society. The "grafting" renovation of enterprises should be carried out on a large scale to attract foreign funds. We should strengthen the self-renovation capacity of enterprises through the method of accelerating depreciation. In the course of running well large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, we should pay high attention to resolving the difficulties and problems facing the state-owned enterprises of counties. Unfailingly Build Key Projects, Readjust Economic Structure, and Form New Economic Growth Points To extricate Heilongjiang's economy from slow growth and weak momentum, we must pay attention to building a group of key capital construction and technological transformation projects with high starting points in technology, wide connections with industries, strong competitiveness in the market, and good economic efficiency. In addition, we must make great efforts to cultivate the pillar industries that greatly affect Heilongjiang's economy. We should concentrate energy on grasping the construction of key projects. It is necessary to accelerate the development of five key pillar industries and 10 key projects as defined by the provincial party committee. The completion and operation of these projects will greatly upgrade the province's economic development speed, efficiency, and reserve strength. In the forms of striving for loans and stocks, we should concentrate financial and material resources to vigorously and rapidly promote economic development. It is necessary to deepen investment and inter-regional capital movement systems and to intensify the investment restriction mechanism. It is necessary to intensify the development and scientific management of projects; set up a warehouse of projects, including on-going projects and reserve projects; and make positive efforts to strive for new projects. The readjustment of the economic structure should be accelerated, and new growth points for the economy should positively be cultivated. It is impossible to set up the socialist market economic system and to register a faster economic growth rate under the unitary ownership system and the unitary economic structure. Therefore, we should vigorously develop the tertiary industry; continue to develop transportation, postal and telecommunications, scientific and technological, and educational industries; and accelerate the development of circulation, financial, insurance, tourist, real estate, information consultation, and intermediate service trades. It is necessary to boldly give free rein to the development of individual and private sectors of the economy and the three types of foreign-funded enterprises and to bring into full play the potentials of various sectors of the economy. It is necessary to implement the provincial party committee and government's "regulations on several issues related to the private and individual sectors of the economy." The state-owned enterprises and enterprises with other forms of ownership are encouraged to make mutual investments and to become shareholders. It is necessary to develop the economy of various sectors where property rights are clearly defined. This year, as well as in the foreseeable future, we should regard the intensive and precision processing of farm and sideline products as a new economic growth point, prominently attend to it, and regard it as a priority of the provincial government and the governments at various levels. We should regard dairy products, grain processing, forage, sugar refinery, foodstuffs, wooden goods, flax products, and medical trade as leading trades; come up with a unified plan; attain serialized development; and accelerate the pace of development. It is necessary to implement the provincial party committee and the provincial government's decision on "making trade, industry, and agriculture a coordinated process;" positively organize and guide industrial and trade enterprises; and organize a production- processing-circulation community in the forms of contract, stock cooperation, and economic assistance. In line with the precision and intensive processing of farm, forestry, and livestock products, we should conduct technological transformation among production enterprises and go all out to develop new products. Through efforts in the next few years, we should make the processing industries with farm and sideline products as raw materials become a key force to affect the province's economic development. Positively Pioneer Domestic and Foreign Markets and Promote the Opening of the Province to All Directions Regarding foreign economic relations and trade, we should take the deepening of the reform of the foreign trade system and the unification of exchange rates as a favorable opportunity; continue to upgrade the strategy of opening to the outside world; gradually develop the opening of the province along higher layers, wider spheres, and deep ranges; and further enhance the functions for affecting the overall economy. In the course of opening to the outside world, we should regard the import of capital and technology as an extremely important task. As for the contracts and agreements of intention on conducting technological transformation with foreign capital as signed by the provincial government on the two overseas business invitation events, we should clearly define responsibilities and pay firm attention to the fulfillment of these contracts and agreements. Continuously in line with the economic construction priorities, we should invite businessmen, bring in capital, and expand inter- regional capital circulation channels in a well-planned manner and through various channels. Large and medium-sized enterprises are of main bodies in the opening up and we should accelerate the pace of encouraging these enterprises to enter international markets. Efforts should be made to uphold the direction of unifying the policies, carrying out open management and operation, enforcing equal competition, adopting the responsibility system for both profits and losses, conducting integration between industries and trade, and promoting the system of acting as agent. We should also accelerate the reform in the systems of foreign economic relations and trade and open in an orderly manner the import and export businesses to the outside world. Efforts should be made to strive to delegate more self- determination rights of imports and exports to large and medium- sized enterprises and to delegate the cash trading right to border trading enterprises as well as to encourage or support large and medium-sized enterprises to carry out transnational business in foreign countries and to have their products enter international markets. The province will sponsor the fifth Harbin border and local economic talks this year and the Asian Winter Games in 1996. By regarding the sponsorship and arrangements for the talks and games as a turning point, we should further improve the investment environment and broaden the province's influence in the world. Markets for the province's products at present are chiefly within the country. Therefore, while actively opening foreign markets, it is imperative to intensively have the domestic markets of the province's products achieve development. Efforts should be made to broaden the marketing rate of local products and particularly of famous-trade-mark ones. We should accelerate the development of markets for various commodities. A good job should be continuously done in perfecting the markets for the products of north China's timber, petrochemical industries in Daqing city, the province's machine-building and electric industries, light industries, and of dairy farms, as well as in improving the operation of these markets. We should concentrate our efforts on developing or fostering the markets of essential factors of production and take a new step in developing the markets of funds, labor forces, technologies, information, real estate, and property rights. Deeply Enforce the Strategic Principle of "Having Science and Education Make the Province Prosperous," Upgrade in an Overall Way the Province's Economic Quality A good job should be done in implementing or promoting the "overall plan for the medium stage of having 'science and education make the province prosperous'". By regarding the thorough reform in the systems of the economy, science and technology, and education as a main aspect in the strategy, as well as the vigorous development of high-and-new-tech industries and relying on science and technology to achieve extra development of township enterprises as two flanks, we should conduct integration between promoting the strategy as a whole and making a breakthrough in the key aspects of the strategy and concentrate the forces of various circles to enforce in an organized and planned manner some key projects and items that are exerting influence as well as should establish some demonstration zones in this regard. We should give priority to having science and education make industries prosperous and deepen the enforcement of having science and education make agriculture prosperous. Efforts should be made to increase the input in science, technology, and education at multiple levels and through multiple channels and to reinforce the strength of supporting the strategy of having science and technology make the province prosperous. We should adopt realistic measures to promote the scientific and technological progress. Efforts should be made to accelerate the development of high and new technologies and of industries of these technologies. A good job should be done in further improving the management over the development zones of high-and-new-tech industries in Harbin and Daqing. Cities and prefectures that have conditions in development may establish their high and new technical parks and their large and medium-sized enterprises may establish their high and new technical corners. Efforts should be made to accelerate the pace of turning the scientific and technical results into practical productive forces. In line with the principle of applying the advanced technologies to equipping various industries and trades in the national economy, we should emphatically deal with the pressing problems cropping up in developing agriculture with high yield, fine quality, and high benefits; conducting the technical renovations of enterprises; turning the military industrial technologies into civilian industrial ones; and in assimilating and creating something new in the imported foreign advanced technologies. We should support or encourage the scientific research units to coordinate with enterprises in conducting technical development and guide the state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises to gradually become the main bodies of scientific and technological development. We should also encourage or support individuals to operate the institutions of scientific and technological research, vigorously foster technical markets, develop technical intermediary organizations, and realistically protect the intellectual property rights. We should continue to put education in a strategic position for development on a priority basis. Both reform and development depend on improvement of the quality of all our people. Governments at all levels should conscientiously implement the "outlines of China's educational reform and development" and the "PRC teachers law," accelerate educational development and reform of the education system, and raise the quality of education and the efficiency of running schools. We should intensify elementary education and greatly develop vocational and technical education and adult education. We should encourage pooling of funds from all quarters of society to run schools and establishment of nongovernmental schools. We should deepen rural and urban overall educational reform and facilitate the overall planning and integration of "agriculture, science, and education" and "economy, science, and education." We should optimize the structure of higher education and particularly develop a number of disciplines urgently needed in Heilongjiang's economic construction. We should fully develop the scientific and technological, intellectual, and technical advantages of schools of higher learning and secondary specialized schools. We should step up efforts to improve the contingents of teachers. We should attach importance to and achieve success in the work related to trained personnel. We should do a better job in enforcing the provincial party committee and government's "several policy regulations on fully developing the functions of intellectuals to promote economic development" and establish a good practice of respecting knowledge and respecting trained personnel throughout society. We should make continuous efforts to improve the conditions for the work, study, and life of intellectuals. Intellectuals with outstanding contributions should be generously awarded. We should achieve success in stabilizing trained personnel and attract trained personnel from foreign countries and from outside the province with preferential policies. Persistently Pay Attention to Building the Socialist Spiritual Civilization and Facilitate Comprehensive Progress in Social Undertakings We should greatly facilitate building of the socialist spiritual civilization. Guided by Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line and firmly focusing on economic construction, which is the central task, we should advocate the major melody of this era and intensify the education on patriotism, collectivism, and socialism. We should conscientiously implement the principle that the "important aspect of the spiritual civilization is in building," carry out the activities to build civilized units in a down-to-earth manner, and provide spiritual impetus and intellectual support to establishment of the socialist market economy system. We should intensify the education on professional ethics, social morality, and family virtues, promote improvement of social conduct, and greatly upgrade people's ideology and morality and social morality. We should strive to develop culture, press and publication, radio and television broadcasting, public healthy, sports, and science and technology. In doing cultural work, we should continue the orientation of making literature and art serve the people and serve socialism and the principle of "letting a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend," put improvement of social benefits in the first place, and strive to achieve unity between social benefits and economic efficiency. We should deepen the reform of the cultural system, make literary and art creation flourish, step up efforts to achieve progress in grass-roots culture, manage well the cultural market, and resolutely ban pornographic books and audio and video products and illegal publication. In press and publication work, we should comprehensively raise the quality of newspapers, magazines, pictures, books, and audio and video products in compliance with the demand for "upholding the orientation, managing according to law, deepening reform, and promoting development." In radio and television work, we should continue to develop the spirit of solid work characterized by the endeavor "to become the best and the leader" and raise the quality and effective coverage of Heilongjiang's radio and television programs. Press and propaganda work should be aimed at meticulously propagating the guidelines of the third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, the current economic situation of the province, and the achievements in reform and construction. Press and propaganda work should be oriented to correct guidance of the media. Social sciences units should take an active part in the practice of reform, opening up, and economic development and strengthen research and explorations for invigorating Heilongjiang's economy. Public health work should be focused on deepening the reform of operational mechanism of medical and health care units and on improving the quality of medical service. Emphasis should be placed on building the village-level hospitals in rural areas and spreading the primary health care service. Good preparations should be made for the Third Winter Asian Games, and the hosting of the games should be regarded as the major event of the province. We should give wide publicity to the games among the people to enhance their sense of participation and the sense of playing the host. We should go all out to make preparations for the games. Family planning, protection of cultivated land, and environmental protection constitute the basic policy of China. We should simultaneously grasp materials production and family planning and truly carry out the system of population quota responsibility. We should actually protect cultivated land and pay equal attention to management of resources and assets. Good Arrangements Should be Made for the Lives of the People To Promote and Ensure Social Stability On the basis of developing the economy, we should make great efforts to increase the actual income of urban and rural residents and improve the living standards and living quality of the people. Attention should be paid to resolving the people's difficulties in clothing, food, housing, transportation, attending kindergartens and schools, and medical treatment. Efforts should be made to increase various kinds of service, cultural, and recreational facilities and to enhance the level of urban management with a view to providing convenience for the people. We should positively and appropriately press forward the pricing reform and resolutely control the hiking margin of the general level of commodity prices. We should further rationalize the relations among prices, successfully grasp the dynamics of the overall control over prices, carry out the declaration system for the record for the prices of daily necessities and service charges, strengthen guidance to and coordination of the prices of such daily necessities as grain, cooking oil, port, eggs, and vegetable. We should build well foodstuff bases and vegetable bases to enrich the people's "vegetable baskets." We should show concern over the weal and woe of the people in poor areas, vigorously promote the reform of housing system, actively press forward the reform of social security system, and further strengthen the comprehensive management of public security. We should pay attention to the work related to nationalities, religion, overseas Chinese affairs, and foreign affairs. We should vigorously build the political power at the grass-roots level, reinforce the unity between the army and the government and between the army and the people, and mobilize the positive factors in all fields. Transform the Government Functions and Further Improve the Style of Work We should actively and appropriately accelerate the reform of government organizations. This year, we should fulfill the task on reforming the organs directly under the provincial authorities, and successfully try out the reform of the organs at the county and township levels. The public service system should be popularized among state administrative organs. In organizational reform, we should attend to transforming the government functions. We should establish and improve the provincial-level regulating and control system compatible with the market economy and meticulously organize implementation of the major reform of the planning and investment systems, financial and tax systems, and banking system. We should meet the needs of the market economy system, give play to the macroeconomic, strategic, and policy functions of plans, and intensify the research and formulation of long- and medium-term economic and social development plans, annual plans, and industrial policies. We should strengthen the tracing, analysis, supervision, examination, balancing, and coordination of economic operation to improve the overall environment for economic activities. In line with the principle of "making the grass-roots level prosper first before making the province prosper," we should apply the tax assignment system to the provincial financial system and strive to enable all quarters to gain benefits and increase vitality in the process of economic development on the premise that continuous enhancement of the state's financial resources is ensured. We should implement the state's monetary system and cultivate and improve the money markets. Government departments at all levels should greatly advocate the practice of study, the practice of seeking truth from facts, and the practice of investigation and study. Study and mastery of the theories on the socialist market economy is an urgent task for us. We should create provincewide a vigorous atmosphere for the earnest study of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping," the "decision" of the third plenary session of the 14th party Central Committee, and the basic knowledge on the market economy. We should conscientiously improve work styles and leadership methods, study more, attend fewer parties, conduct more investigation and study, avoid subjectivism, renounce empty talk in favor of practical work, learn about the masses' desires and demands in a timely and accurate manner, and promote all work in a positive, steady, and down-to- earth manner. Strictly managing government affairs and making unremitting efforts to build a clean government constitute a basic task to build political power and also an important guarantee for the smooth promotion of reform and development. We should continue to carry out the three tasks of the anticorruption struggle put forward by the party Central Committee, do a better job in maintaining the honesty and self-discipline of leading cadres, resolutely oppose and guard against unhealthy trends, conscientiously investigate and handle major and serious cases, strictly investigate and handle the cases on serious bureaucracy and dereliction of duty, which have caused great losses to the state, and conscientiously address the important issues that seriously affect the government-populace ties and social development. We should strengthen democracy and the legal system. The provincial government will designate some dates to receive people's deputies and special telephone lines to establish ties with them in order to listen to and handle their criticisms and suggestions. We will take the initiative in strengthening ties with the CPPCC, democratic parties, and people's organizations and attach full importance to their functions of political consultation and democratic supervision. We will establish and improve the democratic and scientific policy-making systems, attach importance to and develop the role of research and consulting institutions and experts, and promote democratic politics. Governments at all levels must learn to apply the legal means to manage the economy and society.
