FBIS4-29948 "dreas120__a94012" FBIS-EAS-94-120-A Daily Report 14 Jun 1994 ANNEX Japan NTT Consortium To Place Indonesian Telecom Bid NTT Consortium To Place Indonesian Telecom Bid 942A0344A Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 14 Jun 94 p 13--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942A0344A Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese CSO [Text] Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT), Sumitomo Corporation, Itohchu, and two Indonesian firms will form a consortium to place a bid in the international bidding process for Indonesian telecommunications projects. The project will involve the installation of 2 million circuits and the minimum investment value is expected to be $2 billion. The project will be handled under the build, operate, and transfer (BOT) format involving the construction of facilities, recovery of costs after operating the system for a given period, and transfer of the system to local personnel. The three Japanese firms have reached the assessment that the telecommunications market in Indonesia will expand rapidly along with economic growth and hope to participate in such prospects. NTT has been designated a domestic telecommunications operator, but it has stated that it will not be subject to regulation in connection with the proposed projects because it is limited to the Indonesian domestic market. The three Japanese firms including NTT will form a five-firm consortium with an Indonesian corporate giant called Salim Group and one more local firm, which plans to submit papers to the Indonesian Government at the end of June to qualify for the bidding process. The qualifications screening process will designate about 10 qualifying consortia, which will be asked to submit formal bids. Results of the bidding process will be announced at the end of the year or in early 1995. It appears the Indonesian Government will divide the area to be covered by the new system into four or five areas, each to be handled by a separate group designated to handle a maximum of 500,000 circuits. Under the five-year telecommunications construction program, a total of 5 million new circuits are to be installed, but it was decided that the Indonesian National Telephone Company would not be able to handle the entire project, leading to the decision to subject 2 million circuits to bidding by foreign firms. Under the BOT format, consortia with winning bids handle the planning, construction, management, and maintenance of installed systems. Since the new projects will make partial use of existing telecommunications networks, consortia with winning bids will split revenue, such as that for telephone calls, with the Indonesian National Telephone Company. The share for the consortia will be 70 percent. It appears that European and U.S. telecommunications firms will submit bids, but it is expected that Japanese-affiliated consortia are favored to win bids. The reasons for such an outlook are that Japanese-made switching systems are widely used and Japan commands a technical advantage, while the Indonesian Government is expected to seek funds from the Japan Export-Import Bank in the form of loans to install telecommunications circuits.
