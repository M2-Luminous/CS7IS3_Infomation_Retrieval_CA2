Under this tendency, foreign banks' traditional practice of getting involved in the mainland's lending activities is expected to face a challenge. Wu Lien-feng, deputy general manager of the Nanyang Commercial Bank, informed this reporter: In the past, on the mainland under the planned economic structure, shortterm commercial loans from outside the borders were guaranteed by specialized state banks, and foreign banks also used to accept loans of this form. Nevertheless, in recent months this traditional pattern has been gradually broken. Basing his statements on analysis, he said: China has increasingly come to realize that financial structural reform is the "dragon head" of transition to a market economy, and in the second half of last year, it was determined to carry out reform as quickly as possible. The most eye-catching move was to transform the four major specialized banks from policy into commercial banks. To put in another way, the role of the four specialized banks in overseas policy loans as a guarantor will be gradually diluted so as to enable them to concentrate their resources on businesses as commercial banks. As a Hong Kong bank which was the earliest to set up a China internal business department and branches in the mainland's special economic zones, the Nanyang Commercial Bank has closely watched the relevant changes and adopted active measures to participate in the mainland's financial reform, such as readjusting its China business strategy and expanding the scope of operations. According to Mr. Wu, his bank took the lead in organizing a $40-million international syndicated loan with the China Ocean Shipping Company acting as a guarantor rather than borrowing from any financial institutions on the mainland. Moreover, the Nanyang Commercial Bank recently provided commercial loans worth millions of U.S. dollars to a car parts manufacturing plant in Guizhou Province. This was the first batch of commercial loans extended to the province by the Bank of China Group. In addition, according to statistics, although China was active for a while in extending syndicated loans to outside financial institutions in the second half of last year, the number of loans with specialized banks acting as a guarantor was very limited. They were mostly guaranteed by local financial institutions, such as the Guangdong Development Bank and the Pudong Development Bank. However, because the credibility ratings of local banks are relatively low and their financial strengths are not enough to cope with the huge market demands, some bankers are worried that the recent briskness will not last long and the lending activities of mainland enterprises outside the borders may be adversely affected. People in the industry pointed out: Although foreign banks universally adopt a careful approach toward the changes, many of them are also seeking a breakthrough and making active preparations, because from a long-term point of view, China's financial reform is conducive to absorbing foreign capital. Therefore, it would be better for them to become actively involved, promote the changes with good intentions, and expand their businesses while adapting themselves to the changed situation rather than looking on with folded arms and letting a golden opportunity slip by.
