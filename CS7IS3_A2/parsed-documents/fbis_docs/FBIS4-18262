Replying to reporters' questions in parliament today, the justice minister said that the allegations being made are aimed at undermining the regime. Circles that are opposed to the democratic regime, he said, come up with such allegations. Asked to comment on reports that ballot boxes and ballot slips were found in garbage dumps, the minister said that it is the High Election Council and the officials on duty during the elections that are accountable for that. The public prosecutors will investigate the allegations on this issue, he said, and the judiciary will do whatever is necessary.
