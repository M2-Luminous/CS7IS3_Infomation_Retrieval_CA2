The attack, launched both from the territory of Afghanistan, controlled by General Kozi Kobir's 55th Afghan Infantry Division, and from mojaheed positions in the rear of the Russian borderguards, lasted from 0800 to 1100. The enemy gun emplacements were smashed by Russian retaliatory blows. There were no casualties among Russian servicemen. The losses of the Tajik opposition have not been reported, ITAR-TASS learned today from military sources in Dushanbe. It was stressed in this connection that the irreconcilable Tajik opposition, entrenched in the northern provinces of Afghanistan, became active again from 15-17 May. Several of its attempts to break through the positions of the Moskovskiy and Pyanj borderguard detachments were thwarted. The redeployment of armed groups of militants, supporting the Islam movement for the revival of Tajikistan, from the Hunduz and Tahor provinces of Afghanistan to the Afghan part of Badakhshan is continuing. Some of the armed groups are being massed opposite the Shuroabad sector of the Tajik-Afghan border, near the positions of the Moskovskiy borderguard unit, and the others -- in the immediate proximity of the Pamir sector of the border. According to a trustworthy military source in Dushanbe, the purpose of these redeployments is to break through into districts, bordering on the Gorno-Badakhshan autonomous region of Tajikistan, in order to launch further operations against the government forces of the Republc. The source said that all these attempts were futile. The Russian borderguards and the national defence forces of the republic have taken additional effctive measures to strengthen the Tajik-Afghan border and the highland areas of the Republic adjoining it.
