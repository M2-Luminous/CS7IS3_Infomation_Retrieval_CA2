"We have been carrying out four or five raids each day in all those sectors where we believe there are presumed drug traffickers or subversives. What is happening is that now we have intensified them because the intelligence has improved," he added. According to the general, 11 raids were carried out in Cali yesterday, seven in Palmira, four in Buga, and some others in Popayan and adjoining areas. He added that in the course of these raids they have seized property, and vehicles, and have entered ranches and houses, but so far no individuals have been arrested. In Ciudad Jardin neighborhood, in southern Cali, in the past few days various raids have been carried out in which authorities found a building under construction which contained a jacuzzi, gymnasiums, a sauna, and other luxuries. The identity of the owners and the origin of the money invested in that building are a mystery, and the authorities decided to open an investigation to determine the identity of the owners. Other sources revealed that among the property seized are armor-plated vehicles, one of which belongs to Fernando Tello Dorronsoro, a Liberal member of the House of Representatives running for reelection in Valle. Spokespersons for the Prosecutor General's Office said that the vehicle was seized during the raid of a residence presumed to belong to former beauty queen Martha Lucia Echeverri. With regard to several media reports on Thursday night [24 Feb] that one of the operations was on the verge of capturing an important Cali Cartel leader, General Hernandez said it was false. In addition, he said that all of confiscated items as well as "important documents which were being analyzed" will be turned over to the Regional Prosecutor General's Office which is conducting the investigation. A Strike in Bogota In other news, a band of criminals which supposedly tried to sell information processing equipment to the Cali Cartel was dismantled last Thursday in Bogota by the Judicial and Investigative Police whose units captured four of the members.
