NORINCO is a wholly-owned subsidiary of China's defence ministry, which has a number of investments that have been transformed from military applications to manufacturing civilian products. None of the money raised will be used for military purposes. The closed-end fund is being placed to both local and European institutions and is due to list in Ireland next month. NORINCO will issue 16.5 million units at US$10.30 (about HK$79.50) each. H.G. Asia will act as arranger of the issue. The proceeds from the issue will be used for joint ventures under NORINCO. The corporation has a number of joint ventures and subsidiaries, mainly industrial projects, such as the manufacture of motorcycles and optical equipment. One of its subsidiaries, Jialing Motorcycle Plant based in Sichuan province, is a well-established motorcycle manufacturer on the mainland. Other industries include optical equipment manufacturing, with technology that was originally applied for military use, such as in the production of telescopes and glass for aircraft. NORINCO will be carrying out fund-raising exercises in phases. This is the initial phase, to raise US$170 million to invest in enterprises engaged in the manufacture of cars. A further fund-raising exercise is expected in the next couple of years. NORINCO, which is directly under the State Council, comprises 157 state-owned industrial enterprises with fixed assets of 60 billion yuan (about HK$52.8 billion). The corporation has been very active in car manufacturing and related industries. Last year, NORINCO signed a joint-venture agreement with Hong Kong-based financial services and investment company Pacific Group to set up car parts factories on the mainland. They comprise three plants in Changchun, northeast China, and eight in Chongqing, Sichuan province, which between them produce brakes, clutches, starters, transmissions, universal joints and other parts. Merchant bankers said that there had been many fund-raising activities by mainland companies in the last 12 months. These funds may attract overseas investors as the demand still exceeds supply. However, more Chinese enterprises are seeking funds to finance their development and expansion, and the Chinese Government placed controls on credit to curb inflation in the middle of last year. Given that it was almost impossible to borrow from banks, many borrowers had to pay very high interest rates of between 20 and 30 per cent to get short-term funds, he said. [as published] Apart from paying higher costs, however, these borrowers could only temporarily ease their cash crunch, he added. With more mainland enterprises seeking funds overseas, there will be a large number of China projects available on the market. "Investors tend to buy selectively on quality projects, so China concept stocks may not be guaranteed a warm reception now," he said. "The time spent on listing work is shorter and easier, and the listing costs are cheaper in Ireland," said a European fund manager. The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong requires companies to possess a three-year track record and a minimum market capitalisation of $50 million. There is a current proposal to raise capitalisation requirements to $400 million.
