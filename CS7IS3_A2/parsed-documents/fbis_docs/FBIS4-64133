"The president did not accept my resignation and I found it incorrect to insist further," he said in an interview with ITAR-TASS. Shakhray added that republics and other regions within the Russian Federation had sent many appeals to the president not to accept his resignation. Shakhray said he discussed with President Yeltsin different aspects of the regional policy, including the signing of the agreement with Kaliningrad, the regulation of relations with the Chechen Republic and a mechanism implementing the treaty with Tatarstan. Explaining his recent moves, including the announcement of his resignation, Shakhray referred to the breach of office ethics in dismissing him from the post of the minister of nationalities and regional policy. According to Shakhray, "it is not ethical to work on the president's team and announce one's disagreement with things. I do not want to repeat the behavior of some politicians". These were the motives behind his announced resignation. As concerns his relations with the newly appointed Minister Nikolay Yegorov, Shakhray said he would "help the new minister of nationalities and regional policy. I wished him well when introducing the man to the ministry collective. Now everything will depend on himself".
