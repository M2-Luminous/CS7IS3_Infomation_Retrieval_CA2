With reference to the possible participation of military contingents from CIS countries in the peace-keeping forces in Abkhazia he said that "it is possible only in the framework of documents signed on April 4." In comments on the talks on Abkhazia's political status which began in Geneva on Tuesday Ardzinba stressed that "there is no alternative to peace negotiations." According to him, when taking part in the negotiating process Abkhazia proceeds from the agreements signed in Moscow on April 4." "On the contrary, the Georgian side seems to have forgotten about it," the Abkhazian leader pointed out. As he said, the statement made on Georgian radio on Monday by the Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze, as to "the possibility of resolving the conflict militarily", cannot be understood in any other way. According to Ardzinba, this is "a gross violation of the documents signed in Moscow." On April 4 in Moscow the two sides signed a statement on ways to reach a political solution to the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict and an agreement on the voluntary return of refugees and displaced persons.
