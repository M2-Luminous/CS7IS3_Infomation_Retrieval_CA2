Gorazde correspondent Enes Musovic reports that "after yesterday's extremely dramatic day, the aggressor's artillery fire and infantry attacks abated somewhat overnight. However, information from the farthest points of Gorazde's outskirts confirms that fierce fighting for the still free Gorazde is yet to come. The chetniks have been regrouping their forces all night in the areas of Peljin, Potkozara, Priselje, Trebinjaca, Postaja, and Rogatica. The aggressor is continuously bringing in fresh manpower and deadly weaponry. Over 350 mortars and howitzers, 46 tanks, and a supporting tank battalion already encircle Gorazde, while the aggressor, undisturbed, in full view of the international community, continues to kill and torture the civilian population in Gorazde, destroy residential and industrial areas, torch (?schools), destroy bridges." Reporting from Bihac, correspondent Mirza Sadikovic says that "today marks the second month of the Serbian aggressor's fiercest offensive at the Bihac Commune. The offensive attacks, which began last night, continue this morning. Karadzic's terrorists used howitzers and tanks to shell Bihac [words indistinct]. They also intensified their artillery attacks at the defense lines on Grabez and the Grmusko-Srbljanski plateau." "The attacks of the paramilitary forces of the so-called Kladusa autonomy at the outskirts of Cazin have been going on all night and have continued this morning. The autonomists are attacking Hadzici and the wider areas of (?Krivaja) and (?Tajici) with 60-mm and 80-mm mortars, armor-piercing weapons, and antiaircraft weapons, while infantry provocations have been reported on all the other demarcation lines. It is evident that the chetniks and the autonomists continue to coordinate their attacks [words indistinct] at the wider area of (?Osmaka) on the Buzim part of the front."
