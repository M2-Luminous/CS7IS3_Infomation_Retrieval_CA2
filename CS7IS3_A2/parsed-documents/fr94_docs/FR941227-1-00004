FR941227-1-00004 FR941227-1-00001 The FAA recognizes the need for aircraft certification standards to keep pace with technological developments and a changing environment and, in 1986, initiated a high priority program to (1) determine and define electromagnetic energy levels; (2) develop guidance material for design, test, and analysis; and (3) prescribe and promulgate regulatory standards. The FAA participated with industry and airworthiness authorities of other countries to develop internationally recognized standards for certification. The FAA and airworthiness authorities of other countries have identified a level of HIRF environment that a helicopter could be exposed to during IFR operations. While the HIRF requirements are being finalized, the FAA is adopting a special condition for the certification of aircraft that employ electrical/electronic systems that perform critical functions. The accepted maximum energy levels that civilian helicopter system installations must withstand for safe operation are based on surveys and analysis of existing radio frequency emitters. This special condition will require the helicopters' electrical/electronic systems and associated wiring to be protected from these energy levels. These external threat levels are believed to represent the worst-case exposure for a helicopter operating under IFR. The HIRF environment specified in this proposed special condition is based on many critical assumptions. With the exception of takeoff and landing at an airport, one of these assumptions is the aircraft would be not less than 500 feet above ground level (AGL). Helicopters operating under visual flight rules (VFR) routinely operate at less than 500 feet AGL and perform takeoffs and landings at locations other than controlled airports. Therefore, it would be expected that the HIRF environment experienced by a helicopter operating VFR may exceed the defined environment by 100 percent or more. This special condition will require the systems that perform critical functions, as installed in the aircraft, to meet certain standards based on either a defined HIRF environment or a fixed value using laboratory tests. The applicant may demonstrate that the operation and operational capability of the installed electrical/electronic systems that perform critical functions are not adversely affected when the aircraft is exposed to the defined HIRF environment. The FAA has determined that the environment defined in Table 1 is acceptable for critical functions in helicopters operating at or above 500 feet AGL. For critical functions of helicopters operating at less than 500 feet AGL, additional factors must be considered. The applicant may also demonstrate by a laboratory test that the electrical/electronic systems that perform critical functions can withstand a peak electromagnetic field strength in a frequency range of 10 KH Z to 18 GH Z . If a laboratory test is used to show compliance with the defined HIRF environment, no credit will be given for signal attenuation due to installation. A level of 100 v/m and other considerations, such as an alternate technology backup that is immune to HIRF, are appropriate for critical functions during IFR operations. A level of 200 v/m and further considerations, such as an alternate technology backup that is immune to HIRF, are more appropriate for critical functions during VFR operations.
