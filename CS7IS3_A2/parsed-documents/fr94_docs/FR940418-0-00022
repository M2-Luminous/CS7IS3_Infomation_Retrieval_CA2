FR940418-0-00022 FR940418-0-00007 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On March 20, 1987, the Virgin Islands Department of Planning and Natural Resources (DPNR) submitted revisions to title 12, chapter 9, subchapters 204 and 206 of the Virgin Islands Code, effective January 15, 1987, to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for incorporation into the Virgin Islands Implementation Plan. Specific revisions to Subchapter 204 included the amending of sections 204&hyph;20 through 204&hyph;23, 204&hyph;25, 26, 28, 29 and the addition of new sections 204&hyph;33, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41 and 45. Specific revisions to subchapter 206 include amending and redesignating sections 206&hyph;23 through 206&hyph;30 as sections 206&hyph;24 through 206&hyph;31, and the addition of a new section 206&hyph;23. The DPNR held public hearings on these revisions in St. Thomas on September 8 and 9, 1986. On December 14, 1989 (54 FR 51303), EPA published a Federal Register notice proposing to approve all but one of the comprehensive revisions to the Virgin Islands' submittal. Specifically, EPA proposed to disapprove subsection 204&hyph;26(a)(2), which allowed a special 1.5 percent sulfur in residual fuel limit for Martin Marietta, now known as Virgin Islands Alumina Corporation. The December 14, 1989 Federal Register notice solicited comments on the revised regulations and EPA's proposed action in response to the revisions. No comments were received. EPA is approving the revised regulations as part of the Virgin Islands Implementation Plan except for the disapproval of subsection 204&hyph;26(a)(2) as it relates to Martin Marietta (VI Alumina Corporation). In subsection 204&hyph;26(a)(2) the maximum allowable sulfur content of distillate and residual oil expressed in percent by weight are now 0.3 and 0.5, respectively, for all of the Virgin Islands except for the special 1.5 percent sulfur content limit for residual fuel oil used by two specific sources (Hess Oil in St. Croix and Virgin Islands Water and Power Authority in St. Thomas). It should be noted that EPA also is taking action at this time to approve a control strategy demonstration for sulfur dioxide as it relates to the Virgin Islands Water and Power Authority (VIWAPA) plant in St. Croix, based on the attainment demonstration included in its Prevention of Significant Deterioration of Air Quality (PSD) permit application. EPA has received and approved the PSD permit attainment demonstration, which conforms to EPA's ``Guideline on Air Quality Models (Revised 1986).'' On December 28, 1992, EPA approved a PSD permit for four units at VIWAPA's north shore facility in St. Croix. A revised attainment demonstration required to be included in the permit application specified a 0.33 percent sulfur content limit in No. 6 residual fuel oil for the two existing boilers and a 0.2 percent sulfur content limit in No. 2 distillate fuel oil in the remaining units. Although a 0.5 percent sulfur content limit in residual fuel oil and a 0.3 percent sulfur content limit in distillate fuel oil for the VIWAPA plant in St. Croix are included in subsection 204&hyph;26(a)(2) and approved under this action, this limit has been superseded by the limits contained in VIWAPA's PSD permit. The PSD permit meets all applicable requirements of the PSD regulations codified in 40 CFR 52.21 and the Clean Air Act. On August 12, 1986 EPA sent a letter to the Governor of the Virgin Islands notifying him that the Virgin Island Implementation Plan was substantially inadequate to achieve and maintain the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for sulfur dioxide as it relates to VIWAPA's north shore facility in St. Croix. EPA's approval of the lower sulfur in fuel oil limitations included in the PSD permit for VIWAPA and the State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision rectify this inadequacy and is consistent with the Clean Air Act Amendments (Act), enacted on November 15, 1990, requirements of attaining and maintaining the NAAQS for sulfur dioxide. EPA also is approving section 204&hyph;28, which establishes new opacity limits for internal combustion engines, and section 204&hyph;37, which provides for the regulated use of waste fuel oils. These approvals are based on certain understandings which were described in EPA's proposal. Approval of section 204&hyph;25, which regulates sources of fugitive emissions, is based upon EPA's definition of the term ``fugitive emissions,'' since the existing and revised regulations did not include a definition of this term. EPA is approving subsections 204&hyph;40(e) and 206&hyph;25(c) where methods other than the Reference Methods contained in parts 60 and 61 of title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR) are used to demonstrate compliance. These subsections permit the Commissioner to approve alternate requirements in those instances where the source is unable to make use of the reference methods. They are intended to allow the Commissioner to respond to situations which were not envisioned when the specific requirements were adopted, yet insure that the source complies with the intent of the regulation. While EPA understands the need for such provisions, any changes which affect the SIP approved emission limits used to demonstrate attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS must be federally enforceable and, therefore, must be addressed through revisions to the SIP. EPA can only accept alternate requirements if these changes are approved by EPA. EPA also is revising the Table at 40 CFR 52.2773, ``EPA-approved Virgin Islands regulations,'' to reflect these newly adopted regulations. The Table previously referenced the date the regulation was submitted, but has now been changed to refer to the date when the regulation became effective. Sections 206&hyph;30 and 206&hyph;31 have been renumbered to Sections 206&hyph;31 and 206&hyph;32, respectively. EPA's previous determination concerning their approvability remains, along with the previous effective and approved dates. This SIP revision is intended to strengthen the Virgin Islands Implementation Plan, (especially with regard to sulfur dioxide and particulates), by incorporating revised and new regulations which are consistent with the Act as interpreted in current EPA guidance. Although this SIP revision was not intended to fulfill any specific provision of the Act, EPA is approving the revision under section 110 of the Act, because it serves to strengthen the Virgin Islands Implementation Plan and it is consistent with the Act's requirements for attaining and maintaining the NAAQS for sulfur dioxide and particulate matter. Conclusion EPA is approving a special 1.5 percent sulfur content limit for residual fuel oil used by two specific sources, however, EPA is disapproving this special limit for Martin Marietta, St. Croix (VI Alumina Corporation). Martin Marietta, St. Croix (VI Alumina Corporation) is required to burn the maximum allowable sulfur content of distillate and residual oil expressed in percent by weight of 0.3 and 0.5, respectively, in order to meet the PSD requirements specified in part C of the Act.
