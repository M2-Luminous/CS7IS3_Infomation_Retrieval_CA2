"There will be nuances, differences and contradictions, but I believe that as the pace of the national political debate picks up, as solutions and proposals are established, and as specific progress is made in the area of democracy, pressure will naturally decrease and we will make a direct contribution to the consolidation of peace." Camacho Solis admitted this issue "has been quite complex from the beginning because it linked national policy to issues of justice in Indian communities in Chiapas and the entire country." That is why "we had to merge agendas into one in which we made a specific proposal that referred solely to Chiapas and to two points of national policy." "The Chiapas issue has been linked and tied to the national political situation at all times. The political institutions have been responding with positive steps in this direction." By seeing matters in this light, "we are able to explain why, with great responsibility, the candidates to the Presidency of the republic and the political parties were able to sign the 27 January Peace, Justice, and Democracy Agreement, which reduced the pressure in Chiapas and continued the initiative to implement new changes." This thing, "call it the evolution of local and national aspects whereby national aspects are reactivated within the sphere under their control as part of the justification of the Chiapas conflict, is what will pave the way for a final solution to the problem," he affirmed. Interviewed by Jose Gutierrez Vivo on Radio Red, the peace commissioner said the Zapatists "are not asking for material things in exchange for not attacking the Army but, rather, for a new pact with the government." The EZLN "is offering this possibility to maintain a situation of calm, but we have to admit that as long as there is no commitment, accidents could occur, accidents that could complicate the negotiations." The peace commissioner expressed optimism regarding "a 10-day war and five months without any deaths," a war in which the Mexican Army and the EZLN "have kept their commitments and backed a political solution to the conflict without firing one single shot." Gutierrez asked Camacho if he accepted the opinions given by several sectors that he had failed in his mission to find peace. The commissioner said: "At this time, there is no other instance in the world in which a war has been interrupted so quickly and where a situation of nonaggression has prevailed for so long." "The first option, he explained, was to move from a belligerent situation; the second, to maintain the truce; and the third, which we have considered optimistically, to attain additional advances that would allow us to consolidate the truce." He admitted that "it is not foreseeable within the prevailing situation that the peace accords will be signed, but what is important are the events that occur." Based on those options, "we sent a letter to the president of the republic to report on the situation since it began, trying to describe with all clarity the ideology, that is, the origin, of the conflict and the options available to the Mexican Government in light of the decisions the EZLN could possibly make." "We have also prepared," he disclosed, "a letter to the EZLN requesting clear evidence of its nonbelligerence because this is what is really important, and I want to state here, with all clarity, that all the evidence and accounts I have requested from the EZLN in this respect were accepted, explicitly or tacitly, and, it seems to me, this is of utmost importance." Camacho said that "confronted with those events, the tendency of public opinion was to say nothing was being done. This is quite a sensitive issue because we are complying with our commitment." That is why, he added, "we have to make a clear-cut distinction in the EZLN communiques, between the political issues and their contents regarding security and military topics," because "concerning the national political issues, they present hard, even radical positions. I cannot complain, however, about their compliance with the promise of maintaining peace in Chiapas. In this regard, they have proceeded seriously and with responsibility." "Of course, this would have never been possible without the meetings with the president of the republic who allowed the dialogue to further harmony, and this led to the interruption of the war, greater calm in Chiapas, and the consolidation of the truce under the prevailing conditions up to now." Gutierrez asked if Mexicans are still threatened by this war and how will the situation be resolved completely. The peace commissioner replied: "The EZLN has explicitly declared it will not take any offensive actions, and this has a political value and is also significant because, logically, the Zapatists must justify their movements before national and international public opinion."
