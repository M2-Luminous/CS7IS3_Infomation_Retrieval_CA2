"Opening further to the outside world may help us raise the quality of our economy as a whole, and is the key to speeding up our modernization process," Zhao Zhihao, governor of the province, said. "Shandong will further improve its investment conditions and strive to hook up with the international economy," he states. The governor acknowledged that although Shandong has made rapid progress in the development of its export-oriented economy over the past few years it still lags behind some other coastal provinces. The province exported 5.9 billion U.S. dollars worth of goods last year, only one fourth of that for Guangdong, an economically-booming province bordering on Hong Kong, and about the same as Jiangsu and Fujian Provinces. "The latter might surpass us this year if we remain at the same pace of economic development," the governor said. The provincial government pledged to accelerate the development of markets, raise economic efficiency, adjust the industrial structure, and improve transport and telecommunications facilities. According to Song Fatang, deputy governor of the province, Shandong will carry out a package of reforms involving the shift of mechanism in large and medium-sized enterprises, banking, circulation, share-holding system and macro-control of the economy. It will encourage more enterprises to follow the international patterns in production and sell their products on the international market, while helping them to import advanced managerial expertise, technology and equipment, invite talented people to work in the province and absorb foreign capital. In addition, Shandong plans to employ the joint-stock system in its construction of capital projects to attract foreign investment. It will soak up more overseas capital for its capital projects by way of issuing bonds and stocks or borrowing. While concentrating on the development of agriculture and industry, Shandong will pay attention to the service trades. It will streamline its export product mix, with the focus on the export of finished industrial products -- machinery and electrical appliances in the main. Meanwhile, the province is exerting more efforts for the development of such key industries as motor vehicles, iron and steel, machinery, electronics and chemicals, and trying to form enterprise groups, corporations and trans-national companies. Song called on transportation departments to construct more local railways, highways and ports to pave the way for rapid economic development. He encouraged the departments to use more foreign investment in the construction of infrastructure facilities by issuing stocks and taking out loans.
