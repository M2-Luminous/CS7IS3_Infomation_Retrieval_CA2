The remaining seats, a mere 12 percent [number as published], are being distributed in quotas of little importance among the New Democratic Force, the National Salvation Movement, the 19 April Movement Democratic Alliance [AD/M-19], People's Will [Voluntad Popular] (Barranquilla), the Christian, metapolitical, civic, and independent groups. Among the election's large vote-grabbers in Valle is incumbent Representative Fernando Tello Dorrons, who soared with 40,934 votes. The closest contender obtained 28,989 votes. In Barranquilla, Ines Gomez de Vargas, from the People's Will, to which Mayor Bernardo Hoyos belongs, came in first over the others with 38,771 votes. Conservative Mario Varon Olarte, came in second, and Tarquino Pacheco who belongs to Hoyo's movement, came in third. In Caldas, Liberal Rodrigo Garavito was reelected with a notable 38,155 votes. In Antioquia, liberals garnered 179,314 votes and the conservatives 148,140. This means that the liberals maintained the 10 seats they already had while the conservatives increased from six to seven seats. In Santa Fe de Bogota, a big surprise was the significant climb of Carlos Alonso Lucio, who had abandoned the AD/M-19 long before the elections. Because of this, not only was he was saved from the across the board "burnout" of this movements' candidates, but he also led with the largest number of votes: 24,717. Lucio believes this support is the result of this opposition activity that characterized his political actions. Another surprise was Maria Zulia Mena Garcia, one of the leaders of the totally unknown -- nationwide -- Organization of the People's Neighborhoods of the Pacific Coast [Organization de Barrios Populares de la Costa Pacifica, Obapo]. This is a candidate who has worked exclusively inside the black communities. She won 37,156 votes, although she had never participated in elections and her campaign was waged with minimum economic resources. It is well to note that this is the first time that the blacks in Colombia participated in elections through a special district for ethnic minorities. The AD/M-19 electoral retreat had only two exceptions. Janeth Suarez was elected to the Chamber of Representatives in Barranquilla and Franklin Segundo Garcia was elected in Vichada. They are this group's only parliamentary representatives. The Liberals were the strongest force in Cundinamarca where Martha Catalina Daniels, Jose Gregocio Alvarado, Fernando Ramirez, and Roberto Moya were elected. Representatives to the Chamber elected with the lowest number of votes were in the newest departments, mainly Amazonas, Guaviare, Guainia, Vichada, and Vaupes. In Vichada there was a spectacular finish. Liberal Jaime Gonzalez garnered 1,692 votes to defeat the AD/M-19 candidate, who garnered 1,691.
