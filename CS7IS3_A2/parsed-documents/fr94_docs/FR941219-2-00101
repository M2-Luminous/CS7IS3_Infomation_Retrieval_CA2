FR941219-2-00101 FR941219-2-00063 Lodging of Consent Decree Pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as Amended In accordance with Departmental policy, 28 C.F.R. 50.7 and pursuant to Section 122 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (``CERCLA''), 42 U.S.C. 9622, notice is hereby given that a proposed Consent Decree in United States v. Reeves Southeastern Corporation, Civil Action No. 94&hyph;1752&hyph;CIV&hyph;T&hyph;24A, was lodged on November 2, 1994, with the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, Tampa Division. This case concerns the Reeves Southeastern Galvanizing (``SEG'') facility and the Reeves Southeastern Wire (``SEW'') facility which are located along the north and south sides of State Road 574 in Tampa, and, together are known as the Reeves Southeastern Corporation Superfund Site (the ``Site''). Pursuant to Sections 106 and 107 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (``CERCLA''), 42 U.S.C. 9606 and 9607, the Complaint in this action seeks recovery of all past and future costs incurred and to be incurred by the United States at the Site, and injunctive relief for the Site, namely, implementation of remedies selected by EPA in Records of Decision (``ROD'') for Operable Unit (``OU'') One, dated October 13, 1992, for OU two, dated September 9, 1993, and for OU three dated June 28, 1994. The ROD for OU One provides for excavation of contaminated soils and sediments at the SEW and SEG facilities, backfilling of those excavated areas with clean fill, solidification and stabilization of contaminated soils and sediments, disposal of the solidified material above the water table on the SEG facility and installation of a low permeability cap over the solidified material. The ROD for OU Two requires that the surficial aquifer be monitored for at least 21/2 years after the source control measures required in the Operable Unit One ROD have been completed. If, after 21/2 years have expired, levels of contaminants of concern in the surficial aquifer have not been reduced to a pre-determined targeted level, the surficial aquifer will have to be actively remediated through a pump and treat system. If levels have attenuated to the target level, pump and treat will not be required at that time; however, monitoring will continue. The ROD for OU Three requires sampling and monitoring of the North Wetland. Defendant Reeves (the ``Settling Defendant'') has agreed in the proposed Consent Decree to pay the United States $297,759 for past response costs incurred at the Site, as well as all future costs of overseeing the implementation of the Remedial Actions of OU One, Two and Three. The Settling Defendant has also agreed to implement the remedy selected by EPA for the Site. The Department of Justice will receive, for a period of thirty (30) days from the date of this publication, comments relating to the proposed Consent Decree. Comments should be addressed to the Assistant Attorney General for the Environment and Natural Resources Division, Department of Justice, Washington, D.C. 20530, and should refer to United States v. Reeves Southeastern Corporation, DOJ Ref. # 90&hyph;11&hyph;2&hyph;897C. The proposed Consent Decree may be examined at the office of the United States Attorney, Middle District of Florida, 500 Zack St. Room 410, Tampa, Florida 33602; the Office of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, Region IV, 345 Courtland Street, N.E., Atlanta, Georgia; and at the Consent Decree Library, 1120 G Street, N.W., 4th Floor, Washington, D.C. 20005, (202) 624&hyph;0892.
