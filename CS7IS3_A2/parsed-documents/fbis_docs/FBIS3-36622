In an interview with the Vilnius-based Russian-language newspaper ECHO LITVY, the ambassador said a Baltic-Black Sea alliance should be created, but "must not be narrowed only to a political notion." Bilodid said considerable work needs to be done in terms of economic cooperation because the present volume of trade between Lithuania and Ukraine cannot satisfy either of the sides. The ambassador said Ukraine can become a major market for Lithuanian goods, but Lithuania concentrates on economic ties with the West, the North and the East, while the South slips past without being seen. "My task is to direct Lithuania's attention in the southern direction," he said. In Bilodid's view, mutual settlements are a major problem in economic relations between Lithuania and Ukraine. The ambassador said the increasing rate of inflation in his country creates additional difficulties. Among other problems, he also mentioned the imperfectness of banking systems in both countries. "All these problems are already discussed by experts. I think, the presidents will also utter their weighty arguments."
