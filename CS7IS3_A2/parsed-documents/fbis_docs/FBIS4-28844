"The withdrawal appears to be the initiative taken to avoid the disgrace of their being kicked out of the atomic energy agency," the president said. While meeting with a group of 15 Mindan (pro-Seoul Korean Residents Association in Japan) leaders at Chongwadae [presidential offices], President Kim said that thus far there had been no signs of unusual military movement in North Korea. He said Pyongyang's withdrawal from the IAEA seems directed against South Korea and the United States -- the United States in particular. The president noted that the withdrawal was announced at 11 p.m. Korea time Monday, which was a morning hour in the east of the United States. Later in the day, President Kim met leading American businessmen who were in Seoul attending the seventh Korea-U.S. business conference. Kim called on the visitors to invest more in Korea, saying there would be no problem in investment in Korea thanks to durable peace brought about by a firm cooperative system between South Korea and the United States. The government would ease investment conditions and deregulate control so that foreign businesses would find it easier to do business in Korea, the president was quoted as saying by Chongwadae spokesman Chu Ton-sik.
