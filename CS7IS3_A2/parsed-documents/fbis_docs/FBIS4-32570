The decisions unfold in the "iron triangle": the Department of Department--special-interest groups--Congress. Every change of personnel among the leading officials in a U.S. department is, therefore, a change worthy of note. Among the most recent and most surprising changes is the resignation, announced last week, of Assistant Secretary for European Affairs Stephen Oxman. "The erroneous impression is often formed in Europe that U.S. foreign policy is purely a matter for the president," said Andrew Steigman, a political scientist and veteran of U.S. diplomacy, in Prague yesterday. "Nothing is further from the truth," pointed out the former diplomat. The news of Oxman's resignation also attracted attention because it was announced at the same time that Jennone Walker, a specialist on Europe, is to leave the National Security Committee in the White House. They will both be replaced by experienced diplomats. Richard Holbrooke, until now ambassador in Germany, is to replace Oxman, and Alexander Vershbow is to go into the White House in place of Walker. It is of interest to the Czech Republic that Jennone Walker has been offered the post of ambassador to Prague. Walker, whose appointment has still to be confirmed by the Senate, has so far not denied this report. It is supported by at least one Prague diplomatic source. If no problems crop up--and none are envisaged--Walker should take over at the Prague embassy at the beginning of next summer. This will hardly be to the general delight of current Ambassador Adrian Basora. Why are Oxman and Walker going? According to Washington sources, definitely not because serious professional shortcomings could be attributed to them. The reason is more likely to be an attempt by Secretary of State Warren Christopher and President Clinton's security adviser (that is, the head of the National Security Council), Anthony Lake, to take the edge off the criticism that for an embarrassingly long time and uncomfortably emphatically has been descending on them. Christopher and Lake are apparently guilty of not having managed to "instill sufficient confidence both at home and abroad." The resignations of Oxman and Walker should presumably act as a palliative for the weak reputation of the government team entrusted with foreign policy. Of course, in this connection, there is also speculation about whether the changes could go even further. Until now, Stephen Oxman was considered in Washington to be a man in an "unshakable" position because he is a close friend of President Clinton and has been since they were students together, and also of Secretary Christopher, with whom he worked in Jimmy Carter's administration. If Oxman is resigning now, could Warren Christopher or Anthony Lake be next? This is not out of the question in the case of the somewhat colorless presidential adviser Lake. This probably does not apply in the case of the seasoned Secretary of State Christopher--at least, until the fall congressional elections.
