Unfortunately, the reform package by Governor Chris Patten has further polarised the elite and the society, already split over the attitude towards Beijing. Among local people, there have always been suspicions, resentments and fears against the communist rulers on the mainland due to political turmoil there. Military suppression of student-led demonstrations on 4 June, 1989, was the latest of these political turmoils. But the crackdown occurred at a particularly sensitive time to Hong Kong people as 1997 was only several years away, and it came after 10 years of reform and opening. Before Mr Patten proposed his reform package in October 1992, Hong Kong society and its political elite had somewhat contained their polarisation from the 4 June trauma. But in the course of the row over the political system triggered by the governor's move, public figures have had to take sides. And the political dispute has spilled over into other areas, such as the financial arrangement of the new airport. As a result, the society and elite have become further split. Now both the Chinese and British are trying hard to woo Hong Kong people to their sides. As Beijing is stepping up to set up the "second stove" here, it is inviting new batches of people to become advisers to the territory-wide and regional affairs. On the part of the British, they are trying to hold people on their side. In this tug-of-war, people have to choose camps and risk being labelled as pro-Beijing or pro-London. One of the most disturbed sectors is the civil service which should continue to play a crucial role in the government of the future Special Administrative Region. Beijing has taken to task some of the senior officials who have fervently promoted the governor's package. It is believed that the Chinese side is close to determining that certain Hong Kong officials will not serve beyond 1997. This will cost the territory some of its most capable hands. But as every government gives top priority to political reliability among its senior members, the Chinese side's stance is quite understandable. In this regard, Anson Chan, the first local to become Hong Kong's chief secretary, is likely to lose her top job after 1997. Mrs Chan probably knows this. In a recent interview with the HONGKONG STANDARD, she cast doubts about her own political future, saying she would find it difficult to preside over arrangements if China dismantled Hong Kong's three tiers government in 1997. Here, the chief secretary was actually saying that she could not continue her civil service career because of the political changes. The fact remains that because of the row triggered by Mr Patten's package, the Chinese and British can't agree on political arrangements. The inability to establish a political elite which commands the support and respect of the majority of the local people will be harmful to the implementation of Beijing's pledge of "Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong". This may jeopardise the "one country two systems" scheme which needs local people to prop up Hong Kong's system of capitalism. In the worst scenario, the polarisation may lead to instability in the years leading up to, as well as the years after, transition. We need local people to be in responsible positions in every major sector so that after the British withdrawal, the local administration can still operate effectively and stability will be maintained. If we cannot do that, we risk the danger of Beijing sending the mainland cadres to help run the administration. This is a development which the local people do not want to see. Much has to be done to redress the situation. Ideally, the Chinese and British sides should confine their clashes and prevent further splitting the society and its political elite. The two sides should stop politicising the civil service. The Chinese side should understand that since the officials are still under the British administration, they should by and large follow London's line. Let the civil servants perform their duties as usual. Actually, the society as a whole should be allowed to do its business as usual. If the governments of China and Britain and local political groups concerned themselves more with livelihood rather than political issues, Hong Kong would have a smoother transition. It would also be easier for a political elite, which commanded the support and respect of the majority of the local people, to emerge.
