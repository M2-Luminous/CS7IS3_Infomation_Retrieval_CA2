Defense Secretariat Communique No. 27 stated that armed groups attacked Indian villages that refused to cooperate with the self-styled Zapatist National Liberation Army. The communique added that 56 families were evicted with excessive violence from Santa Elena, La Soleda, San Francisco, and San Miguel Villages. The families were later given shelter by the Rural Association of Common Interest [Asociacion Rural de Interes Colectivo] in Ocosingo Municipality in eastern Chiapas. The 7th Military Region Command received 27 complaints from cattle ranchers in Ocosingo and Altamirano of looting by aggressor groups. The office reported that on 27 January the person in charge of one of the ranches attacked in Ocosingo had stated that a group of 50 armed persons destroyed the ranch he was guarding. Near the Miguel Hidalgo ranches in Ocosingo, some 500 armed individuals have surrounded 1,460 residents of nearby villages, asking them for food and a "war tax" and threatening to kill them if they do not join the armed movement. A report received on 29 January stated that armed groups burned four wooden houses and used mallets to destroy three brick houses located close by the San Cristobal de las Casas-Ocosingo highway near Nuevo Oxchuc village, the communique added. Residents of the 10 April and San Bartolo Ejidos went to military installations in Comitan on Sunday to ask for help in evacuating the refugees and to ask for food since armed groups are blocking the roads.
