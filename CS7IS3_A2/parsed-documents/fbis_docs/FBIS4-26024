This serious incident of illegal import of hazardous wastes, which occurred half a year ago, has been initially settled. This serious incident occurred on 25 September last year. Without receiving prior approval from environmental protection departments, Beijing's (Zhongmaofa) Company and Nanjing's (Huagu) Company imported 1,288 tonnes of so-called fuel oil from South Korea to Nanjing Port's (Shanyuan) Wharf. After a sample check by Jiangsu Import and Export Commodity Inspection Bureau personnel, they found that the shipment was not fuel oil, but hazardous chemical wastes. The Nanjing New District Customs immediately blocked the release of the problematic shipment. Due to the cooperation among relevant state and Jiangsu departments, the illegally imported wastes had all been safely returned to the consignee on 5 March this year. A check shows that during the five-month stay of these hazardous wastes in Nanjing Port, no incident of pollution was reported, thanks to the joint supervision of the Jiangsu and Nanjing Environmental Protection Bureaus. Although these hazardous wastes had been returned to the consignee, there is no knowing what kind of punishment will be meted to those who were responsible for importing these wastes in the first place.
