The Palestinians said this is not the right time to sign cooperation agreements with Israel on security and military issues. According to them, such agreements, coming in the aftermath of the Hebron massacre, encourage Israel to perpetuate its policy vis-a-vis the Palestinians. In a news conference with French journalists, Leotard said such an issue did not come up in his meeting with the Palestinians. Referring to French assistance, the Palestinians stressed the need for political over any other kind of aid. They asked France to try to bring about a change in the Israeli position with regard to the settlers and the settlements so that a small number of settlements may be removed already at this stage. Replying to the Palestinians' request that France support the notion of international protection in the territories, Leotard said that if Israel and the Palestinians reached an agreement to this effect, France would agree to participate in such a force. At the news conference, Leotard said that France would agree to an international presence but not to an international force. The French minister expressed willingness to help train personnel for the Palestinian police force.
