According to a report, the first Patriot missile unit, consisting of 48 missiles and some 800 soldiers, will arrive in South Korea sometime this week and will be deployed in accordance with U.S. Defense Department orders. According to another report, the second Patriot missile unit will soon be dispatched to the Korean peninsula. As it has already been reported, U.S. Defense Secretary Perry will make a junket to South Korea this week and will hold discussions with the South Korean puppet defense minister on the situation on the Korean peninsula. This shows that the situation on the Korean peninsula is heading all the more toward the brink of war. As it is known, the United States and the South Korean puppets decided to gradually deploy the Patriot missiles to South Korea beginning in October 1994. Nevertheless, the United States is starting to deploy them to South Korea from the middle of this month, six months earlier than scheduled. What does this show? This shows that the United States is trying to provoke a nuclear war in Korea without fail by finding fault with our nonexistent nuclear issue. As it is known, the U.S. military is drawing up an aggressive war plan to bring in 600,000 aggressive forces, over 200 vessels, and over 1,600 airplanes--including two Marine Corps divisions--from the continental U.S. within 80 days in event of an emergency on the Korean peninsula. The South Korean puppets are assuming a posture of attack by even making public their plan to invade the North under the new strategy plan 5027 which had been kept secret up until now. We cannot but take seriously the remarks made by U.S. Defense Secretary Perry who openly said that the possibility of a preemptive military strike on North Korea will not be ruled out and that he is ready to risk a war. The U.S. Patriot missile units are arriving in South Korea at such a time. U.S. military officials are lecturing that the Patriot missiles they introduced are defensive weapons to prepare against an attack. That is merely a deceptive talk to disguise their aggressive nature. The Patriot missiles are of an improved type and their threat varies with the type of warheads installed. This proves that Patriot missiles are not simply defensive weapons but can also be used as offensive weapons to strike the opponent. Patriot missiles are being deployed to South Korea at a time when the United States has moved numerous Navy carriers around the Korean peninsula, has put them in a ready posture for immediate deployment at any time, and is trying to conduct the Team Spirit joint military exercise by all means. This shows that the risk of a nuclear war in our country is approaching a visible reality. There is no guarantee that the United States would not attack us with Patriot missiles after putting the South Korean war maniacs in the front to ignite the fuse of war. Our people cannot but heighten an equivalent alert regarding the reinforced commotion of military power buildup in South Korea coinciding with the U.S. defense secretary's junket to South Korea. If the United States continues to build up military power indiscriminately despite our repeated warnings and chooses the direction of a nuclear war in the end, it will sustain a staunch punishment [tanhohan chingbol] by our people. The aggressors will only be met with bitter defeat and deaths.
