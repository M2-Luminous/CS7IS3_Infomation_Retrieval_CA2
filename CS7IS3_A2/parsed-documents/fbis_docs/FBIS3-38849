This question that Bill Clinton seems to raise [quoting the correspondent in the video report on Clinton wondering whether France is really committed to air strikes in Bosnia], I will put it to you again: Are the French ready? [Juppe] I already answered this question on Sunday [6 February] afternoon in the company of Francois Leotard [minister of state for defense], when I said that France wanted an ultimatum to be given in order to obtain the lifting of the siege in Sarajevo. When one says ultimatum, one says force must be used if conditions are not met. So we are ready. I would like to add a word: When I say this, I say it with all the seriousness it implies. I hear a lot of advice these days. We are told we should hit back, we should be firm. I do not believe I have been suspected of being weak since the start of the tragedy in the former Yugoslavia. Striking means putting the population and our soldiers at risk. As you can understand, a member of the government, like any French citizen, thinks first about our soldiers. In life, there are those with positions of responsibility and those who exhort. Exhorting is easy, deciding is more difficult. We are ready to decide. [d'Arvor] For the moment things have not been that easy, first, vis-a-vis your European allies, as they have been slow to respond. The word ultimatum was not used yesterday, will it be used tomorrow perhaps? [Juppe] No ultimatum was given but a demand for the lifting of the siege on Sarajevo was made. It was affirmed that all means should be used, including air strikes. Therefore, I think the decision of the Twelve -- even if we had to work hard with those who were more reluctant -- goes in the right direction. Tomorrow, during the meeting of the Atlantic Council, you mentioned a short while ago that France's position will be very clear. We will ask for a precise and strong reaction. We cannot let last Sunday's massacre in Sarajevo go by without reacting clearly and strongly. [d'Arvor] So a fresh incident is not expected? [Juppe] Surely not. If tomorrow, the Council of the Atlantic Alliance does not agree or if it only embarks on a fresh exercise in exhortation, saying: Watch it! You will see what we will do next time! France will not be associated with such a decision. [d'Arvor] So this means it [France] will eventually decide on its own on the air strikes? [Juppe] Obviously not. We neither have the law [on our side] nor the strength. But we will not continue [subscribing] to this situation -- to which, I hope, I will go back to in a moment -- we will not continue to put the lives of our soldiers and their reputation in danger. They are being criticized at the moment. It is said that because they are in Sarajevo, strikes are not possible. This situation would be unbearable if it were to continue. This is not likely -- as I said earlier, why? We have done a lot of work with our allies, in particular with the Americans, and I think that tomorrow morning we will be able to present a joint position to the Council of the Alliance, in particular between the United States and France, which would demand the lifting of the siege. It would mean specifically: The withdrawal of the attacking, or besieging troops to a distance of 20-30 km, so that they cannot repeat what they have done, wherever the firing came from, that they cannot repeat what we saw in those terrible, unbearable, pictures. Then we will demand that all heavy arms in this area be placed under United Nations control, and we will say very clearly -- or at least this is what we will propose -- that if these demands are not satisfied within a few days, the batteries remaining in the zone will be the object of air strikes. I think that is a very clear position, and I repeat the answer I gave you just now: France is ready to face up to the risks. The president, the prime minister, the minister of defense, and I myself have held discussions, and this decision has been taken. [d'Arvor] If you are speaking of Franco-American decisions, or at least of a Franco-American axis, this means that you already have some indications from the White House that lead you to believe.... [Juppe, interrupting] Of course. You know, all these things are serious, as I said just now, at the beginning. So, we would not do it just like that, all alone. For the past several days I have had daily conversations with our European and American partners. I would like to add one thing: It seems to me that Washington has adopted the French position on the reaction to be taken on the latest massacres in Sarajevo, but it also seems to me that there is an evolution on the political and diplomatic level, because -- I would like to add this point as it seems very important to me -- we are not warmongers, we are not trying to conduct an all-out war; we want to launch an ultimatum, but we also want a political perspective in all this. We recall that there is a plan for a political settlement, and that there is no other way out than by political negotiation. It seems -- and this is another positive aspect of my conversations this afternoon -- that the Americans are ready to associate themselves with this diplomatic and political step by the Europeans. Our plan is not unalterable; it can be developed, it can be improved, but I make this appeal once again: All the great powers, the Americans, but also the Russians and the Europeans, must tell the belligerents: We will not allow the massacres in Sarajevo to continue but, at the same time, we are proposing a way our for you, and it is a political and diplomatic way. [d'Arvor] If I understand you right, the two prongs of the alternative are, if you do not get satisfaction in Brussels tomorrow from your NATO partners, that means that the French are ready to withdraw, since they will be alone against the attackers and belligerents of all kinds? [Juppe] I think tomorrow it will be a question of dignity and honor. How, after having so often uttered threats, so often repeated that we will not allow such massacres to happen again, can we do nothing? France will not associate itself with a nondecision. If the Atlantic alliance is incapable of taking a decision, as I said just now, we will ask whether we can continue to expose our soldiers to pointless risks. Our soldiers are brave, and I want to pay homage to them. It is true soldiers are ready to take risks, but not for just anything, not pointlessly, and not in an ill-considered way. [d'Arvor] (?Doesn't this) question the credibility of Europe, because Europe has repeated so many times in the last year and one-half, with the risk of ending up losing credibility, that this must end, and it has gone on? Sarajevo is geographically exactly half way between Rome and Athens. [Juppe] Credibility of Europe, yes and no. First, Europe has done things, and France has done things. I am not ashamed of what France has done. Just the opposite, because it is there on the ground with its soldiers. We have collectively given a lot of money for humanitarian aid, and for several months we have proposed more and more diplomatic initiatives. We have done our best, even if for the moment we have been unable to settle the problem. Europe also put a peace plan on the table in November, December, which is the only plan for a political settlement that exists, and let me remind you that the three parties -- Muslim, Croat, and Serb -- have agreed on its principles. It is true that yesterday I would have preferred Europe to have been a bit more courageous, perhaps. [d'Arvor] Thank you for responding to our invitation, Mr. Juppe.
