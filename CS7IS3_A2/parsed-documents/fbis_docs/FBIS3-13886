All this, however, is needless repetition and self-evident truth known by everyone. Even graver than this is what news agencies reported about the U.S. abstention on one of the resolution's clauses. That clause considers Jerusalem to be part of the Arab territories occupied in 1967 and the same international resolutions and negotiating points of reference applying to those territories also apply to Jerusalem. It is common knowledge that after the massacre at the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque, U.S. pressure continued on the Palestinian leadership in a bid to empty the resoution of content. Washington linked its approval of the resolution to the Palestinians' resumption of negotiations with Israel. In other words, the United States adopted the Israeli stance. The Palestinian leadership's refusal to deal with the U.S. position delayed voting on the draft resolution for three weeks. This U.S. stance, biased in favor of Israel, encouraged it to continue its settlement policy in the occupied Arab territories, particularly in the Jerusalem area, where various Israeli ministries are making plans to build more settlements and settlement neighborhoods in a bid to impose a new fait accompli. All Arab and Islamic parties concerned with the future of the occupied Palestinian territories, foremost of all Jerusalem, must realize these facts and act to confront designs and plans aimed at the Arab presence in the holy city. Inalienable Palestinian rights include all the occupied territories, which begin from Jerusalem and end in Jerusalem.
