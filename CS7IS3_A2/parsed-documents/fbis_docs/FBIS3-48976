In connection with agency reports that four civilians were killed and several others wounded in Sarajevo, Karadzic told TANJUG that this was a new attempt by the Moslems ruthlessly to manipulate the international public. "Anyone in the world who has followed this bloody civil war at all could have guessed that the Moslem side would stage some New Year's gift to the international audience," said Karadzic. "This is by now largely a crime against one's own people, which the Moslem leadership has been perpetrating constantly, and the international public should finally expose it by publishing the naked truth that Moslems do not care even for their own citizens since their slogan is -- the end justifies the means," said Karadzic. In the meantime, the Bosnian Serb parliament late on Friday temporarily ended a regular session. It was ruled that a report on the peace talks on Bosnia-Herzegovina, which were held in Geneva and Brussels in December, and a debate on this major subject of the current session be put off for the next session, which has been scheduled for January 10.
