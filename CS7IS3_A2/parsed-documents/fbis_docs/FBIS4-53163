He said it was inevitable that there would be an entry price if the Federal Government pursued a link between the Closer Economic Relations [CER] agreement and the ASEAN Free Trade Area [AFTA], even though Australia's general level of tariffs was much lower than the ASEAN average. "If we are to get some sort of agreement about an open trading arrangement between ourselves, we can't expect that can take place without Australia having to make any changes." He said Australia would come to the negotiating table in a strong position because of the tariff reductions and economic opening that had taken place in Australia in the past decade, but "we can't expect there would be no price". Senator McMullan was launching a report by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade [DFAT] East Asia Analytical Unit on AFTA where he also announced that Australia would be discussing a possible link with New Zealand officials next week. The DFAT report, AFTA: Trading Bloc or Building Block suggests ASEAN countries "would be keen to tap" the politically sensitive textiles, clothing and footwear market. A CER-AFTA link would provide the opportunity for ASEAN to "influence and secure (tariff) reductions in areas like textiles, clothing and footwear and motor vehicles." The report notes that Australia's anti-dumping regime "irritates" ASEAN countries. Yesterday, Senator McMullan warned against moving too fast towards a formal trade link and suggested that Australia and New Zealand could first establish a dialogue with the AFTA countries to exchange information. The ASEAN secretariat Economic Research Bureau director, Dr Suthat Setbunsang, also said there would be benefits in the AFTA countries learning more about CER because it could provide a model for resolving many AFTA trade issues. The DFAT report also suggests CER "dialogue" with ASEAN as a first step and ongoing encouragement for further trade liberalisation within AFTA.
