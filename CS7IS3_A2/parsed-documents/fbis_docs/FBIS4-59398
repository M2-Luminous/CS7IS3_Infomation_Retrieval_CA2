The second day's meetings ended a short while ago. Details are in the following report by our political affairs correspondent Shakir Maharimah: [Begin recording] [Maharimah] The Jordanian-Palestinian Economic Committee resumed its meetings at the Prime Ministry today until late this evening. After the meeting, Mr. Ahmad Quray', head of the PLO Economic Department and head of the Palestinian side, and Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, minister of state for cabinet affairs, minister of information, and head of the Jordanian side, made statements: [Quray'] After this long and enjoyable round of talks and exchange of views with our brothers under the chairmanship of my brother His Excellency Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, we have prepared mechanisms with full understanding on both sides to implement the Jordanian-Palestinian agreement in the economic field. We discussed basic and important issues that dealt with banking and monetary issues, trade and customs. We also set up subcommittees and they will commence their work immediately as of Saturday [14 May] to follow up the implementation of the working program. God willing, when the transitional stage goes into implementation, coordination will take place on the ground. I believe that since 1967, this is the first chance for us, as Palestinians, to exercise part of our powers usurped by the Israeli occupation authorities. The first and basic reference that we resort to is this fraternal, brotherly, and friendly country with which we are linked with distinguished ties and which cannot but include all the visions and aspirations of our two peoples. God willing, we shall meet again tomorrow and release a joint statement and agree on a working program to implement the accord signed on 7 January 1994. [Al-'Anani] The negotiations were held in a businesslike atmosphere in which issues were discussed in detail. The discussion of the details of a mechanism took us a long time. It was not enough to agree on the basic principles. It was necessary that we work out practical steps on the ground so that technical experts and specialists in the various sectors could immediately start implementing the agreement. A high spirit of cooperation permeated these meetings. Since our interests are interrelated, they must be organized in a detailed way so that people and the private sector could take advantage of the chances available on the ground in view of what is going on in the Palestinian territories in terms of changes we will witness on the ground. In fact, I would like to thank brother Abu-'Ala' [Quray'], and his friends and colleagues who showed a high level of response to and understanding of issues that are of concern to us in Jordan. We found solutions to these issues, which, God willing, will convince the Jordanian and Palestinian people that we are on the road to achieving interests. God willing, we will avoid dangers and seek to achieve joint interests in light of close relations between the two people. As my brother Abu-'Ala' said, we will meet in order to sign what we call a working plan based on the agreement. As he mentioned, we took a number of priorities into consideration. These included banking, monetary, trade, and transient issues. We also discussed the issue of tourism. We shall hold further meetings to complete the discussion of agriculture, industry, energy, and any other related issues. Moreover, the [Palestinian] brothers asked for cooperation in terms of exchanging expertise and technical cadres, especially since the required Palestinian institutions are being established. They received sufficient response from us. [end recording]
