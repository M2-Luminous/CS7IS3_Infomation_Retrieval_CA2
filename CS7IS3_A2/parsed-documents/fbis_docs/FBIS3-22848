Acquired as an important tool for training Brazilian technicians, the simulator reproduces all the operations and emergency situations in the control unit of a nuclear plant. To finance its upkeep and pay its operators, the simulator is being used by foreign plants and enterprises interested in training their personnel. During the past few years, professionals from various countries have come to Angra-2 for training courses using the plant's equipment and local personnel at a cost of $30,000 per week per person. This year, the simulator will make a liquid profit of $1.4 billion by training Argentine, Spanish, French, and German technicians. Courses are completely booked to January 1995.
