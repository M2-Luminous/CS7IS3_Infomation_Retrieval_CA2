The Russian lawmakers met and held talks with their Chinese counterparts in Beijing. The delegation will also visit Shanghai and the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone. Here is a short commentary by station observer Mulatov: The Russian parliamentary delegation's visit to China is yet another step toward expanding good-neighborly cooperation between the two countries. Actively strengthening contacts between the two parliaments is part of the constructive partnership between Russia and China. Foreign observers have noted that the parliamentary delegation's visit to China precedes the official visit by a delegation headed by Prime Minister Chernomyrdin. The Russian prime minister will visit China from 26-29 May. During the visit, some documents on expanding concrete areas of Russian-Chinese cooperation will be signed. A second Russia-China summit will be held later on, probably in late summer or early autumn. The first summit was held in December 1992, when President Yeltsin paid an official visit to China. This time, Chinese President Jiang Zemin will reciprocate the visit. Holding a second Russia-China summit will promote and raise to a new high the constructive partnership between Russia and China. The development of Russian-Chinese relations on the basis of good-neighborly and wide-ranging cooperation has gradually become an important positive factor that has a bearing on the international situation, in the Asia-Pacific region, and in the world at large. In conclusion, Station observer Mulatov says: To Russia, which is a large Eurasian country, its equality-based partnership with China is of great importance as is its new relationship with West Europe and the United States.
