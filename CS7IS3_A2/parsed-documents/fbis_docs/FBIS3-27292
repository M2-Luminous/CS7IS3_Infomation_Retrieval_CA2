The department made the decision Thursday [16 February] in response to President Bill Clinton's Feb. 3 move to end the 19-year-old trade embargo against Vietnam. Clinton said, "I have made the judgment that the best way to ensure cooperation from Vietnam and to continue getting the information Americans want on POWs and MIAs is to end the trade embargo." The U.S. business community has hailed the President's decision, saying the move will open up a new venue for American goods and investment. The U.S. United Airlines made a decision on February 3 to offer flights between Los Angeles and Ho Chi Minh City hours after the President announced the lifting of the trade embargo on Vietnam. The airlines said it would begin service to Vietnam as soon as it could get government approval.
