FR941103-0-00098 FR941103-0-00016 One commenter stated that specifying all applicable sections of the ASME Code, rather than providing exceptions to sections that are not applicable, would provide greater assurance to engineers and designers that they have not overlooked an obscure section of the ASME Code. The commenter did not provide RSPA with any suggested wording for implementation of the recommendation. The National Propane Gas Association (NPGA) submitted a report on the structural integrity of the MC 331 specification cargo tank. NPGA recommended uniformity in design loading requirements for all DOT specification cargo tanks. RSPA will consider the design loading requirements for MC 331 and MC 338 specification cargo tanks in a future rulemaking. The report is available for review in the public docket. III. Section-by-Section Review This review by section discusses only significant comments received to the proposals in the NPRM, changes made based on alternative proposals offered by commenters, and clarifications to certain provisions based on RSPA's initiatives. For those provisions that are adopted as proposed, readers are referred to the preamble discussion in the NPRM. Section 171.7 The Truck Trailer Manufacturers Association (TTMA) submitted a petition for rulemaking (P&hyph;1236) requesting RSPA to incorporate by reference the latest editions of the ASME Code from the 1986 Edition and Addenda through 1985 to the 1992 edition and Addenda through 1993, and to update the National Board inspection Code from the 1983 Edition to the 1992 Edition. RSPA has reviewed these updated standards and agrees the latest editions should be referenced. The table in paragraph (a)(3) has been revised accordingly. Section 173.33 Consistent with changes made in §180.405(h) in this final rule, a new sentence is added to paragraph (d) stating that the venting requirements of the original DOT cargo tank specification must be met whenever a pressure relief valve is modified to a more recent specification. See preamble discussion for §180.405(h). Similarly, in view of changes made in §§178.337&hyph;11 and 178.338&hyph;11 in this final rule, a new paragraph (h) is added to inform shippers that certain MC 331 and MC 338 cargo tanks manufactured after August 31, 1995, must have remotely controlled, internal, self-closing stop valves. See preamble discussion for §178.337&hyph;11. Section 173.225 Commenters supported the proposal to revise paragraph (e)(2) to authorize the use of MC 307 and DOT 407 cargo tank motor vehicles for certain organic peroxides. However, one commenter opposed allowing the use of MC 307 cargo tanks for all organic peroxides. This commenter misunderstood the proposal. Note 14 to the §173.225(b) Table authorizes bulk packagings for only a few organic peroxides. Therefore, paragraph (e)(2) is adopted as proposed in the NPRM. Section 173.315 For cargo tank motor vehicles in chlorine service, changes in requirements for hose, piping or tubing to be carried on the vehicle and in requirements for testing angle valves, as proposed in the NPRM, are adopted as paragraphs (o)(1) and (o)(2) respectively. Section 178.337&hyph;1 Paragraphs (a)(3) and (e)(1) are revised to correct certain section references and paragraph (e)(2) is revised to authorize the use of ceramic fiber/fiberglass insulation for cargo tanks in chlorine service as proposed in the NPRM. Section 178.337&hyph;9 As proposed in the NPRM, the restriction is removed against mounting or carrying on a cargo tank motor vehicle any hose, piping or tubing used in loading or unloading; paragraphs (b)(7) (ii) and (iii) are redesignated as (b)(7) (i) and (ii) respectively. Section 178.337&hyph;11 In response to NTSB recommendation H&hyph;90&hyph;91 dealing with release of sulfur dioxide from an MC 331 cargo tank during unloading, RSPA proposed revision of requirements for remotely controlled self-closing stop valves on liquid or vapor discharge lines on newly constructed MC 331 cargo tank motor vehicles. Currently found at paragraph (a)(2), this requirement applies only to equipment intended for transportation of a flammable liquid, a flammable compressed gas, hydrogen chloride (refrigerated liquid) or anhydrous ammonia. RSPA proposed to broaden the requirement to include all compressed gases. This revision also was proposed for MC 338 cargo tanks. Both the NTSB and the Compressed Gas Association (CGA) commented on RSPA's proposal to require remotely controlled internal self-closing stop valves. While supportive of RSPA's proposal, NTSB stated: Although the Safety Board is aware that MC 331 cargo tanks are predominantly used for the transportation of flammable and nonflammable compressed gases, the hazardous materials regulations (49 CFR Parts 171 through 180) do authorize these tanks to be used for the transportation of other classes of hazardous materials such as flammable liquids and poisons. The Safety Board believes that remote controls for internal shut-off valves should be required for any hazardous material that is authorized to be transported in an MC 331 cargo tank. Further the Safety Board believes that all MC 331 and MC 338 cargo tanks currently in hazardous materials service, and not just newly constructed tanks, should also be equipped with remote controls for the internal shut-off valves. The Safety Board has consistently urged the DOT to eliminate ``grandfathering'' clauses that permit hazardous materials to be transported indefinitely in containers or vehicles that fail to meet current minimum safety standards. The Safety Board believes that RSPA should require all MC 331 and MC 338 highway cargo tanks in hazardous materials service to be equipped with remote controls for internal shut-off valves by a specific date. On the other hand, the CGA believes that remotely controlled shut-off valves should not be required for nonflammable ladings. CGA stated that ``operating experience for the nonflammable compressed gases does not warrant the addition of this restriction which would add cost without providing additional safety benefit.''
