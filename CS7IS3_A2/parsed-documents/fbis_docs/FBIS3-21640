This seizure, which can be described as the most important so far this year, took place approximately 80 km from Cancun, on the beaches of Acumal, where the bundles were dropped into the sea from an aircraft. Apparently, the bundles were to be illegally transshipped in a 30-meter-long fiberglass boat that had a radio with a marine band and other frequencies. The boat and the cocaine are under Navy guard in Cozumel. The Federal Judicial Police are investigating the origin of the cocaine.
