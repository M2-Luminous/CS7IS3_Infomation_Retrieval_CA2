And the substance was political dynamite. This, especially in view of the fact that the attacks came from the foreign minister. But not even his own office and the silent retinue of diplomats that surround him were able to contain Beniamino Andreatta. On the aircraft that took us to Vilnius, Andreatta turned away from the subject of his meeting with Boris Yeltsin and the rights of the Russian-speaking minorities of the Baltic. He lit his pipe. He gave his trousers a hitch, tucking his necktie into the waistband. He half-closed his eyes, and then he let loose. "There is a tide of anger in Italy and, as always, it has right-wing characteristics. Those who shook the tree have caused the apples to fall in their neighbors' garden. The Left concentrated on the issue of the other parties' reputation instead of on the country's problems, thus creating the conditions for an explosion by the Right. The most disconcerting aspect of [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi is the way he has taken advantage of poor people. His are the typical promises made in countries lacking a political structure. And it is the poor consumers of escapist television who are attracted by this campaign, with its cynical plan." [Valentino] Why "cynical," minister? [Andreatta] Because it is a form of Reaganism after the event, a reintroduction of the "supply side" theory -- to cut taxes in order to bring in more taxes -- that did not work in the United States, where it left a deficit that has constituted its greatest problem for the past nine years. The disgusting aspect of this operation is this rummaging around in the attic for the remnants of a past era, pulling back out of the chests of the right the carnival costumes of past seasons and, having shaken off a little dust, selling them back to the Italian people, who are somewhat unaware of the complexity of the problems. This, in the midst of an adjustment that is working -- as the Amato and Ciampi governments have basically succeeded in doing -- when we should not be loosening our grip. (A steward informed us that we were about to land in Vilnius). So, now we are entering Lithuania. Here we have a government which, also because of anger and the difficulty of adhering to the policy of liberalization, has become a government representing continuity with communism. Of course, in political terms they have done well, they too have fought for independence, but they are managing liberalization as the communists may have managed it, with a few concessions, and privatizations that are more apparent than real. [Valentino] But you do not use the word "disgusting" in connection with [secretary of the Democratic Party of the Left, PDS] Occhetto; you seem gentler in your criticisms.... [Andreatta] Well, strong language has been used for the past 40 years. The fact that the intellectual world of the Italian Left maintains some ambiguity and that its contempt -- which may not be a political category -- is never brought to bear on continuity is such old hat that it is not worth emphasizing. The desire to break with the past and not to cultivate memories or feelings, which I have found in Russia, is something that I do not find among my friends on the Italian Left. In Italy the former communists need to maintain their feelings. And I find that this leaves me very suspicious about their ability to tackle properly situations demanding a genuine market economy philosophy. Then there is this operation -- one of the worst on the Italian Left -- of exploiting people's reputation. Basically, the democratic defense against the left is regarded as 1948-style anticommunism. [Valentino] But anticommunism in 1948 was a fact... [Andreatta] Because it is part of our history and was an important factor. If it had not been for that.... The result can be better imagined looking at this part of the world. [Valentino] What frightens you in Italy today? [Andreatta] The regression of politics to primordial feelings, to anger. Videocracy, which has reduced political reasoning to gestures and insults. This goes profoundly contrary to our history. In order to cast off politics as the supreme art of compromise, which unfortunately has a negative connotation in Italy, shouting has been introduced, which allows even criminals to conceal their past offenses. Even P2 [outlawed Masonic lodge] members are shouting.
