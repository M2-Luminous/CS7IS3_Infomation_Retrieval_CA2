FR940504-0-00061 FR940504-0-00015 Comments and Responses Two written comments on the Amendment were submitted representing three individuals and two organizations, the Environmental Defense Fund and the Northwest Forest Resource Council. Comment: The spawning escapement goal proposed in the Amendment and the proposed rule does not adequately reflect documented declines in fish size, fecundity, survival rates, ocean production, and rainfall since 1979. The spawning escapement goal of 200,000 adults is most likely inadequate. Response: The OCN coho stock has been the subject of ongoing review under the Council management process, which requires using the best scientific information and methodology available. There are several reasons for the consistent and significant depression in the OCN coho stock, but determination of a primary cause is not currently possible given the inadequacies in the information available on the stock and its habitat. Additional studies may provide a better definition of the total OCN coho spawning population. The ODFW is currently in the fourth year of a 5-year study of the methodology used in estimating OCN coho escapements. The results of that study, coupled with any additional biological data, will be used to develop a biologically sounder OCN coho escapement goal. Implementation of the Amendment does not hinder further investigations on the appropriateness of the numerical goal of 200,000 adults. The proposed rule anticipated revision to the spawning escapement goal, including the 200,000 number, by describing the processes by which the goal would be revised. If the estimated total number of spawners at the MSY level that is calculated by extrapolating from the 42 adults per mile in the standard index survey areas is revised, further changes to the FMP or its implementing regulations would not be necessary. If the number (42) of adult spawners per mile in the standard index survey areas is revised, the FMP would need to be amended. The framework in 50 CFR part 661, Appendix IV.B. provides for the modification of escapement goals based on technical evidence. Comment: Individual escapement goals should be set for the northern, central, and southern regional aggregates of OCN coho stocks. Response: The Salmon Technical Team has expressed its concern that the unequal distribution of spawners along the Oregon coast may be an important factor in recent OCN stock status declines. The Council recognizes the problem, but there are insufficient data at this time to implement separate escapement goals by subdividing the OCN stock aggregate. This matter will be subject to further analysis. Comment: The escapement goal should be increased by 10 percent to hedge against impacts of harvest on genetic diversity and ecosystem integrity. Response: The 200,000-fish MSY escapement goal has not been met for a number of years, and does not appear to be attainable in 1994. Because the goal represents an optimal production level and not a conservation threshold, it provides for substantial genetic diversity. Although there does not appear to be a statistical basis for any particular level of additional conservatism, NMFS agrees that, when stock sizes are such that the number of spawners is forecast to be below 28 per mile when directed fisheries are not allowed, substantial conservatism should be used when allowing incidental impacts for other fisheries. Comment: Allowable incidental take should be reduced to a maximum of 10 percent to prosecute other fisheries, and should only be allowed when abundance is between 225,000 and 150,000 fish. No incidental take should be allowed that would result in escapement below the escapement floor (28 spawners per mile) until scientific information establishes that incidental take that violates the floor would not result in irreparable harm. Response: The maximum incidental exploitation rate of 20 percent provides flexibility during the annual preseason management process for structuring fishing seasons to access salmon stocks with allowable harvest levels. Flexibility is also needed to account for harvest impacts by fisheries outside the Council's purview (e.g., freshwater fisheries and Canadian fisheries). NMFS will rely on the annual management process to determine the appropriate level of allowable incidental take. As with any management measure recommended by the Council, NMFS will consider comments by the Council, its advisers, and the public before implementing an incidental harvest rate. The Regional Director will provide guidance to the Council on an appropriate rate after consideration of the available information as supported by the administrative record. The Council demonstrated its ability to exercise harvest restraint on OCN coho, as in 1991, 1992, and 1993, when it recommended emergency regulations to reduce the ocean harvest rate on OCN coho from the levels set in Amendment 7 to the FMP. For the 1994 season, the Council recommended management measures with an incidental harvest rate of 11 percent. The standard of the minimum incidental harvest and no irreparable harm replaces other allocative measures in the plan regarding OCN coho at spawner escapement levels at or below 28 spawners per mile. Comment: A reduction in the body size of salmon could cause a significant reduction in fish productivity and subsequent declines in stock abundance. The direct relationship between fecundity and fish size has been established in prior research. Yet the proposed spawning escapement goal has not taken this relationship into account.
