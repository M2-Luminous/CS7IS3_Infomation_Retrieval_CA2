FR940606-1-00047 FR940606-1-00008 State and local regulations for aerospace coatings use VOC content as the means of regulating coating emissions. Consequently, no directed effort has been made to control the organic HAP content of these coatings. Data on coating VOC content are readily available from both the coating manufacturers and the coating users, but no comprehensive data exist for coating organic HAP content. The data obtained from the section 114 responses showed that the organic HAP content varies widely and randomly with the VOC content. This is not surprising since, as noted above, there have been efforts to limit only the VOC content in the coatings and not the organic HAP content. However, the data show that the organic HAP content is typically 50 percent less than the VOC content. Where the organic HAP content was higher than the VOC content, the EPA found that this was the result of the use of exempt solvents (those solvents determined by the EPA to have negligible photochemical reactivity) that are also organic HAP. There are a number of chemicals commonly found in coatings that are not on the list of 189 HAP (section 112(b) of the Act) including methyl amylketone (2-heptanone), cyclohexanone, and isopropyl alcohol. Currently, the EPA does not have adequate health data to determine the relative toxicity of these organic HAP substitutes and, therefore, does not want to establish a requirement that would encourage their use as substitutes in coatings. Since these potential substitutes are also VOC, the proposed standards would limit both organic HAP and VOC content, rather than organic HAP only. The effect of this dual limit will be to reduce the total amount of organic emissions from coating operations, eliminate the use of the few very high organic HAP content primers and topcoats, and establish a cap on the organic HAP content of primers and topcoats that will be developed in the future. The organic HAP and VOC limits were determined by ranking the facilities that reported usage of primers or topcoats from the lowest to the highest weighted average VOC content of all primers or topcoats used at the facility. The weighted average VOC content that represented the average of the best 12 percent was selected as the VOC limit. This value was 350 g/l (2.9 lb/gal) for primers and 420 g/l (3.5 lb/gal) for topcoats. As discussed earlier, the limited data available to the EPA indicate that organic HAP content is typically lower than VOC content. However, no reasonable limit could be identified. Therefore, the EPA is proposing an organic HAP content limit at the same level as for VOC. The proposed limits for organic HAP are, therefore, 350 g/l (2.9 lb/gal) for primers and 420 g/l (3.5 lb/gal) for topcoats. The section 114 questionnaire responses showed that the inorganic HAP emissions from nearly all primer and topcoat application operations were controlled by dry particulate filters or waterwash spray booths. Since no other technology was identified that can be used to control inorganic HAP emissions, the use of filters and waterwash was adopted as the MACT floor. 3. Depainting Operation The information obtained on depainting operations showed the pervasive use of organic HAP-containing chemical strippers to remove paint. However, information was also obtained showing that many aerospace depainting operations are using alternative methods that do not utilize organic HAP, including organic HAP-free chemical strippers and dry media blasting techniques. The information also showed that not all commercial aerospace vehicles are fully coated. In these instances, the amount of organic HAP emissions from depainting is less than it would be if the same vehicle were fully coated.
