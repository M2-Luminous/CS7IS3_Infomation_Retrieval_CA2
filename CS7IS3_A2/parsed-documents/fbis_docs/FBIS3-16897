Under the accord, the parties will conduct a joint examination of the main units of the plant and put them into operation, after taking additional measures to ensure its safe functioning. They will also train operational and technical maintenance personnel for the plant. Russia will deliver nuclear fuel to the station, help the plant operators and assist in setting up Armenian bodies of control over nuclear materials and the nuclear power engineering network. For its part, Armenia will introduce the rules and standards now in use at the Russian nuclear power plants and take steps to secure physical safety of the plant. Under the agreement, Armenia pledges not to use the nuclear and non-nuclear materials received from Russia, as well as the nuclear and non-nuclear materials, installations and equipment created on their basis for producing nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosives or for attaining any military objectives. Specialists and their families will be granted the right of free travel to Armenia. Tax and duty exemption will be granted for required goods brought into Armenia for the purpose of restarting the moth-balled nuclear power plant. Armenian Prime-Minister Grant Bagratyan believes that the accord signed between the two countries marks a great step towards meeting Armenia's energy needs, which have been accumulating since the power station was moth-balled in the wake of the 1988 disastrous earthquake.
