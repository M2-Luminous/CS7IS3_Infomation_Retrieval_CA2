FR940412-2-00168 FR940412-2-00120 Application of ATX, Inc. for Authority to Operate as an Airline AGENCY: Department of Transportation. ACTION: Notice of opinion and final order. SUMMARY: The Department of Transportation, by Order 94&hyph;4&hyph;8 in Docket 48780, has rejected the application of ATX, Inc. to operate as an air carrier, citing the strong influence that Frank Lorenzo, the former chairman of the Texas Air Corp., would have on the company. In the final decision, the Department found that the record fails to demonstrate that Lorenzo has a sufficient commitment to safety or to comply with legal requirements. Both Eastern Air Lines and Continental Airlines, while they were owned by Texas Air Corp. and controlled by Lorenzo, experienced operational, maintenance, and labor-related problems that were among the most serious in the history of U.S. aviation. These problems threatened safety to the point that the Federal government had to intervene to ensure the public's protection. While ATX has adequate financing and meets the citizenship requirements, managerial competence and compliance disposition are lacking and thus ATX fails to meet the department's airline fitness standards. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John V. Coleman, Director, Office of Aviation Analysis, Department of Transportation, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590, (202) 366&hyph;1030. Dated: April 5, 1994. Patrick V. Murphy, Acting Assistant Secretary for Aviation and International Affairs. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;8624 Filed 4&hyph;11&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;62&hyph;M
